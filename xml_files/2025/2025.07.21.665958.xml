To explore the cellular and spatial organization of sensation, we used MERFISH to profile receptor expression across 2.1 million cells in multiple regions of the murine gut under specific-pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) conditions. This atlas revealed expected and novel cell types—including a candidate murine homolog of human BEST4<sup>+</sup> enterocytes—demonstrated cell-type regional specialization, discovered extensive location-dependent spatial fine-tuning in mucosal cell expression, and suggested cell-type specific mediators of the effects of microbiota-derived small molecules. In addition, this atlas revealed that, aside from immune cell abundance, many aspects of the murine gut are host-intrinsic and modified only modestly in the absence of a microbiota. Collectively, this atlas provides a valuable resource for understanding the cellular and spatial organization underlying small molecule sensation in the gut.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Gastrointestinal tract</kwd><kwd>single-cell transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>spatial transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>MERFISH</kwd><kwd>gut microbiota</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a complex role as one of the largest organs in the body. In addition to facilitating digestion, nutrient absorption, and immune response, it is home to a complex microbial community that contributes to a diverse small molecule environment through its metabolic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. A wide array of cell types, spanning multiple cell classes including epithelial, immune, fibroblast, endothelial, smooth muscle cells, as well as cells of the enteric nervous system, are responsible for executing these functions, and their behavior and interactions are shaped by the intricate spatial structure of the gut, including not just regional variations between the small and large intestine but local variations within the varied anatomical structures of the gut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Of its many functions, one central role of the gut is to sense and detect these diverse small molecules as well as other microbial- and host-derived signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. These functions are mediated, in part, through the expression of a vast array of small molecule and signal receptors, including G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), nuclear receptors, ligand-gated ion channels, pattern recognition receptors, complement receptors, enzyme-linked receptors, and cytokine receptors. The differential cell-type expression of these receptors, in turn, shapes how the gut responds to these molecular cues. Therefore, an understanding of gut sensation will require a mapping of the cell type of expression of these receptors.</p><p id="P5">To this end, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of small molecule sensation in the gut by enabling detailed cataloging of both the cell type diversity and their gene expression profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. These efforts have led to important findings, including the identification of previously unrecognized epithelial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, immune<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, fibroblast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and enteric nervous system cell subsets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and the discovery of region-specific transcriptional differences between the small and large intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, several limitations have hindered a comprehensive understanding of sensory capabilities in the gastrointestinal tract. Receptor expression and cell type composition vary across gut regions, yet many existing atlases focus on single regions, leaving regional specialization—i.e. small or large intestine-specific gene expression within cell types—incompletely characterized. Additionally, limited cell numbers have reduced the resolution of rare but potentially important cell types and subtypes. These gaps highlight the need for a large-scale, pan-regional, single-cell atlas to comprehensively map gut cell diversity, sensory capabilities, and regional specialization.</p><p id="P6">Beyond regional specialization, multiple gut cell populations are known to fine-tune their gene expression over micron-scale lengths within the gut mucosa. For example, single-cell RNA sequencing in combination with laser-capture microdissection or targeted single-RNA-molecule imaging has revealed spatial gradients in gene expression within epithelial populations and mucosal fibroblasts along the axis stretching from the top to the bottom of the mucosa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. These gradients give rise to functional fine tuning over the micron-scale, and, in the case of morphogen expression can have important consequences in cell development and fate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Yet aside from the direct measurement of a handful of genes, the transcriptome wide adaptation of gene expression within cells of the mucosa remains only inferred not directly measured, limiting our understanding of the degree of niche-dependent functional fine tuning of cells within the gut.</p><p id="P7">In addition to mediating rapid responses to local environmental cues, gut sensing also regulates gene expression, cellular recruitment, and decisions regarding cell fate and development. Over longer timescales, these sensing mechanisms have the potential to reshape the structural and functional features of the gut. A key driver of such remodeling is the gut microbiome, which influences the host by regulating immune cell development, nutrient absorption and metabolism, central nervous system functions, and susceptibility to disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. As the largest, most complex, and metabolically active commensal community in the host, the gut microbiome produces a diverse array of small molecules, such as short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, as well as secondary bile acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Therefore, host sensing of the activity of the microbiota is one of the ways in which the microbiome may shape gut physiology. For example, lacking the diverse molecular cues provided by the microbiota, germ-free mice have an altered mucosal barrier, metabolism, and altered abundance of gut cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, the remodeling of the gut by the microbiota has not been systematically characterized across all cell types and compartments; thus, the role that the microbiome and its metabolites play in shaping structural and transcriptomic features of the gut remains unclear.</p><p id="P8">Image-based transcriptomic methods, with the ability to characterize the expression of large fractions of the transcriptome within single cells within intact tissues, promise the ability to define the sensory gene expression of cell types, place these cell types in their region of origin, and identify subtle spatial variations in expression and, thus, offer a new avenue to address these questions. Indeed, studies leveraging a variety of image-based methods—MERFISH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, CosMx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, or Xenium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>—have already provided insights into the molecular, cellular, and spatial structure of individual gut regions in health and inflammatory disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Here we apply MERFISH to provide new insights into the cellular and spatial organization of sensation in the murine gut by profiling the expression of a near comprehensive set of murine receptors in 2.1 million cells from 105 cross-sectional slices taken from four regions of the gut, covering both the small and large intestine, in both specific-pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) conditions. The resulting atlas provides a rich resource for understanding the cellular compartmentalization of small molecule sensation in the gut, the spatial specialization of these capabilities both across gut regions and within the length of the mucosa, and the modulation of the molecular, cellular, and spatial structure of the gut by the microbiota.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Construction of a cellular atlas across the lower mouse GI tract with MERFISH</title><p id="P9">To define the diversity of cells in the GI tract, their sensory capabilities, regional specialization, potential spatial fine-tuning, and the role of the microbiome on the molecular and cellular structure of the gut, we created a MERFISH library targeting 1,922 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). The first library portion focused on cellular identity and included ~200 markers of cell types. The second portion focused on the sensory capabilities of these cells and comprised essentially all major classes of annotated receptors in the mouse genome—such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs), enzyme-linked receptors (ELRs), nuclear receptors (NRs), pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), complement receptors, and cytokine receptors—as well as their host-derived ligands, including cytokines and ligands from pathways such as Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, Bmp, and Hippo. Collectively, these genes were targeted with 2,070 39-bit combinatorial barcodes. Additionally, we measured 12 highly expressed cell markers with non-combinatorial barcodes (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We used MERFISH with this panel to construct an atlas of four regions of the mouse lower gut—ileum, cecum, and proximal and distal colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). These regions were selected because they span both the large and small intestine and have the highest microbial density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Tissue was harvested from male C57BL/6NTac mice aged 8-12 weeks harboring either a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) microbiota or no microbiota (germ-free [GF]), using a fresh-frozen protocol optimized for RNA stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). In total, gene expression was measured in 105 cross-sectional slices taken from at least 3 mice per region and condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). As receptor mRNAs can be lowly expressed even when functionally relevant, we developed a method to decrease false positive levels by defining a quality score for each identified RNA molecule, lowering our detection expression limit to ~1 count per 500 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1A-S1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). Supporting the accuracy of our identified RNAs, markers were identified in the expected spatial locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), average expression per slice correlated strongly with bulk RNA-sequencing from the same regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>), and MERFISH measurements from different mice correlated strongly within each region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1D-S1E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To segment cells within these measurements, we included with each MERFISH measurement immunofluorescence images of a pan-cell surface marker, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, and used Cellpose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> to define the 3D boundaries of cells based on these images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). To refine these boundaries and to identify cells that could not be captured with Cellpose, we used the distribution of the RNAs themselves with Baysor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). As minor cell segmentation errors could confound our profiling of lowly expressed genes, we developed a segmentation optimization pipeline that uses doublet-detection tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> to provide a measure of the segmentation quality. We used this pipeline to guide segmentation and parameter choices that produced a noticeable improvement in segmentation quality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1F-S1K</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). Putative cells generated by this pipeline were then filtered through a combination of volume, RNA copy number, and residual doublet score (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>) to remove small cell fragments and segmentation errors, producing 2,060,051 cells collectively containing 280 million RNAs.</p><p id="P12">To manage the effects of gene expression differences due to regional specialization and microbiota dependence, we used Harmony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> to jointly embed and label the cells within this atlas (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). A first tier of clustering revealed all anticipated cell classes, which then divided into 78 distinct cell populations with additional tiers of clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B-1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). These clusters showed a high degree of marker purity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1L</xref>); co-integrated both across regions and microbiome states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1M and S1N</xref>); co-integrated with published scRNA-seq measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1O-S1X</xref>); were found in the expected locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A-S2B</xref>); and expressed the expected markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C-S2K</xref>), supporting our segmentation, clustering, and cell-type labeling.</p><p id="P13">To then define the spatial structure of the gut, we statistically identified anatomical features through recurrent patterns in the composition of the local neighborhood of cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). This analysis identified all major gut anatomical structures, including the mucosa, the submucosa, the muscularis propria, the myenteric plexus, and patches of gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1G and 1H</xref>). We then refined this analysis to capture the known zonation of the mucosa by classifying top, middle, and bottom mucosal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). This tissue neighborhood mapping allowed us to determine the fraction of each cell type within each anatomical feature across all four regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1J and 1K</xref>). Importantly, this analysis revealed cell types in the expected regional and anatomical locations, further supporting our analysis.</p><p id="P14">In summary, MERFISH identified 78 distinct cell populations, characterized their abundances across the four regions of the lower GI tract, and mapped their spatial organization within gut anatomical features, both in the presence and absence of the microbiome.

As we anticipate that this atlas will be a rich resource for the community, we developed a web-based viewer to facilitate access and exploration (Resource Availability).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cellular identity and spatial organization are largely conserved across gut regions</title><p id="P15">The cellular composition of the mammalian gut differs between the small and large intestine and varies along the longitudinal axis within each region. Moreover, cell types can display region-specific expression profiles reflecting specialization to the unique local molecular environment. While there exist several pan-region murine single-cell atlases focused on specific intestinal cell populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, the extent to which cell identity and spatial organization are conserved across region remains unclear. To address this question, we first examined the cell type diversity in our integrated large-and-small-intestine atlas in SPF mice.</p><p id="P16">Despite strong regional specialization in epithelial cell function, our atlas defined a diverse set of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) with most cell types seen in all four profiled GI regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>). We identified the expected maturation of absorptive enterocytes, starting with stem and transit amplifying (TA) cells, and proceeding through increasing maturation from the bottom to the top of the mucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D, 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B and S2C</xref>). The joint integration of enterocyte development suggests that, despite the differences in enterocyte function and lamina propria (LP) organization between the small and large intestine, there is a strong, regionally conserved maturation program among enterocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1M</xref>).</p><p id="P17">We observed a similar conservation in secretory epithelial cells, with the identification of two divisions of goblet cells (bottom and top), tuft cells, and Paneth cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D, 1E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C</xref>). We also observed a rich diversity of enteroendocrine cells (EEC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2D, and S2E</xref>), with an early progenitor population, and two late progenitor states committed either to enterochromaffin (EC) or delta, L, or N cell development, respectively. Finally, we also observed microfold (M) cells—specialized epithelial cells that line gut associated lymphoid tissues (GALT)—in all four regions with the expected GALT association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1J, 1K</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We identified four families of fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D, 1E, 1J, 1K</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2F</xref>). As there is still some debate regarding fibroblast naming, we adopted telocyte and FB1, FB2, and FB3, as names for these families. As expected, telocytes were identified lining the epithelial layer in the lamina propria (LP) and were marked by <italic>Pdgfra, Bmp5</italic>, and <italic>Wnt5a</italic>.

In addition to these core fibroblast families, we also identified a series of other stroma-like cells that we grouped with fibroblasts, including pericytes, fibroblast reticular cells (FRC), and the mesothelium found, as expected, in the LP, GALT, and a single-layer surrounding the muscularis propria, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D, 1E, 1J, 1K</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2F</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Similarly, we identified a striking immune diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D, 1E, 1J, 1K</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2G</xref>). Among lymphoid cells, we observed plasma, follicular, and cycling B cells.

Importantly, beyond the expression of the epithelial sodium channel, these enterocytes display transcriptional signatures indicative of unique functions. For example, high <italic>Nt5e</italic> expression suggests a role in extracellular AMP metabolism; <italic>Ptger3</italic> indicates a sensitivity to prostaglandin signaling; and the expression of <italic>Bmp3</italic>—rather than <italic>Bmp8a</italic>, which is expressed in other mature enterocytes—suggests a unique role in morphogen signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C</xref>).</p><p id="P25">To provide further support for this population, we examined prior murine gut single-cell studies and found evidence for a subpopulation of mature enterocytes that co-express all subunits of the epithelial sodium channel as well as <italic>Nt5e</italic> and high levels of <italic>Bmp3</italic> in a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A</xref>).

Notably, the human BEST4+ enterocyte was the only population to express appreciable levels of all three subunits of the epithelial sodium channel and was also the major source of NT5E and BMP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Moreover, these populations shared striking spatial similarities: BEST4+ enterocytes are located at the top of the mucosa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> and are primarily found in the distal colon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, mirroring the distribution of <italic>Scnn1g</italic>+ enterocytes in mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1J, 1K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Although BEST4+ enterocytes have been observed in a variety of organisms, including macaque, pig, rabbits, and zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, it has been suggested that mice lack a homolog due to an in-frame stop codon that renders <italic>Best4</italic> a pseudogene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. However, we hypothesized that if the <italic>Scnn1g</italic>+ enterocyte is a homolog of the BEST4+ enterocyte, residual regulatory mechanisms might still drive <italic>Best4-ps</italic> expression. Indeed, bulk RNA sequencing detected <italic>Best4-ps</italic> expression in the mouse distal colon at a level consistent with our MERFISH data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D</xref>), and, importantly, the <italic>Scnn1g</italic>+ enterocyte was the only population to express <italic>Best4-ps</italic>, albeit at low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A and 2C</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that the <italic>Scnn1g</italic>+ enterocyte may represent the mouse homolog of the human BEST4+ enterocyte.

Therefore, we next used our atlas to provide a cellular-scale map of the organization of the intestinal mucosa.</p><p id="P29">One challenge to defining this organization is the imperfect and variable orientation of crypts and villi that arises as a natural result of sectioning. To address this challenge, we were inspired by the strong gene expression variation that occurs within epithelial populations as they mature from the crypt to the top of the mucosa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, which we reasoned could serve as a natural mucosal ruler, defining mucosal location via gene expression instead of absolute position. Indeed, multiple epithelial genes showed clear zonation in expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), and we observed a clear continuous gradient in gene expression in epithelial cells from stem to mature enterocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). To quantify the transcriptomic variation in enterocytes along this developmental axis, we performed pseudotime analysis on the co-integrated stem, TA cells, and enterocytes from all profiled regions and found excellent agreement between this pseudotime and both the continuous axis of transcriptomic variation captured in our epithelial UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B-3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>) and the spatial location of enterocytes within all four regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3F and 3G</xref>). Importantly, this clear agreement underscores the remarkable fidelity between epithelial maturation and mucosal position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p id="P30">To then use this gene expression ruler to define spatial positions within the mucosa, we developed a mucosal pseudospace axis by propagating the pseudotime value from the nearest enterocytes to all other mucosal cells (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). We then calibrated this mucosal pseudospace axis to actual mucosal position by calculating a cumulative distribution of epithelial cell numbers along this axis and estimating the average thickness of the mucosa for each region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). All regions showed a very similar progression of the pseudospace axis along the length of the mucosa; however, anatomical differences between the large and small intestine were clear. For example, pseudospace grew linearly with mucosal position in the ileum until roughly 80 μm, after which the pseudospace value increased quickly over a short mucosal length, before growing very slowly over a large stretch of the mucosa that corresponds to the mature villus region. This transition at 80 μm reflects the established transition between crypt and villus and underscores the rapidity of transcriptomic remodeling at this transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3G, 3H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Using this pseudospace axis, we computed the spatial distribution of all mucosal cells, revealing a rich, cell-type specific organization in all four regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3I, 3J</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B-S4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Supporting this analysis, we observed the expected zonation of stem/TA, bottom, mid, and top enterocytes as well as other cell type divisions already named based on spatial location, e.g. bottom and top goblet, EC, FB1, and telocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B-S4D</xref>).

In the ileum, most immune populations were seen enriched at the mid-to-top villus. However, there were notable exceptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>). Monocytes were found predominantly within the crypts, possibly reflecting their recent recruitment from blood vessels in the submucosa; macrophages were arrayed from bottom to top reflecting the <italic>Mrc1</italic>+ to <italic>Itgax</italic>+ functional maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>; and cDC2, while predominantly in the villus, contained a small population in the crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3I and 3J</xref>).

To determine whether other mucosal populations also adjust their gene expression based on position, we projected pseudospace values onto both our MERFISH gene expression UMAPs and, as a control, published scRNA-seq UMAPs, using our co-embedding to impute pseudospace values for scRNA-seq cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C, 4D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A-S5F</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). These projections revealed that location-dependent fine-tuning of gene expression is a common feature across most mucosal cell types, with clear co-variation between UMAP features and pseudospace in goblet cells, EECs, telocytes, FB1 fibroblasts, pericytes, and capillary endothelial cells. Furthermore, these results suggest that the location-based clusters we identified, e.g. bottom, mid, and top telocytes, represent discrete approximations of a continuous gene expression gradient. For the purposes of this analysis, we therefore regrouped all such divisions.</p><p id="P35">To quantitatively compare how different cell populations fine-tune their gene expression based on location, we next calculated the mutual information (MI) between pseudospace and gene expression within each population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5G-S5I</xref>). We chose MI over other methods as it does not assume a specific form of relationship with position, and we used the recently introduced latent mutual information (LMI) to address the computational challenges of calculating MI for thousands of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). Epithelial cells showed the greatest LMI of any cell class across all four regions, with enterocytes, as expected, showing the largest LMI among all populations. Among other epithelial cells, goblet cells showed substantial location-dependent variation, as did Tuft cells and ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5G-S5I</xref>). Importantly, this analysis revealed extensive stromal remodeling based on location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5G-S5I</xref>). Telocytes exhibited the greatest LMI, followed closely by FB1, with vascular cells (pericytes and capillary endothelial cells) also showing appreciable location-dependent variation. In contrast, LP SMCs had consistently low LMI across regions. Finally, immune populations generally had modest LMI values, indicating limited spatial fine-tuning of expression among the genes we profiled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5G-S5I</xref>). While memory T cells in the ileum showed one of the highest LMIs among immune cells, consistent with recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, the values were still lower than most epithelial or stromal populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p id="P36">To identify genes driving this spatial patterning, we next calculated normalized mutual information (NMI) between gene expression and pseudospace (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). Supporting this analysis, we noted that the relative range of NMI values reflected the LMI hierarchies, and top NMI genes aligned with known biology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4F-4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5J-S5N</xref>). For example, <italic>Mki67</italic>—a marker of dividing cells—scored highly in dividing epithelial cells (enterocytes, goblet cells, and EECs) but not stromal or immune cells.

Broadly, high NMI genes suggested functional fine-tuning with spatial location along the mucosa, such as ECM modulation by telocytes (<italic>Fn1</italic> and <italic>Col1a1</italic>) and differential MHCII expression and PAMP detection by macrophages (<italic>H2-Eb1</italic> and <italic>Tlr12</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4G and 4H</xref>).</p><p id="P37">We next explored spatial gene expression patterning along the mucosa and its conservation across regions, focusing on four high-LMI populations: enterocytes, telocytes, FB1s, and macrophages. All showed a diversity of spatial patterns among hundreds of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4I-4K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5O-S5P</xref>), indicating wide-spread spatial fine-tuning of expression. Hierarchical clustering revealed five major expression patterns: constant (cluster 0), off-on or on-off (clusters 2 or 4), or modest decreases or increases along the mucosal axis (clusters 1 and 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5Q</xref>). A few genes, mainly among enterocytes, peaked at intermediate pseudospace values (e.g. <italic>Nr1h4</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, genes with this spatial expression pattern were too rare to form a separate cluster.</p><p id="P38">To explore regional conservation, we quantified how often genes switched spatial expression clusters across regions, considering genes that are sufficiently expressed in at least two regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4M</xref>). Cluster switching was rare and mostly occurred between similar patterns (e.g., cluster 1 to cluster 2 or cluster 0 to cluster 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4L and 4M</xref>), indicating that spatial gene expression is largely conserved within each cell population across gut regions. A cluster-free analysis using the Jensen-Shannon (J-S) divergence as a measure of distance between spatial patterns further supported this conclusion (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). While gene pairs within a cell type showed diverse spatial patterns, the same gene across regions had consistently lower J-S distances, reinforcing regional conservation of spatial expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4N</xref>).

While these genes were not enriched for specific receptor categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4P</xref>), some, like key morphogens and their receptors such as <italic>Bmp3</italic> and <italic>Fzd7</italic> in enterocytes, may play key roles in shaping regional variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4Q and 4R</xref>).</p><p id="P39">We next explored how spatial fine-tuning of gene expression impacts mucosal organization and interactions, focusing on receptor-ligand interactions along the pseudospace axis.

Beyond interactions between mucosal zones, we reasoned that the pseudospace axis could help generate spatially prioritized hypotheses from receptor–ligand interactions. To investigate the role of chemokine gradients in organizing motile immune cells along the mucosa, we examined spatial chemokine expression patterns and receptor profiles. For instance, all T cells express <italic>Cxcr3</italic>, whose ligand <italic>Cxcl16</italic> peaks at the tip of the ileal villus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4T and 4U</xref>), consistent with the enrichment of T cells in that location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Cd4</italic>+ T cells, including Tregs, localize to slightly lower mucosal pseudospace values than <italic>Cd8</italic>+ T cells, perhaps due to the expression of <italic>Ccr4</italic> by <italic>Cd4</italic>+ T cells, but not <italic>Cd8</italic>+ T cells. The ligand of <italic>Ccr4, Ccl22</italic>, peaks lower in the villus, possibly driving the lower mucosal localization of <italic>Cd4</italic>+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4T, and 4U</xref>).</p><p id="P40">Inspired by this observation, we reasoned that the spatial similarity between chemokine expression and the distribution of receptor-expressing cells could serve as a quantitative metric to prioritize receptor-ligand interactions influencing cellular organization.

These genes fell into two categories. The first included <italic>Dhx58, Ddx58</italic>, and <italic>Ifih1</italic>, all of which are interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). In the ileum, we observed co-expression of these genes within individual villi, with expression patches often spatially isolated and confined to one or two adjacent villi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). In the cecum, proximal colon, and distal colon, co-expression was instead seen within small groups of adjacent crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B-5D</xref>). Previous studies have shown that certain ISGs, such as <italic>Ifit1</italic> and <italic>Isg15</italic>, are expressed in epithelial cells within individual villi in the mouse small intestine in an interferon-lambda-dependent and microbiota-dependent manner and suggest that such ISG patches modulate susceptibility to enteric viral infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Our observations now suggest that such patchy expression extends to these additional genes and also exists in the large intestine.</p><p id="P42">The second category of genes was also found in epithelial cells and included chemokine <italic>Ccl20</italic>, inducible nitric oxide synthase <italic>Nos2</italic>, and calcitonin signaling gene <italic>Calcb</italic>. We observed rare but distinct patches of these genes in the proximal and distal colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5E and 5F</xref>). Unlike the ISG patches, which lacked structural correlates, these genes were consistently expressed in non-M-cell, follicle-associated enterocytes located on the surface of small GALT patches (as marked by <italic>Cd19</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5E and 5F</xref>). Therefore, these cells likely represent a distinct enterocyte state induced in the presence of GALT, which escaped detection via standard clustering because of their rarity. Importantly, <italic>Ccl20</italic> has been implicated in recruiting <italic>Ccr6</italic>+ B cells during early GALT formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>, suggesting a potential role for this rare follicle-associated epithelial state.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Regional variation in gene expression may shape sensory capabilities and microbial metabolite response</title><p id="P43">We next explored the spatial, regional, and cell-type variation in genes associated with small molecule sensing. While our initial Harmony-based embedding enabled joint cell-type labeling across regions and microbiome states, it purposefully obscured regional expression differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Removing batch correction revealed a hierarchy of regional specialization across major cell classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A and 6B;</xref> <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). As expected, epithelial cells showed the greatest regional variation, with pronounced differences across most regions except cecum and proximal colon, which maintained a degree of partial co-embedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6A and 6B</xref>).</p><p id="P44">To quantify these variations, we identified genes differentially expressed within a given cell type in one region compared to the same cell type across all other regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). This analysis revealed that across all major cell classes, epithelial cells showed the most extensive regional specialization, with over 50% of expressed receptors showing differential expression in at least one region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). This degree of specialization is unsurprising given the substantial variation in the small molecule environment across regions and is consistent with prior scRNA-seq findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, our work extends this previous understanding by revealing a surprising degree of specialization across many other cell populations. Immune cells, fibroblasts, cells of the ENS, and, to a lesser degree, ICCs, also exhibited differential regional expression within large fractions of their expressed receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). In contrast, endothelial cells and SMCs had both more modest levels of sensory gene expression and regional specialization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p id="P45">To explore whether this regional specialization aligns with the shifting small molecule landscape or microbial load along the GI axis, we examined the average expression levels of specific subsets of GCPRs responsive to common gut small molecules (lipids, peptides, amines, nucleosides) as well as receptors responsive to microbial cues (toll-like receptors; TLRs). Remarkably, despite substantial variations in the nutrient content along the GI tract, we observed no clear correspondence between small molecule distribution and sensory gene expression in epithelial cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, or the ENS though we noted a substantial increase in TLR expression in the large intestine compared to the small intestine, mirroring regional differences in microbial density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6A</xref>). Moreover, while these classes of molecules are distributed differently across the different anatomical features of the gut, with the epithelial layer encountering the greatest diversity of small molecules, remarkably, we observed no clear spatial compartmental enrichment in the expression of different classes of GPCRs and PRRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that the varying small molecule landscape within the gut is not reflected in similar broad spatial compartmentalization of the corresponding receptor genes.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Differential receptor expression shapes the potential cell-type-specific response to microbial metabolites</title><p id="P46">The gut harbors a rich array of microbiota metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids, amines, and indole derivatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, which act on diverse receptors such as GPCRs or nuclear receptors (NRs) to regulate host digestion, metabolism, immune system, and neural functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. While the systemic effects of these metabolites are well-documented, the specific cell populations that respond to these small molecules are less well understood. To this end, we set our gut atlas in the context of the diverse array of microbiome-derived small molecules by constructing a custom microbiota metabolite—receptor database (MMRDB; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). We constructed the MMRDB by combining GPCR—ligand (GLASS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>) and NR— ligand (NRLiSt BDB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>) databases with multiple microbiota-metabolite databases (MiMeDB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>, gutMGene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>), which we then supplemented with additional interactions curated from gutMGene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P47">We next integrated the MMRDB with our gut receptor atlas using the drug2cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup> pipeline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). This integration revealed spatially distinct enrichment patterns, suggesting that microbial metabolite sensing is functionally compartmentalized, with specific metabolite classes preferentially detected in distinct gut niches. For instance, receptors for bile acid derivatives and SCFAs were consistently enriched in the mucosa, with SCFA receptors especially abundant in the colonic mucosa but also present in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses. In contrast, receptors for alkylamines and indoles were more broadly distributed. While such patterns were mostly regionally conserved, there were some exceptions. Notably, indole receptors were more highly expressed and shifted toward the lower mucosa in the distal colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p id="P48">In terms of cell type specialization, receptors for microbiota metabolites were represented in all gut cell classes, with epithelial, ENS, interstitial, and immune cells, in particular, serving as major sensory hubs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6B</xref>). Interactions with microbiota metabolites were largely conserved across regions but highly cell-type-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6C, and S6D</xref>). For example, <italic>Mrc1</italic>+ macrophages selectively sensed alkyl polyamines like putrescine and spermidine, but this interaction was lost as they migrated to the top of the mucosa and differentiated into <italic>Itgax</italic>+ macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>), echoing recent findings that microbiota-derived polyamines regulate macrophage differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. Succinic acid, a common microbial metabolite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>, was sensed by tuft cells, L and N enteroendocrine cells, and their <italic>Arx</italic>+ progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). In particular, the sensing of succinate by tuft cells is consistent with prior findings that succinate-mediated activation of <italic>Sucnr1</italic> in tuft cells triggers ILC2-driven immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. Since microbiota-derived succinate also improves glucose homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>, its detection by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1)–secreting L cells via <italic>Sucnr1</italic> suggests a potential metabolic mechanism, as GLP1 is an incretin that promotes insulin production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. Additionally, we uncovered underexplored interactions, such as deoxycholic acid signaling in colonic submucosal ICCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>), implicating a potential microbiome role in regulating pacemaker cell function. Overall, our atlas highlights specific cell types as mediators of gut–microbiota metabolite interactions and offers a rich hypothesis-generating resource for future mechanistic studies.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>The absence of the microbiome selectively remodels the gut on a structural, cellular and transcriptomic level</title><p id="P49">GF mice exhibit well-documented physiological differences from mice harboring a native microbiota—including reduced mucosal thickness, Paneth cell depletion, immune underdevelopment, metabolic alterations, and increased susceptibility to colitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. However, a comprehensive, cell-type- and tissue-wide characterization of the differences in the GF remains lacking. Thus, to investigate the role of the microbiota in shaping the molecular, cellular, and spatial structure of the gut, we next analyzed the portion of our atlas derived from germ-free (GF) mice.</p><p id="P50">We first examined gut morphology across all four regions and found that, although the absence of the microbiome made villi thinner, more slender, and structurally fragile—a well-documented effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>, its impact on neighborhood composition was relatively modest. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7A and 7B</xref>). As expected, our neighborhood analysis identified all major gut anatomical regions in GF mice, with region sizes—measured by the area associated with assigned cells—largely unchanged as compared to that observed in SPF mice. However, a few modest but statistically significant differences were observed: the mucosa was slightly reduced in the ileum and distal colon; the submucosa was reduced in the cecum and proximal colon; the muscularis propria was reduced in the cecum; and the myenteric plexus was also reduced in the cecum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). The cecum is known to have substantial structural changes in GF mice, where it is often several-fold larger than in mice harboring a microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>, consistent with our observation that, while subtle, many compartments of the cecum showed statistically significant differences from SPF controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p id="P51">We next examined the role of the microbiota in modulating gene expression within cell types. Indeed, without batch correction, gene expression differences were readily visible in the UMAP representation, highlighting that the microbiota influences expression within our targeted gene panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). We observed pronounced shifts in the expression of a small number of genes in a cell type- and location-specific fashion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. Notably, interferon-gamma stimulated genes such as MHC class II (<italic>H2-Eb1</italic>), its positive regulator <italic>Ciita</italic>, and nitric oxide synthase <italic>Nos2</italic> were strongly downregulated in the absence of the microbiome, while <italic>Gpr108</italic>, a negative regulator of TLR signaling, was upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7A, and S7B</xref>).</p><p id="P52">However, beyond these more prominent differences, the overall transcriptional response to the absence of the microbiome was relatively modest. Specifically, the number of differentially expressed genes between microbiota states was smaller within individual cell classes than the number observed between gut regions in SPF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S18">STAR Methods</xref>). Among cell classes, epithelial cells exhibited the most extensive microbiota-dependent remodeling, although immune cells and fibroblasts also showed notable differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). Interestingly, this microbiota-dependent remodeling varied by gut region, with ileum showing the greatest differences and the distal colon the least. Although the colon harbors higher microbiota densities than the ileum, the increased differences within the ileum may reflect a greater degree of microbe-host interactions due to the thinner mucus layer in the small intestine relative to that of the large intestine. In parallel, the absence of the microbiota had minimal impact on the spatial gene expression gradients. Major high-LMI populations—including enterocytes, goblet cells, FB1 fibroblasts, and telocytes—continued to display five distinct gradient types, with minimal switching of expression patterns between SPF and GF states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). Spatial gradients remained highly similar based on J-S distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7G</xref>), and very few genes exhibited substantial spatial differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7C</xref>). Notably, we observed ISG expression patches in all four gut regions in GF mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7D</xref>), suggesting that, in addition to microbiota-dependent cues previously associated with these patches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>, other non-microbial cues may also be involved. Together, these results indicate that the sensory capabilities of gut cells are largely host-intrinsic, and that changes in the abundance or metabolic activities of the microbiota are likely to induce only modest alterations in host cell function.</p><p id="P53">Despite modest changes in gene expression, we observed pronounced shifts in cell type composition in GF mice. Mucosal cell types, especially in the epithelial and immune compartments, were notably depleted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7E</xref>). In contrast, other cell classes—including fibroblasts, smooth muscle, the ICCs, and the enteric nervous system—showed no significant changes in cell abundance in the GF gut, suggesting their development is largely microbiota-independent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7E</xref>). Interestingly, remodeling of the mucosal immune compartment was both cell type-selective and regionally dependent. The ileal mucosa was most affected, with broad depletion of both adaptive and innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7F</xref>), while the large intestine showed a more modest and cell type-selective pattern of immune depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7F</xref>). For instance, in the distal colon, plasma cells, macrophages, and Tregs decreased in abundance, while other T cell subsets and ILCs remained unchanged. In contrast, cDC2 and NK cell abundance increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7H</xref>). These findings highlight the strong regional specificity of the immune response to the microbiota and the distinct remodeling that occurs in its absence.</p><p id="P54">In addition to the changes in the immune compartment, we found that the developmental process of the gut epithelium is also modulated by the microbiome. In both ileum and distal colon, the abundance of bottom epithelial cells, including Paneth in ileum and stem and bottom enterocytes and goblet cells in both regions, decreased in number per cross-section, whereas the abundance of top or mature epithelial cells, including top enterocytes and goblet cells, remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7H</xref>). This effect was present but less significant in cecum and proximal colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7H</xref>). The decrease in Paneth cell numbers confirmed previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, whereas our atlas revealed a systemic depletion across all bottom or immature epithelial cell populations. Indeed, we observed that the band of bottom epithelial cells visually contracted in depth in the ileum and distal colon in GF compared to SPF state, while the same trend did not hold true for the band of top epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7I</xref>). This observation was further validated by comparing the area per cross-section for bottom versus top epithelial zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7M</xref>). Furthermore, by comparing the progression of actual mucosal length with positions along the mucosal pseudospace axis, we observed a slower growth in real length at lower pseudospace positions, indicating a relative shortening of the lower mucosa in the absence of the microbiome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7J</xref>). Likewise, cell abundance distributions along the mucosal pseudospace axis showed a relative downward shift of epithelial populations, including enterocytes and goblet cells, consistent with the shortening of the lower mucosa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7K</xref>). These findings collectively suggest that gut epithelial development is modulated by the microbiome, and that its absence may accelerate epithelial development, resulting in the depletion of immature and a relative enrichment of mature cell populations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P55">The gut contains a diverse array of cell types, each tuned to sense distinct host-, diet-, and microbe-derived molecules. These sensory roles vary across regions and are shaped by local spatial heterogeneities. The microbiome can further reshape this molecular landscape, influencing the cellular and spatial organization of the gut. To systematically explore these features, we used MERFISH to generate a spatial transcriptomic atlas of the expression profile of most sensory-related genes in over 2 million cells across four regions of the mouse lower digestive tract, under both SPF and GF conditions. Through a combination of improved background filtering and segmentation, we defined the expected cell types across all layers of the gut, including rare populations, and defined previously unappreciated divisions within several populations. By providing a high-cellular- and -spatial-resolution view of multiple regions of the gut in two microbiome states, we envision that this atlas may prove to be a useful resource for a deeper understanding of the spatial organization of gut sensation in a range of questions.</p><p id="P56">Several observations illustrate this point. For instance, by combining detection sensitivity with cellular throughput, our MERFISH-based atlas revealed a population of mature enterocytes predominantly in the distal colon marked by the expression of the epithelial sodium channel subunit <italic>Scnn1g</italic>. To our knowledge, this population has not been previously identified in mice. Interestingly, this population expresses multiple genes in common with a human mature enterocyte population, which is marked by the calcium-dependent chloride channel BEST4 and similarly localized predominantly in the distal colon top mucosa. Multiple functions have been proposed for the BEST4+ enterocytes, including ion transport, mucus hydration, and regulation of the luminal pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. However, as there has been no previously defined homolog in a convenient model organism, it has been difficult to validate the hypothesized functions of these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Like the BEST4+ enterocytes, the <italic>Scnn1g+</italic> enterocytes may play a similar role in ion transport and mucus hydration given its expression of all three subunits of the non-voltage-gated epithelial sodium channel. While the lack of a functional Best4 and some BEST4+ enterocyte markers may indicate potential functional distinctions between these populations, genetic manipulation of this mouse population may prove useful in the exploration of BEST4+ enterocyte functions.</p><p id="P57">Another major insight provided by our atlas is that there is an extensive degree of fine-tuning of sensory gene expression and, thus, potentially sensory function within most cell types across multiple spatial scales within the gut. At broad spatial scales, we observed that while the overall cellular identities are conserved across different regions of the gastrointestinal tract, most cell types exhibit region-specific receptor expression, reflecting a potential tuning of their sensation to the differences in the small molecule environment within different gut regions. As the cells in direct contact with the lumen, it is perhaps not surprising that epithelial cells showed the greatest regional specialization, with over half of their receptors varying by region, particularly in receptors for lipids, peptides, amines, and microbial cues. However, these patterns showed little correlation with known variations in small molecules along the GI tract, suggesting that specialization is not solely shaped by local ligand availability.</p><p id="P58">At finer spatial scales, prior studies had described mucosal bottom-to-top gene expression gradients in epithelial and some fibroblast populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Our atlas now demonstrates that such spatial fine-tuning is widespread across most mucosal cell types, including stromal and immune populations, with the most pronounced gradients seen in epithelial and fibroblast subsets, and the least in immune cells. These gradients appear largely conserved across gut regions and microbiome conditions, suggesting they are intrinsic features of each cell type. Importantly, these gradients suggest that most cells adapt their gene expression to micron-scale variations within the mucosa. Importantly, our study offers a more precise framework for interpreting cellular heterogeneity in the gut. Subsets previously thought to represent distinct cell types—such as top and bottom goblet cells, telocyte subtypes, or other fibroblast subpopulations (FB1s)—are more accurately described as positions along spatially continuous gene expression gradients. This refined view provides a unifying perspective on gut cellular diversity and highlights the power of spatial transcriptomics to resolve long-standing ambiguities in tissue organization.</p><p id="P59">In addition to spatially cued gene expressions, cells in the intestinal mucosa are intricately organized, but this cellular-scale architecture has been difficult to define comprehensively across regions and cell types. Leveraging the conserved epithelial maturation process as a spatial reference, we applied a pseudospace analysis to align mucosal organization across the gut. This revealed broadly conserved spatial patterns in epithelial and fibroblast populations, while immune cell organization varied more substantially. Notably, the cecum stood out with distinct immune cell localization at the base of the crypt, suggesting region-specific roles in microbial interaction. By precisely mapping gene expression gradients and cell localization, we also developed a spatial prioritization analysis for ligand–receptor interactions, linking chemokine expression levels to immune cell distributions in the mucosa. As image-based single-cell transcriptomics become more widely adopted, such analysis approaches can offer powerful frameworks for dissecting cellular organization and interaction within intact tissues.</p><p id="P60">The microbiota has broad effects on host physiology, influencing processes such as immune development, epithelial differentiation, and disease susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. To systematically map these effects, our atlas included a germ-free (GF) component, enabling molecular, cellular, and tissue-scale comparisons with specific-pathogen-free (SPF) controls. We found that most features of gut organization are host intrinsic: cell types were largely conserved, and both receptor expression profiles and spatial gene expression patterns were mostly unchanged in the absence of the microbiome. The most pronounced changes were observed in immune cell abundance. The ileum showed widespread depletion of both adaptive and innate immune cells, while the large intestine exhibited more selective shifts—such as reduced plasma cells, Tregs, and macrophages in the distal colon, alongside increased cDC2 and NK cells. Epithelial development was also affected, with a depletion of immature populations in the gut epithelium of GF mice. These findings highlight the critical yet selective role the microbiome plays in shaping immune composition and epithelial dynamics. Taken together, these measurements reveal a rich spatial and regional organization of the mammalian gut and provide a valuable foundation for future mechanistic studies of host–microbe interactions and gut physiology.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="P61">As image-based transcriptomic methods are inherently targeted, our conclusions are necessarily limited to the genes within our selected panel, which is enriched for genes associated with sensory functions. Therefore, our findings regarding the host-intrinsic nature of receptor expression in the absence of the microbiome may not extend to other cellular processes. Moreover, we restricted our analysis to male C57BL/6 mice fed a standard diet (NIH-31M); therefore, the conclusions we draw from our atlas will not reflect sex, strain, or dietary differences, all of which can be important modulators of the sensory organization of the gut and its interaction with the microbiome. Additionally, because this is a transcriptomic study, our functional interpretations are inferred from the presence of transcripts rather than direct measurements of protein expression or cellular function. Finally, our spatial expression gradient analysis focused on radial and circumferential organization of the mucosa, reflecting the orientation of the gut slices collected. However, anatomical transitions between gut regions— such as the proximal to distal colon—may not be discrete. Thus, while our atlas revealed regional differences, it does not capture the underlying longitudinal gradients that may underlie more continuous variation between regions. Future studies that capture the full longitudinal axis using techniques such as Swiss rolling will be important for providing a more continuous and comprehensive view of regional specialization.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Resource Availability</title><sec id="S15"><title>Lead contact</title><p id="P62">Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be

Specifically, distal colon tissue was harvested from C57BL/6NTac mice, flushed and rinsed with 4 mM ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (RVC; NEB S1402S) in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Thermo AM9625) at 4 °C. The tissue was then dissolved in TRIzol (Invitrogen 15596026), and RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus kit (Zymo R2072) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was then depleted for ribosomal RNA using the HyperPrep with Ribo-Erase kit (Roche KK8560), and paired-end sequencing of 75 bases was performed on an Illumina MiSeq Instrument. RNA abundance was determined using tophat (v2.1.1) and cufflinks (v2.2.1) with default parameters, aligning against the mouse genome (GRCm39). Raw and analyzed sequencing data were deposited in the gene expression omnibus (GEO) at accession GSE297799.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>MERFISH library design and construction</title><p id="P100">To profile gene expression in the mouse intestine, we selected a panel of 1,922 genes. The first component of this panel contained ~200 well-established cell-type markers for major cell populations present in gut tissue (e.g., epithelial cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, cells of the enteric nervous system, interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC], and adipose cells) as well as established subtypes of these cells (e.g., B cells, T cells, etc.). The second component of this panel comprised a near comprehensive set of mouse receptors. To build a receptor list, we mined the KEGG database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup> to compile all genes from the following categories: G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; mmu4030), ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs; mmu04040), enzyme-linked receptors (ELRs, including receptor tyrosine kinases, receptor tyrosine phosphatases, receptor serine/threonine kinases, and receptor serine/threonine kinase; mmu01001 and mmu01009), nuclear receptors (NRs; mmu03310), pattern recognition receptors (PRRs, including Toll-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors; mmu04054), complement receptors (mmu04610), cytokine receptors (mmu04050), Wnt receptors (mmu04310), Hedgehog receptors (mmu04340), Notch receptors (mmu04330), bone morphogen protein receptors (BMP; mmu04050), and Hippo receptors (mmu04392). In addition, we included all known host-derived ligands for these pathways, including cytokines (mmu04052) and ligands for the Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, BMP, and Hippo pathways. With a few exceptions, we did not include intracellular signaling components within any of these pathways. While we aimed to be comprehensive in all receptor categories, there was one category for which we made an exception: olfactory, taste, and vomeronasal receptors. While there is ectopic expression of olfactory receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>, we selected only receptors from these categories with evidence of expression from bulk RNA sequencing data (GSE143342), keeping only 791 of 1,527 genes in these categories.</p><p id="P101">Imaging-based approaches to single-cell transcriptomics can be sensitive to RNAs that are very highly expressed, as increased crowding of single-molecule fluorescence signals can corrupt the optical barcodes used to identify RNAs. In order to reduce signal crowding and improve detection sensitivity, we removed a small subset of highly expressed receptors in published bulk RNA-sequencing (GSE143342)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>. Specifically, any RNA with an FPKM greater than 50 was removed. In addition, MERFISH obtains high quality signals by targeting each RNA with multiple probes that bind to different regions of the same RNA. Therefore, we also screened out RNAs for which the expressed isoforms are too short to support sufficient numbers of MERFISH probes.

About 10 % of the targeted genes were too short to support 75 target regions.

Individual bits were associated with a previously designed set of readout probes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup> which were first pre-screened against the mouse tissue to identify and remove probes that had modest but measurable degrees of non-specific binding. Encoding probe template molecules were then designed by assembling (1) the reverse complement of three of the four readout probes associated with the barcode assigned to each RNA, (2) a forward primer, (3) the T7 promoter, and (4) one of the desired target regions. The three readouts associated with each target region were selected from the four appropriate readouts at random but such that there was roughly even usage of each readout among the target regions associated with a given RNA.

Samples were briefly stored in 2× SSC prior to imaging. To perform a MERFISH measurement, a coverslip was mounted in the flow chamber and imaging buffer wash flown across the sample. 9 z-planes at 1.5 μm spacing were imaged for each field-of-view (FOV) covering a distance range of 2.5 μm to 16 μm from the coverslip surface with illumination in both the 635-nm and 750-nm channels to measure readout probes. A single z-plane was imaged with the 535-nm channel to identify the location of fiducial beads on the coverslip surface, and in the first imaging round, the same 9 z-planes were also imaged with the 405-nm and 473-nm channels to identify nuclei via the DAPI stain and the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase membrane immunofluorescence signals.

Briefly, this pipeline (github.com/ZhuangLab/MERFISH_analysis) identifies RNA molecules with a pixel-based, soft-decoding approach in which the normalized intensity vector of each pixel across imaging rounds is matched to that expected for each MERFISH barcode via Euclidean distance. Directly adjacent pixels that are matched to the same barcode are aggregated to form one tentative RNA molecule. This decoding process generates a set of metadata, including Euclidean distance to matched barcode (“distance”), number of pixels that form one RNA molecule (“area”), as well as the average of the Euclidean norm of the normalized signal intensity across all imaging rounds (“brightness”).</p><p id="P116">Included in these identified RNAs were a population of false positives. Previous efforts discriminated these false molecules from real molecules by thresholding on all or some of these metadata properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. However, these approaches required a degree of dataset-by-dataset adjustment of metadata thresholds, in addition to leaving behind a low but potentially meaningful level of false positive, as judged by the frequency with which blank barcodes were detected. As an improvement, we developed a new approach to discriminate real from false MERFISH signals. Specifically, we used these RNA metadata properties to define a single quality score for each RNA and then applied a single quality score threshold across all data to exclude false positives.</p><p id="P117">To compute the quality score, we computed two 3D histograms of the area, brightness, and distance metadata quantities for each individual MERFISH dataset—one for all barcodes (putative real molecules combined with false positives) and the other for blank barcodes only (known false positives). In the null model that all detected RNAs with MERFISH are false positives, the fraction of blank barcodes relative to all barcodes for each bin in these histograms would be equal to the fraction of barcodes in our library that are blank barcodes. Therefore, a smaller fraction of blanks observed for any given range of metadata properties would suggest that RNAs with those metadata properties are proportionally more likely to represent true positive measurements. The use of this 3D histogram to define complex metadata cuts has been proposed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>; however, here we used the ratio of these two histograms to define a quality score for each set of metadata properties. First, we normalized the ratio of the blank counts to the total counts for each RNA metadata bin by the fraction of barcodes in the library assigned to blanks. Second, we defined the quality score as one minus this quantity.</p><p id="P118">To estimate the quality score for each RNA, we computed the histograms above with area binned into bins of size 1, the logarithm of the brightness binned into bins of size 0.1, and the distance binned into bins of size 0.02. We then computed the quality score for each of these bins as described above. Finally, we assigned a unique quality score to each RNA based on a nearest neighbor interpolation to the nearest metadata bin. We found that this analysis produced a clear distinction between false positives (low quality score RNAs) and true positives (high quality score RNAs) with relatively few RNAs with intermediate quality scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). Therefore, the actual choice of quality score threshold did not have a strong effect on the RNAs that were kept in our MERFISH analysis. We selected 0.8 as a uniform quality score threshold applied to all datasets.</p><p id="P119">In-house bulk RNA sequencing revealed a small set of genes for which the MERFISH expression level is much higher than the expected bulk RNA sequencing level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). To minimize the effect of residual false positives on our biological interpretation, we screened our data for RNAs which had evidence of large false-positive contamination by looking for RNAs detected more frequently than expected given bulk RNA-seq. We used a linear regression in logarithmic expression space to remove the predicted abundance from bulk RNA sequencing from that observed with MERFISH and identified outlier genes as those with residuals post-regression above 0.8. In addition, we removed all zero-FPKM genes expressed in any MERFISH cluster with an average abundance greater than 0.002. In total, this analysis flagged 106 genes as potentially more contaminated by false positives than the average gene.

We applied 2D Cellpose to create 3D boundaries as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Briefly, we first trained a Cellpose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> model on the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase membrane immunofluorescence (IF) from 11 FOV in 3 regions (ileum, proximal colon, and distal colon) in SPF mice, starting with the “cyto” pretrained model. Next, we applied this Cellpose model to each z-plane for each FOV, producing 2D cell boundaries. Then, we grouped 2D boundaries for the same cell across all z-planes in each field of view if pairs of boundaries within adjacent z-planes shared at least 60% of the same area by the intersection over union (IoU) metric. RNAs were then assigned to these putative cells if they fell within these 3D boundaries. The final Cellpose model is provided in the Dryad repository associated with this work.</p><p id="P121">To refine the segmentation and capture cells for which Cellpose did not define a boundary, we used Baysor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> (v0.5.1).

All blank barcodes were excluded from this analysis, as was <italic>Neat1</italic>, a highly abundant nuclear RNA that we found could artificially drive the segmentation of nuclei from cytoplasm in the same cell. Since the quality of Baysor segmentation can be sensitive to its parameters, we first scanned a range of parameters on a subset of our data comprising three slices, one each from ileum, cecum, and distal colon. Specifically, we explored size scale (-s, from 3 to 5 in increments of 0.5), minimum molecules per cell (-m, 10 or 15), number of initial clusters for coarse segmentation (--n-clusters, from 4 to 30 in increments of 2), and Cellpose prior confidence (--prior-segmentation-confidence, from 0.7 to 1 in increments of 0.05).</p><p id="P122">For each parameter set in this screen, we used the scRNA-seq doublet-detector tool Scrublet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> to calculate a doublet score for each cell. We selected the final parameter set that minimized this doublet score. As a validation of this iterative segmentation approach, we observed that the qualitative quality of the UMAP of this dataset was noticeably improved with the final parameter set identified here as compared to our initial unguided best estimate of the parameter choice. Baysor was then run on all datasets with these optimized parameters (-i 1000 -m 15 -s 3.5 --scale-std=50% --prior-segmentation-confidence=0.9 --n-clusters=10 --exclude-genes=Blank*,Neat1 --no-ncv-estimation).</p><p id="P123">To further improve our segmentation, we identified RNAs assigned to cells with limited assignment confidence by Baysor and removed all RNAs with assignment confidence less than 0.5. In total, 16% of all RNAs were removed from cells by this filtering criteria.</p><p id="P124">To evaluate the quality of our segmentation, we performed a ‘marker purity analysis.’ Specifically, we quantified the fraction of cells in each major cell class that expressed well established cell type markers. For a more stringent quality threshold, we defined expression as a single count of RNA per cell. Indeed, we found that these markers were highly enriched in the expected cell types, with very low levels of expression elsewhere. However, this analysis did show that despite our best efforts, there may remain some small degree of cross contamination of expression between adjacent cells due to imperfect segmentation.</p><p id="P125">Baysor assigns RNAs to cells but does not, technically, find the boundary of cells. Thus, when boundaries were needed for display or other calculations, we estimated these boundaries from the 2D convex hulls calculated from the location of all RNAs assigned to a given cell across all z-planes.

While we included these genes to help discriminate some cell subtypes, we found that the genes measured with combinatorial barcodes were sufficient to define these subtypes. Therefore, the sequential markers (reported as z-scores of the average in-cell intensity) were only used as confirmation of enteroendocrine subtype labels.

To further reduce doublet effects from segmentation, a Scrublet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> doublet score was then calculated for each cell, and the top 10% of cells with the highest doublet score (above 0.22) were removed from the dataset.

Specifically, we normalized the counts within each cell to a target total sum of 2000 counts. A pseudocount of 1 was then added to all genes in all cells and the expression was natural log transformed to create logarithmic expression. In addition, we used linear regression to remove any potential effects due to the total number of unnormalized counts from this logarithmic expression, and then the residuals from this regression were z-scored.</p><p id="P129">The top 1,300 highly variable genes were used for principal component analysis (PCA). To select the number of principal components (PC) to keep for subsequent steps, we performed a pseudo-JackStraw analysis in which the maximum eigenvalue was determined from a PCA performed on expression measurements in which the cell indices associated with each gene were scrambled (therefore removing gene-gene expression covariation while preserving the expression distribution for each gene) for 10 independent randomizations. We selected only the PCs from the original analysis that had eigenvalues greater than the average of these 10 maximum values. The selected PCs were then batch-corrected with Harmony to remove batch effects between datasets, allowing for a joint analysis of cell types despite regional and microbiome-dependent differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P130">UMAP representations and Leiden clusters were calculated using standard approaches in Scanpy. This analysis was performed in multiple tiers to capture the natural hierarchy of cell types. Briefly, a Tier 1 UMAP was constructed from the harmonized PCs using a nearest neighbor graph with 49 PCs, 30 neighbors, a min_dist value of 0.3, and the cosine distance metric. This nearest neighbor graph was then used to construct clusters with the Leiden algorithm with a resolution value of 1.5. The expression of canonical marker genes for major cell classes—epithelial, fibroblast, immune, endothelial, interstitial cells of Cajal, smooth muscle, cells of the enteric nervous system, and adipose—were used to identify clusters associated with these classes. In the Tier 2 clustering, this process was repeated for each cell class individually to define cell types and states within these classes. In some cases, clusters were manually regrouped as a single Leiden resolution was insufficient to define all divisions within a class without introducing additional population divisions. Several cell populations (including EECs and T cells) were put through a third tier of clustering to identify established divisions within them.</p><p id="P131">All identified clusters were present across multiple replicate mice and could be assigned to expected cell populations based on gene expression and spatial location. However, a few clusters of epithelial cells were strongly driven by imaging artifacts in small regions of a few slices; these clusters were removed from subsequent analysis. In addition, we identified a population of cells that co-clustered with fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) but were found outside of the expected location in gut associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs) and expressed lower levels of canonical FRC markers. We labeled these cells FB6 and included them in all reported data, but as we cannot rule out that these cells represented a segmentation or clustering artifact, we do not discuss them further. Finally, we noted that some base-crypt goblet cells in the large intestine were grouped with the Paneth cell cluster in ileum, likely reflecting some shared gene expression among base-crypt secretory lineages; however, these cells do not express canonical Paneth markers outside of the ileum and were, thus, not discussed further.</p><p id="P132">In addition to the marker purity analysis described above, all final cell clusters were examined for evidence of cross-contamination with other cell populations. We noted very modest degrees of such contamination across all cell types. Nonetheless, we did notice that the Tuft cell cluster contained unclustered subsets that showed greater co-expression of markers of other epithelial populations, suggesting that this population may contain a greater degree of doublet-like features, possibly, because Baysor did not see enough instances of these exceedingly rare cells to drive the same degree of high-quality segmentation we observed in other populations.</p></sec><sec id="S37"><title>Integration with scRNA-seq</title><p id="P133">As an additional layer of validation for our clustering and cell type assignment, we co-embedded our MERFISH gut atlas with published single-cell or single-nucleus sequencing datasets. Since large-scale scRNA-seq datasets that comprehensively cover all cell classes in the mouse gut were lacking, we chose, instead, to separately co-embed subsets of our data for different cell classes to existing scRNA-seq datasets of matching cell classes and regions and for which both sufficient cell numbers and cell cluster labels were available. Specifically, we used Haber et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> for ileal epithelial cells, Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> for ileal immune cells, Pærregaard et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> for fibroblasts from the colon and ileum, Drokhlyansky et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> for cells of the ENS in the colon, Kalucka et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup> for endothelial cells in the colon, Gehart et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> for ileal EECs, and Mayassi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> for enterocytes of the colon that share evidence of the Scnn1g+ enterocytes described below. All scRNA-seq data were from SPF mice.</p><p id="P134">For each cell class, a set of overlapping genes between the two datasets were identified and the expression matrices concatenated. As described above, this concatenated dataset was normalized, natural log-transformed, regressed for total counts, and z-score corrected. PCA was then performed on 1,300 highly variable genes, and the number of PCs determined by the pseudo-JackStraw method described above. The kept PCs were then batch-corrected with Harmony across the datasets and data types (MERFISH vs. scRNA-seq). These corrected PCs were then used to create UMAP representations as described above.</p><p id="P135">To assess the co-integration between MERFISH and scRNA-seq, we computed a multi-categorical confusion matrix to evaluate the cell type alignment between these two data types. Specifically, for each MERFISH cell, we identified its five nearest scRNA-seq neighbors (NNs) in the batch-corrected PC space by the cosine distance metric, using only PCs kept by the pseudo-JackStraw method. Then a probability density distribution of the scRNA-seq cell types of the five NNs was calculated, using the inverse cosine distance in the PC space as weights, and aggregated across all cells in the same MERFISH cell type to yield a probabilistic scRNA-seq cell type alignment for that MERFISH cell type. Across all major cell classes, this analysis revealed an excellent level of alignment between the MERFISH labels and the published sequencing labels, validating our data quality, segmentation, clustering, and cell type assignment.</p><p id="P136">None of these previous studies, including the most recent one from Mayassi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, identified a population of <italic>Scnn1g</italic>+ enterocytes in the mouse gut. Moreover, among the published epithelial datasets, only Mayassi et al. provided the necessary markers to define these populations. Therefore, to determine if evidence for this population could be found within the published data of Mayassi et al., we first extracted all colon enterocytes from SPF mice in this dataset and computed the pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients between the z-scored log-normalized expression values for key enterocyte population markers. In parallel, we co-embedded this dataset with SPF colonic enterocytes from the MERFISH atlas and mapped the sequencing cell types onto MERFISH cell types as described above. In particular, we isolated all <italic>Scnn1g</italic>-expressing enterocytes in the Mayassi et al. dataset and treated them as a separate group for the cell type alignment analysis. The enterocytes expressing <italic>Scnn1g</italic> in the Mayassi et al. dataset mapped onto the <italic>Scnn1g</italic>+ enterocytes in the MERFISH atlas, further supporting the existence of this enterocyte state in the mouse colonic epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="S38"><title>Spatial neighborhood analysis</title><p id="P137">To analyze and extricate distinct gut anatomical layers, namely mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, myenteric plexus, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), we adapted a tissue neighborhood analysis approach that has been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, with several important modifications. Specifically, for each cell, we identified the 25 nearest neighbors based on the centroid-to-centroid distances, and a Neighborhood cell-type Composition Vector (NCV) was calculated with an inverse distance weight, which was defined as (10 μm / <italic>d</italic>), where 10 μm was roughly the dimension of the average cell and <italic>d</italic> was the centroid-to-centroid distance between the center cell and its neighbor. The weight was set to 1.0 for the center cell and capped at 1.0 as the maximum possible value for a neighboring cell. To capture both high-level and fine-grained cell type features, the NCV kept track of the relative abundance of both cell classes (Tier 1) as well as the final cell type labels (Tier 2 or Tier 3). The contribution of Tier 2 or Tier 3 components to the NCV was weighted with a factor of 2 relative to Tier 1 components.</p><p id="P138">The NCVs for all cells in the dataset, including all regions and microbiome conditions, were concatenated to form one neighborhood composition matrix (NCM). To identify spatial neighborhoods, we normalized each NCV to a total sum of 20, z-scored the NCM, performed PCA, and determined the number of PCs to keep via the jack straw method described above. These PCs were then used to create a UMAP embedding with the cosine distance metric, 30 neighbors, and a minimum distance of 0.3. To label different anatomical layers, we performed Leiden clustering on the same graph used to create the UMAP. A relatively modest resolution (0.3) was sufficient to pull out the major anatomical features. This analysis produced a few different mucosal regions, which we manually recombined. As we have observed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, the high numerical similarity of some NCVs produced challenges in UMAP convergence. Therefore, we added a random, small noise term, which varied between 0.02 and 0.2, to each entry in the NCM to aid convergence. The final spatial neighborhood labels derived from this analysis are provided in the Dryad deposition.</p><p id="P139">To quantify the relative abundance and distribution of cell types across gut regions and anatomical layers, we performed a three-tiered analysis. First, the relative abundance of cell types was calculated as the fraction of a given cell type among all cells in all SPF regions. Then, the relative abundance of cell types across regions was calculated by dividing the number in each region by the total number of that cell type in all SPF regions. Finally, the relative abundance of each cell type across gut anatomical layers was calculated separately for each SPF region, by dividing the number in each layer by the total number across all layers in that region.</p></sec><sec id="S39"><title>Mucosal pseudospace axis</title><p id="P140">To define a unified spatial axis of the mucosa across regions and microbiome states, we used the spatially organized maturation of epithelial cells—from stem cells at the crypt base to mature enterocytes at the top of the mucosa. Specifically, we subset our atlas to stem cells as well as bottom, mid, top, and <italic>Scnn1g</italic>+ enterocytes, and we calculated a UMAP using harmonized PCs following a similar protocol as above. A diffusion map with 15 dimensions was then calculated using Scanpy based on the resulting nearest-neighbor graph. While the 1<sup>st</sup> diffusion component captured inter-sample variation, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> components reflected the enterocyte maturation trajectory from crypt base to top mucosa. We then computed pseudotime without branching from the diffusion map of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> components, using the stem cell with the lowest values on these two components as the root using standard methods in Scanpy.</p><p id="P141">To extend this spatial trajectory to all mucosal populations, a mucosal pseudospace axis was constructed by propagating enterocyte pseudotime values to nearby non-enterocyte cells. For each non-enterocyte cell in the mucosa spatial neighborhood, the three nearest stem or enterocyte cells (based on centroid-to-centroid distance) were identified, and their pseudotime values averaged and assigned to that cell as its mucosal pseudospace value. For stem and enterocyte populations, the original expression-derived pseudotime was retained as the mucosal pseudospace value.</p><p id="P142">To relate mucosal pseudospace to real-space location, we computed the cumulative fraction of all mucosal cells at or below a given mucosal pseudospace value for 100 pseudospace positions sampled evenly between 0 (crypt base) and 1 (top of mucosa). The length fractions were then converted to real-space length values by scaling by the average mucosal thickness of the given region and microbiome state. To calculate the mucosal thickness, we identified the top and bottom 5% of all cells ranked by mucosal pseudospace coordinates. Each top cell was then mapped to the 5 nearest bottom cells, and the distances calculated and averaged; the distances were then averaged across all top cells in each slice to derive the slice-averaged mucosal thickness. Mapping between mucosal pseudospace and real-space length position was quantified by averaging the thickness values slice-by-slice within each region and microbiome state, followed by computation of the mean and standard error across slices.</p><p id="P143">While the spatial neighborhood analysis described in the previous section was used to delineate the mucosa from surrounding regions, the mucosal pseudospace axis provided a more fine-grained descriptor of mucosal spatial organization. Accordingly, for all analyses referring to the bottom, mid, or top mucosa, regions were defined based on mucosal pseudospace values: bottom as &lt; 1/3, mid as 1/3 – 2/3, and top as &gt; 2/3.</p></sec><sec id="S40"><title>Cellular and transcriptomic gradients in the mucosa</title><p id="P144">Real-space coordinates, derived in relation to mucosal pseudospace coordinates as described above, were used to quantify the relative spatial distribution of all cell populations within the mucosa, separately for each region and microbiome state. The real-space coordinates were favored over the pseudospace coordinates for this analysis as they provided a more intuitive visualization of cell abundance distributions in the mucosa. To ensure robust estimation, the analysis was restricted to cell populations exceeding a minimum abundance threshold of 100 cells in the given region and microbiome condition. For each cell type, kernel density estimate (KDE) was applied on the distribution of mucosal real-space coordinates. KDE was implemented by the scipy.stats.gaussian_kde module and the kernel bandwidth was automatically selected via the “scott” method. To avoid artificial disruptions to the cell densities near either ends of the real-space axis, boundary correction was applied by padding the distribution of real-space values for 0.1 fractional unit beyond the minimum or maximum real-space value. Specifically, all data points within 0.1 fractional unit of either end of the real-space axis were reflected across the end and added to the existing real-space value distribution. The KDE-smoothed cell density vectors were normalized so that the maximum value equaled 1, visualized with heat map, and reported for mucosal cell types in both SPF and GF gut regions.</p><p id="P145">Similar to cell abundance gradients, gene expression gradients along the mucosal pseudospace axis were estimated using KDE. In short, in each mucosal cell type with more than 100 counts in a given region or microbiome state, RNAs of each gene were tabulated for the mucosal pseudospace values of the cells they are found in. The resulting pseudospace values were then smoothed with KDE and normalized by the cell abundance KDE over the same range of mucosal pseudospace coordinates.</p><p id="P146">To implement this pipeline, several considerations were made. First, since sufficient cell density was required for robust KDE estimate of gene expression, for each mucosal cell type in a given region or condition, only the mucosal pseudospace range over which the given cell type was sufficiently abundant was used for gene expression gradient calculations. To determine the pseudospace range where cell density is sufficient, the following standard was applied. Cell counts were first computed in 100 bins along the pseudospace axis. The lower boundary of the range was defined as the lowest pseudospace value above which all bins contained at least 10 cells. Similarly, the upper boundary was defined as the highest pseudospace value below which all bins satisfied this same threshold. KDE analyses proceeded only if the resulting valid range exceeded 0.1 pseudospace unit (the whole mucosa is 1 pseudospace unit), ensuring adequate support for reliable cell density and gene expression estimation.</p><p id="P147">To estimate cell densities for the purpose of normalizing gene expression, a KDE was computed for the total counts of the selected cell type along the pseudospace axis, following a protocol like the one described above. Genes were then filtered so that only ones with natural log-normalized expression levels above 0.2 in each cell type in the given region and microbiome state were estimated for KDE densities. To estimate gene expression densities, for each gene, a transcript count vector and a pseudospace coordinate vector were extracted from all cells of a given type. The pseudospace vector was expanded such that each pseudospace value was replicated according to the number of transcripts in the corresponding cell. If the resulting vector contained more than 100 values, a KDE was applied to obtain a continuous expression profile along the pseudospace axis. This profile was then normalized by the KDE of total cell counts to control for underlying cell density. The normalized curve was further smoothed using a second round of KDE and finally scaled so that the maximum value was equal to 1. To visualize the gene expression gradients in enterocytes, telocytes, and macrophages, hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance metric and “complete” inter-cluster distance was applied for the purpose of ordering the gradients by similarity. The final set of gene expression gradients for each cell type in each region and microbiome state was reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S41"><title>Mapping mucosal pseudospace to scRNA-seq</title><p id="P148">To validate mucosal gene expression gradients independently of MERFISH measurements and to extend these gradients transcriptome-wide, we mapped mucosal positional coordinates onto published scRNA-seq datasets via co-integration with MERFISH data. Integration was performed as previously described. For each cell in the scRNA-seq dataset that corresponded to a mucosal cell type, the five nearest MERFISH neighbors of the same type were identified within the co-embedding principal component space by the Euclidean distance metric, and mucosal pseudospace values were transferred by averaging the positional scores of these neighbors.</p><p id="P149">Following pseudospace transfer, each scRNA-seq dataset was analyzed independently of MERFISH data to ensure an unbiased assessment of transcriptome-wide spatial patterns. Preprocessing steps included count normalization to a target sum of 10,000, natural log-transformation, and selection of highly variable genes (min_mean = 0, min_disp = -0.2). Total UMI counts were regressed out, and the residual expression matrix was z-scored. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed, and the number of components retained was determined using the pseudo-JackStraw method as described above. Batch correction was applied using either Harmony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> or ComBat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup>, with the latter used when average batch sizes were fewer than 200 cells due to poor Harmony performance under such conditions. A nearest-neighbor graph and UMAP embedding were then computed using standard Scanpy procedures. The transferred mucosal pseudospace values were overlaid on the scRNA-seq UMAPs, revealing spatial gradients consistent with the axis of gene expression variation.</p></sec><sec id="S42"><title>Mutual information (MI) between transcriptome and pseudospace</title><p id="P150">To quantitatively assess the influence of mucosal position on gene expression across different mucosal cell populations, latent mutual information (LMI) was computed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. LMI calculations were performed using the latentmi package. For each cell population within each mucosal region and microbiome state, cells were subsetted and included only if at least 100 cells were present. The model was run in GPU mode with the following parameters: 15 dimensions for the latent space (N_dims = 15), half the data used as the validation set (validation_split = 0.5), and a maximum number of 2000 rounds of iterations (epochs = 2000). The resulting LMI scores represent the degree to which transcriptomic variation is explained by spatial positions along the mucosal axis.</p><p id="P151">To identify genes that contribute to spatial expression gradients within specific cell populations along the mucosal pseudospace axis, we calculated the normalized mutual information (NMI) between the expression of individual genes and mucosal pseudospace. For each gene within a given cell population and condition, we estimated mutual information using sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_regression. To normalize the resulting mutual information values to fall between 0 and 1, we divided them by the square root of the product of the differential entropies of pseudospace locations and gene expression, both computed using scipy.stats.differential_entropy. Prior to these calculations, both pseudospace and natural log-normalized gene expression values were z-scored to ensure scale comparability. To handle the entropy of gene expression distributions containing a large fraction of zeros, we modeled expression as a two-component mixture of zero and non-zero values, assigning zero entropy to the former and estimating the latter after adding a small noise term, modeled with a Gaussian distribution with 0 mean and 10<sup>-6</sup> variance, to avoid numerical instability. NMI was computed only for cell populations with at least 100 cells in the given region and condition, and for genes with average natural log-normalized expression greater than 0.2. The distributions of NMI values in select cell populations in SPF ileum were visualized. The LMI values of cell populations as well as NMI values of genes can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S43"><title>Mucosal gene gradient conservation analysis via hierarchical clustering</title><p id="P152">To assess the conservation of spatial gene expression gradients in the mucosal pseudospace across mucosal regions and microbiome states, we performed hierarchical clustering of the KDE-smoothed gene expression gradients previously derived. To ensure robust gradient estimation as well as to facilitate comparison across conditions, only cell types with well-defined gradients over the pseudospace range of 0.35 - 0.85 in all regions and microbiome conditions were considered for this analysis. This led us to focus on key populations, including enterocytes, goblet cells, telocytes, and FB1 interstitial fibroblasts. In each of these populations and for each region and microbiome state, only genes above 0.2 natural log-normalized expression were considered for gradient pattern comparison.</p><p id="P153">For comparison of gradient similarity across regions in the SPF dataset and between SPF and GF, all gene expression gradients were concatenated and hierarchically clustered using a complete linkage algorithm and Euclidean distance. This analysis identified five major gradient patterns: constant, slightly increasing, increasing, decreasing, and slightly decreasing. While a small subset of genes in enterocytes exhibited non-monotonic (e.g., peak in the middle) expression, these were too infrequent to form a distinct cluster.</p><p id="P154">To quantify the conservation of gradient patterns across SPF regions, we computed the frequency with which a given gene-in-cell type gradient assigned to a particular cluster in one region co-occurred with the same or alternative clusters in other regions. Among genes defined in at least two SPF regions, most cluster transitions occurred between the constant and slightly increasing or slightly decreasing clusters, indicating high overall conservation of gradient patterns. A similar co-occurrence analysis comparing SPF and GF states within the same region revealed a high level of gradient preservation across microbiome conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S44"><title>Quantifying mucosal gradient similarity via Jensen-Shannon distance</title><p id="P155">To quantify the conservation of gene expression gradients across regions and microbiome states, we used the Jensen-Shannon (J-S) distance, a symmetric measure of dissimilarity between density distributions, implemented by the scipy.spatial.distance.jensenshannon module. For each cell type (stem cell and enterocyte, goblet, telocyte, and FB1), we first computed the pairwise J-S distances between all genes expressed above a threshold (0.2 in natural log-normalized expression) within each individual region and microbiome state, capturing the natural intra-regional variation in gene expression spatial patterns. We then computed inter-regional J-S distances for each gene, comparing its expression gradients across all regions in the SPF dataset where it was sufficiently expressed. As expected, inter-regional J-S distances for the same gene were consistently lower than intra-regional distances between different genes, indicating that most gene gradients are conserved across regions.</p><p id="P156">To identify genes with high regional variability, we defined outliers as those whose inter-regional J-S distance exceeded the 75th percentile of the intra-regional J-S distance distribution of all regions. Genes were then classified as conserved or variable within each cell type and receptor class and visualized using stacked bar plots. The majority of gene gradients were found to be regionally conserved.</p><p id="P157">A similar approach was applied to compare spatial gene expression gradients between SPF and GF conditions within the same region. J-S distances between microbiome states were markedly smaller than baseline intra-regional variation. Upon applying the same threshold—defined as the 75th percentile of inter-regional and inter-microbiome variation—to identify gradient variability, the vast majority of gene expression gradients were likewise classified as conserved. This reinforced the conclusion that the majority of gene expression gradients were conserved across both regions and microbiome states.</p><p id="P158">Finally, to quantify the spatial co-localization between chemokine expression and immune cell abundance in the mucosa, we computed the J-S distance between the spatial distributions of chemokines and chemokine-receptor-expressing immune cells along the real-space mucosal axis. The spatial distributions were computed following the KDE-smoothing protocols for cell abundance and gene expression as described above. Chemokine distributions were calculated as density (counts per cell) among all mucosal cells, while immune cell distributions were derived from total cell counts. Chemokine-receptor interactions were curated from the OmniPath<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup> database, with human gene names converted to mouse orthologs using pybiomart and verified manually. Only immune cell populations expressing the cognate chemokine receptor above a threshold of 0.2 in natural log–normalized expression were included. For chemokines, a lower expression threshold of 0.01 was applied to account for dilution across mucosal cell types. J-S distances between chemokine and immune cell distributions were calculated separately within each gut region in the SPF dataset to characterize region-specific spatial coordination between chemokine expression and immune infiltration.</p></sec><sec id="S45"><title>Spatially informed receptor-ligand interaction</title><p id="P159">To perform a spatially informed receptor-ligand interaction analysis, we first subset to all cells found within each mucosal neighborhood, defined by three equal bins of the mucosal pseudospace axis as described above.

Within each condition, we first subset cells by region, microbiome state, and cell type, then gene expression across cells of the same type was averaged within each slice.

These patterns were only apparent in the results for enterocytes but not other cell populations.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>SI Figures and Captions</label><media xlink:href="EMS207689-supplement-SI_Figures_and_Captions.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d84aAcHbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS207689-supplement-Supplemental_Table_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d84aAcHcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplemental Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS207689-supplement-Supplemental_Table_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d84aAcHdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplemental Table 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS207689-supplement-Supplemental_Table_3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d84aAcHeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplemental Table 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS207689-supplement-Supplemental_Table_4.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d84aAcHfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplemental Table 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS207689-supplement-Supplemental_Table_5.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d84aAcHgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplemental Table 6</label><media xlink:href="EMS207689-supplement-Supplemental_Table_6.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d84aAcHhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Supplemental Table 7</label><media xlink:href="EMS207689-supplement-Supplemental_Table_7.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d84aAcHiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S49"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Brianna R.
