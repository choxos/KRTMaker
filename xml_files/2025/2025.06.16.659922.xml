extracellular particles. (Meta)genomics and (meta)transcriptomics have provided insight into their diverse coding repertoire, but many of the proteins remain to be characterized as they lack homology with known proteins. Here, we integrated cross-linking mass spectrometry, quantitative proteomics, computational tools and cryo-EM data to characterize the protein architecture of intact melbournevirus particles. Based on this, we allocated 88 viral proteins to different virion sub-compartments and proposed topologies of 25 inner membrane proteins. We assigned eight components of the capsid in cryo-EM data, including proteins that tether the capsid shell to the membrane, reflecting key points in virion maturation. The data provide a valuable resource and demonstrate the power of an integrative approach to gain system-level structural insights into a poorly characterized biological system.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Advances in (meta)genomics and (meta)transcriptomics have revealed the remarkable genetic diversity of viruses, the largest on earth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. More recently, breakthroughs in protein structure prediction, such as Alphafold2/3, have enabled large-scale modeling of viral protein structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. However, approximately 40% of the viral proteins lack known structural homologs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, the performance and accuracy of AlphaFold’s predictions depend heavily on the availability of sequence data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, which is limited for many viruses, especially emerging ones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. These challenges hinder our ability to infer protein structures and functions solely through <italic>in silico</italic> analyses, underscoring the need for complementary experimental approaches to study poorly characterized viruses and their interactions with the host.</p><p id="P3">Giant viruses are a prime example of complex yet poorly understood biological systems. As members of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV), they infect unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes and produce very large extracellular viral particles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Their particle size (ranging from 200 nm to up to 2 μm) and genome content (up to 2.8 megabase pairs) challenge conventional definitions of viruses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, giant viruses encode proteins involved in processes once thought exclusive to cellular life, such as metabolism, protein synthesis, or genome condensation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. For example, the giant melbournevirus was found to encode three histone-like proteins (MEL_368, MEL_369 and MEL_149) that compact its viral DNA - a process previously associated primarily with eukaryotes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Melbournevirus, first described in 2014, belongs to the <italic>Marseilleviridae</italic> family and has a highly complex, 360 kbp-long genome containing 403 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The virus replicates and assembles in amoeba <italic>Acanthamoeba castellanii</italic>, and newly formed virions exit the host cell via exocytosis or cell lysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Despite its significance, the structure of melbournevirus remains poorly characterized. The particle has a diameter of 230 nm and consists of several components: (1) an outer capsid shell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, formed by homotrimeric major capsid protein (MCP, MEL_305), along with penton and cap proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, (2) an internal membrane layer enclosing the viral DNA genome, and (3) a minor capsid protein (mCP) layer beneath the MCP layer, likely stabilizing the capsid structure and linking it to the inner membrane, a feature also observed in other NCLDV capsids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">The architecture of these complexes has been determined exclusively by cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. However, the large size of capsid imposes resolution limitations that can be achieved in cryo-EM studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Due to these constraints and the complexity of the system, only three Melbournevirus proteins have been structurally characterized: the major capsid protein MEL_305, and two nucleosome-like proteins MEL_368 and MEL_369 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Additionally, many melbournevirus ORFs are predicted to encode proteins lacking available homology to any known proteins in databases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, severely constraining our understanding of the identity, structure, function, interactions, and spatial organization of the viral proteins in the virion. These challenges could potentially be addressed by analyzing the virion’s native protein interaction networks. Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) is particularly well-suited for this task, as it enables the mapping of protein interaction networks within intact cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, organelles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and virions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Furthermore, integrating XL-MS with computational protein structural prediction offers a powerful approach to validate and refine structural models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">In this study, we combined proteome-wide XL-MS with AlphaFold3-based structure prediction to characterize the structural interactome of intact melbournevirus particles. Our XL-MS data enabled spatial mapping of 88 viral proteins to the two virion sublayers. Notably, within the membrane separating these two sublayers, we identified 25 viral transmembrane (TM) proteins and determined their topologies. Curiously, most viral TM proteins position the majority of their non-TM domains within the capsid-membrane space. By combining XL-MS, AlphaFold3 and cryo-EM data, we demonstrate that two of these TM proteins structurally bridge the inner virion membrane and the capsid, functioning as minor capsid proteins (mCPs). Furthermore, we generated structural predictions for multiple uncharacterized viral proteins, proposed molecular functions based on their structure, localization and interaction partners and assigned previously unresolved cryo-EM densities. Our findings provide detailed structural insight into melbournevirus protein organization and establish integrative structural interactomics as a powerful approach for multi-level analysis of giant viruses. More broadly, this methodology represents an attractive strategy for studying poorly understood biological systems.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The melbournevirus interactome clusters packaged proteins to sub-virion compartments</title><p id="P8">We employed XL-MS to uncover protein-protein interactions (PPIs) within the large and poorly characterized melbournevirus particles. Virions were collected from the supernatant of infected <italic>A. castellanii</italic> cell culture and cross-linked using the MS-cleavable cross-linker disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO). To enrich virions and deplete contaminating debris, we purified the particles by sucrose density-gradient ultracentrifugation, as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Proteins were then extracted, digested by trypsin, and cross-linked peptides were identified by LC-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To assess the reproducibility of our approach, we performed XL-MS across three biological replicates. We identified between 4,900 and 8,100 unique residue-to-residue connections at a residue-level false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 1</xref>). After aggregating cross-links to PPIs, we analyzed the overlap between replicates. Approximately 64% of PPIs were identified in at least two replicates and 50% were present in all three, indicating high experimental reproducibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). To minimize false positives, we retained only PPIs observed in at least two replicates. The resulting filtered interaction network comprised 486 PPIs, corresponding to 8,908 cross-links from 108 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">While most cross-links involved viral proteins, a small fraction (2 - 4.5% per replicate) connected viral and host proteins. We included only those Amoeba host proteins with direct viral interaction partners, likely representing virion-recruited host proteins.</p><p id="P11">These included amoebal Cystatin, an HMG (High mobility group) box domain-containing protein, Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, Vinculin and several unannotated proteins corresponding to previously identified transcripts in Amoeba <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. The predominance of viral proteins and the scarcity of highly abundant host proteins inside the virion align with prior proteomic analyses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">Next, we investigated the spatial distribution of packaged proteins. Previous cryo-EM studies revealed that melbournevirus possesses a 30 □-thick inner membrane layer separating the outer capsid from the inner dsDNA genome and associated proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. This membrane imposes a constraint on XL-MS, as the DSSO cross-linker, which has a spacer arm of 10.1 □, cannot connect proteins on opposite sides. To evaluate this constraint in our PPI network, we performed unsupervised community clustering <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, which partitioned the network into two major protein communities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 2</xref>). Proteins within the same community exhibited dense interactions, whereas connections between communities were sparse. These communities reflect spatial segregation of a genome-associated internal “core” and a membrane-external, capsid-enclosed “coat”.</p><p id="P13">We then predicted sub-virion localizations for melbournevirus proteins based on the only four proteins with known localizations: the histone-like viral proteins (MEL_368 [H4-H3-analog], MEL_369 [H2B-H2A-analog] and MEL_149 [“mini” H2B-H2A-analog] <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> localized to the core, while the major capsid protein (MCP, MEL_305) resided in the coat <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Using the spatial information of their interaction partners, we classified the viral proteome into 33 core and 55 coat proteins. This represents the first system-wide spatial mapping within a giant virus.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Transmembrane predictions and cross-linking data assign topologies to viral TM proteins</title><p id="P14">Next, we sought to identify proteins bridging the two communities, focusing on membrane-anchored proteins in our cross-linking dataset. Since no experimental data were available for transmembrane (TM) domain annotation of melbournevirus, we screened the viral proteome using <italic>in silico</italic> prediction tools (DeepTMHMM, DeepTMpred and TMbed; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). These algorithms predict both α-helical and β-barrel TM regions with high accuracy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. To enhance reliability, we retained only TM domains predicted by at least two algorithms. While TMbed and DeepTMHMM showed strong agreement, DeepTMpred assigned more TM domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), likely because it does not distinguish between TM domains and signal peptides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. This analysis identified 43 putative TM proteins, of which 25 were present in our interaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P15">A key advantage of XL-MS is its domain-level resolution, enabling topology prediction of TM proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Leveraging this, we assigned topologies based on the localizations of interacting partners in the PPI network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Using 1,291 cross-links, we predicted topological orientations for 29 domains of 25 predicted TM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 3</xref>). These predictions explained 98.5% of the cross-linking data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The remaining ~ 1.5% of cross-links conflicted with our predictions, possibly due to mis-incorporated proteins, false identifications or proteins with dual topologies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">Notably, most cross-links on TM proteins mapped to the outer membrane leaflet. Consistently, non-TM domains were predominantly located in the coat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). This suggests melbournevirus TM proteins evolved with large coat-facing domains and small core-facing regions. One exception is MEL_173, which has two non-TM domains, both predicted in the core. Taken together, our XL-based analysis resolved a high-resolution sub-virion interactome, revealing dozens of viral TM proteins with a preferential outer-leaflet exposure.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cross-links validate structure prediction of melbournevirus proteins</title><p id="P17">Having established the global melbournevirus interactome with sub-virion resolution, we next pursued atomistic structural insights. We predicted structures for all viral proteins in our cross-linking network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) using AlphaFold3, focusing on proteins containing at least one intra-link (cross-links connecting lysines within the same protein sequence). Model quality was assessed using predicted template modeling (pTM) scores <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">To validate these predictions, we mapped intra-protein cross-links onto the AlphaFold3 structures and measured Cα-Cα distances (supplementary Tab 3). Models with low pTM scores (e.g., MEL_232, pTM = 0.1) frequently violated the DSSO distance constraint of 35 □ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, while high-scoring models (e.g., MEL_085, pTM = 0.95) showed excellent agreement with cross-linking data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Models with a pTM score of 0.5 and higher generally agreed with the cross-linking data and can therefore be considered high-confidence predictions. Overall, AlphaFold3 generated 45 high-confidence structures where &gt;50% of intra-links satisfied distance restraints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 4</xref>).</p><p id="P19">In addition to structures of individual proteins, we expanded our analysis to prediction of heterodimers with AlphaFold3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. After filtering by the AlphaFold confidence score, we identified 16 high-confidence dimeric models consistent with our cross-linking data (confidence score &gt;0.5, at least 50% of inter-protein cross-links from structured regions satisfied, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 4</xref>). A notable example is the MEL_183:MEL_249 complex (confidence score = 0.72), where all seven inter-protein cross-links satisfied distance constraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). This model is further supported by the observation that both proteins are membrane incorporated (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and the globular domains building the interaction interface are both located in the “coat”.</p><p id="P20">Another insightful prediction is on the viral histone-like proteins. We obtained high-scoring heterodimeric models for MEL_368 (also known as the melbournevirus histone H4-H3-analog) with either MEL_369 (also known as the melbournevirus histone H2B-H2A-analog) or MEL_149 (also known as mini H2B-H2A-analog). While MEL_368:MEL_369 forms canonical nucleosome-like complexes within the virion, MEL_368 and MEL_149 association remained enigmatic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and were only recently observed to form a complex in vitro <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Comparative analysis of heterodimer versus heterotetramer predictions revealed a slight improvement of the confidence scores (from 0.8 to 0.9) and increased cross-link concordance (from 3/5 to 4/5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). These data support MEL_368:MEL_149 may form an alternative, minor nucleosome-like species which is present within native virions.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>High-confidence protein models pinpoint the putative functions of uncharacterized viral proteins</title><p id="P21">Leveraging our high-confidence structure models, we investigated potential functional roles of melbournevirus proteins through structural homology searches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Using Foldseek <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> we compared the 39 high-scoring, cross-link validated monomeric models against the PDB and AlphaFold databases. Remarkably, 25 models showed significant structural similarity (probability score &gt; 0.95) to known protein folds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 5</xref>). Many melbournevirus proteins, especially in the coat, share structural similarities with enzymes. For example, MEL_085 displays a fold similar to amino acid oxidases, while MEL_146 and MEL_398 resemble glycosyltransferases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the core, many protein models showed structural similarity to proteins involved in DNA-related processes. For example, MEL_275 aligns with TATA-box binding proteins, MEL_380 is related to serine/threonine protein kinases, and MEL_219 has an RNase III-like structure.</p><p id="P22">A particularly intriguing case is MEL_206 – a protein with no sequence homology to characterized proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, but displaying striking structural similarity to several ubiquitin-specific proteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The model aligned closely with the structure of Chlamydia trachomatis DUB1 (deubiquitinase and deneddylase), suggesting potential ubiquitin protease activity. Supporting this hypothesis, we studied protein ubiquitination of the virion proteome by proteomics and found several ubiquitinated peptides originating from the histone-like proteins MEL_368 and MEL_369 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 6</xref>). Both proteins are cross-linking partners of MEL_206. These findings suggest MEL_206 may regulate viral chromatin accessibility through histone ubiquitination as a potential regulatory mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Refining the cryo-EM capsid structure by integrative modeling</title><p id="P23">In addition to putative enzymes, we sought to further characterize the structural properties of melbournevirus proteins. Current cryo-EM reconstructions of melbournevirus particles have resolutions ranging from 4.4 □ <sup>21</sup> to 3.4 □ <sup>45</sup>. While certain regions of the map permitted de novo model building, the complexity of the system, unknown stoichiometry, and limited resolution in many other regions made de novo modeling based solely on density unfeasible <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.

Among these, the pentasymmetron component (PC□) exhibits a rhodopsin-like stacked α-helical fold, though its identity remained unresolved in existing cryo-EM data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. To identify this protein, we screened high-scoring models among predicted coat proteins and found that density matched to MEL_213b, when predicted as a homodimer. Furthermore, homodimeric prediction of MEL_213b satisfied the XL-distance restraints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P26">To identify additional minor capsid components, we shortlisted candidate proteins from the coat community that cross-linked to either MCP or MEL_213b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). By fitting these models into the cryo-EM map, we assigned MEL_234 and MEL_276 as minor capsid proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). We also identified four other proteins - MEL_341, MEL_097, MEL_297 and MEL_331 - whose AlphaFold3 models contained well-structured domains consistent with the cryo-EM density. However, their lower accuracy domains could not be fitted, likely due to their high flexibility. In such cases, PPI data provided critical orthogonal evidence. Interestingly, MEL_276 and MEL_331 were predicted to be membrane associated (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting a structural role in capsid-membrane tethering.</p><p id="P27">Each vertex of the MCP icosahedron is characterized by the presence of a homopentameric complex, the penton <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Assigning the identity proved challenging, as none of the candidate models cross-linking to MCP or MEL_213b displayed a similar fold. We therefore screened all XL-MS detected proteins for potential homo-multimerization (n=1-5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 7</xref>). As expected, MCP and MEL_213b scored the highest at their known stoichiometries. The only protein with a high-scoring pentameric model was MEL_256, which fit exceptionally well into the cryo-EM map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The detected inter-domain cross-link further supported the MEL_256 pentamer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Refinement of the AlphaFold3 models by tracing revealed an extensive contact between the penton complex and the minor capsid protein MEL_341, which wraps around the vertex center beneath the penton (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Remaining unassigned densities in the cryo-EM map lacked sufficient evidence for confident model matching (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P28">To extend these findings, we assessed the stoichiometry and symmetry of assigned capsid components using shotgun proteomics and intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) values from purified virion samples. By calibrating copy numbers against four reference proteins (with known abundances from literature or our cryo-EM assignments), we obtained highly reproducible estimates across four technical replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure 7</xref>). This analysis suggested ~120 copies of MEL_097 and MEL_276, and ~ 60 copies of MEL_297 and MEL_341 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 7</xref>). The other minor capsid proteins such as MEL_234 (~2200 calculated copies) and MEL_331 (~550 calculated copies) are incorporated in much higher stoichiometries and therefore are also likely part of the capsid outside the vertex (previously named “scaffold” component, “glue” or “zipper” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P29">In summary, our integrative approach assigned seven minor capsid proteins as well as the penton protein using cross-link verified AlphaFold models.

With every newly discovered giant virus, more questions need to be addressed, urging the development of fast and systematic approaches to elucidate structure, proteomic arsenal, interaction with the hosts and ecological roles. To address this challenge, we developed an integrative approach combining XL-MS and AlphaFold3 modeling to comprehensively resolve the structural and spatial interactome of melbournevirus particles, providing unprecedented insights into its proteome organization.</p><p id="P31">Our XL-MS data partitioned the melbournevirus proteome into two spatially distinct communities separated by the inner membrane: an inner “core” and an outer “coat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We identified 25 TM proteins and annotated their topologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Through structural assignment on the cryo-EM density map, we assigned two TM proteins (MEL_331, MEL_276) as minor capsid proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). These proteins likely bridge the capsid and membrane through physical contacts, which may likely explain previous observations of membrane protrusions at the capsid vertices <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Notably, similar membrane-capsid tethering architecture was observed in distantly related viruses like PBCV-1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and medusavirus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, suggesting a conserved structural strategy.</p><p id="P32">Using AlphaFold3, we generated high-confidence structural models (prioritized by pTM or confidence scores and cross-link validation) and accessed functional homology with Foldseek. The coat community was enriched in proteins with predicted enzymatic functions, possibly acquired through horizontal gene transfer from the host <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> or other viruses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. While some viral enzymes have been functionally validated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, the activities of melbournevirus-encoded proteins remain speculative and warrant <italic>in vitro</italic> characterization.</p><p id="P33">Beyond enzymes, we identified a heterodimeric complex between MEL_149 and MEL_368 that forms an alternative nucleosome-like structure comparing to the previously described MEL_368:MEL_369 complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Importantly, when MEL149:MEL_368 was modeled as a heterotetramer, nearly all cross-links from the structured regions of the MEL_149:MEL_368 complex were satisfied, further validating the model. This prediction is consistent with a recently reported <italic>in vitro</italic> structure of MEL_149:MEL_368 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Our data further support the existence of this complex in intact virions. However, the MEL_149:MEL_368 complex likely exists in low stoichiometry, as MEL_149 is present at fewer than 100 copies per virion, which is much lower in comparison to the ~4,000 copies of MEL_368. Therefore, the MEL_149-containing complex may not significantly contribute to overall viral genome condensation, but it could play a regulatory role, potentially modulating transcription activation as observed in yeast <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">Finally, we demonstrated the power of our integrative structural modeling approach by assigning eight additional capsid components to a previously published cryo-EM map <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. XL-MS data enabled us to generate a shortlist of potential protein candidates, significantly improving the success rate of matching models with the density. For regions with low-confident structural predictions or cryo-EM densities of limited resolution, the additional constraints provided by cross-linking data substantially increases assignment confidence.</p><p id="P35">We further improved our cryo-EM assignments using two complementary approaches: (i) protein copy number quantification through proteomics, and (ii) homomultimeric state predictions using AlphaFold3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. These methods successfully confirmed known assemblies, including the trimeric MCP, homodimeric MEL_213b and homopentameric MEL_256.

Importantly, our approach only requires native virion particles, without the need of genetic manipulation. Therefore it can be easily transferred to structurally characterize other giant viruses (e.g., Marseilleviridae and NCLDV members) and other emerging pathogens, offering a powerful platform for high-throughput characterization of understudied biological systems.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Propagation of melbournevirus in <italic>Acanthamoeba castellanii</italic></title><p id="P38">Purified melbournevirus was produced as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.
