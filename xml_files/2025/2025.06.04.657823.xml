Here, we investigated the role of Notch3 signaling in pericyte phenotype and functions in colorectal cancer (CRC). Using lineage tracing approaches, we showed that tumor pericytes originate from normal tissue-resident pericytes, which proliferate inside tumors. In vivo genetic manipulation revealed that Notch3 pathway activation promotes pericyte proliferation, while suppressing contractile protein expression, and leads to increased endothelial cell proliferation. In contrast, Notch3 deletion leads to reduced endothelial proliferation and a significant decrease in. This effect is associated with a shift toward a contractile phenotype. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis uncovered significant pericyte heterogeneity in both mouse colitis-associated cancer and human CRC. It specifically identified functionally distinct subpopulations characterized by differential Notch3 activity, which supported our in vivo and in vitro findings. Our results establish Notch3 as a key regulator of pericyte phenotypic plasticity in CRC and suggest that targeting this pathway could represent a promising strategy for improving therapeutic outcomes through vascular normalization.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health burden, ranking as the third most diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). This highlights the need for novel therapeutic approaches based on deeper understanding of CRC biology. Recent research has uncovered the crucial role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in CRC progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The TME consists of diverse cell populations, including fibroblasts, immune cells, endothelial cells, and pericytes, which collectively influence tumor behavior through complex intercellular communications and extracellular matrix remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Pericytes are specialized perivascular cells embedded within the basement membrane of microvessels, where they establish direct physical contact with endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). In physiological conditions, pericytes play essential roles in vascular development, stabilization, and maturation by regulating endothelial cell proliferation, vessel diameter, and basement membrane deposition. The recruitment and differentiation of pericytes along nascent vessels are tightly regulated by several signaling pathways, such as PDGF-B, TGFβ, and angiopoietin. Disruption of these pathways leads to pericyte deficiency, vascular instability, and subsequent pathologies, emphasizing the importance of proper pericyte function in vascular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). In cancer, pericytes undergo significant alterations in their phenotype, distribution, and functionality, contributing to tumor angiogenesis by regulating vascular integrity, permeability, and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Tumor vessels typically exhibit abnormal pericyte coverage characterized by loose attachment to endothelial cells, cytoplasmic processes extending into the tumor parenchyma, and altered expression of marker proteins. These abnormalities contribute to vessel leakiness, increased interstitial fluid pressure, and hypoxia, ultimately promoting tumor progression and limiting drug delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). In addition, pericyte phenotype switching in tumors has emerged as an important process influencing cancer progression. Upon exposure to tumor-derived factors, pericytes may acquire a more proliferative state, transdifferentiate into fibroblast-like cells, or adopt contractile properties resembling smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The molecular mechanisms governing these phenotypic transitions remain incompletely understood, particularly in the context of CRC. Furthermore, the precise origin of tumor pericytes in CRC has been a subject of debate, with potential sources including resident pericytes, recruited bone marrow-derived pericyte precursors or transdifferentiation from other stromal cell types, mainly endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Understanding these processes is crucial for developing strategies to normalize the tumor vasculature and improve therapeutic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The Notch signaling pathway represents a highly conserved cell-cell communication mechanism involved in various aspects of development, tissue homeostasis, and disease, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). In mammals, the pathway consists of four transmembrane receptors (Notch1-4) and five ligands (Jagged1-2, Delta-like 1, 3, and 4). Activation of Notch receptors through interaction with ligands on adjacent cells triggers a series of proteolytic cleavages, resulting in the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The NICD subsequently translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional complex with the DNA-binding protein RBPJ and co-activators to regulate target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Among Notch receptors, Notch3 has gained particular attention for its role in vascular development and homeostasis. Notch3 is predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) and pericytes, where it regulates cell differentiation, maturation, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>NOTCH3</italic> gene cause cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a hereditary stroke disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). In mice, deletion of Notch3 leads to abnormal maturation of vSMCs and reduced mural cell recruitment and maturation in the retinal vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). These findings highlight the importance of Notch3 signaling in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the vasculature. In cancer, Notch3 signaling exhibits context-dependent effects, functioning either as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor depending on the tissue type and cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Several studies have reported Notch3 overexpression in various malignancies, including ovarian, breast, and lung cancers, where it promotes tumor cell proliferation, survival, and stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). In colorectal cancer, elevated Notch3 expression correlates with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Notch3 upregulation specifically in cancer cells results in increased tumour growth, while its inhibition leads to reduced proliferation and invasiveness both in xenografts and a mouse model of CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). However, the specific role of Notch3 in regulating pericyte behavior within the CRC microenvironment remains largely unexplored, representing a significant knowledge gap in the field.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing, lineage tracing, and functional assays to investigate the role of pericytes in CRC development using the AOM/DSS colitis-associated cancer model. We identified a significant enrichment of pericytes in the tumor microenvironment compared to normal colon tissue and showed that Notch3 signaling plays an important role in regulating pericyte proliferation, phenotype, and interaction with endothelial cells. Our findings provide novel insights into the contribution of pericytes to CRC progression and suggest that targeting Notch3 signaling in pericytes may represent a promising therapeutic approach for advanced colorectal cancer.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Single cell analysis reveals enrichment of pericytes in the microenvironment of colorectal cancer</title><p id="P6">In the AOM/DSS model of colitis-associated cancer (CAC) model, carcinogenesis is initiated by a single injection of azoxymethane (AOM), which induces random mutations. This process is further enhanced by cycles of inflammation and regeneration triggered by cyclic administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water. The resulting tumors are predominantly adenomas located in the middle and distal colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Having previously used genetic models to delineate the role of fibroblast-specific pathways in this process, we employed here a high-throughput single-cell approach to analyze the stromal component of these tumors. To this end, we isolated non-epithelial, non-immune (EpCAM-CD45-) cells from AOM/DSS colonic adenomas (tumors from 11 male and female mice) and normal healthy colon tissue (pooled from one male and one female mouse).</p><p id="P7">Isolated stromal cells were used for library preparation on the 10x Genomics platform and subsequent single cell RNA sequencing. After excluding glial cells (<italic>Gfap+S100b</italic>+) and interstitial cells of Cajal (<italic>Kit</italic>+<italic>Ano1</italic>+), and any remaining immune (<italic>Ptprc</italic>+) and epithelial/cancer (<italic>Epcam</italic>+) cells, we integrated the data across the two conditions using Harmony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). 12.692 (normal: 6.018, AOM/DSS: 6.674) stromal cells were included in the subsequent bioinformatic analysis, after quality control and doublet exclusion. Clustering and UMAP visualization revealed 6 broad clusters, which correspond to known cell types, including blood and lymphatic endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), fibroblasts, and a distinct proliferating stromal cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-C</xref> and Supplementary Data 1).</p><p id="P8">Blood endothelial cells could be further subdivided in capillary (<italic>Rgcc</italic>+ CapECs), venous (<italic>Ackr1</italic>+ VenECs), and arterial (<italic>Sema3g</italic>+ ArtECs) endothelial cells, consistent to previous studies (Supplementary Figure 1A-C and Supplementary Data 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Similarly, fibroblasts were subdivided into three main clusters: PDGFRα<sup>hi</sup> subepithelial myofibroblasts (SEMFs), PDGFRα<sup>lo</sup>CD81- fibroblasts and PDGFRα<sup>lo</sup>CD81+ trophocytes (Supplementary Figure 2A-D and Supplementary Data 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Notably, all identified clusters contained cells from both normal tissue and tumors, albeit at different proportions. Tumor samples showed increased numbers of blood endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells, with a corresponding decrease in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). This observation was further verified by FACS analysis, which confirmed an increase in MCAM+αSMA+ pericytes and αSMA<sup>hi</sup> SMCs, along with a decrease in PDGFRα+ fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-F</xref>). An increase in MCAM+αSMA+ cells in the AOM/DSS model has also been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). In addition, tumor samples had more proliferating stromal cells, primarily consisting of endothelial cells and pericytes in line with their observed increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). Single-cell transcriptomic data integration of human CRC stromal cells from four published studies showed similar changes in stromal cell proportions, and in particular the significant increase in pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H-K</xref>, Supplementary Figure 3, and Supplementary Data 1). These findings show that intestinal carcinogenesis is accompanied by a significant increase in cancer-associated pericytes in both mice and humans.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Lineage tracing confirms pericyte expansion in colitis-associated cancer</title><p id="P10">Given the increased abundance of cancer-associated pericytes and the presence of proliferating pericytes, we next investigated whether normal pericytes are a source of tumor pericytes and whether they proliferate within tumors. To address these questions, we utilized the PDGFRβ-CreERT2 mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) in combination with the mTmG reporter strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) and performed lineage tracing analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Tamoxifen was administered for five consecutive days prior to the initiation of the AOM/DSS protocol. At the end of the protocol, we analyzed both normal colon tissue and tumors by flow cytometry and confocal imaging. Our analysis revealed a significant approximately 3-fold increase in labeled PDGFRβ+MCAM+ pericytes within tumors compared to the normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-D</xref>). However, we noted that the PDGFRβ-CreERT2 strain also targets intestinal fibroblasts, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To overcome this limitation, we identified Notch3 as a more specific marker of both normal and tumor pericytes and confirmed its cell-specific expression in AOM/DSS tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E-F</xref>). Subsequently, we employed the Notch3-CreERT2 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) in combination with mTmG mice and performed lineage tracing using the same protocol described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). The Notch3-CreERT2 mice specifically targeted MCAM+ pericytes in the normal colon. These labeled pericytes showed a significant increase in AOM/DSS tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H-J</xref>). Immunostaining for Ki67 revealed proliferating GFP+ perivascular cells in AOM/DSS tumors in both PDGFRβ-CreERT2;mTmG and Notch3-CreERT2;mTmG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2K</xref>). These results demonstrate that pericytes proliferate and increase in numbers during colitis-associated carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Notch3 signaling regulates pericyte proliferation and blood vessel properties in the intestinal TME</title><p id="P12">In addition to identifying Notch3’s restricted expression in pericytes, we next investigated if it also had a functional role. We initially performed cell-to-cell interaction analysis using CellChat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), which revealed that pericytes are a major target (incoming signal strength) and source (outgoing signal strength) of the Notch pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The Notch pathway was particularly active in the interactions in-between pericytes (autocrine signaling) and between pericytes and endothelial cells (paracrine signaling) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Among the different ligand-receptor pairs in the TME, the Jag1-Notch3 and Dll4-Notch3 pairs contribute significantly to this enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Notch3 was expressed in tumor pericytes and accepted signals from pericytes (<italic>Jag1</italic>) and blood endothelial cells (<italic>Jag1, Dll4</italic>), including proliferating endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-F</xref>). Notably, the downstream Notch3 target Heyl was also restrictively expressed in pericytes, further supporting the cell-specific activation of the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). These findings support the activation of Notch3 signaling and its potential regulation of pericyte function within the intestinal TME.</p><p id="P13">To investigate the pathophysiological role of Notch3 in intestinal tumors, we utilized a mouse strain that enables the inducible expression of the intracellular domain of Notch3 upon Cre-mediated recombination, leading to the cell-specific activation of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). We crossed these mice with the PDGFRβ-CreERT2 strain and confirmed increased Notch3 expression in isolated stromal cells following tamoxifen administration (Notch3ICD or N3ICD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> and Supplementary Figure 4). We then applied the AOM/DSS protocol to these mice and their littermate controls, all of which received five consecutive tamoxifen injections one week before the initiation of colitis-associated carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). While mice did not display statistically significant differences in tumor multiplicity or size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-C</xref>), tissue staining with antibodies against Ki67 and αSMA, revealed increased proliferation of GFP+ cells and reduced expression of αSMA expression around blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-E</xref>). These results suggest that Notch3 plays a role in balancing proliferation and activation of pericytes. To verify the effect of Notch3 pathway activation on pericyte properties, we utilized the Rosa26-CreERT2 mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), which we crossed with N3ICD mice. We FACS-sorted EpCAM-CD45-MCAM+ cells from these mice and incubated them with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) to induce Notch3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). Cells from Rosa26-CreERT2;mTmG mice were used to confirm the efficiency of this method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). MTT assay measurements demonstrated increased proliferation in cells with activated Notch3 signaling, while other growth factors, including TGFβ and PDGF, did not have a pro-proliferative effect either alone or in the presence of Notch3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). Therefore, our results show that Notch3 signaling promotes pericyte proliferation in vitro and vivo.</p><p id="P14">Notably, we also observed increased CD31+ cell proliferation as a consequence of Notch3 activation in PDGFRβ+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-E</xref>). However, despite the parallel increased proliferation of both cell types, pericyte coverage, expressed as the ratio of % GFP+ to CD31+ cells around blood vessels, was reduced in PDGFRβ-N3ICD tumors in comparison to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-E</xref>). These results suggest that increased pericyte proliferation downstream of Notch3 activation is associated with increased endothelial cell proliferation and reduced pericyte coverage, which is indicative of disrupted vessel integrity inside CAC tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Notch3 deletion results in pericyte phenotype changes hindering cancer progression</title><p id="P15">To better understand the pathophysiological significance of pericyte-specific Notch3 signaling in intestinal carcinogenesis, we also utilized Notch3 deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). After applying the AOM/DSS protocol of CAC, we observed no difference in tumor multiplicity and size compared to controls, similar to our observation with Notch3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>). However, using similar staining to our previous experiments, we found that Notch3 deletion led to decreased proliferation of CD31+ endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-D</xref>). αSMA staining around blood vessels was similar between experimental and control mice, suggesting that Notch3 activation may be sufficient but not necessary for pericyte activation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-D</xref>). Accordingly, pericyte coverage, was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Since the AOM/DSS model primarily results in adenomas and the integrity of blood vessels in tumors plays a crucial role in metastasis, we also investigated whether Notch3 deletion could influence later stages of tumor progression. For this purpose, we utilized an orthotopic transplantation model in which AKP organoids − bearing deletion of <italic>Apc, Tp53</italic>, along with an activating mutation in <italic>Kras</italic> − were injected into the mouse rectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Six weeks after transplantation, all wildtype control mice had developed tumors ranging in size from 12 to 96 mm<sup>3</sup>. However, tumors were either absent or significantly smaller in the Notch3-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Stainings revealed fewer and smaller blood vessels in Notch3-KO tumors compared to control tumors, albeit the small number and size of tumors did not allow for image analysis and quantifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). These findings indicate that Notch3 signaling plays a crucial role in advanced stages of colorectal cancer progression.</p><p id="P17">To further investigate the opposite functions of Notch3 deletion and activation, we performed in vitro experiments, similar to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f-h</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). To overcome the challenge of low MCAM+ cell yield, we used total stromal cells isolated from Notch3 knockout mice (N3KO), Rosa-CreERT2;N3ICD (N3ICD) mice, and controls (C, WT or N3ICDf/f). We confirmed increased expression of the intracellular domain of Notch3 in N3ICD cells, and the concomitant increase in the Notch3-target gene <italic>Heyl</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>). Notch3 expression was reduced in Notch3 knockout cells, although the difference was not statistically significantly, possibly due to the relatively low number of Notch3-expressing pericytes in the control cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>). However, <italic>Acta2</italic> was increased in the absence of <italic>Notch3</italic>, suggesting a negative association, which aligns with our previous in vivo observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-E</xref>). Notch3 activation also led to an increase − albeit not statistically significant - in cell proliferation, as assessed by crystal violet staining, and reduced wound closure ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J-K</xref>). These results suggest that Notch3 activation may promote pericyte proliferation while limiting their contractile activation.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Cancer-associated pericyte phenotypic states are regulated by Notch3 signaling</title><p id="P18">Considering the in vivo effects of Notch3 activation/deletion on pericyte properties, we investigated in detail the heterogeneity of cancer-associated pericytes in our dataset. We performed subclustering of 1008 pericytes (mainly originating from the AOM/DSS sample − 1000/1008 cells) and analyzed the transcriptomic profiles of 4 subsets, which differed in the expression level of genes associated with ECM production and remodeling, myogenic features, inflammatory activation, and endothelial traits. The two largest subsets exhibited classic markers of pericytes (e.g. <italic>Notch3, Pdgfrb, and Ndufa4l2</italic>), but different levels of <italic>Rgs5</italic> and ECM-related molecules (<italic>Col3a1, Vtn, Mmp11</italic>), and myogenic-related genes (<italic>Acta2, Myh11, Tagln</italic>). As such, we designated them ecmPCs and myPCs, respectively. A smaller cluster expressed genes related to inflammatory activation (<italic>Mmp10, Saa3, Cxcl1, Il6</italic>), and we labeled it iPCs. Finally, there was a distinct cluster expressing endothelial cell markers, such as <italic>Pecam1, Plvap, Cdh5</italic>, and <italic>Kdr</italic>, which indicates endothelial to mesenchymal transition, as previously described (endoPCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-B</xref> and Supplementary Data 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). The presence of these subsets was also verified by FACS analysis in both normal and tumor samples, although iPCs were not detectable in the normal colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C-D</xref>). The relative abundance of the other three subsets was not statistically significantly different between the normal colon and AOM/DSS induced adenomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Examining the expression of <italic>Notch3</italic>, the Notch target gene <italic>Heyl</italic>, and proliferation markers <italic>Top2a</italic>, and <italic>Pcna</italic>, we found that ecmPCs were enriched in <italic>Heyl</italic>, which was absent in myPCs. Proliferation markers were also increased in ecmPCs, in agreement with our vivo and in vitro data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Trajectory analysis using monocle 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) showed a possible transition from ecmPCs to myPCs, which correlated with decreased <italic>Heyl</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F-G</xref>). These results suggest that pericytes can be found in distinct phenotypic states that are regulated by Notch3 signaling, instructed by direct cell-to-cell contact with other pericytes or Notch3-ligand expressing endothelial cells, and, therefore, influenced by cell topology. Among endothelial subsets, capillary endothelial cells are the main cellular source of both Jag1 and Dll4 ligands in the TME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H-I</xref>).</p><p id="P20">We next validated these results in our combined human colorectal cancer dataset through subclustering of pericytes. We observed the presence of myPCs, and two clusters of ecmPCs, one enriched in tumors (T) and the other in the normal tissue (N). Interestingly, an intermediate cluster between myPCs and tumor ecmPCs was also evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A-D</xref> and Supplementary Data 1). We also detected a small cluster of proliferating PCs (prolifPCs) in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A-D</xref>). Inflammatory pericytes, although present, did not form a distinct subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). It should be noted that endoPCs were clustered together with blood endothelial cells and as such they were not included in the subclustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). Trajectory analysis using monocle 3 showed the potential of normal ecmPCs as a source of both tumor ecmPCs and myPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7G</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>HEYL</italic> was preferentially expressed in tumor ecmPCs, intPCs, and prolifPCs, consistent with our mouse data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C, H</xref>). In conclusion, our analysis supports a model where Notch3 activation in response to microenvironmental cues, drives pericyte proliferation, a shift to synthetic ecmPC state, and subsequent endothelial proliferation. Conversely, Notch3 deletion, associated with contractile myPCs, leads to reduced endothelial cell proliferation, and potential vascular normalization, hindering cancer progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7I</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">Our study provides several novel insights into the role of pericytes in CRC. These cells, often referred to as cancer-associated pericytes (CAPs) or vascular CAFs (vCAFs) have received considerably less attention in comparison to other TME components, despite their crucial functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). First, we showed that pericytes are enriched in the AOM/DSS tumor microenvironment and actively proliferate within tumors, contributing to the altered stromal composition. This observation was confirmed in published human CRC datasets, highlighting the consistency of our results across species and the relevance to human CRC. Previous reports have suggested significant contributions from bone marrow-derived cells to the pericyte pool in pancreatic and brain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Given that bone marrow cells do not contribute to the AOM/DSS stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), normal resident pericytes seem to be the primary source of tumor pericytes. In addition, despite previous reports suggesting the presence of resident pericyte progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), we did not identify a specialized pericyte subset with a progenitor expression profile. However, we did detect pericytes with endothelial characteristics, indicative of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Nevertheless, their equal contribution to both the normal tissue and tumor microenvironment along with their distinct signature points towards their proliferation rather than complete transdifferentiation. The different cellular sources reported for tumor pericytes underline the context-dependent nature of tumor pericyte recruitment across different cancer types and experimental models. The identification of resident pericytes as a primary source of tumor pericytes in CRC suggests that interventions targeting pericyte function rather than recruitment might be more effective in this context.</p><p id="P22">Second, we identify Notch3 as a key regulator of pericyte function in CRC, influencing their proliferation, activation, and interaction with endothelial cells. This pro-proliferative effect of Notch3 signaling in pericytes is consistent with its role in vascular smooth muscle cells, where Notch3 activation has been shown to enhance proliferation and inhibit apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Accordingly, in vitro activation of Notch3 signaling inhibited vSMC migration and led to downregulation of contractile gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). The dual role of Notch3 in promoting pericyte proliferation while limiting their contractile activation has important implications for tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Reduced pericyte coverage and activation around tumor vessels can lead to increased vascular permeability, impaired blood flow, and enhanced tumor cell intravasation, facilitating metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Our finding that Notch3 deletion impairs tumor growth in an orthotopic model of advanced CRC suggests that inhibiting Notch3 signaling may be beneficial in treating advanced stages of the disease by normalizing the tumor vasculature and limiting metastatic spread.</p><p id="P23">Third, we reveal the heterogeneity of CRC-associated pericytes and show that Notch3 signaling may regulate transitions between different pericyte phenotypes or states. The identification of distinct pericyte subpopulations with different functional properties in both mouse and human CRC tumors highlights the complexity of the tumor microenvironment. These findings are consistent with emerging evidence for pericyte heterogeneity in both normal tissues and pathological conditions, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Notably, the identified pericyte subpopulations exhibited differential expression of Notch pathway components and target genes, suggesting that Notch3 signaling may influence pericyte heterogeneity and plasticity in the tumor microenvironment. We specifically identified a pericyte subpopulation with high Notch3 activity and low expression of contractile proteins, and a contractile subpopulation with low Notch3 activity and high expression of αSMA and other contractile markers. This observation supports our functional studies demonstrating Notch3-mediated regulation of pericyte proliferation and contractility and suggests that these phenotypic states represent distinct positions along a continuum of pericyte differentiation. This result also fits into the concept of phenotype switching, a process characterized by pericyte transition between different states, such as from a quiescent, contractile phenotype that stabilizes blood vessels to a more plastic, proliferative, or angiogenic state associated with tissue remodeling, disease progression, or metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Indeed, chemical inhibition of Notch using a γ-secretase inhibitor was previously shown to drive the generation of a more contractile and quiescent pericyte phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The regulation of these phenotypic states by Notch3 signaling provides a potential mechanism for therapeutic intervention, targeting specific pericyte subpopulations to modulate the tumor microenvironment.</p><p id="P24">Finally, we demonstrate that targeting Notch3 signaling in pericytes can impair tumor growth in advanced CRC models, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach. Traditional anti-angiogenic therapies focusing on VEGF/VEGFR signaling have shown limited efficacy in CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>), highlighting the need for alternative approaches. Targeting the Notch3 pathway represents a novel strategy that could complement existing anti-angiogenic therapies by promoting vessel normalization. Based on our results, inhibition of Notch3 signaling in pericytes would be expected to reduce pericyte proliferation and enhance their contractile phenotype, potentially leading to improved vessel stability and reduced leakiness. This normalization effect could enhance drug delivery to tumors and reduce hypoxia-driven tumor aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). A similar effect was recently shown with the use of MEK, PI3K, or general Notch inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Furthermore, normalized vasculature may facilitate immune cell infiltration, potentially enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapies, which have shown limited success in CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Conversely, targeting a specific Notch ligand in contrast to general Notch inhibition may also lead to reduced potential side-effects.</p><p id="P25">In conclusion, our study shows that pericytes are enriched in the CRC microenvironment and that Notch3 signaling plays an important role in regulating their proliferation, activation, and interaction with endothelial cells. The heterogeneity of tumor-associated pericytes and their regulation by Notch3 signaling provide novel insights into the complexity and plasticity of the tumor microenvironment. Targeting Notch3 signaling in pericytes to modulate pericyte phenotype may represent a promising therapeutic approach for advanced colorectal cancer and other malignancies.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Animals</title><p id="P26">PDGFRβ-CreERT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), Notch3-/- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), and Rosa26-CreERT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) were purchased by Jackson Laboratories.

We computed signatures by using Ucell (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/carmonalab/UCell">https://github.com/carmonalab/UCell</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Statistics</title><p id="P48">Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10 software. Differences between two groups were analyzed using Student’s t-test. For multiple group comparisons, one-way ANOVA test was used. Welch’s correction was used for samples that showed unequal variance. Differences were considered statistically significant at p ≤ 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S30"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank Sofia Grammenoudi for assistance in FACS sorting experiments.
