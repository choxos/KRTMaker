They are used to treat metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer, but resistance is common, and this has been associated with TP53 loss and senescence evasion. We show here that enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells that evade senescence mis-segregate chromosomes due to defective chromosomal alignment and a weakened mitotic checkpoint, leading to aneuploidy and DNA damage. The chromosome alignment errors are associated with impaired Sgo1 localisation to centromeres and defective sister chromatin cohesion during mitosis. Importantly, all these mitotic defects can be rescued by constraining cell size during the CDK4/6i-treatment, and specifically restoring cohesion rescues the chromosome segregation errors. Together, this demonstrates mechanistically how cell enlargement drives genetic and karyotypic change in cells that re-enter the cell cycle following CDK4/6 inhibition. This could help fuel the rapid emergence of chemotherapy-resistant clones, especially in p53-null cells that evade senescence to drive drug-resistance in patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) are game-changing drugs that have revolutionised breast cancer treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. They arrest the cell cycle in G1 by preventing retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation to inhibit E2F transcription factors and suppress S-phase entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. During this G1 arrest, oncogenic signals in cancer cells activate mTOR to induce constitutive cell growth in the absence of proliferation, leading to cellular enlargement and permanent cell cycle exit into senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. This processes has been termed geroconversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and it is associated with a range of cellular stresses that promote senescence entry. Cellular enlargement in the absence of DNA replication induces a starvation-like remodelling of the proteome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, leading to cytoplasmic dilution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, osmotic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and p38/p53/p21-dependent senescence from G1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. These enlarged cells have a weakened DNA damage response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and if they fail to enter senescence from G1 they re-enter the cell cycle when the drug is removed and experience replication stress and further p21 induction during G2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Similar effects were observed following inhibition of CDK2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> or CDK7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, which also arrest the cell cycle in G1, implying that geroconversion into senescence is a common outcome following a prolonged G1 arrest.</p><p id="P3">A major unresolved issue concerns the fate of cells that manage to evade senescence following CDK4/6i treatment. This occurs frequently in p53 deficient cells because these cells cannot induce p21 in response to the stresses that result from cell enlargement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. A high proportion of enlarged p53-deficient cells then re-enter the cell cycle and reach mitosis, were they experience chromosome segregation errors, leading to gross nuclear abnormalities and further DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. These damaged cells are also able to continue proliferating, due to p53-loss and defective DDR signalling, which we hypothesise drives genetic and chromosomal instability (CIN) and the rapid emergence of drug-resistant clones. In support, various clinical studies have shown that TP53 is rarely mutated in patients that respond well to CDK4/6i-treatment, but it is frequently mutated in cases of intrinsic or acquired resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a very recent clinical study by Kudo et al links CDK4/6i-resistance to a lack of p21 induction in TP53-null cells, which prevents geroconversion into senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. It is therefore crucial to understand why enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells that evade senescence missegregate chromosomes because the resulting CIN is likely to fuel the acquisition of drug-resistant karyotypes and genotypes.</p><p id="P4">We show here that enlarged cells that fail to enter senescence following CDK4/6i-treatment have defective centromeric cohesion and a weakened mitotic checkpoint, which combine to cause chromosome segregation errors. These defects result from the increased cell size which weakens the mitotic checkpoint and redistributes Sgo1 away from centromeres, leading to premature loss of cohesion. Together, this reveals how increases in cell size can dysregulate key mitotic processes to drive aneuploidy and genomic damage, with important implications for the evolution of CDK4/6i-resisitance in breast cancer.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Cellular enlargement induces chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidy</title><p id="P5">CDK4/6i-treatment increases cell size and causes severe chromosome segregation errors when enlarged cells reach mitosis after drug removal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The increased cell size causes the mitotic errors because these are abolished by restricting overgrowth using direct or indirect mTOR inhibition during the cell cycle arrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. To study mechanistically why cell enlargement causes mitotic defects we compared cells that had been arrested with palbociclib (hereafter CDK4/6i) for different lengths of time in the presence or absence of PF-05212384 (hereafter mTORi) which prevents cell overgrowth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1A</xref>). We analysed non-transformed RPE1 cells and the HR+/HER2- breast cancer line, MCF7, which both arrest efficiently and overgrow extensively in G1 following CDK4/6i-treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. All drugs were then washed out and the cells analysed as they progressed through the first mitosis (Fig.1A).</p><p id="P6">Live cell imaging demonstrated that enlarged RPE1 and MCF7 cells that recover from a prolonged G1 arrest experience significant delays in the first mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). A lower proportion of enlarged RPE1 cells reach mitosis after drug washout, which is known to be due to earlier entry into senescence from G1 or G2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. This can be bypassed by knockout of p53, which allows the RPE1 cells to synchronously enter mitosis similarly to MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). We next sought to characterise the mitotic defects in these enlarged cells that evade senescence following CDK4/6i treatment. Immunofluorescence imaging demonstrated that the mitotic delays are associated with chromosome alignment errors and an inability to attach chromosomes to microtubules via the kinetochore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref>). However, these cells still exited mitosis prematurely with misalignments, leading to lagging chromosomes and anaphase bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-F</xref>). All these mitotic defects are size-dependent because they are rescued by inhibiting mTOR during the G1 arrest to prevent cell enlargement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs.1B-F</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). This shows that a prolonged G1 arrest causes later defects in chromosome segregation during mitosis. These defects do not result for the prolonged G1 arrest <italic>per se</italic>, but rather they result from continue cell growth that occurs during that arrest.</p><p id="P7">This has important clinical implications because cells that manage to evade senescence following CDK4/6i-treatment, for example p53-deficient cells, could use their enlarged size to become chromosomally unstable. To test this hypothesis, we perform single cell sequencing on RPE1-p53KO cells 72h after release from 1 or 7 days CDK4/6i-treatment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1G</xref> and H shows that prolonged CDK4/6i treatment leads to increased aneuploidy and heterogeneity 72h after drug washout. This is rescued by combined inhibition of CDK4/6 and mTOR, implying these chromosomal changes are driven by cell enlargement during the G1 arrest. Increased heterogeneity following cell enlargement was also observed in the aneuploid breast cancer line MCF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p><p id="P8">In summary, increased cell size causes delays in kinetochore-microtubule attachment and chromosome alignment, however, cells are unable to wait to correct those attachment errors before progressing into anaphase, leading to chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidy.</p><p id="P9">The mitotic checkpoint, also known as the spindle assembly checkpoint or SAC, is supposed to delay anaphase in the presence of unattached kinetochores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> therefore we hypothesised that the SAC may also be weakened in large cells. In support, the duration of mitotic arrest in the presence of either STLC or nocodazole – drugs that prevent kinetochore-microtubule attachment to activate the SAC – was shortened specifically in enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). The SAC produces the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which inhibits the anaphase promote complexes/cyclosome (APC/C) to restrict Cyclin B degradation and prevent mitotic exit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Live cell imaging with an endogenous Cyclin B1-EYFP RPE1 cell line confirmed that enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells degraded Cyclin B more rapidly during a STLC-induced arrest, consistent with SAC weakening in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">In summary, cell enlargement following CDK4/6i-treatment causes delays in kinetochore-microtubule attachment and a weakened mitotic checkpoint, leading to enlarged cells exiting mitosis with chromosome segregation errors. Enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells also experience earlier replication stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, which could potentially affect mitotic fidelity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. However, supplementation with excess nucleosides can rescue the replication stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and increase the percentage of cells entering mitosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>), but this is unable to limit the mitotic delays or SAC weakening (S3B-C). We conclude therefore, that cell size has more direct effects on mitotic fidelity. We next set out to characterise these defects.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Mechanism of SAC weakening in enlarged cells</title><p id="P11">The strength of the SAC is determined by relative levels of MCC and APC/C. MCC is produced at unattached kinetochore before being release into the cytoplasm to rapidly inhibit APC/C-CDC20 molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. We reasoned that the SAC could be weakened in large cells by changes to the relative levels of MCC or APC/C components. Alternatively, if the concentration of MCC and APC/C components remain unchanged, then effective APC/C inhibition may still be compromised because the same number of kinetochores catalyse MCC production, but these inhibitory complexes must then diffuse throughout a larger cytoplasmic volume to inhibit more APC/C molecules.</p><p id="P12">We therefore assessed the effects of cell size (1-7d CDK4/6i -/+ mTORi) on the levels of MCC and APC components during the G1 arrest or during the subsequent G2/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Protein concentrations were normalised in all conditions prior to western blotting so as to provide an estimate of relative changes to cellular concentrations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref> shows that the MCC components MAD2, BUBR1, BUB3 and CDC20 are all enriched in G2/M-arrested MCF7 cells, as expected. However, we observed no clear size-dependent changes to their concentrations under any conditions. Furthermore, the levels of 4 different APC-C subunits were also broadly unaltered by cell cycle stage or cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-E</xref>). Similar results were observed in RPE1-p53 KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>), which also displayed considerable size-dependent SAC weakening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). We conclude that cell size does not weaken the SAC by altering the relative concentration of MCC or APC/C subunits. Even though the cytoplasmic levels of MCC components remain unchanged, their recruitment to kinetochores could be perturbed to affect MCC assembly. However, we observed no striking size-dependent changes in the kinetochore levels of MAD1, MAD2, BUBR1 or CDC20 in either nocodazole or STLC-arrested mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F-G</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In summary, the level of MCC production at kinetochores is unlikely to be affected by increased cell size. However, the MCC complexes that are produced by kinetochores in large cells must then inhibit more APC/C molecules in a larger cytoplasmic volume, which we predict contributes to SAC weakening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). This is analogous to mechanism proposed for SAC weakening in the early embryonic divisions of large C-elegans embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Mechanism of kinetochore-microtubule attachment defects in enlarged cells</title><p id="P14">Sister kinetochores are held together by cohesin, which resists the pulling forces exerted by bipolar microtubule attachments. To check for defects in this process in enlarged cells, we measured inter-kinetochore distances on chromosomes that had aligned to the metaphase plate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref> shows that inter-kinetochore distances were significantly increased in enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells, suggesting effective microtubule attachment but impaired sister chromatid cohesion. Cohesion is gradually lost from aligned kinetochores under tension due to a process known as cohesion fatigue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. However, the reduced cohesion was not due to the mitotic delays in enlarged cells because inter-kinetochore distances were also increased 30 min after release from R03306 to synchronise mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Sister chromatid cohesion is established during DNA replication and maintained thereafter by sororin which antagonises the action of the cohesin-release factor WAPL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Chromatin-bound sororin, which can be used as a marker for cohesive cohesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, was specifically elevated following DNA replication, as expected, but this was unaltered in enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Considering we observed no obvious defect in cohesin establishment in enlarged cells, we hypothesised that cohesin may instead be prematurely removed by WAPL during mitosis. In agreement, WAPL knockdown specifically rescued inter-kinetochore distances in enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). This was also sufficient to completely rescue the mitotic delays and partially rescue the chromosome alignment defects and segregation errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4D-G</xref>). Therefore, WAPL-mediated release of cohesin causes mitotic delays, kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors and chromosome missegregations in enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells.</p><p id="P16">In human cells, WAPL is known to remove cohesin from chromosomes during early mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> when its antagonist sororin is displaced from cohesin by mitotic kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Importantly, centromeric cohesion is preserved by shugoshin (Sgo1) which competes with WAPL for cohesin-binding and recruits PP2A to prevent sororin phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Together, this maintains cohesion at centromeres, where it is needed to resist pulling forces exerted by kinetochore-microtubules. Immunofluorescence imaging of nocodazole-arrested cells showed that Sgo1 localisation was defective in enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells. Total levels of Sgo1 at the centromere/kinetochore were largely unaffected by cell size, but Sgo1 was relocalised to kinetochore proximal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Sgo1 binds directly to cohesin, therefore Sgo1 relocalisation could be a cause and/or consequence of cohesin loss from centromeres. To investigate this further, we recovered Sgo1 at centromeres by fusing to CenpB (CB-Sgo1), which was sufficient to also rescue cohesion in enlarged cells, as judged by a reduction in inter-kinetochore distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6</xref>). Similarly, rescuing cohesion by WAPL depletion also recovered Sgo1 localisation to centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Therefore, the ability of Sgo1 to antagonise WAPL and protect cohesion at centromeres is impaired in enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells. This causes premature loss of cohesion and chromosome segregation errors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">This work reveals how increases to cell size following CDK4/6i treatment can have deleterious effects on the segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. Enlarged cells have a weakened mitotic checkpoint response, most likely because the same number of kinetochores must catalyse more MCC to inhibit the additional APC/C molecules present within a larger cytoplasmic volume. When all kinetochores are signalling, cells can delay anaphase for a few hours, but when just a few unattached kinetochores remain, these are most likely insufficient to halt mitotic progression. This is particularly problematic for large cells because Sgo1 is also delocalised from centromeres causing weakened sister chromatid cohesion and kinetochore-microtubule attachment delays. The inability to wait to properly attach those kinetochores leads to chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidy in enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells.</p><p id="P18">This has important implications for the emergence of CDK4/6i resistance in advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients. In this setting, p53 mutations are some of the most common genetic alterations associated with acquired and intrinsic resistance, and this was recently linked to the inability of p53 deficient cells to enter senescence following CDK4/6i-treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We hypothesise that p53-deficient cells that evade senescence can use their enlarged size to induce chromosome segregation errors before selecting for karyotypes and/or genotypes that offer proliferative advantages. In this model, oncogenic mutations, which are also frequently associated with resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, are predicted to drive chromosome missegregations by increasing cell size during the CDK4/6i arrest. Furthermore, preventing increases to cell size by inhibiting signalling to mTOR should limit resistance by rescuing chromosome segregation errors, as we observe following mTORi in MCF7 and RPE1 cells. This could help to explain why the PI3K inhibitor inavolisib delays the onset of resistance in PIK3CA-mutated breast cancer patients treated with palbociclib and fulvestrant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. It will be important in future to address whether increases to cell size are observed in patient tumours, and if so, whether these enlarged cells renter the cell cycle to cause chromosome segregation errors during the frequent CDK4/6i holiday periods. If they do, then the molecular basis for these mitotic errors could perhaps be targeted to limit drug-resistance.</p><p id="P19">The work we have presented on CDK4/6i could be widely relevant for other anti-cancer treatments that also increase cell size. For example, a growing body of evidence indicates that chemotherapeutics that damage DNA to indirectly arrest the cell cycle also induce cell overgrowth during this arrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Therefore, enlarged cells that evade therapy-induced senescence in these contexts, or even cells that enter senescence but then later escape, could be similarly primed to experience chromosome segregation and aneuploidy because of their increased size. This may help to explain why cells that escape from therapy-induced senescence can drive such aggressive tumourigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">Finally, our work could also be relevant in physiological contexts in the body when cells become enlarged. One good example is during aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) where increased cell size contributes to decreased replicative potential and functional decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Aneuploidy also impairs HSC fitness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, therefore increased cell size could contribute to functional decline of aged HSC by inducing aneuploidy. If increased size causes permanent genetic changes during the aging process, this might also explain why rapamycin is able to prevent the functional decline of aged HSCs and increase longevity in mice, but still be unable to restore HSC function once cells have already become enlarged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. It will be important in future to determine whether increased cell size can drive age-associated aneuploidies in HSCs and in other cell types and tissues.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Cell culture and reagents:</title><p id="P21">hTERT-RPE1 cells and the human ER+/HER2- breast cancer cell line MCF7 were purchased from ATCC.

Images of similarly stained experiments were acquired with identical illumination settings and analysed on Fiji, Image J software using an ImageJ macro, as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Briefly, the macro performs a threshold and selection of all the kinetochores, using the DAPI and CenpC channels. To generate kinetochore masks, the macro applied a convolution filter to the CenpC channel and perform a threshold selection. The resulting masks were then increased by 1 pixel (to ensure complete kinetochore selection). These masks were used to calculate the relative mean kinetochore intensities of indicated proteins. Fluorescence intensities at kinetochores were normalised to the kinetochore marker, CenpC.</p><p id="P38">For quantification of Sgo1 localization, The CenpC channel was used to choose 5 random kinetochore pairs per cell that lie on the same 0.2 μm Z-plane. A line was then drawn through the kinetochore pairs (using ImageJ), with the first CenpC kinetochore peak at 0.5 μm from the start of the line. An ImageJ macro (created by Kees Straatman, University of Leicester and modified by Balaji Ramalingam, University of Dundee) was used to simultaneously measure the intensities in each channel across the line. The signal from the five kinetochore pairs was averaged and normalized to the maximum signal in each channel. Inter-kinetochore distance for each kinetochore pair was measured as the distance between the two peaks from the intensity profiles from the CenpC channel.</p><p id="P39">The single-cell FUCCI profiles were generated manually by analysing RPE1-FUCCI movies. A total of 50 red cells were randomly selected and marked at the beginning of the movie. The time points in which the FUCCI cells change colour was recorded to determine the time spent in each phase of the first cell cycle following release from CDK4/6 inhibition. RPE-FUCCI cells were always imaged with the same illumination settings and all images were placed on the same scale prior to analysis to ensure that the red/yellow/green cut-offs were reproducibly calculated between experiments. Mitotic entry was timed based on the visualization of typical mitotic cell rounding and loss of nuclear mAG-geminin signal.</p><p id="P40">Sororin intensities were calculated by first using the DAPI channel to generate an ROI overlay in ImageJ. This overlay was then applied to the DAPI, EdU and Sororin channels and used to measure the mean grey value of each individual ROI. An area outside any ROI was then designated as background and its mean grey value in either channel was also calculated. This background value was then subtracted from all ROI values from the corresponding channel. Since cells were release from palbociclib into EdU and STLC, those cells lacking EdU were designated as G1 cells and cells expressing high EdU were designated as G2 cells. Their corresponding sororin values were used to calculate integrated fluorescence intensity.</p><p id="P41">Violin plots were produced using PlotsOfData — <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://huygens.science.uva.nl/PlotsOfData/">https://huygens.science.uva.nl/PlotsOfData/</ext-link><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. This allows the spread of data to be accurately visualised along with the 95% confidence intervals (thick vertical bars) calculated around the median (thin horizontal lines). This representation allows the statistical comparison between all treatments and time points because when the vertical bar of one condition does not overlap with one in another condition, the difference between the medians is statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05).
