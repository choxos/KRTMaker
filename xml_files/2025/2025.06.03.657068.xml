Autonomous transferability of our carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) gel vaccine delivery formulation was tested in a microchipped vampire bat colony in rural Jalisco, Mexico.

Extended storage at 4 °C and short exposure at higher temperatures of potential vampire bat environments preserved vaccine titers within CMC. Furthermore, physical properties of our CMC formulation were compared to the previously used glycerin jelly at 40 °C, 20 °C, and 0 °C using rheological tests. These tests indicate that CMC exhibits optimal properties for topical application to bats even at extreme temperatures possible during field vaccination.

First reported in the early 1900’s, vampire bat-transmitted rabies (VBR) poses significant health risk to humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and, especially, to livestock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Each year, VBR causes an estimated economic burden of $50 million USD to the livestock industry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Additionally, the suitable habitat range for vampire bats is expected to spread due to changing climates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, and annual reports of VBR are trending upwards in several countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Recent models predict future expansion of the bats into the southern United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> posing risk of extensive damages in this region with high populations of livestock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Across the US, an estimated 40,000 individuals annually receive rabies prophylaxis post-exposure to natively found bat species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and 90% of fatal rabies cases acquired from 2000-2022 were of bat origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Attempts to mitigate VBR rely on vaccination of livestock and proactive or reactive culling of bat colonies via application of “vampiricide” – a topical paste containing poisons that spread by the allogrooming behavior of the bats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, since their inception in the 1970’s, these methods have been insufficient in preventing the expansion of VBR. Reactive application of vampiricide has been shown to exacerbate rabies virus transmission by provoking dispersal of infected bats to new roosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Furthermore, the poison may transfer to multiple non-target species in the wild, causing unintended mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The ingestion of topically applied (orotopical) vaccines has been previously proposed as a superior method for bolstering current control strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Mathematical simulations predict that transferrable vaccines that similarly leverage bat allogrooming behavior outperform culling practices in reducing the probability, size, and duration of rabies outbreaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.

This vaccine was shown to produce protective immunity intradermally in A/J mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and orotopically in big brown bats (<italic>Eptesicus fuscus</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Notably, orotopical vaccination blocked shedding of rabies virus in vampire bats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.

Zero-shear viscosity for 12.5% CMC ranged from approximately 110-400 Pa*s from 0 to 40 °C compared to 0.05 – 1,070 Pa*s for GJ.

Although effective in humans and domesticated animals, parenteral vaccination is impractical for bats. Likewise, oral baits successfully used for other wildlife species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> are not suitable for bats due to differing feeding behavior. Because topically administered poisons demonstrate high rates of oral uptake within bat colonies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, orotopical vaccination of vampire bats has been proposed but lacks an optimal delivery vehicle. In this work, we describe the development of a topical vehicle that maintains optimal physical properties even at extreme temperatures, preserves our viral vector vaccine candidate, and exhibits high rates of transfer and oral uptake between treated and untreated bats in a wild bat colony.</p><p id="P42">Previous bat studies tested petroleum jelly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> – a paste commonly used for anticoagulant poison delivery – or glycerin jelly (GJ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> as the topical vaccine delivery vehicles. Petroleum jelly proved difficult to work with resulting in dilution of the vaccine and substantial loss of vaccine paste<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, the consistency of GJ is highly temperature dependent as demonstrated by our study. We found the mixture of GJ in water previously used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> has a melting temperature around 30 °C. While vampire bats typically roost where temperatures remain below 37 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and do not well tolerate temperatures above 33 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, environmental temperatures may exceed 40 °C during heat waves in some regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P43">Characterization of physical properties of a topical vehicle under environmental temperatures is necessary for proper application as revealed by the shortcomings of GJ. Rheology, measuring how a material sample responds to deformation, presents a useful method for measuring physical properties of gel-like materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The rheological properties of CMC solutions are well studied and vary with the molecular weight and degree of substitution of the CMC powder used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. The CMC gel preparation used in our study demonstrates shear thinning behavior and viscoelastic properties corresponding with these previous reports. In a steady rate sweep test, CMC demonstrates less variation than GJ in zero-shear viscosity over the studied range of temperature. At 40 °C, the near-zero shear rate of CMC was approximately 110 Pa*s, demonstrating high viscosity at high temperatures. This improves on the GJ formulation which has a near-zero shear rate approaching 0 Pa*s at 30 °C when it becomes completely liquified. In the characterization of viscoelastic materials, the storage modulus G’ characterizes the elastic component (energy stored during deformation) and the loss modulus G” characterizes the viscous component (energy dissipated during deformation). In CMC, G” is greater than G’ in the linear viscoelastic region which suggests CMC acts as a viscoelastic liquid that flows slowly over time. This may contribute to improved surface wettability and to the enhanced stickiness of CMC that we observed compared to GJ. In GJ, G’ &gt; G”, indicating primarily elastic solid-like behavior. Notably at 0 °C, G’ becomes greater than G” in CMC indicating trends toward solidification at temperatures near freezing, while still exhibiting viscoelastic properties.</p><p id="P44">Additional described properties of CMC support its use as a topical vaccine vehicle. The muco-adhesion of CMC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> may enhance viral entry into mucosal tissue. Mucoadhesive cellulose-based films have been previously used to facilitate entry of Modified Vaccinia Ankara – a commonly used poxviral vaccine vector - into the buccal mucosa of mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. CMC is also commonly used in drug delivery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, is non-toxic at high quantities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, and was found to mix easily with buffer containing RB.</p><p id="P45">To facilitate vaccination strategies, the vaccine must be readily shipped and stored without dependence on cold-chains in regions where reliability of infrastructure may be unpredictable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Our assessment of viral stability in CMC under different temperature conditions provides insight into vaccine preservation under storage conditions and persistence in field-relevant conditions. Minimal decay of viral titer within CMC was evident at refrigeration temperatures (4 °C) with only a 0.63 log fold decrease in viral titer after 3 months of storage. This will enable shipment and storage of the vaccine when challenges in infrastructure prevent maintaining temperatures below freezing. If refrigeration is lost, vaccine titer may also be preserved up to 1 week at 23 °C with only a 0.46 log fold decrease in titer and 24 hrs at 40 °C with 0.54 log fold decrease. Although virus stability was generally better preserved in GJ;, the viral titer initially decreased more rapidly in GJ than in CMC at 40 °C with a log fold decrease of 0.82 after 24 hours. Other additives could be considered to improve stability within the CMC gel formulation such as sucrose, which has been shown to enhance poxviral vaccine vector stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. The implications of these vaccine preservation data depend on the determination of the minimum effective dose of RCN-MoG in vampire bats; however, during field application, we expect gel to be consumed within hours after application.</p><p id="P46">Like applications of vampiricide, orotopical vaccination utilizes the natural propensity of vampire bats to allogroom to facilitate the transfer of vaccine between treated and untreated bats. Ideally, only a small portion of a colony would need to be treated to effectively manage rabies due to difficulties in locating and treating entire roosts.</p><p id="P47">Vampire bat captures are commonly performed at ranches where bats are known to be feeding to apply vampiricide, rather than at the roost istelf<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. This highlights the importance of understanding the rates of vaccine transfer and uptake within colonies and between cohorts at low rates of application. The RB biomarker used in this study is a common proxy for measuring uptake of treatment in wildlife species given its properties to stably mark the hair follicle and shaft with a fluorescent signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Based on assumptions about population size and demographic distribution of bats in this trial, an estimated gel uptake by 88.0% (CI: 76.9% - 94.0%) of the colony was measured after initial treatment of 20.5% of the colony. This corresponds to gel uptake in 3.29 bats (CI: 2.75 – 3.58) per initial bat treated which improves upon the transfer reported in Bakker et al. (2019) of 1.8-2.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. This difference is likely related to the increase in volume of gel applied per bat from 0.45 mL to 1 mL and the higher proportion of remaining non-treated bats available for gel uptake. Given the near 100% uptake observed in adult females and juveniles in our study, gel transfer rates may be even higher given the finite number of untreated bats within the colony.</p><p id="P48">Importantly, adult male bats are disproportionately implicated in the dispersal of VBR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. While our field trial suggests that adult male bats may be less likely to consume orotopically applied vaccines vehicles, we still demonstrate predicted uptake by 48.4% (CI: 30.4%-69.6%) of non-treated adult male bats. It has also previously been documented that males may be less effective than females at spreading vampiricide within a colony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. However, this result differs from Bakker et al. (2019) who found a nonsignificant difference in the proportion of males that showed uptake of RB compared to females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. This previous finding could be associated with the high proportion of treatment (up to 50%) in the colonies reported, variation in the social dynamics within the colonies between the studies, or potential regional or seasonal influences. Vampire bat colonies are differentiated as either maternity colonies with resident and non-resident males or primarily-male bachelor roosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Social grooming interactions and thus topical vehicle uptake may vary between different sites with different structures and sex and age ratios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Notably, 2.3-9 times the proportion of juveniles (31.5%) were captured in the roost in the present study compared to the three roosts studied in Bakker et al. (2019) (3.5%, 8.7% and 13.6%) during the first diurnal capture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P49">While RFID detection remained stable between captures 1 and 2 in this study, the number detected declined by around 50% a week later. In addition to the multiple captures at this site, disturbance was caused by the euthanasia of 20 of the bats from our colony carried out by authorities of the Mexican Rabies Campaign as equine rabies cases were reported near the roost site. As previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, vampire bats are prone to roost abandonment when disturbed, relocating to nearby manmade and natural roosts. For example, five months before the initiation of this biomarker study, we visited a large colony of over 100 bats within an abandoned facility 10 km away as a potential study site. However, before captures could be initiated, the colony relocated with only a few bats remaining at the site.</p><p id="P50">Epidemiological models indicate that vaccination significantly reduces duration and frequency of rabies outbreaks compared to culling even at low rates of vaccination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P51">The estimated gel consumption rates by nearly 100% of adult females, and male and female juveniles found in this study will likely aid in preventing rabies virus introduction to naive colonies. As a lower proportion of adult males consumed the gel, targeting males as juveniles may result in higher rates of vaccination; however, this will require investigation of the development and duration of the immune response in vaccinated juvenile bats. Further field trials are needed to understand gel uptake dynamics within multiple bat colonies to maximize vaccine uptake by adult males. Additional models may also investigate the effect of differing rates of vaccination uptake between males and females. Given that vampire bat rabies has been known to spread among colonies in a slow wavelike fashion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, strategies of ring vaccination around areas of predicted spread may be effective at containing expansion of VBR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P52">CMC gel may also work well as a topical vehicle for vaccine delivery to other bat species. In the United States, an estimated 40,000 individuals receive rabies prophylaxis each year after exposure to various bat species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Furthermore, 36 of 40 (90%) fatal rabies cases acquired in the United States between 2000 and 2022 were of bat origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. CMC could additionally be used to deliver a white nose syndrome (WNS) vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> or to scale up deployment of a herpesvirus-vectored rabies vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. As WNS-affected bats often inhabit colder regions in the United States and Canada, it is notable that CMC additionally maintains its physical properties at colder temperatures. However, vampire bats participate in allogrooming at higher rates than other bat species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, and field studies would be needed to determine gel transfer within colonies of other targeted bat species.</p><p id="P53">The identification of vampire bats within 50 km of the southern border of the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> and the expectation that their geographic range will continue to expand emphasizes the need for superior control methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. While topical application of vaccines presents an appealing alternative to culling practices that may exacerbate rabies transmission, further studies are needed to understand the dimorphism of uptake rates in adult male and female bats observed in this study. Likewise, additional studies are needed to determine the impact of vaccination on vampire bat colony sizes, although it is proposed to include contraceptives as a method for population control while minimizing unintended ecological impacts of anticoagulant poisons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P54">This study details the characterization of a carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) gel vehicle for orotopical rabies vaccine delivery to vampire bats.
