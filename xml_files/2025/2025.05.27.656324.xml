The ability of early embryos to form patterns <italic>de novo</italic> has long been recognized, dating back to some of the earliest experiments in embryology in the late 1800s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Driesch, 1892</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Roux, 1888</xref>). Beyond early embryos, self-organization also occurs in many developing tissues, as evidenced by the ability of diverse organoid systems to self-organize patterns <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Eiraku et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ishihara and Tanaka, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Meinhardt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Merle et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Simunovic et al., 2019</xref>). Some of the most well-studied paradigms of self-organization involve periodic (i.e., repeating) patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hiscock and Megason, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kondo and Miura, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Marcon and Sharpe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Raspopovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sick et al., 2006</xref>), in which initially uniform tissues spontaneously break symmetry to generate identical/similar structures at regular spatial intervals (e.g., teeth, hair, leaves).</p><p id="P3">Decades of theoretical work – initiated by Alan Turing in the 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Turing, 1952</xref>) – has advanced the hypothesis that these self-organizing patterns are the result of reacting and diffusing chemical signals. <italic>In vivo</italic>, these reaction-diffusion systems can be implemented by intercellular feedback circuits of secreted signalling molecules that diffuse in the extracellular space. In the canonical Turing model (as well as subsequent Gierer-Meinhardt models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Meinhardt and Gierer, 1974</xref>)) there are two such diffusible molecules – an activator and its (more rapidly diffusing) inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). These activator-inhibitor systems can self-organize <italic>in silico</italic> from a homogeneous initial state into a diversity of eventual patterns, often periodic patterns such as dots or stripes. Moreover, putative activator/inhibitor pairs have been proposed for a variety of tissues and signalling pathways, and <italic>in silico</italic> Turing models can be made to qualitatively recapitulate patterns formed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Grall et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Kondo and Asai, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Raspopovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sick et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P4">However, Turing models are often highly simplified, approximating complex mechanisms by a handful of equations that loosely mirror the regulatory interactions present <italic>in vivo,</italic> and neglect the essential roles that cellular and/or mechanical interactions may be playing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hiscock and Megason, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ho et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Nakamasu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Shyer et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, when modelling pure reaction-diffusion systems <italic>in silico</italic>, they are highly sensitive to parameters and often only form patterns in a narrow and biophysically unrealistic region of parameter space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Maini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Scholes et al., 2019</xref>). It is thus unclear whether a molecular mechanism, alone, could ever be capable of robust patterning, casting doubt on the relevance of Turing’s hypothesis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P5">Despite this, recent experimental data are beginning to pinpoint specific patterns that are generated by definitively molecular (i.e., reaction-diffusion) mechanisms. The clearest examples draw from tissues that undergo minimal morphogenesis during initial patterning, such as the developing hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sick et al., 2006</xref>) and fingerprints in the mammalian epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Glover et al., 2023</xref>), or the patterning of joints within the digits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Grall et al., 2024</xref>). In these cases, a self-organized molecular prepattern is the first sign of symmetry breaking and precedes any overt changes in cell density or tissue morphology, strongly implicating a reaction-diffusion mechanism.</p><p id="P6">At the same time, theoreticians have started to consider reaction-diffusion systems that are considerably more complex than simple activator-inhibitor schemes e.g., by incorporating more than two diffusible molecules. High throughput, systematic analyses of 3- and 4-node networks have revealed a wide array of regulatory architectures capable of periodic patterning beyond simple 2-component Turing models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Diego et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Haas and Goldstein, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Marcon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Scholes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Shaberi et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that patterning may involve more than just one activator and one inhibitor <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, whilst containing more diffusible elements, the models are still simplified network-level abstractions which approximate molecular interactions by simple mathematical expressions (e.g., linear or hill functions), rather than directly capturing the nature of developmental signalling <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, many of the identified circuits remain highly fragile to parameters <italic>in silico</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Scholes et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Here, instead of adding more activators/inhibitors, we seek to build models of classic Turing mechanisms (i.e., 1-activator, 1-inhibitor) that more realistically capture the mechanisms of intercellular signalling. We move beyond idealized 2-component representations of these systems, and instead explicitly consider the multi-step nature of pathway activation (i.e., signal transduction), transcriptional regulation (i.e., feedbacks) and the diverse biochemical mechanisms of pathway inhibition (e.g., some inhibitors sequester ligands, whereas others compete for receptor binding). To deal with the substantial increase in model complexity that this entails, we developed a highly performant and freely available computational pipeline (ReactionDiffusion.jl) that simulates complex reaction-diffusion systems at scale and at speed. By combining large scale numerical simulations with formal mathematical proofs, we uncover fundamental limits on the ability of such activator-inhibitor circuits to break symmetry, which apply rather generally across many types of signalling pathways and intracellular dynamics.</p><p id="P8">Rather than all behaving similarly – as implicitly assumed in simple 2-component Turing models – we have identified eight distinct classes of activator-inhibitor system, defined by the type of inhibitory mechanism and regulatory feedbacks present. This suggests that self-organized patterning is possible with a more flexible regulatory logic than previously thought and reveals several pattern-forming motifs not predicted by simpler models. Moreover, we predict that patterning is achievable with biologically feasible parameter values, and in some cases, can be made robust to variations in any single biophysical/biochemical parameter. Thus, by adding complexity and realism to our models, we have revealed a more widespread ability of reaction-diffusion systems – even those that comprise only a single activator and single inhibitor – to self-organize patterns <italic>de novo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>ReactionDiffusion.jl: a pipeline to efficiently simulate complex reaction-diffusion systems</title><p id="P9">Intercellular feedbacks in reaction-diffusion systems couple cell states across space and time within developing tissues. These interactions can be coarse grained via a continuum approximation into systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of signalling. Whilst simple to write down, the complexity of our models (large systems of numerically stiff PDEs) makes them highly challenging to simulate. We therefore developed a suite of new computational tools to simulate these complex reaction-diffusion systems at scale.</p><p id="P10">We have built an end-to-end pipeline in the performant <italic>SciML</italic> ecosystem that leverages an expressive domain-specific-language, state-of-the-art numerical solvers, and automated multicore parallelization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Loman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Rackauckas and Nie, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">2017</xref>). Models are first specified in an intuitive syntax that naturally reflects the regulatory interactions involved in signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Mass action kinetics are automatically prescribed for the specified biochemical reactions, and user-defined functions can be used to parameterize other reaction rates (e.g., transcriptional feedbacks). Once specified, the model is then <italic>automatically</italic> converted to a system of corresponding PDEs, and then <italic>automatically</italic> simulated to predict the resulting dynamics, all within a single line of code (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). We have implemented highly-performant, adaptive time-stepping solvers that allow systems of 10+ PDEs to be simulated interactively on a standard desktop machine (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We have also implemented Turing instability analysis into our pipeline, mirroring the approaches used in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Diego et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Scholes et al., 2019</xref>) to predict whether a reaction-diffusion system can break symmetry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1A</xref>). Again, this is fully automated, going from an intuitive model description to a high-throughput parameter screen in just a single line of code (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1B</xref>). We have demonstrated the efficacy of our approach by correctly identifying pattern-forming parameter sets for 4 separate Turing systems (2-4 components) with known ground truths (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S1C-F</xref>). By employing multithreaded parallelization and symbolic computing methods, we can accelerate these computations and are able to screen millions of parameter sets per minute on a standard desktop machine.</p><p id="P12">Together, these form a fully end-to-end pipeline for efficiently simulating and screening complex reaction-diffusion systems. These tools can be applied to any type/size of reaction-diffusion system and are fully automated, meaning that a detailed knowledge of numerical solvers or fine tuning of algorithm parameters is not required. We have made our pipeline freely-available as an open-source Julia package with extensive documentation and tutorials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hiscocklab/ReactionDiffusion.jl">https://github.com/hiscocklab/ReactionDiffusion.jl</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Deriving general limits on pattern formation by reaction-diffusion systems</title><p id="P13">Armed with our new pipeline, we are now able to simulate reaction-diffusion models with sufficient complexity to more accurately mirror intercellular signalling mechanisms. However, despite the significant acceleration in simulation time, the curse of dimensionality still constrains our ability to screen large systems of PDEs. For example, the GDF5 signalling model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> has 20 free parameters and 14 components. Whilst we can simulate this rapidly for a single parameter set, to exhaustively screen through all combinations remains computationally unfeasible. Therefore, we sought strategies to approximate our detection of Turing instabilities to render comprehensive screens tractable, allowing us to derive generally applicable limits regardless of parameter values (many of which are often not quantified <italic>in vivo</italic>).</p><p id="P14">For a Turing-like instability to arise, there must be some small perturbations with wavenumber <italic>q</italic> (equivalently, periodic patterns with wavelength <italic>λ = 2π/q</italic>) which destabilize an initially homogeneous state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">J.D. Murray, 2008</xref>). One simplification that has been used previously is to examine the determinant of the linearised reaction-diffusion matrix, <bold>M</bold>(<italic>q</italic><sup>2</sup>) ≡ <bold>J</bold> - <italic>q</italic><sup>2</sup><bold>D</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Diego et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Smith and Dalchau, 2018</xref>), where <bold>J</bold> is the Jacobian of the reaction terms and <bold>D</bold> is a diagonal matrix corresponding to diffusion. The Turing instability criterion requires det (<bold>M</bold>(<italic>q</italic><sup>2</sup>)) to change sign twice in the range <italic>q</italic> ∈ [0, ∞) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Smith and Dalchau, 2018</xref>), which we hereafter refer to as the necessary condition <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mo>𝒩</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P15">When considering detailed reaction-diffusion models (e.g., like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), we noticed that their structure greatly simplifies the calculation of <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mo>𝒩</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref>). In general, signalling pathways comprise elements which diffuse between cells (e.g., extracellular ligands and inhibitors; we label these as <italic>D</italic>); elements which directly interact/bind to the diffusible elements (e.g., receptors; we label these as <italic>R</italic>); and elements which are confined within the cell itself (e.g., intracellular signal transduction elements; we label these as <italic>I</italic>). We may split <bold>M</bold>(<italic>q</italic><sup>2</sup>) accordingly into blocks, so for example <bold>M<sub><italic>DD</italic></sub></bold>(<italic>q</italic><sup>2</sup>) ≡ ]<bold>j</bold><sub>DD</sub> - <italic>q</italic><sup>2</sup><bold>D</bold><sub>DD</sub> represents interactions/diffusion of the extracellular components <italic>D,</italic> whereas <bold>M</bold><sub>IR</sub>(<italic>q</italic><sup>2</sup>) ≡ <bold>J</bold><sub>IR</sub> reflects how the intracellular elements <italic>I</italic> are regulated by (activated) receptors <italic>R.</italic> Whilst the intracellular components, <italic>I,</italic> add significant complexity to the models, they do not contribute to intercellular diffusion (i.e., <bold><italic>D</italic></bold><sub>II</sub> = 0) and are not <italic>directly</italic> affected by the extracellular species (i.e., <bold>J</bold><sub><italic>ID</italic></sub> = <bold>0</bold>). Using Schur’s lemma, we therefore find that the determinant of <bold>M</bold> may be expressed in a simpler form: <disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math

At first glance, the computation of these effective interactions remains challenging and appears to depend on the full complexity of the intracellular components. However, we may use Lemma 2.1 from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Smith and Dalchau, 2018</xref>), to show that these terms can be computed by simply assuming that all intracellular components, <italic>I</italic>, reach quasi-steady state i.e., do not change over time. Therefore, we may rigorously approximate the intracellular dynamics as a “black box” that takes in inputs (e.g., levels of activated signalling receptors) and translates these into outputs (e.g., production rates of signalling ligands and inhibitors), with each steady-state input-output relation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) quantified by a corresponding intracellular response function, F<sub>output</sub>(input). The advantage of this formulation is that the necessary condition <inline-formula><mml:math id="M10"><mml:mo>𝒩</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> may now be computed by considering the intracellular response functions alone without a detailed characterization of the intracellular dynamics. Moreover, we show that <inline-formula><mml:math id="M11"><mml:mo>𝒩</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> is also sufficient to predict the possible wavelengths of pattern that can form, as well as the phase relations between gene expression domains i.e., whether they are in- or out-of-phase (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref>).</p><p id="P18">There are multiple ways to measure F<sub>output</sub>(input) in experiments. The most direct would be to experimentally vary the input <italic>in vitro</italic> (e.g., via dosed application of exogeneous ligand to low density cultures) and then quantify the resulting output (e.g., via qPCR quantification of relevant transcript levels). Alternatively, one could use <italic>in vivo</italic> correlations to quantify how natural variations in inputs (e.g., levels of pathway activation measured via immunofluorescence) lead to changes in output levels (e.g., gene expression levels measured via fluorescent in situ hybridization). Moreover, even if F<sub>output</sub>(input) cannot be measured directly, it’s salient features can often be estimated or at least bounded. We later show that the ability of reaction-diffusion systems to break symmetry depends only on the normalized sensitivity of the intracellular response functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Paulsson, 2004</xref>); this is defined as the % change in output for a given % change in input, i.e., H<sub>input→output</sub> ≡ (ΔF<sub>output</sub>/F<sub>output</sub>)/(Δinput/input).</p><p id="P19">These normalized sensitivities, H<sub>input→output</sub>, have an intuitive interpretation – they can be viewed as the effective hill coefficients of the response functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Thus, we can now derive general limits on patterning that will be broadly applicable regardless of the precise intracellular feedback mechanisms – or intracellular parameters – at play (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The ability of reaction-diffusion systems to form patterns is relatively insensitive to their intracellular dynamics</title><p id="P21">Whilst the condition <inline-formula><mml:math id="M13"><mml:mo>𝒩</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> places strict constraints on pattern-forming parameters, it is not clear how tight – and thus how informative – these constraints are. Equivalently, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M14"><mml:mo>𝒩</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> defines a necessary condition for patterning, but it is unclear how close this is to a necessary <italic>and</italic> a sufficient condition. The complexity of intracellular dynamics we consider makes an analytical derivation of the sufficient conditions intractable. Therefore, we instead investigate this question numerically using our ReactionDiffusion.jl pipeline to determine pattern-forming parameters (i.e., those that satisfy both necessary and sufficient conditions). To begin with, we consider perhaps the simplest mode of pathway inhibition, in which the inhibitor directly binds to the signalling ligand thus preventing it from activating receptors and eventually targeting it for degradation. Keeping this extracellular component identical, we then consider a variety of intracellular dynamics: a single, effective intracellular signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>); incorporation of mRNA transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>); a multi-step intracellular signalling cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>); and an explicit model of GDF5 signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Nunns and Goentoro, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Schmierer et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). We explore a wide range of parameter sets for all models, ensuring consistent parameter ranges for any shared (e.g., extracellular) components.</p><p id="P22">First, we plot the normalized sensitivities, H<sub>input→output</sub>, which naturally describe the (overall) intracellular signalling feedbacks; if H &gt; 0, then signalling activates the prescribed output, whereas if H &lt; 0, then it inhibits it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). An advantage of considering H is that we can derive strict bounds (light blue lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-E</xref>) that are not only independent of the intracellular dynamics but also apply across all possible extracellular parameters and depend only on the type of inhibitor present (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials</xref>). When we identify pattern-forming parameter sets numerically, we find that, regardless of the intracellular dynamics assumed, the normalized sensitivities all fall within the predicted region i.e., satisfy the general limits defined by <inline-formula><mml:math id="M15"><mml:mo>𝒩</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-E</xref>). Moreover, we observe that some parameter sets lie close to these limits, demonstrating that the bound is tight. To quantify this further, we directly compare the parameter sets that satisfy <inline-formula><mml:math id="M16"><mml:mo>𝒩</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> with those that form patterns i.e., those that satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions. Across all types of intracellular dynamics, we find a large overlap (&gt;90%) between the parameter sets that satisfy <inline-formula><mml:math id="M17"><mml:mo>𝒩</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> and the true pattern-forming parameter space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-E</xref>); this is also the case when assuming alternative extracellular interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2A-D, Figure S3</xref>). We could find parameter regimes where the agreement between <inline-formula><mml:math id="M18"><mml:mo>𝒩</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> and pattern-forming ability was lower (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2E</xref>), although this required substantial differences in diffusion rates that may not be relevant <italic>in vivo.</italic> Together, this suggests that, at least for the models and parameter ranges considered here, the general limits that we derive from <inline-formula><mml:math id="M19"><mml:mo>𝒩</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> – which apply regardless of the precise intracellular dynamics — place tight constraints on pattern-forming parameter values and may be reasonably close to being necessary and sufficient conditions for patterning. Furthermore, this implies that key properties of reaction-diffusion systems may be determined by analysing models in which intracellular signalling is approximated by a single effective component, <italic>S,</italic> per pathway and a correspondingly simpler reactiondiffusion matrix <inline-formula><mml:math id="M20"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">˜</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula></p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Inhibitor type strongly constrains the regulatory logic of pattern-forming activator-inhibitor circuits</title><p id="P23">So far, we have explored how different <italic>intracellular</italic> dynamics impact the pattern-forming capacity of reaction-diffusion models. Now, we investigate the effect of incorporating different <italic>extracellular</italic> interactions. We restrict our attention to activator-inhibitor systems (i.e., those with just two secreted molecules that either activate or inhibit signalling) and explicitly model the mechanism of pathway inhibition. This leads us to consider four distinct types of (diffusible) inhibitor: (1) inhibitors that bind directly to signalling ligands, sequestering them into an inert complex that eventually degrades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>); (2) inhibitors that bind to receptors but do not activate them, thus competing with ligand-induced signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>); (3) inhibitors that reversibly form complexes with ligands, in which the complex cannot activate signalling but can dissociate to release the ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>); (4) inhibitors that act indirectly on the activator i.e., ligands that activate other signalling pathways, which then leads to transcriptional inhibition of the activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). For each inhibitor type, we sought to understand what regulatory interactions were compatible with patterning; for example, the classic activator-inhibitor scheme posits that both activator and inhibitor are induced by signalling (H<sub>S→A</sub> &gt; 0, H<sub>S→I</sub> &gt; 0).</p><p id="P24">We take two complementary approaches.

Second, we perform numerical simulations assuming a specific intracellular network (for simplicity, a single effective component, <italic>S</italic>, per pathway) and systematically vary parameters to plot a wide range of pattern-forming parameter sets (blue dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, compared with <inline-formula><mml:math id="M21"><mml:mo>𝒩</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Strikingly, we find that each type of diffusible inhibitor requires distinct regulatory circuits to self-organize patterns: <list list-type="simple" id="L1"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p id="P26">When the inhibitor irreversibly sequesters the activator by directly binding to it, then both activator and inhibitor must be <italic>activated</italic> by signalling for patterns to form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>); this is consistent with the intuition from classic activator-inhibitor models.</p></list-item><list-item><label>(2)</label><p id="P27">When the inhibitor instead competes with the activator for receptor binding, then an additional type of regulation is also compatible with patterning, in which signalling <italic>inhibits</italic> both activator and inhibitor expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><label>(3)</label><p id="P28">When the inhibitor binds the ligand, but the resulting complex can readily dissociate, then the classic activator-inhibitor logic (i.e., signalling <italic>activates</italic> both activator and inhibitor) no longer permits patterning.

One key difference amongst them is the predicted phase difference between components. Regions of active signalling may be in-phase (i.e., co-expressed) with both the ligand and inhibitor expression domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A, B<sub>1</sub></xref>). Alternatively, signalling may be out-of-phase (i.e., anticorrelated) with both ligand and inhibitor expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B<sub>2</sub>,C<sub>3</sub></xref>). Beyond these two scenarios, the ligand need not always be co-expressed with the inhibitor but may instead be expressed in regions where inhibitor levels are low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C<sub>1</sub></xref>) or present uniformly throughout the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C<sub>2</sub></xref>).

Moreover, for these representative parameter sets, we show that patterning can still occur despite significant variation in any of the individual parameters of the models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>, left column). This suggests that, at least for the regions of parameter space shown here, the ability of activator-inhibitor circuits to form patterns can be highly robust to parameters. We also computed robustness metrics for each parameter individually by calculating the fraction of parameter space that forms patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>, right column). This reveals general tendencies that affect the ability of each of the circuits to form patterns; for example, we predict that a highly diffusive complex of activator and inhibitor increases the likelihood of the circuit being pattern forming (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5C</xref>). We find that these broad tendencies can be derived by considering the necessary condition <inline-formula><mml:math id="M23"><mml:mo>𝒩</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> alone and are therefore likely to apply regardless of the precise intracellular dynamics present.

Here, we develop activator-inhibitor models that are more closely aligned to <italic>in vivo</italic> signalling mechanisms and find that they display qualitatively distinct behaviours to simpler, phenomenological approximations. In particular, the mode of extracellular inhibition strongly constrains the type of regulatory architectures capable of self-organizing patterns <italic>de novo.</italic> In contrast, the ability to break symmetry is relatively insensitive to the intracellular dynamics and depends only on the overall, steady-state response of the cell to signalling, which can often be approximated or estimated directly. We have combined formal mathematical proofs with large scale numerical simulations to support the generality of our conclusions, and derive strict constraints on patterning (via the necessary condition <inline-formula><mml:math id="M24"><mml:mo>𝒩</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>) which apply regardless of intracellular signalling mechanisms. These constraints do not guarantee that a pattern will form, nor do they predict all features of the resulting patterns (e.g., spatiotemporal dynamics, final pattern formed), but they do point to broadly applicable principles that are necessary for reaction-diffusion systems to self-organize.</p><p id="P35">Guided by these principles, we systematically characterize systems that can form patterns with only a single activator and a single inhibitor, and identify key gene expression signatures associated with each class of mechanism. These include the classic Turing-type logic, in which signalling promotes the simultaneous expression of both activator and inhibitor. However, several other circuits form patterns but have an inverse relationship between signalling and activator/inhibitor production. Indeed, recent experimental observations point to numerous examples of this inverted logic operating <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Grall et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Grocott et al., 2020</xref>). When we allow the inhibitor to <italic>reversibly</italic> bind the signalling ligand, we predict several further types of circuit capable of breaking symmetry. This includes cases where activator and inhibitor are expressed in opposite locations, a property not predicted by simpler activator-inhibitor models, but something that has been observed for several self-organizing patterns <italic>in vivo</italic> (e.g., WNT/sFRP in cortical organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Takata et al., 2017</xref>)). Moreover, we predict that an elevated diffusivity of the ligand in complex promotes pattern formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5C</xref>), suggesting that ligand shuttling (as has been suggested for e.g., WNT/sFRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Mii and Taira, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">2009</xref>), BMP-Chordin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>)) may also be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Shilo et al., 2013</xref>).

However, our analysis of model robustness is rather preliminary, characterizing either isolated exemplar parameter sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>, left column) or collapsing the full parameter space down to one dimension for ease of visualization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S5</xref>, right column). In future, more work will be needed to fully characterize the high-dimensional parameter spaces and thus robustness of each of the models in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, using tools and approaches applied elsewhere. Moreover, integrating model predictions with <italic>in vivo</italic> data and biophysical measurements of key parameters will also be necessary to definitively test the hypothetical circuits that we have proposed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kuhn et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Müller et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P37">A further limitation of this study is that we restrict our attention to mechanisms with only two secreted diffusible molecules.

Moreover, <italic>in silico</italic> studies have shown that adding diffusible molecules not only expands the number of possible pattern-forming networks but can also be associated with increased robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Marcon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Scholes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Shaberi et al., 2025</xref>). In addition, our models have so far neglected impacts of receptor dynamics on extracellular ligands and inhibitors (e.g., receptor-mediated ligand sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Lord et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Preiß et al., 2022</xref>), endocytic ligand recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Romanova-Michaelides et al., 2022</xref>)), and have focused on activator-inhibitor complexes with 1:1 stoichiometries (like GDF5-NOG). Despite these simplifications, our models capture the minimal mechanistic features associated with intercellular signalling and distinct types of pathway inhibition, and this already revealed qualitative differences with phenomenological Turing models. We expect that incorporating more <italic>in vivo</italic> interactions and complexity into our models will further expand our understanding of reaction-diffusion based patterning.</p><p id="P38">Beyond the principles we have uncovered, the computational frameworks that we have developed are broadly applicable to any reaction-diffusion mechanism.

We are currently limited to one dimensional simulations, which are sufficient to determine the overall characteristics of a pattern (i.e., can it form <italic>de novo?</italic> what components are co-expressed?) but can often not be compared directly to experimental data. Moreover, we have restricted our attention to fully self-organizing systems (i.e., no prior asymmetries in the tissue) with a strong focus on periodic patterns.
