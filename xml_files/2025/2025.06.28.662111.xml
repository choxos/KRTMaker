We combined chemically imposed immune activation with single-cell transcriptomics to profile ETI responses across all leaf cell types in Arabidopsis. Despite uniform ETI perception, we find striking divergence between transcriptional outputs: a core set of defense genes is broadly induced, while distinct cell types activate specialized immune modules. We infer that downstream immune execution is shaped not only by immune receptor activation, but also by cell identity and its associated transcriptional regulatory context, including local transcription factor availability and chromatin accessibility. We further demonstrate that transcriptional regulators preferentially induced in epidermal cells are required to restrict invasion by non-adapted pathogens. Their absence permits pathogen entry into deeper tissues despite intact recognition, revealing a spatial division of immune functions. Our findings uncover a layered immune architecture in plants, challenges the assumption of uniform immune execution, and provides a framework for exploring cell-type-specific resistance logic in multicellular hosts.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Effector-triggered immunity (ETI)</kwd><kwd>cell-autonomous immunity</kwd><kwd>cell-type-specific immunity</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">In multicellular organisms lacking adaptive immunity, such as plants, immune responses are largely cell-autonomous: each cell must independently perceive and counter pathogenic threats in the absence of mobile immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. While this principle has long shaped our understanding of plant defense, recent studies highlight the importance of intercellular communication in modulating local responses and coordinating systemic immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, how immune execution at the resolution of individual cell types remains poorly understood. Specifically, it is unknown whether all plant cell types engage immune programs equivalently, or whether transcriptional responses are modulated by cell identity, developmental state, or physiological role.</p><p id="P5">Effector-triggered immunity (ETI), mediated by intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) receptors (NLRs), is a core component of plant innate immunity. Upon recognizing pathogen-derived effectors, ETI activates a robust transcriptional response that drives defense gene expression, cell wall fortification, immune metabolite production, and often culminates in a localized cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. While ETI is widely regarded as a canonical and system-wide immune program, most insights to date stem from bulk tissue measurements or natural infections, where immune activation is spatially heterogeneous and confounded by pathogen distribution and pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), mediated by cell-surface immune receptors. These limitations have obscured a fundamental question: Do all plant cell types execute ETI similarly when immune activation is synchronized?</p><p id="P6">Recent studies have begun to explore immune responses at single-cell resolution. For example, single-cell profiling of <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>-infected Arabidopsis leaves revealed transcriptional shifts linked to pathogen proximity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and fungal infection studies have identified cell-type-specific defense signatures under biotic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Most recently, the concept of a primary immune responder (PRIMER) cell state was proposed, based on single-cell RNA-seq analysis of ETI-inducing bacterial infections during which host cells experience PTI, ETI and also defense suppression via pathogen effectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. While these studies have uncovered valuable spatial features of plant immunity, they are inherently confounded by pathogen load, PTI co-activation, and the spatial unpredictability of natural infections.</p><p id="P7">To overcome these limitations, we established a synthetic system for uniform and pathogen-free ETI induction using estradiol-triggered NLR activation in Arabidopsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Combining this with single-cell RNA sequencing, we constructed a high-resolution atlas of ETI-responsive transcriptional states across major leaf cell types. Our analysis uncovered a layered immune architecture: despite of a shared core transcriptional response activated across all cell types, ETI responses were shaped by local gene regulatory networks in cell-type-specific transcriptional modules, demonstrating a complementary mechanism between both. This suggests that immune execution is not merely a product of perception but is also intrinsically constrained by cell identity and chromatin context.</p><p id="P8">To directly test whether cell-type-specific transcriptional modules are functionally required for immune execution, we focused on CAMODULIN-BINDING PROTEIN 60 G (CBP60g) and SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE DEFICIENT 1 (SARD1), two closely related transcription factors known to act downstream of NLR signaling. Both have been established as central regulators of salicylic acid biosynthesis and systemic acquired resistance during ETI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Strikingly, our single-cell data revealed their preferential induction in pavement cells, the epidermal layer that interfaces directly with the external environment. This was particularly intriguing in the context of enabling a non-adapted <italic>Albugo candida</italic>, isolate to invade Arabidopsis through stomata that would normally be resisted. While guard cells form the stomatal pore, it is the surrounding pavement cells that must constrain early pathogen entry. We hypothesized that CBP60g and SARD1 may act as key mediators of spatial immune execution in this vulnerable layer. Supporting this, we found that <italic>cbp60g sard1</italic> mutants permitted haustoria formation by <italic>A. candida</italic> specifically in the epidermal and sub-epidermal cells, despite intact immunity in internal tissues. This provides direct evidence that cell-type-specific transcriptional activation, rather than receptor activation alone, is required to restrict nonhost pathogen ingress.</p><p id="P9">Together, our findings redefine our understanding of immune coordination in plants, not as a uniform switch, but as a mosaic of modular, spatially distributed programs embedded within tissues. By decoupling immune activation from pathogen-associated variables and resolving transcriptional responses at cellular scale, this work has broad implications for how multicellular hosts orchestrate defense and opens avenues for engineering more precise and spatially tuned immune activation in multicellular systems, including crops.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>ETI activation defines distinct immune-responsive cell clusters</title><p id="P10">To profile the transcriptional landscape of effector-triggered immunity (ETI) at single-cell resolution, we developed a synthetic ETI activation system in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis thereafter) leaves using estradiol (E2)-inducible expression of <italic>AvrRps4</italic>, a bacterial effector recognized by the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) receptor (NLR) pairs, RESISTANT TO RALSTONIA SOLANACEARUM 1 (RRS1)/RESISTANT TO PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE 4 (RPS4) and RRS1B/RPS4B, referred to as the SUPER ETI (SETI) line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Leaves of the SETI plants were infiltrated with mock or E2 solution, and protoplasts were isolated 4 hours post-infiltration (hpi) for single-cell analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).

A violin plot of selected cell-type-specific genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>) confirmed robust classification of 16 clusters corresponding to nine distinct cell types, with a predominant mesophyll identity (clusters M1â€“M8) along with pavement cells (epidermal cells), bundle sheath, hydathode, phloem, and other known leaf cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Together, these data establish a comprehensive single-cell atlas of early ETI activation across Arabidopsis leaf tissue, in the absence of PTI, providing a foundation for dissecting immune responses at cellular resolution without confounding pathogen-derived heterogeneity or defense suppression.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Uniform immune activation elicits heterogeneous transcriptional responses</title><p id="P14">To dissect the spatial pattern of immune execution, we examined the expression of canonical immune and susceptibility genes across annotated cell types. Core components of the Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor/Resistance protein (TIR) NLR immune signaling cascades including <italic>ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1</italic> (<italic>EDS1</italic>), <italic>PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 4</italic> (<italic>PAD4</italic>) and <italic>SENESCENCE ASSOCIATED GENE 101</italic> (<italic>SAG101</italic>) were broadly expressed, along with downstream helper NLR encoding genes, <italic>ACTIVATED DISEASE RESISTANCE 1</italic> (<italic>ADR1</italic>), <italic>ADR1-L1, ADR1-L2, N REQUIREMENT GENE 1.1</italic> (<italic>NRG1.1</italic>) and <italic>NRG1.2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, with <italic>ADR1</italic> and <italic>NRG1.2</italic> exhibiting relatively sparse expression. This widespread expression suggests that the EDS1-dependent module is transcriptionally accessible across the entire leaf tissue, equipping most cell types to mount ETI responses upon intracellular effector recognition.</p><p id="P15">Consistently, the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, downstream of EDS1 signaling, was also globally activated. Genes including <italic>ICS1, EDS5</italic> and <italic>AVRPPHB SUSCEPTIBLE 3</italic> (<italic>PBS3</italic>) were robustly expressed across nearly all cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2B and S2C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, in line with broad SA pathway activation previously observed in ETI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The widespread induction of <italic>ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2</italic> (<italic>EIN2</italic>) further supports the notion of a tissue-wide immune readiness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Notably, negative immune regulators such as Nudix hydrolase encoding genes, <italic>NUDTs</italic>, and <italic>CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATORs</italic> (<italic>CAMTAs</italic>) were also broadly induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that immune repression mechanisms are similarly embedded across the tissue.</p><p id="P16">Moreover, key signaling components that mediate the mutual potentiation between PTI and ETI, including shared protein kinases and transcriptional regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, were also ubiquitously expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S3A</xref>). This suggests that all cells in Arabidopsis leaves harbor an immunity-supporting infrastructure that is transcriptionally primed to interpret and integrate diverse immune cues.</p><p id="P17">In contrast to these broadly distributed immune modules, we identified marked spatial restriction in the expression of N-hydroxy pipecolic acid (NHP) biosynthesis genes. Specifically, <italic>AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN 1</italic> (<italic>ALD1</italic>) and <italic>FLAVIN-CONTAINING MONOOXYGENASE 1</italic> (<italic>FMO1</italic>), which encodes enzymes catalyzing the first and last steps in NHP production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, were almost exclusively expressed in companion cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2D and S2E</xref>), consistent with recent findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, <italic>SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED RESISTENCE DEFICIENT 4</italic> (<italic>SARD4</italic>), which encodes the oxidoreductase catalyzing the intermediate step of NHP biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, exhibited widespread expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F</xref>), suggesting a division of labor wherein companion cells complete NHP biosynthesis to support systemic signal propagation. These findings indicate a spatial configuration of NHP biosynthesis and reinforce the role of companion cells as specialized immune hubs for systemic acquired resistance (SAR)-related metabolites.</p><p id="P18">We also observed cell-type-restricted expression for genes in the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway and members of the E2F transcription factor family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), previously implicated in cell cycle control and immune regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. These results suggest that hormone signaling, and proliferation-linked regulators may modulate ETI output in a spatially restricted and context-dependent manner. For instance, loss-of-function of <italic>E2Fa/b/c</italic> compromises ETI responses mediated by both TIR and coiled-coil (CC) NLRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">Importantly, because our system triggers ETI uniformly and in a pathogen-free manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, it offers a unique opportunity to examine whether immune-enhanced cell states, such as primary immune responder (PRIMER) and bystander cell states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, can arise independently of pathogen spatial distribution. We observed broad induction of the trihelix transcription factor encoding gene, <italic>GT-MOTIF BINDING FACTOR-3A</italic> (<italic>GT-3A</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, a canonical marker of the PRIMER cell state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, across all ETI-activated cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with its role as a general ETI-responsive gene. This confirms that <italic>GT-3A</italic> expression reflects the proximity to pathogens that can induce robust cell-autonomous ETI. In contrast, its close homologues <italic>GT-3B</italic> and <italic>GT-4</italic> were preferentially induced in hydathodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating cell-type-specific modulation of the transcriptional responses mediated by putatively redundant components. These findings refine the PRIMER cell state concept by suggesting that its transcriptional hallmarks can be broadly accessible to almost all plant cells but differentially tuned by cell identity. Rather than being exclusively driven by pathogen contact, PRIMER-like transcriptional cell states may emerge from intrinsic regulatory programs that govern immune execution across tissues.</p><p id="P20">Taken together, these results reveal that while the capacity to initiate immune signaling is broadly encoded in all leaf cells, the execution of immune programs is highly modular and spatially patterned. Even under synchronized and pathogen-free ETI activation, immune outputs such as NHP biosynthesis and PRIMER-like transcriptional states remain confined to specific cell types. This indicates that plant tissues harbor intrinsic immune compartmentalization, likely reflecting functional specializations that balance defense intensity, metabolic cost, and coordination of systemic immunity. These insights offer a new framework to explore how spatial immune signaling is uncoded in development and potentially exploited during natural infections.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Shared and cluster-specific gene programs structure immune execution</title><p id="P21">To map the cellular architecture of immune execution, we performed differential gene expression (DEG) analysis across all annotated cell clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>), followed by gene ontology (GO) term enrichment. As anticipated, defense-related GO terms were predominantly enriched in epidermal and mesophyll cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), consistent with prior bulk RNA-seq findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, GO terms related to photosynthesis, especially photosystem I components, were significantly enriched among downregulated genes in several mesophyll clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>), indicating that ETI alone can suppress core metabolic programs in addition to activating defense.</p><p id="P22">To evaluate how cell-resolved responses relate to canonical ETI programs, we compared upregulated DEGs in each cluster with a previously defined list of EDS1-dependent immune-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Most clusters showed significant overlap, with pavement cells and mesophyll cells exhibiting the highest concordance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> and S4B). This supports the presence of a broadly conserved core immune program across major cell types.</p><p id="P23">However, beyond this shared module, many cell clusters displayed distinct expression of immune-activation indicators or regulators, such as <italic>CALMODULIN-BINDING PROTEIN 60 G</italic> (<italic>CBP60g</italic>), <italic>SARD1, ALD1, FMO1, SWEET4</italic> and <italic>E2F</italic> family transcription factors etc., which may mediate cell-autonomous immune amplification, niche-specific defense execution, or immune signal propagation contributing to pathogen restriction and distal immune priming signal propagation.</p><p id="P24">To delineate these features systematically, we classified DEGs as shared (included in more than 2 different clusters; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S7</xref>) or cluster-specific (uniquely induced; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S8</xref>). Many cluster-specific genes still overlapped with bulk-identified ETI targets, suggesting these are not artifacts of cellular noise but reflect specialized, cell type-enriched immune indicators and putative regulators. Additionally, these genes overlapped with known EDS1-dependent ETI-responsive genes from bulk RNA-seq, supporting their role as specialized, cell type-enriched immune markers or execution components. Together, these results define a layered transcriptional framework for ETI in Arabidopsis: a core set of conserved immune genes is broadly deployed, while modular, cell-specific programs likely tailor immune outputs in a spatially precise manner. This modular immune architecture likely enables plants to coordinate tissue-scale defense while optimizing energy use and in parallel restrict pathogen invasion.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Gene regulatory networks orchestrate cell-type-specific immune outputs</title><p id="P25">To elucidate how a uniform ETI activation translates into spatially heterogeneous immune execution, we examined the underlying regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional level. We intersected upregulated DEGs from pavement and mesophyll 1 clusters with genes previously shown to be both ETI-induced (bulk RNA-seq) and exhibit ETI-enhanced chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. This revealed a core set of chromatin-licensed immune genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B and 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5 and S6</xref>), likely under transcriptional control during early ETI, and broadly conserved across both pavement and mesophyll 1 cell types.</p><p id="P26">To further dissect upstream regulatory control, we mapped cell-type specific DEGs to the Arabidopsis transcription factor (TF) <italic>cistrome</italic> and <italic>epicistrome</italic> database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. The <italic>cistrome</italic> defines the genome-wide landscape of transcription factor binding, while the <italic>epicistrome</italic> extends this by incorporating epigenetic features, such as DNA methylation, that modulate TF-DNA interactions, thereby shaping functional access to regulatory DNA. Together, they provide a comprehensive view of how gene regulatory networks are both encoded and epigenetically tuned<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. WRKY, NAC, ERFs, MYB and bZIP TFs were prominently enriched in our analysis, consistent with established roles in plant immunity and suggesting that shared TF modules are deployed in distinct configurations across cell types to shape local defense outputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">Notably, the enriched TFs exhibited varied responses across cell types, reflecting diverse regulatory roles in immune activation. Pavement and mesophyll cells showed the highest number of DEGs and the strongest GO enrichment for immune-related processes. We therefore compared these two cell types to investigate transcriptional regulators underlying spatial specificity. Strikingly, <italic>WRKY8</italic> and <italic>SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE DEFICIENT 1</italic> (<italic>SARD1</italic>) were both exclusively expressed in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). Mapping to the <italic>cistrome</italic> and <italic>epicitrome</italic> database, WRKY8 was enriched at the promoters of a large fraction of pavement-specific ETI-induced DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), consistent with its proposed role as an epidermal immune amplifier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. SARD1, a master regulator known to act redundantly with CBP60g to regulate plant immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, was similarly epidermis-specific and targeted more than 80% of upregulated DEGs in this cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Together, these TFs accounted for the majority of regulatory activity in the epidermal immune network, underscoring their importance in orchestrating cell typeâ€“specific defense programs. Similar modular patterns were observed for other TFs with respect to other cell-types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), reinforcing idea that different TF families contribute to spatially specialized transcriptional circuits.</p><p id="P28">Collectively, these findings support a model in which ETI activation is interpreted through a preconfigured, cell-intrinsic transcriptional framework, governed by chromatin accessibility and transcription factor availability. This spatially modular regulatory architecture allows for the diversification of immune outputs despite a common upstream signal, enabling plants to finely tune defense intensity, coordinate intercellular signaling, and maintain metabolic balance under immune stress or during pathogen attack.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Epidermis-specific immune regulators restrict non-host pathogen entry at the leaf surface</title><p id="P29">While many immune-related genes were broadly expressed across all leaf cell types upon ETI induction, certain transcriptional regulator exhibited strikingly cell-type-specific induction patterns, suggesting functional compartmentalization in immune execution.

In contrast to WT plants, <italic>cbp60g sard1</italic> mutants permitted haustorial formation specifically in the epidermal and sub-epidermal cell layers, by not in deeper mesophyll tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). This indicates that while CBP60g and SARD1 are not globally required for ETI, they play a cell-type-specific role in restricting early pathogen entry at the leaf surface.</p><p id="P31">Despite their loss, ETI signaling in mesophyll cells appears intact, likely due to broad expression of core components such as EDS1, PAD4, and other transcriptional regulators like WRKY33 or E2Fs that may independently sustain immune competence in internal tissues. This reinforces the concept that cell-type-specific TF modules mediate immune execution in distinct spatial zones, with CBP60g and SARD1 acting as epidermis-enriched executors to enforce localized resistance against non-adapted pathogens. While we did not perform pathogen-infected single-cell profiling, our data provide a transcriptional reference framework for immune potential across cell types and highlight testable hypotheses for future spatial challenge assays.</p><p id="P32">Furthermore, testing additional pathogens with alternative invasion routes, such as <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic>, which penetrates directly through the epidermis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, may clarify whether CBP60g-and SARD1-dependent immunity represents a generalizable outer-layer defense strategy. Such studies will further refine our understanding of how immune competence and execution are partitioned across tissue layers to collectively enforce nonhost resistance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P33">Our study presents a single-cell transcriptional atlas of ETI in Arabidopsis leaves, enabled by the SETI system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, which uncouples immune activation by pathogen-derived cues (<italic>e.g</italic>. Mechanical perturbations, cell-wall integrity and apoplastic chemical matrix alternations, and cell-surface receptor-mediated signaling upon elicitor recognition, etc.) from the effects of pathogen effectors. This approach reveals how intracellular ETI is broadly perceived yet executed in a spatially heterogeneous manner across different cell types, offering new insights into the modular logic of plant immunity.</p><p id="P34">ETI activation via TIR-NLRs induces a widespread transcriptional competence across leaf cell types. Genes encoding core components such as EDS1, PAD4, SAG101 and enzymes involved in salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis are broadly expressed, indicating that immune signal transduction is not restricted to a specialized subset of cells within the leaf, but is accessible to diverse cell types. Nonetheless, specific immune outputs, including the NHP and JA pathways, are spatially restricted, suggesting compartmentalization of defense metabolism. These results imply that metabolic branches of ETI may follow cell-type-specific coordination, raising the need for future integration of single-cell metabolomics to map the immune metabolome with cellular precision.</p><p id="P35">At the gene regulatory level, our data support a layered and modular tissue architecture of immune control. While certain transcriptional modules are shared across cell types, others are distinctly partitioned. WRKY25 and WRKY70 exhibit broad deployment, whereas WRKY8 appears to function almost exclusively in pavement cells, regulating the majority of immune-induced genes in that cellular layer. Such spatial exclusivity is consistent with proposed role of WRKY8 in the PRIMER cell state. However, our results challenge the notion of the PRIMER state as a rare phenomenon. Instead, we propose that it represents a manifestation of differential ETI execution programs across cell types, embedded in their intrinsic components such as chromatin landscapes and transcription factor availability. The observed spatial heterogeneity reflects not a stochastic occurrence, but a structured immune regulatory mechanism encoded in tissue architecture. Other TFs, including WRKY17, WRKY33, E2Fs, and trihelix factors, further reinforce the diversity of transcriptional programs orchestrating immune output across spatial domains. This emphasizes that transcriptional immune competence is not synonymous with uniform immune execution. Despite shared upstream signaling through TIR-NLRs and EDS1, each cell type interprets immune signals through its own transcriptional lens, shaped by chromatin accessibility, TF availability, and cellular identity. This modular state likely allows plants to fine-tune defense intensity, optimize resource allocation, and coordinate systemic signaling in a spatially controlled manner.</p><p id="P36">Conventionally, nonhost resistance (NHR) represents a durable and broad-spectrum form of plant immunity, in which an entire plant species is resistant to all strains of a non-adapted pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. While traditionally attributed to preformed barriers and pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), recent studies suggest that intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors can also contribute to nonhost restriction, particularly through effector recognition and ETI-like responses in specific pathosystems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. For instance, Arabidopsis NLR WRR4A mediates resistance to multiple isolates of <italic>Brassica</italic>-infecting isolates of <italic>Albugo candida</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, by recognizing lineage-specific effectors and triggering localized immune activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Our results extend this model by demonstrating that spatially restricted transcriptional regulators such as CBP60g and SARD1 are essential for enforcing cell-type-specific resistance against non-adapted <italic>Albugo</italic> isolates, preventing pathogen ingress at the epidermal layer. In <italic>cbp60g sard1</italic> double mutants, <italic>A. candida</italic> haustoria are formed in cell types at the outer layer of the leaf tissue, despite intact immunity in underlying tissues. This provides direct evidence that immune competence alone is insufficient without proper transcriptional execution at vulnerable interfaces. It also underscores a broader principle: spatially localized immune regulators enforce layered defense barriers that guard vulnerable tissue interfaces, a robust framework that could likely be conserved across diverse plant-pathogen interactions. Building on this, future studies could extend similar analyses, combined with spatial omics approaches, to identify additional spatially enriched immune components and evaluate their cell typeâ€“specific functional relevance.</p><p id="P37">The hydathode, a specialized structure at the leaf margin that connects to the vasculature, exemplifies this principle. Unlike the epidermis, which confronts external pathogens, hydathodes represent potential internal entry points. Prior work has shown that hydathode immunity is mediated by EDS1-PAD4-ADR1 signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, and our findings extend this by identifying GT-family transcription factors and GT-3A paralogs, GT-3B and GT-4, as selectively induced in hydathodes during ETI. While GT-3A is expressed in almost all cell types during ETI activation, the restricted expression pattern of GT-3B and GT-4 suggests that these TFs constitute a hydathode immune regulatory module. This underscores how even uniformly activated ETI is interpreted through distinct local transcriptional regulation, shaped by structural vulnerability and functional necessity.</p><p id="P38">Our findings deliver several conceptual advances. First, we provide direct transcriptional evidence that innate immune competence is broadly encoded in all major cell types of the Arabidopsis leaf, supporting a model of fully distributed, cell-autonomous immunity. Second, we show that even under uniform activation of intracellular immunity, cell identity exerts a major constraint on the spectrum and strength of transcriptional output. This introduces the concept of cell-type-specific immune execution, highlighting new questions about how chromatin features, TF availability, and metabolic state shape these responses. Our dataset offers a valuable resource for future mechanistic studies into these layers of regulation. Third, our functional validation of the epidermis-enriched transcriptional regulators CBP60g and SARD1 establishes that NHR mediated by NLR-triggered ETI is not uniform across tissues but depends on precise execution in specific cell types. In <italic>cbp60g sard1</italic> double mutants, haustoria of resisted races of oomycete <italic>A. candida</italic> formed specifically in the epidermal and sub-epidermal cells, despite intact immunity in inner layers. This demonstrates that immune competence alone is insufficient without proper transcriptional execution at vulnerable tissue interfaces. These findings provide, to our knowledge, the first direct evidence that NLR-driven NHR displays cell-type specificity, with functional consequences for pathogen entry.</p><p id="P39">Altogether, our results define a spatially modular model of ETI, where uniformly initiated immune signaling is filtered through localized transcriptional programs. This allows for precise deployment of immunity, which is stronger in vulnerable cell types in Arabidopsis leaf tissue like the epidermis and hydathodes than elsewhere. These insights raise compelling research questions: What molecular features prime certain cells for heightened immune execution? Can spatial chromatin states predict immunocompetence? How do localized defenses coordinate with systemic signaling? Is infection spatially random, or shaped by hostâ€“pathogen combinations at the single-cell level? How do highly responsive cells compensate for neighboring cells with limited immune potential to maintain tissue-wide resilience?</p><p id="P40">In summary, this work provides a foundational framework for understanding cell-type-resolved immunity in plants. By demonstrating how immune signaling is broadly competent yet differentially executed, we reveal the principles of spatial immune execution. These insights offer a roadmap for engineering durable, precision immune responses in crops, tailored to the distinct roles and vulnerabilities of each cell type.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p id="P41"><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Col-0 ecotype was used as the wild-type background.
