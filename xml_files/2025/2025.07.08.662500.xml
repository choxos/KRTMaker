Because of the increased costs associated with these systems, optimal use of resources, such as cultivation space and light, is a requirement. This necessitates a detailed understanding of plant development in different light conditions. The aim of this experiment was to analyze the effect of photoperiod on the early development of seasonal flowering and everbearing strawberry plants, and to compare the expression of genes known or suspected to be involved in the regulation of plant development between the two flowering types. Young, runner-propagated seasonal flowering and everbearing strawberry plants were grown under 10, 12, 14, or 16 h photoperiod in a climate-controlled vertical farm. Morphological and physiological measurements were made weekly. Leaf material was collected for gene expression analysis. There were not many differences in plant growth and development between the short day conditions (10 and 12 h photoperiods), or long day conditions (14 and 16 h photoperiods). Short day conditions had a repressive effect on vegetative growth in all cultivars, but this effect was reduced in everbearing cultivars compared to seasonal flowering cultivars. No notable differences were found in gene expression between the two flowering types.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Photoperiod</kwd><kwd>Morphology</kwd><kwd>Vertical farm</kwd><kwd>endodormancy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Strawberry (<italic>Fragaria</italic> x <italic>ananassa</italic> Duch.) is a popular and economically important fruit crop. The Netherlands produces around 80 million kg of strawberries yearly, in open soil, in plastic tunnels (polytunnels), and in greenhouses<sup>1</sup>. Strawberry yield has doubled since the year 2000. However, because more cultivation is done in greenhouses, which is more space efficient than open field cultivation, the area dedicated to strawberry production has not increased in the last decades<sup>1,2</sup>.</p><p id="P3">The relatively small size of the plant and the high market value and demand for the fruit makes strawberry a suitable candidate for vertical farm cultivation<sup>3</sup>. Vertical farms are indoor cultivation systems with controlled environments. Instead of sunlight, artificial is applied to drive photosynthesis. Typically, they contain vertically stacked growing layers or multiple cultivation floors<sup>4</sup>. These systems offer several benefits over cultivation in open field or greenhouses, such as year-round cultivation, independent of weather or climate, and a reduction in environmental pollution by pesticides and fertilizers<sup>4</sup>. However, the technology required for VFS cultivation result in high costs. This necessitates that, to be competitive, resources are optimally utilized and yield is maximized. A detailed understanding of early plant development, and how it is influenced by different photoperiods, would facilitate this.</p><p id="P4">Strawberry cultivars can be distinguished based on flowering type. Seasonal flowering cultivars require exposure to short day conditions for flower initiation and produce a single flush of flowers<sup>5,6</sup>. Exposure to long day conditions inhibits flower initiation but stimulates vegetative growth. In commercial cultivation, after the fruit harvest, seasonal flowering plants are typically replaced by a later-flowering cultivar. Everbearing cultivars initiate flowers under long day conditions and as such do not require exposure to short day conditions for flower initiation<sup>7</sup>. They also produce fruits over an extended period compared to seasonal flowering types<sup>8</sup>.</p><p id="P5">The aim of this experiment is to analyze the effect of photoperiod on the early development of seasonal flowering and everbearing strawberry plants, and to compare the expression of genes known or suspected to be involved in developmental regulation between the two flowering types. Young runner propagated plants were grown in a VFS under four different photoperiods (10, 12, 14, or 16 h). Plant morphology was analyzed weekly and after 10 weeks a destructive harvest was conducted. We analyzed the expression of several genes (suspected to be) involved in the regulation of vegetative and generative growth.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Plant material</title><p id="P6">Two seasonal flowering and two everbearing cultivars were used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Plants were provided by breeding company Fresh Forward (Huissen, The Netherlands), where they were propagated from runners on June 1, 2023, and grown in plugs under long day conditions in the greenhouse. On June 16, 2023, the plants were transported to Wageningen University. All leaves besides the two or three youngest were removed to ensure uniformity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Growing conditions</title><p id="P7">The experiment was conducted in a climate cell (Wageningen University and Research). The climate cell contained three levels with four cultivation compartments on each level, for a total of 12 compartments. Each compartment measured 250 by 80 cm and contained 16 plants, four of each cultivar. Light was provide with LED lamps (GPL PM 168 DRBWFR_R L120 3.1 C4, Signify, Eindhoven, the Netherlands). The spectral composition (400-499 nm: 23%; 500-599 nm: 37%; 600-699 nm: 27%; 700-799 nm: 13%) was measured with a spectroradiometer (model SS-110, Apogee Instruments, Logan, UT, USA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 1</xref>). Plants were irrigated with nutrient solution by an ebb and flow system. The frequency of irrigation was adjusted throughout the experiment according to the rate of liquid uptake by the plants. Relative humidity and temperature in each compartment were continuously measured with a sensor (Onset, HOBO MX2300) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 2, Supplement 3</xref>). The plants were acclimated to the conditions in the climate cell by growing them under a 13 h photoperiod (231 µmol·m<sup>-2</sup>·sec<sup>-1</sup>) for ten days before the treatment period. On June 23, 2023, from each cultivar, 48 plants were selected and potted in 2 L pots with coconut fiber, peat, and perlite (40:40:20 ratio) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Treatments</title><p id="P8">On June 26, 2023, photoperiod treatments were started. There were four different treatments consisting of a 10, 12, 14 or 16 h photoperiod. The light intensity was adjusted so that each treatment had a daily light integral (DLI) of 10.8 mol·m<sup>-2</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The treatment period lasted until September 13, 2023.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Measurements</title><p id="P9">At the start of the treatment period, five surplus plants of each cultivar were selected for (destructive) analysis of the crowns and meristems, also known as flower mapping. In this process, the number of crowns, as well as the location and developmental stage of the meristem positions were described (Planta Logica, Ede, the Netherlands). During the treatment period of the experiment, vegetative development and flowering were analyzed. On a weekly basis, the youngest fully developed leaf was selected (defined as the second youngest, fully opened leaf), of which the following measurements were taken: The width of the left leaf lobe and the length of the middle lobe; The length of the petiole; Chlorophyll content was estimated with an optical sensor (Force-A, Dualex, Orsay, France). Leaf area (LA) was calculated from individual leaf lobe measurements, according to the method described by Demirsoy <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Equation 1</xref>)<sup>9</sup>. <disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.89</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2.145</mml:mn><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P10"><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Equation 1</xref><bold>, estimation of leaf area from lobe measurements.

Flowers were removed as soon as or before they reached the small green stage of fruit development, to limit the effect on the assimilate balance. At the end of the experiment, on September 13, 2023, the final destructive measurements were done. Of each plant, the total number of leaves, total leaf area, fresh and dry weight (dried in the oven at 105°C for 48 hours) of all leaves was measured. Afterwards, four plants of each of the seasonal flowering cultivars were selected for flower mapping.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Leaf sample collection</title><p id="P12">Leaf material was taken on June 27, July 18, August 8, and August 29, 2023 (weeks 1, 4, 7 and 10 of the treatment period). Two 1 cm diameter leaf disks were taken from two leaf lobes of the second youngest leaf. Leaf material of plants of the same cultivar in the same compartment was combined and subsequently flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. All leaf material was collected within the first hour after the lights switched on.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>RNA extraction</title><p id="P13">Leaf material frozen in liquid nitrogen was finely ground in a ball mill grinder (Retsch, MM400, Haan, Germany). RNA was extracted from the plant samples using the CTAB method (adapted from Schultz <italic>et al</italic>. 1994<sup>10</sup>) with lithium chloride precipitation. All centrifuge steps were done in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed. In a 2 mL tube, 750 µL extraction buffer (1.4M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA pH8, 100 mM TRIS pH8, 2% CTAB, 2% PVP-40, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, milli-Q water (MQ) to 750 µL) was added to ±50 mg of frozen leaf powder. Samples were incubated 15 min at 65°C. 750 µL chloroform was added and samples were centrifuged at max speed for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a tube with 500 µL isopropanol, homogenized and centrifuged at max speed for 5 min. Supernatant was removed and pellet was washed with 70% ethanol. The pellet was dissolved in 205 µL MQ and RNA was precipitated by adding 67 µL 8M LiCl and incubating for 30 min at -20°C. The RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at max speed for 30 min at 4°C. Pellet was washed once more with 70% ethanol, air dried for 5 minutes and dissolved in 50 µL MQ.

F-probabilities below 0.05 were considered significant. Fisher’s unprotected LSD test was applied for multiple comparisons. On the meristem analysis before the treatment period, a one-way ANOVA with cultivar as the factor was performed in SPSS Statistics (IBM, v28.0.1.1 (15)).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P17">We did not find any differences in any of the measured traits (petiole length, leaf area, and chlorophyll content) between the two short (10 and 12 h), or between the two long photoperiods (14 and 16 h) in any cultivar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Due to increasingly severe tip-burn from week 4 onwards in ‘SF_Fan’, the following section primarily focusses on the measurements of ‘SF_Els’, ‘EB_Fav’ and ‘EB_D08’.</p><p id="P18">Day lengths of 14 and 16 h caused the petioles of newly emerged leaves to gradually lengthen over the treatment period in all cultivars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In ‘SF_Els’, the 10 and 12 h photoperiods resulted in a decrease in petiole length, especially between weeks 4 and 6. In the everbearing types (‘EB_Fav’ and ‘EB_D08’), petiole length did not decrease during the treatment period, although the petioles of plants in short day conditions were shorter compared to those of the plants in long day conditions.</p><p id="P19">In all cultivars, the long photoperiods increased the leaf area of newly emerged leaves compared to the short photoperiods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). In ‘SF_Els’, the leaf size of plants in long photoperiods was considerably larger than in the everbearing types. The leaf size of plants in short photoperiods was similar between all cultivars, especially in the second half of the treatment period, after the effects of the pre-treatment had worn off.</p><p id="P20">In all cultivars, short photoperiods increased leaf chlorophyll content compared to long photoperiods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

Under 10 and 12 h photoperiods, runner production in all cultivars was very low or completely halted before the end of the treatment period. Under 14 and 16 h photoperiods, some cultivars produced runners throughout the treatment period, such as ‘SF_Els’ under 16 h photoperiod, or ‘EB_D08’ under 14 h photoperiod. In ‘EB_Fav’, runner production peaked in week 5, after which it decreased until runner production had ceased by the end of the treatment period.</p><p id="P22">Plants of the cultivar SF_Els did not produce any flowers. ‘SF_Fan’ produced a few flowers under 12 h photoperiod in the last four weeks of the treatment period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Both everbearing cultivars flowered. Flowering started later in ‘EB_Fav’, but the rate of flower emergence was higher than in ‘EB_D08’. No photoperiodic effect was found on the starting time or rate of flower emergence in either everbearing cultivar.</p><p id="P23">In all cultivars, except ‘SF_Fan’, 14 and 16 h photoperiods resulted in an increase in total leaf area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>). This increase is explained by an increase in leaf area per leaf under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>), which was observed in all cultivars, and not by an increase in number of leaves. In seasonal flowering cultivars the number of leaves decreased under 14 and 16 h photoperiods, compared to the 10 and 12 h photoperiods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>). In the everbearing cultivars no such effect was found. Similar to total leaf area, the leaf dry weight increased in long photoperiods in all cultivars except ‘SF_Fan’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>). Photoperiod did not affect the leaf dry matter content or the specific leaf area of any cultivar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8E-F</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Before the treatment period, all plants of each cultivar had one crown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). The everbearing cultivars both contained generative meristem while the seasonal flowering cultivars were completely vegetative at this point. After the treatment period the seasonal flowering cultivars were analyzed again. Under 10 and 12 h photoperiod, the amount of crowns had increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10A</xref>). In ‘SF_Els’, under 10 and 12 h photoperiod the number of positions was higher compared to long day 14 and 16 h photoperiod. In ‘SF_Fan’ no significant effect of photoperiod on number of meristem positions was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10B</xref>). The average number of meristem positions per crown was lower under 10 and 12 h photoperiod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10C</xref>). The percentage of generative meristem was significantly higher under 10 and 12 h photoperiod in both cultivars, as the majority of plants did not develop generative meristem under 14 and 16 h photoperiod.</p><p id="P25">The expression of <italic>SOC1</italic> decreased under 10 h photoperiod in all cultivars, while under 16 h photoperiod <italic>SOC1</italic> expression remained relatively high. <italic>CO</italic> expression was found to vary over time and between cultivars and did not respond consistently to photoperiod, but generally <italic>CO</italic> expression was lower under the 16 h photoperiod. <italic>DAM3</italic> expression increased under 10 h photoperiod in the first seven weeks of the treatment period, after which it stabilized or decreased slightly.

Under the 10 and 12 h photoperiods, ‘SF_Els’ had decreased petiole length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) and leaf area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), increased chlorophyll content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) and leaf appearance rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>), as well as flower initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). The developmental and physiological responses that we observed are consistent with the induction of endodormancy and indicate a short day developmental response under these photoperiods<sup>19,20</sup>. In ‘SF_Els’, no generative development occurred under the 14 and 16 h photoperiods, indicating a long day developmental response. Little to no difference was found in vegetative and generative development between the short photoperiods (10 and 12 h) or the long photoperiods (14 and 16 h), contrasting with the results of Heide (1977), who reported a continuous response of petiole length on photoperiod in multiple cultivars<sup>5</sup>. The destructive harvest after the treatment period yielded a result similar to the weekly measurements. The results indicate a qualitative response of vegetative development to photoperiod with the critical daylength between 12 and 14 h.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Long day conditions improved vegetative growth in all cultivars</title><p id="P28">Under the 14 and 16 h photoperiods (long day conditions), we observed increased vegetative growth in the four cultivars included in the experiment. The leaf area of individual leaves was generally smaller in the everbearing cultivars compared to ‘SF_Els’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). However, both everbearing cultivars produced more leaves than ‘SF_Els’, which ultimately resulted in a higher total leaf area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Under long day conditions, petiole length of newly emerged leaves of the everbearing cultivars was typically as high or even higher than that of ‘SF_Els’. Petiole length is considered an important trait, as proper petiole extension may improve light interception<sup>21</sup>. Moreover, petiole length is often used as a measure of general vegetative growth in strawberry research<sup>5,18,22,23</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Photoperiodic effect on vegetative growth is reduced in the everbearing cultivars</title><p id="P29">Long day conditions improved vegetative growth in ‘EB_Fav’ and ‘EB_D08’, compared to short day conditions. The differences in vegetative growth between short and long day conditions were less extreme in these everbearing cultivars. Under short day conditions, the petiole length of the everbearing cultivars increased until the end of the treatment period, albeit at a reduced rate compared to long day conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). While long day conditions increased the leaf area of individual leaves in the everbearing cultivars, the photoperiodic effect was much smaller compared to ‘SF_Els’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast to ‘SF_Els’, there was no clear negative effect of long day conditions on the amount of leaves produced in the everbearing cultivars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). This coincides with the findings of Rivero <italic>et al.</italic> (2021) in ‘EB_Fav’ and a third everbearing cultivar, ‘Delizzimo’<sup>7</sup>. The decreased photoperiod effect on vegetative development in everbearing types resulted in more similar looking plants between short and long day conditions compared to ‘SF_Els’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 4</xref>). Interestingly, not all vegetative traits had reduced sensitivity to photoperiodic regulation in the everbearing types. Leaf chlorophyll content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), runner production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), total leaf area and leaf dry weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>) all responded similarly to photoperiodic regulation in both flowering types. The everbearing phenotype is the result of a genetic mutation which alters the regulation of generative development<sup>6,24</sup>. The precise nature of this mutation is as of yet not fully understood. The differences in plant development we observed could be a result of the genetic difference which causes the everbearing flowering type. However, findings from two everbearing cultivars are not necessarily representative for all everbearing cultivars and might be unrelated to the locus which causes everbearing behavior.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Effect of photoperiod on flowering</title><p id="P30">Photoperiodic treatments did not affect the rate of flowering in both everbearing cultivars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). An earlier study found that ‘EB_Fav’ did not flower during 10 weeks of pretreatment at long day conditions<sup>7</sup>. This suggests that the treatment period of the current study may have been too short to show the photoperiodic effect, and that the flowers which emerged were initiated during the pre-treatment (which applied the same photoperiod to all subsequent treatment groups). Interestingly, flower emergence was not affected by photoperiod but runner production was reduced, especially in ‘EB_Fav’. After flower initiation these plants could be grown under short day conditions to prevent runnering. This would impact vegetative growth, but it would also reduce the need for removal of runners, which might be beneficial in circumstances were manual intervention needs to be kept to a minimum.</p><p id="P31">The seasonal flowering cultivars had no generative meristem at the start of the treatment period, implying that subsequent generative growth had initiated during the treatment period. This indicates that the photoperiod of 13 hours that we applied during acclimation before the treatment period caused a long day response in these cultivars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A</xref>). A clear difference in flower initiation during the treatment period was found between short day (10 and 12 h) and long day conditions (14 and 16 h) in both seasonal flowering cultivars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9B-C</xref>). No difference in generative growth was found between the two short photoperiods, or between the two long photoperiods. Although ‘SF_Els’ and ‘SF_Fan’ initiated flowers under short day conditions, few to no flowers emerged on these plants, reenforcing the possibility that the treatment period of ten weeks was too short to show an effect on flower emergence.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Gene expression analysis</title><p id="P32">The expression level and patterns of several genes involved in the regulation of the balance between vegetative and generative growth were analyzed for differences between seasonal flowering and everbearing types.</p><p id="P33"><italic>SOC1</italic> is a transcription factor which integrates environmental signals and negatively regulates generative growth by inducing expression of the anti-florigen <italic>TFL1.</italic> This gene has been shown to promote vegetative development in wild as well as cultivated strawberry<sup>13,25</sup>. <italic>SOC1</italic> expression in the first week of the experimental period was similar between the short day and long day treatments, likely due to the pre-treatment conditions which were equal for all plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). In the short day treatment, <italic>SOC1</italic> expression reached its lowest point by week four of the treatment period. In ‘SF_Els’ plants grown under short day conditions, this coincided with the peak of leaf area and petiole length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Contrasting with the other cultivars, in ‘SF_Fan’ an increase in <italic>SOC1</italic> expression was observed by the end of the treatment period, but it is unclear if gene expression has been affected by tip burn, which affected most of the leaves of this cultivar.</p><p id="P34">Arabidopsis (<italic>At</italic>), <italic>CO</italic> is a key regulator of photoperiodism. Under long days the CO protein induces flowering through the florigen <italic>FT1</italic><sup>26</sup>. Research on woodland strawberry (<italic>F. vesca</italic>) indicates it is likely involved in photoperiodism in strawberry as well<sup>27,28</sup>. However, the expression pattern of strawberry <italic>CO</italic> does not coincide with that of <italic>AtCO</italic>, and the exact role of <italic>CO</italic> in the photoperiodic regulation of development in strawberry is still unclear<sup>13</sup>. Muñoz-Avila (2022), found significantly higher <italic>CO</italic> expression in long day conditions compared to short day conditions<sup>13</sup>. Contrastingly, we generally found <italic>CO</italic> to be lower expressed in long day conditions, and in multiple instances no difference was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). A notable difference is that in Muñoz-Avila (2022), the plants were exposed to the natural photoperiod. Plants were sampled in December and in June to obtain samples from short-day and long-day grown plants. This means that there is a difference in plant age and developmental stage between the short day and long day treatment which may explain the discrepancy between their findings and ours.</p><p id="P35"><italic>DAM3</italic> and <italic>DAM4</italic> are homologs of the <italic>Dormancy-associated MADS-box</italic> genes, first identified in peach<sup>6,29,30</sup>. Previously, we showed that <italic>DAM3</italic> and <italic>DAM4</italic> have similar expression patterns and that these genes are down-regulated in chilling conditions (2°C). We consider these genes candidates for master regulators of endodormancy in strawberry<sup>14</sup>. Here we show that <italic>DAM3</italic> and <italic>DAM4</italic> are upregulated under the influence of short day conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). Both everbearing cultivars experienced higher peaks in <italic>DAM3</italic> expression under short day conditions than the seasonal flowering cultivars. Interestingly, we also observed a gradual increase in <italic>DAM3</italic> expression under long day conditions in all cultivars, most notably in ‘SF_Els’ and ‘Favori’.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Cultivar-specific vulnerability to tip burn in VFS environment</title><p id="P36">During the treatment period leaves of some of the plants were affected by tip burn. To remedy this problem, the difference in relative humidity between day and night time was increased, with the higher humidity during night time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 3</xref>). This mostly resolved the tip burn problem. However, ‘SF_Fan’ was most gravely affected by tip burn, and, contrary to the other cultivars, did not recover after the climate settings were adjusted. For that reason, the discussion focusses on the other cultivars with respect to vegetative growth and development.</p><p id="P37">Under longer daylengths, slightly more leaves were affected by tip burn (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement 5</xref>).
