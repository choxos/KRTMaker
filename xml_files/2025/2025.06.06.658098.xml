We report that initial, very rapid translational silencing is driven by a specialized metabolic mechanism. Following glucose withdrawal, intracellular NTP levels drop drastically over 30 sec, before stabilizing at a regulated, post-stress set-point. Programmed translational control results from the differential NTP affinities of key enzymes; ATP falls below the (high) binding constants for DEAD-box helicase initiation factors, including eIF4A, driving mRNA release and blocking 80S assembly. Contrastingly, GTP levels always greatly exceed the (low) binding constants for elongation factors, allowing ribosome run-off and orderly translation shutdown. Translation initiation is immediately lost on all pre-existing mRNAs, before being preferentially re-established on newly synthesized, upregulated stress-response transcripts. We conclude that enzymatic constants are tuned for metabolic remodeling. This response counters energy depletion, rather than being glucose-specific, allowing hierarchical inhibition of energy-consuming processes on very rapid timescales.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>translation regulation</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>RNA-protein interaction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">All cells face the fundamental challenge of providing a constant supply of energy, in the context of a rapidly shifting nutritional environment. The budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> grows rapidly on glucose using “aerobic fermentation”, with ATP production almost exclusively from glycolysis (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>). Preferential use of aerobic fermentation to quickly generate ATP occurs across diverse systems, including human skeletal muscles, activated T-cells and tumors, where it is termed the “Warburg effect” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">In response to glucose depletion, yeast and other organisms undergo “diauxic shift”. This entails a comprehensive transcriptional re-programming, in which hundreds of genes required for stress-responses and utilization of alternative carbon sources are upregulated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Simultaneously, expression of ribosome maturation and protein synthesis factors is suppressed. However, at nutrient shift the cellular mRNA pool is composed of pre-existing transcripts produced under glucose-replete conditions. Reprogramming is therefore complemented by more rapid post-transcriptional changes to acutely modify the functional proteome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Notably, global mRNA translation is dramatically reduced within minutes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>This is selectively bypassed for specific stress-induced transcripts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Together, this allows yeast to mount protective responses and dynamically alter metabolism immediately following glucose withdrawal.</p><p id="P4">Translation repression is a common response to numerous stresses, including temperature and osmotic shock, generally targeting initiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Notably, translational shut-down following glucose withdrawal is distinct in both speed and scale <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. We previously reported that this results from a specific mechanism, in which key initiation factors are displaced from the 5’ regions of mRNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Recruitment of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits at the start codon of a transcript is mediated by ‘scanning’ initiation factors, which unwind secondary structures in the mRNA and promote 43S-complex loading. These are eIF4B and two DEAD-box RNA helicases, eIF4A and Ded1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Following glucose withdrawal, loss of binding by these factors blocks formation of 80S ribosomes. Translation activity ceases as elongating ribosomes reach the termination codons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig1A</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Remarkably, glucose-dependent initiation factor release occurred within 30 sec, the earliest time point that could be tested <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. These proteins are extremely abundant; eIF4A is comparable in copies to the ribosome (~150,000 per cell), while eIF4B and Ded1 also exceed 25,000 copies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The rapid regulation of such abundant targets presents a challenge: information on glucose depletion must be sensed, transmitted and amplified to alter protein binding within seconds. While rapid regulation of RNA-protein interactions mediates post-transcriptional responses to many cellular stresses, this is an unprecedented timescale of response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Here, we set out to investigate the mechanisms allowing yeast cells to achieve seconds-level remodeling of RNA metabolism following glucose withdrawal.</p><p id="P6">Although implicated in the response of yeast cells to multiple stresses, depleting intracellular pH did not recapitulate the effects of glucose depletion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Considering other metabolite regulators, we noted that the DEAD-box helicase initiation factors are ATP-dependent RNA binding proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. This requirement for ATP means their binding activity is subject to kinetic effects, alongside control by protein-protein interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Hypothesizing glucose-dependent changes, we discovered that rapid remodeling of NTP levels drives translation shutdown. This is a distinct mechanism from the major well-characterized stress-signaling pathways, and can be triggered by energy depletion without carbon source shift. The resulting translation shutdown is global, prior to preferential restoration on newly synthesized mRNAs. We conclude a biphasic adaptive response to energy stress: Metabolic remodeling, acting in seconds, mediates immediate protective changes in RNA metabolism, with subsequent transcriptional regulation by kinase/phosphatase cascades acting over minutes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Rapid NTP depletion and initiation factor displacement</title><p id="P7">The translational response to glucose withdrawal is remarkably rapid, with global initiation shutdown achieved on a timescale of seconds. This appeared to be excessively fast for regulation by conventional stress-responsive signaling cascades. Contrastingly, levels of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) have been reported to change rapidly following loss of glucose in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The DEAD-box helicases are predicted to require ATP to support translation initiation, suggesting the possibility that an abrupt drop in ATP levels and/or ATP:ADP ratios might be responsible for their displacement from mRNA 5’ UTRs. In contrast, the major translation elongation factors utilize GTP. We hypothesized that the distinction in NTP utilization could underpin a mechanism for translation regulation acting on timescales shorter than most previous analyses.</p><p id="P8">We established rapid protocols to characterize changes in metabolites and RNA metabolism on a timescale of seconds. Nutrient shift and harvesting of exponential yeast cultures followed by metabolic quenching was achieved within 10 sec total time, or UV crosslinking within 30 sec (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig. S1A</xref>). NTP and NDP levels were quantified using targeted HPLC separation coupled with UV detection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Quantified NTP recoveries were used to estimate intracellular nucleotide concentrations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Rapid time courses over the first minute following glucose withdrawal were performed in biological triplicate and compared to mock shifts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig. S1B</xref>). The results were highly reproducible.</p><p id="P9">We initially applied this approach to a switch from medium containing 2% glucose (Glu), to medium lacking glucose but containing 2% glycerol plus 2% ethanol (Glyc/EthOH) to mimic diauxic shift. The measured intracellular ATP level was close to 2mM during growth on glucose medium. Following transfer to Glyc/EthOH medium, ATP dropped ~7-fold to below 0.3 mM by 30 sec, remaining at this level through the 60 sec timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs.1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">S1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). Contrastingly, the cellular ADP concentration in glucose medium was 0.18 mM, but rose to 0.45 mM by 30 sec after transfer to Glyc/EthOH. In consequence, ADP rapidly became dominant over ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">S2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). These changes make it likely that many ATP-utilizing proteins are subject to both limiting substrate availability and product inhibition by ADP, within seconds of glucose withdrawal.</p><p id="P10">Our original model for selective loss of translation initiation postulated that elongation may be favored by delayed depletion of GTP relative to ATP. However, GTP, CTP and UTP were each depleted on a comparable timescale to ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). In particular, the starting GTP concentration of 0.46 mM fell to 89 µM by 30 sec of transfer to Glyc/EthOH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig. S1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). We therefore considered whether there might be differences in the NTP binding constants for the translation initiation and elongation factors. Based on published data, eIF4A and Ded1 both show low affinity for ATP, with binding constants of 540µM and 300µM respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. These values are consistent with other DEAD-box ATPases reported from yeast <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. In consequence, ATP depletion following glucose withdrawal causes intracellular concentration to fall well below the Km within 30 sec. Due to DEAD-box ATPases binding ATP and RNA cooperatively, this is expected to result in release from mRNAs. Furthermore, eIF4A displays affinity for ADP an order of magnitude greater than for ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). ADP binding promotes an ‘open’ state with low affinity for RNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. The rapid dominance of ADP following loss of glucose will therefore block further mRNA binding.</p><p id="P11">In contrast, reported binding affinities for GTPase elongation factors are very much lower: for example 140 nM for eEF1A (Cavallius and Merrick, 1998). The measured GTP concentrations remain an order of magnitude above this value after transfer to Glyc/EthOH, so their continued function is expected after glucose withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To confirm the timescale of initiation factor displacement from mRNA transcripts, we developed a poly(A) interactome capture approach. RNAs were UV crosslinked to bound proteins in cells grown in glucose or at timepoints immediately following transfer to Glc/EthOH medium. Poly(A)+ RNAs were purified from cell lysates using oligo[dT]<sub>25</sub> beads. Binding of FLAG-tagged initiation factors was quantified by western blotting and Licor imaging, using Pab1 as positive control for input and pull-down efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>) This revealed that eIF4A is lost from mRNA transcripts, reaching undetectable levels within 30 sec, consistent with NTP remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>). eIF4B is the binding partner of eIF4A, and showed equivalently reduced mRNA interactions over the same timescale. Recovery of eIF4B was much lower in non-crosslinked controls, and eliminated by competition with artificial poly(A) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig S1C</xref>), confirming binding specificity. We conclude that the entire 43S loading complex is displaced from total mRNA within 30 sec.</p><p id="P13">From these results, we propose that a 'Differential Affinity' mechanism drives translational arrest following glucose withdrawal. ATP depletion to below the binding constants for the DEAD-box helicase initiation factors (~0.35-0.54mM) leads to reduced RNA affinity and directly blocks the translation initiation process. In contrast, GTP levels remain well above the very low (~140nM) binding constants for elongation factors, supporting continued function. Together, this results in orderly translation shutdown by preventing 80S ribosome assembly while allowing polysome run-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ATP depletion induces translational arrest independent of carbon source shift</title><p id="P14">To investigate whether changes in ATP concentrations are sufficient to arrest initiation, we characterized the translational response to intracellular ATP depletion independent of carbon source shift. For this we utilized the mitochondrial inhibitor Antimycin A (AA), which blocks ATP generation through respiration. Although the BY4741 yeast strain growing in 2% sucrose shows highly similar glycolytic growth to on glucose (see below), there is an increased metabolic contribution from respiration when utilizing the disaccharide. Under these conditions, AA strongly reduced intracellular NTP pools without an external change in carbon source availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>).</p><p id="P15">NTP depletion occurred on a minute time scale after AA addition, allowing comparison of the timescales of metabolic remodeling and translation arrest. Although NTP depletion after AA addition was slower than following glucose withdrawal, by 4 min intracellular ATP levels had fallen to 0.1 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">S1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). This is well below the binding constant of eIF4A. Polysome gradient analyses, performed after 10 min to allow time for ribosome runoff, demonstrate the loss of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Poly(A) interactome capture at the same time point confirmed the reduction in eIF4A binding to mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>). Polysome profiling on aliquots of the same culture are consistent with reduced eIF4A binding to mRNAs driving polysome collapse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig. S1E</xref>).</p><p id="P16">These results support ATP-dependent binding as a direct regulator of translation initiation factor function.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>NTP remodeling is actively controlled</title><p id="P17">The glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 2 (Hxk2) has been implicated in regulating transcriptional and post-transcriptional responses to glucose availability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Consistent with previous data, a <italic>hxk2</italic>Δ strain showed resistance to rapid translation arrest following glucose depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In wild-type cells polysome collapse occurs within 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), whereas these were maintained at 10 min and 25 min in <italic>hxk2</italic>Δ strains, indicating ongoing translation initiation. We considered whether this might reflect reduced metabolic flux through the glycolytic pathway favoring respiratory metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. However, <italic>hxk2</italic>Δ strains showed a wildtype growth rate on glucose and (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig. S2A</xref>) and were almost insensitive to AA, indicating little dependence on mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig. S2A</xref>). Yeast expresses two other hexose kinases (Hxk1 and Glk1), which are sufficient to maintain glycolytic flux.</p><p id="P18">Analyses of NTP levels indicate that continued translation in <italic>hxk2</italic>Δ mutants results instead from an altered metabolic response to glucose withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">S2B-2D</xref>). The intracellular NTP concentrations decline initially (15 sec) comparably to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, ATP levels then plateau at around 1mM, and this is maintained for at least 16 min. Concentrations of ADP and AMP also remain relatively stable in the <italic>hxk2</italic>Δ strain, as do the pools of CTP, UTP and GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">S2B-2C</xref>). Since ATP levels remains well above the binding constants for the DEAD-box initiation factors, these results are consistent with ongoing translation initiation.</p><p id="P19">Notably, following initial depletion, the reduced ATP concentration also remains stable in wild-type strains over 16 min post-stress, as do ADP and AMP pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">S2D</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the depletion of NTPs, and dramatic alteration of adenylate nucleotide ratios, following glucose depletion is not simply an inevitable consequence of energy deprivation. Rather, a regulated response controls remodeling to achieve a new “set-point” for NTP levels.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Rapidly growing yeast are primed for protective post-transcriptional responses</title><p id="P20">In previous analyses, the timescale and effects of glucose depletion were distinct from withdrawal form alternative sugars <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. These less readily metabolized sugars are expected to be predominately metabolized via mitochondrial respiration. We postulated that NTP remodeling on a second timescale occurs only in cells ‘primed’ by fast glycolytic growth to initiate a protective adaptation of metabolism under energy stress.</p><p id="P21">We used Antimycin A (AA) to assess relative dependence on oxidative phosphorylation. Yeast growing on raffinose displayed a lag period of 14 h, in response to very low doses of AA and failed to saturate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Comparatively, yeast grown on sucrose demonstrated low AA sensitivity, only mildly greater than on glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">S4A</xref>). Thus, sucrose and raffinose promote primarily glycolytic or slower respiratory growth, respectively. The doubling time on sucrose medium (~97 min) is similar to glucose (~98 min) but substantially faster than on raffinose (148 min) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig. S3A</xref>). Corresponding to these differences in metabolic state, we observe that transfer from raffinose medium did not cause precipitous NTP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">S3B</xref>), whereas shift from sucrose led to rapid loss of ATP equivalent to glucose withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">S3C</xref>). Consistent with this, following raffinose withdrawal eIF4A was retained on mRNA over minute time courses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Polysomes were retained 10 min post-withdrawal, supporting ongoing translation initiation and protein synthesis. Conversely sucrose withdrawal caused loss of eIF4A binding to mRNA in &lt;1 min and polysome collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We conclude the regulated NTP remodeling response to carbon source withdrawal is not glucose-specific, but a feature of fast-growing yeast.

To maintain these mRNAs in the data set, they were assigned “pseudo-counts” of 0.5 reads per million (RPM). For eIF4A, &gt;50% of transcripts were not detected after stress. In consequence, we focused on eIF4B datasets for subsequent analyses.</p><p id="P30">We compared eIF4B binding to mRNAs on glucose and after transfer to Glyc/EthOH for 30 sec (no glucose) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Transcripts were filtered to produce a high confidence set (n =4,377), with reliable quantification (&gt;0.5 RPM) in all replicates of at least one condition, removing mRNAs with very low expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table.

Indeed, many lose binding sufficiently to fall below the detection threshold and appear in the imputed subset (lower horizontal line, n = 902), and eIF4B binding averaged for just this, subsequently induced, group is lower than for all mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Across the transcriptome, eIF4B binding immediately following glucose depletion (30 sec) shows no evident preference for mRNAs that are subsequently transcriptionally upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p><p id="P32">We also compared the location of eIF4B binding on individual mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">S5C</xref>); including selected, abundant “housekeeping” mRNAs (shown for ACT1, RPL25 and RPB2), induced, stress-responsive mRNAs (HSP12, HSP42, HSP82, HSP104, HSP26) and upregulated glycolytic enzymes (HXK1, GSY1). On Glucose, most mRNAs show a clear peak of eIF4B binding around the AUG, as expected. At 30 sec after glucose depletion, eIF4B binding has been almost entirely lost on all mRNAs. At 16 min the housekeeping mRNAs remain very abundant, but show little restoration of eIF4B binding. In marked contrast, the induced genes show substantially increased eIF4B binding. However, alongside the 5’ peak there was increased binding throughout the body of the transcript. These strongly upregulated mRNA populations must largely consist of RNAs synthesized post-shift, whereas housekeeping transcripts will have been predominantly produced prior to this.</p><p id="P33">We postulated that the newly synthesized pool of each mRNA species has preferential access to the translation machinery. Supporting this, we compared the re-establishment of eIF4B binding on the sets of transcriptionally induced or repressed transcripts, defined by RNAseq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>). 16 min after glucose depletion, strongly up-regulated transcripts nearly all showed increased eIF4B binding. In contrast, down-regulated transcripts predominately show reduced eIF4B binding; with 44% lost below detectable levels.</p><p id="P34">Preferential availability of newly transcribed mRNA species might reflect exclusion from condensates that sequester pre-existing mRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

We therefore assessed protein synthesis by metabolic labeling of nascent polypeptides using the “clickable” methionine analogue L-Azidohomoalanine (AHA). Labelling was performed for 16 min in glucose medium, or for 16 min immediately following transfer from glucose to glycerol/ethanol medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>). Total proteins were extracted, and newly synthesized proteins were purified by copper-catalyzed, covalent linkage to an alkyne-agarose resin. Following stringent washing, peptides were released by trypsin digestion and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). The total proteome was quantified in parallel and all replicates showed good correlation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Fig. S6</xref>). Unlabeled controls were included.

Differential proteomic expression analysis identified relatively enriched proteins following AHA-labeling, while no proteins were significantly enriched in the unlabeled control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6E</xref>). The most induced proteins are stress response factors and hexose transporters (labeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>).

These show stable mRNA levels, low protein production and low association with eIF4B binding following glucose withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). In contrast, cluster 3 includes 25% of the 100 mRNAs identified by DE as most upregulated following 16m glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>, highlighted in red in scatter plots), which correlates with increased protein production and elevated binding of eIF4B.</p><p id="P39">We conclude that eIF4B binding is initially heavily reduced for nearly all mRNA and contributes to attenuated translation. Subsequently, eIF4B preferentially binds newly produced mRNA. For a select, heavily induced population produced near entirely post-stress, this results in significantly increased protein translation.

Strikingly, mRNA binding was abrogated within 30 sec of glucose depletion, a speed of response seemingly incompatible with conventional stress-responsive signaling cascades. DEAD-box helicases bind RNA and ATP cooperatively, whereas ADP binding promotes an open, non-RNA bound conformation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. This suggested that altered ATP and/or ADP levels as glycolytic flux falls, might drive translation factor release.</p><p id="P42">Analyses of nucleotide availability revealed that intracellular ATP levels drop from ~2 mM to below 0.3 mM within 30 sec following glucose depletion. This concentration is below reported ATP binding constants for DEAD-box helicases, including eIF4A (~0.35-0.54 mM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Over the same period, ADP rises from around 0.18 mM to 0.45 mM. This is substantially greater than the ATP concentration, or the reported eIF4A Km for ADP (0.027mM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, which favors an open structure with low RNA affinity. We propose that loss of ATP binding and increased ADP association directly drive release of eIF4A from all mRNA transcripts, blocking the initiation process. However, even after depletion, a minimal ATP-associated population will remain, potentially supporting the residual level of protein synthesis.</p><p id="P43">Over the initial period of glucose depletion, translation elongation is more resistant to inhibition than is initiation, resulting in bulk polysome run-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Notably, translation elongation is more dependent on GTP than ATP. In our metabolite analyses GTP, was depleted with similar kinetics to ATP, presumably reflecting the requirement for ATP in GTP recycling. However, GTP levels remained substantially above the binding constants for elongation GTPases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Strikingly, these show GTP-binding affinities around 3,000-fold greater than the initiation factor ATPases. We therefore proposed a mechanism based on differential affinity. NTP depletion rapidly prevents 80S ribosome assembly but allows initiated ribosomes to continue and terminate, resulting in an orderly translation shutdown.</p><p id="P44">During termination, ribosome release is mediated by eRF1-eRF3, or the homologs Dom34-Hbs1, which are GTP-dependent (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>). Peptide release by the ATPase Ril1 is independent of ATP hydrolysis, whereas 40S-60S splitting by Rli1 is ATP dependent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. This may explain why ribosomes released from polysomes accumulate as 80S monosomes, rather than free subunits.</p><p id="P45">The metabolic response reflects energy depletion, rather than being glucose specific. Depletion of ATP by inhibition of respiration without carbon source shift, also resulted in the loss of initiation factor binding and ribosome run-off, supporting a direct ATP-driven mechanism. Similarly, withdrawal of sucrose caused rapid ATP-depletion and translation factor loss. Sucrose supports fast growth and is largely metabolized by glycolysis. In contrast, raffinose supports slow growth and is largely metabolized by respiration. Withdrawal of raffinose did not result in substantial ATP depletion or translation factor loss. We conclude that rapid NTP remodeling is ‘primed’ by fast glycolytic growth. Rapid ATP generation through glycolysis, with a minimal mitochondrial network, is highly efficient but results in vulnerability to energy stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. NTP remodeling may “de-risk” glycolytic growth by curtailing energy-consuming processes on very rapid timescales.</p><p id="P46">The differential affinity model requires that both enzymatic constants and NTP levels are “tuned” by evolutionary selection to enable distinct responses following glucose withdrawal. We noted that after rapid depletion during the first minute, NTP levels were approximately constant over the following 16 min. This suggested that the cells do not simply exhaust NTPs. Many cellular processes utilize NTPs, with a wide range of binding constants and turnover rates. We suggest that as the effective [NTP] drops, different NTP sinks will be progressively inhibited until residual consumption and production match, and a new equilibrium is established. In practice this occurs at ~0.3 mM ATP after 30 sec. Residual ATP production may reflect a low level of respiration, or glycolysis from mobilization of stored glycogen.</p><p id="P47">In yeast lacking the glycolytic enzyme Hxk2, polysomes are not lost following glucose withdrawal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. In <italic>hxk2</italic>Δ yeast, ATP levels initially declined but reached equilibrium faster and at a higher set point: 1.0 mM after 15 sec; above the binding constants of the initiation factors. We conclude that regulated metabolic remodeling controls NTP levels following glucose depletion. This higher set point is substantially above the binding constants of the initiation factors, suggesting that one or more major ATP sink is inactivated at a higher [ATP] in the mutant. A plausible candidate is the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (Pma1), which alone consumes around 30% of the ATP budget in WT cells and has been functionally linked to hexokinase in numerous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P48">Notably, subsequent changes in global gene expression patterns were strikingly similar following either glucose or sucrose withdrawal. 90% of transcripts responded comparably, reflecting remodeling of central carbon metabolism and repression of protein synthesis components <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. We postulate that a general “energy stress” program also initiates transcriptional reprogramming, independent of the canonical glucose repression network.

This inactivates pre-stress mRNAs while a selective transcriptional response is mounted <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.

Structural or sequence elements allowing specific evasion of translation repression have been suggested <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, but widespread common features have not been found. Rather, reporter systems indicate that timing is crucial; mRNAs transcribed after the initial stress escape repression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Supporting a sequence-independent mechanism for selective translation, our analyses found no evidence that withdrawal-induced mRNAs escape initiation factor eviction following glucose withdrawal. Instead, eIF4B was globally displaced on a second timescale, and then re-engaged over minutes preferentially on transcriptionally upregulated transcripts. Concordantly, initiation factor binding patterns shifted on these transcripts to reveal non-specific interactions alongside cognate 5’ binding. This indicates reduced specificity, possibly reflecting an excess of initiation factors relative to available mRNAs.</p><p id="P50">Immediately following glucose withdrawal, release of the protein-synthesis machinery leads to sequestration of free mRNAs into cytoplasmic condensates. However, newly transcribed mRNAs are excluded from condensates, by an unknown mechanism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Reduced global translation will generate free pools of translation initiation factors but these can access only the available, newly synthesized mRNA pool. A relative excess of initiation factors may favor translation even under conditions of ATP limitation.</p><p id="P51">Ded1 and other DEAD-box helicases participate in mRNA condensate formation under stress conditions. However, condensates form via multivalent interactions and the contribution of RNA binding in the helicase active site is unclear. Ded1 is lost from the AUG-proximal regions of all mRNAs immediately after glucose withdrawal, but remains associated with some coding sequences, potentially in condensates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. This indicates that alternative modes of interaction exist and can be maintained after ATP depletion, perhaps facilitating roles in condensate formation and other regulatory processes. We propose that evolutionary tuning of enzymatic constants to control NTP remodeling allows specific rapid modulation of RNA metabolism following carbon-source shift.</p><p id="P52">Our findings may be relevant to other systems. ATP abundance in glucose was 1.7 x 10<sup>-16</sup> mol per cell, corresponding to approximately 10<sup>8</sup> ATP molecules per cell. After glucose withdrawal, the ATP level drops by ~8x 10<sup>7</sup> molecules in 30 sec, giving an ATP depletion rate of 3x 10<sup>6</sup> molecules per second in yeast. During normal metabolism in human cells, the ATP pool is reported to be around 10<sup>9</sup> molecules, and is entirely turned over in around 1 – 2 min <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Therefore, a complete block in ATP production should result in a comparable ATP depletion rate to that seen in yeast. Moreover, 70-80% ATP depletion is reported for focal ischemia following arterial occlusion (see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> and references therein), or with combined oxygen and glucose deprivation in neuronal cultures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P53">NTPases function in a vast range of essential and non-essential activities. Selection for differential affinity may provide a single mechanism to coordinate comprehensive post-transcriptional adaptation to energy stress. Similar enzymatic tuning might have modulated binding constants for many metabolites, such that alterations in metabolite abundance are buffered by hierarchical loss of selected pathways.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p id="P54">Loss of eIF4A and eIF4B is expected to block translation initiation, but other initiation factors may also contribute to inhibition. It remains unclear how the ATP concentration “set point” is established and maintained as a new equilibrium following glucose withdrawal.

These could be RNA structure and/or modification, associated proteins or localization – and these possibilities are not mutually exclusive.

Scatter graphs comparing logCPM distribution between experiments and volcano plots visualizing differentially expressed genes were created using ggplot2.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>CRAC analysis</title><p id="P97">Our previous published CRAC datasets were re-analyzed here to address novel questions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). These are for the RNA interactomes of the DEAD-box helicase eIF4A and associated factor eIF4B in glucose grown and glucose starved (16 min) <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Utilized data is outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S4</xref>. Processing, mapping and quantification of the sequencing data was described in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. These reposited datasets were imported into R for analyses presented here.</p><p id="P98">Firstly, a high-confidence dataset of quantified mRNA transcripts bound under each condition was created (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S8</xref>). Feature counts were normalized to library size in Reads per Million (RPM) and a threshold of RPM &lt; 0.5 (~1 count) applied. Features were required to have been quantified in a minimum of two replicates, and the median of replicate values was used. Accounting for low coverage in glucose withdrawal conditions, imputation of the threshold 0.5 RPM was used to retain features present in the averaged glucose data. Retained features were then filtered by annotation as ‘protein_coding; exon’ to select mRNA transcripts, and utilizing RNAseq data for corresponding conditions lowly expressed transcripts were removed by a RPKM threshold of 10. For each protein, changes in RNA binding before and after stress were compared using scatterplots created in ggplot2, using the log transformed RPM values. For eIF4B, RPM binding was further normalized by expression using the RNAseq RPKM values at the equivalent timepoint. As mRNA populations will not alter significantly in seconds, RNAseq for glucose was used for 30 sec withdrawal. Targeted analyses of changes in eIF4B binding were performed for the top 100 most increased (induced) and decreased (repressed) transcripts following glucose withdrawal, as determined by differential expression analyses of RNAseq data (outlined above; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Table S9</xref>). Bar graphs were created using GraphPad Prism 10.</p><p id="P99">In order to visualize binding across individual transcripts, the coverage at each position along the genome was calculated and normalized to the library size using genomecov from bedtools v2.27.0 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. The Integrative Genomics Viewer was used to illustrate the distribution of reads across chosen transcripts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Metabolic Labelling Proteomics Analysis</title><p id="P100">The DIA-NN software platform version 1.9.2. was used to process the DIA raw files, and these were searched against the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> complete/reference proteome in Uniprot (released in June, 2019). Precursor ion generation was based on the chosen protein database (automatically generated spectral library) with deep-learning based spectra, retention time and IMs prediction. Digestion mode was set to specific with trypsin allowing maximum of two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed modification. Oxidation of methionine, and acetylation of the N-terminus were set as variable modifications. The parameters for peptide length range, precursor charge range, precursor m/z range and fragment ion m/z range as well as other software parameters were used with their default values. The precursor FDR was set to 1%. Annotating library proteins were created with information from the FASTA database: the spectral library contained 6093 proteins and 6093 genes.</p><p id="P101">Processed protein intensity data was analyzed in R. Standard filtering steps were applied to clean the dataset, and reverse and potential contaminant were removed. The dataset contained triplicate samples of the labelled input (total) and eluate (nascent) proteins for AHA-purification (described above), alongside unlabeled controls. To reliably identify the nascent proteome, only protein groups quantified in all purification eluate samples for at least one labelled condition were retained (n=4165).</p><p id="P102">Samples were VSN normalized and missing values were imputed with the left-censored MinProb method, as proteins are not expected to be missing at random, using the proteomics specific DEP package. Subsequently, to quantify changes between conditions, differential expression tests were performed using test_diff function on manually defined contrasts. Obtained <italic>p</italic> values were corrected to control for false discoveries using the highly stringent Bayesian/local false discoveries rate (FDR) method, and proteins with greater than 1.5-fold change (FDR□≤□0.05) were considered differentially expressed. Volcano plots visualizing differentially expressed genes were created using ggplot2.</p><p id="P103">For cluster analysis of nascent protein production, proteins with significant change between +AHA purification eluates were selected using the conventional FDR in R stats. For the resulting 524 proteins, median intensities for the input and eluate samples were z-scored and k-means clustered (k=4). For visualization, pheatmap was used to create correlation heatmaps. Clusters 2 and 3 showed significantly increased label incorporation in glucose or no glucose conditions, respectively, and were analyzed further. For genes in these clusters, RNAseq and CRAC data sets were utilized to compare fold change in RNA abundance (RPKM), eIF4B binding (RPM) and protein abundance (intensity) following glucose withdrawal.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS206373-supplement-Supplemental_Table_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d101aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS206373-supplement-Supplemental_Table_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d101aAcFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplemental Table 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS206373-supplement-Supplemental_Table_3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d101aAcFdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplemental Table 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS206373-supplement-Supplemental_Table_4.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d101aAcFeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplemental Table 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS206373-supplement-Supplemental_Table_5.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d101aAcFfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplemental Table 6</label><media xlink:href="EMS206373-supplement-Supplemental_Table_6.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d101aAcFgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplemental Table 7</label><media xlink:href="EMS206373-supplement-Supplemental_Table_7.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d101aAcFhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Supplemental Table 8</label><media xlink:href="EMS206373-supplement-Supplemental_Table_8.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d101aAcFiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD9"><label>Supplemental Table 9</label><media xlink:href="EMS206373-supplement-Supplemental_Table_9.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d101aAcFjB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD10"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS206373-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d101aAcFkB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S32"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Stefan Bresson for his support in relation to this work, including the gift of cell lines, consultation regarding analysis and critical reading of this manuscript.

In the absence of glucose, flux through the glycolytic pathway is stopped immediately and NTP production falls, while usage continues, leading to rapid depletion. ATP levels fall below the binding constants for the low affinity DEAD-box helicases required for initiation, displacing these ATP-dependent RNA-binding protein from transcripts. Comparatively, elongation factors are high affinity and retain GTP binding, allowing translation to continue from initiated ribosomes. In the absence of recycling, polysomes run off leaving free translation machinery and transcripts.</p><p>H: Intracellular ATP and GTP levels (mean values; n=3) during growth in 2% sucrose, and following addition of mitochondrial inhibitor Antimycin A (AA) to 0.02µg/ml.
