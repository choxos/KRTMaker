Specifically, about one-third of MCC patients with initial local disease will eventually develop distant metastasis that results in a high mortality rate of 33-46%. This highlights the urgent need for biomarkers that would identify patients at high risk of metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">MCC is classically divided into two distinct molecular subclasses: virus-positive (VP) and virus-negative (VN), which are morphologically indistinguishable by conventional histology. VP-MCC results from the integration of the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) into the host genome and expression of viral oncoproteins that cause the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. By contrast, VN-MCC is caused by UV-induced DNA damage and is characterized by a high mutational burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Several reports have documented more favorable survival outcomes for VP-MCC patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. However, whether the difference in survival between VP- and VN-MCC is due to comorbidities often found in the predominantly older VN-MC population or inherent biological differences associated with MCPyV infection remains unknown.</p><p id="P7">Our current understanding of anti-tumor immune responses in MCC is largely derived from flow cytometry, T-cell receptor sequencing, low-dimensional immunohistochemistry (IHC), and bulk sequencing data that lack either spatial context or single-cell resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Hence, critical aspects of the <italic>in-situ</italic> tumor ecosystem can only be inferred. To capture the complexity of tumor-immune interactions within the native TME directly and on the single-cell level, we here apply the first comprehensive multiplex imaging study of the MCC-TME utilizing co-detection by indexing combined with in-situ RNA hybridization (RNAscope) imaging and targeted RNA sequencing through laser-capture microdissection (LCM). This allowed us to address two questions: (1) How MCPyV modulates anti-tumor immune responses within the TME and (2) how these tissue signatures are linked to patient outcomes.</p><p id="P8">Our results demonstrate that the VP-TME is characterized by a spatial co-enrichment of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells with CXCL9<sup>+</sup>PD-L1<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) at the tumor invasive front. We show that virus-positivity and high CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration at the invasive front predict prolonged metastasis-free survival in MCC patients. By contrast the enrichment of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) at the tumor boundary associated with higher risk for distant metastasis. Importantly, we found that responses to immune-checkpointblockade (ICB), being the current standard-of-care in advanced MCC patients, associated with a B-cell enriched spatial context that was independent of viral-status.</p><p id="P9">In summary, we have created the first single-cell spatial map of MCPyV-mediated immunomodulation of the TME, that informs novel strategies for patient stratification at early disease stages and provide a rationale for biomarker-informed adjuvant ICB therapy of MCC patients at high-risk of metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>MCPyV-positive MCC is associated with favorable survival outcomes</title><p id="P10">We applied a multi-modal experimental framework including CODEX multiplex imaging, RNAscope, and LCM-guided bulk sequencing (LCMseq) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>) in conjunction with an analytical framework to dissect spatial imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>). This strategy allowed us to uncover MCPyV-associated anti-tumor immune responses within the native tissue context and delineate how those are linked to patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>). From a database of 242 patients with MCC, we selected a cohort of 60 MCC patients with detailed clinical documentation, long-term follow up and known MCPyV-status (29 VN and 31 VP patients) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.1A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D</xref>). Importantly, VP and VN groups were matched for main clinical parameters such as demographics, primary tumor characteristics, tumor stage, treatments, investigated tissues and follow-up (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Table1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.1C-D</xref>).

In addition, we found that VP-MCC patients with local stage I/II disease had a significantly longer distant-metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (median DMFS: not reached vs 7 months, <italic>p</italic>=0.0034), that was confirmed in multivariate testing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.1E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplemental Tables3</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>In-Situ</italic> Profiling of the MCC-TME using CODEX multiplex imaging</title><p id="P11">We reasoned that the identification of virus-specific immune signatures and their spatial organization might help explain the differential survival outcomes found between VP and VN-MCCs. To identify such tissue signatures, we, determined MCPyV-status for all MCC samples and constructed tissue microarrays (TMA) of the MCC-TME that incorporated representative tumor regions from both the tumor-invasive front and the tumor core for each patient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.2A-F</xref>). We developed and validated a 56-marker CODEX antibody panel that includes antibodies for cell phenotyping and functional assessment such as markers for macrophages (CD68, CD163, CD206), B cells, T cell-specific markers, tumor markers (CK20, Synaptophysin, CD56, Chromogranin A), markers of T cell dysfunction (EOMES, PD1, LAG3), and markers of MCPyV-infection (MCPyV LT antigen) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.3A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data Fig.S1-4</xref>).

Following tissue extraction, cell segmentation, quality control, and data normalization as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, we performed Leiden-based clustering that enabled the identification of 7 major cell lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1F</xref>) including T and B-cells, myeloid cells, stromal cells, as well as epithelial and tumor cells that comprised the majority of cells within the MCC-TME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1G</xref>). We observed a strong heterogeneity in the cellular composition of the investigated MCC tumors but did not detect a clear correlation between the abundance of the major cell lineages with clinical parameters such as tumor stage or viral status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The TME of virus-positive MCC is characterized by a CD8-dominant T cell infiltrate exhibiting an effector phenotype while CAFs are enriched within the VN-MCC TME</title><p id="P13">To better characterize the cellular composition of the MCC-TME we used key phenotypic markers to identify 18 granular cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2A</xref>). Stratification by MCPyV status highlighted differences in the cellular composition between VP-MCC and VN-MCC tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B</xref>): In particular, we observed a higher proportion of tumor cells within VP-MCC, whereas VN-MCC exhibited a higher proportion of stromal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2C</xref>). To enable a more balanced representation of cellular changes driving anti-tumor immune responses within the MCC-TME, we analyzed the cellular composition of the immune and stroma compartment between VN and VP tumors. We discovered that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and plasma cells were significantly enriched in VP-MCCs, whereas we detected a higher abundance of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within VN-MCC tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2D</xref>). We further interrogated the T-cell compartment, to characterize the differential impact of MCPyV-infection on the abundance of T-cell subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2E</xref>) and their functional polarization in more detail. We found that both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells within the VP-TME exhibited an elevated expression of proteins, implicated in T-cell cytotoxicity and effector function, including Granzyme B, PD1 and LAG3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2F-G</xref>). To map the organization of different T cell states within the TME, we identified states of T cell differentiation based on previously defined marker expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.4A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Using these T-cell subsets we found an enrichment for both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that expressed high levels of the checkpoint molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2H-I</xref>) in VP-MCC. This observation reflects on the known role of chronic viral infections and cancer in promoting T-cell exhaustion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. We expanded our results by analyzing a publicly available scRNAseq dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.4B-D</xref>). In line with the results from our CODEX multiplex imaging, we identified therein a subset of T-cells enriched for genes implicated in T-cell activation and exhaustion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.4E</xref>). We detected a relative enrichment of these PD1<sup>high</sup>, LAG3<sup>high</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in VP-MCC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.4F</xref>) that were characterized by an elevated expression of cytotoxic markers such as <italic>PRF1</italic> and <italic>IFNG</italic>, as well as immune-checkpoint molecules <italic>PDCD1</italic>, <italic>CTLA4</italic> and <italic>TIGIT</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.4G-H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Neighborhood analysis reveals a spatial co-enrichment of immunomodulatory CXCL9 and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at the invasive front of VP-MCC</title><p id="P14">In order to spatially contextualize the enrichment of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and their functional states within the VP-MCC TME, we grouped the TME into spatially organized functional units, termed cellular neighborhoods (CNs). We identified 11 unique CNs characteristic of VP-MCC and VN-MCC using a k-nearest neighbors’ approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.5A-D</xref>). While some CNs were unique to a given tissue, such as an <italic>epithelium CN</italic> (skin) or <italic>LN-follicles</italic> (LN), the majority of CNs was shared between tissues, such as a B-cell enriched CN, vessel-enriched stroma, and more granular CNs such as T cell priming and activation zones and the tumor boundary (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.5E-H</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We compared the abundance of CNs between VP-MCC and VN-MCC and observed a higher abundance of the <italic>CAF-enriched stroma</italic> CN9 in VN-MCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3B</xref>). More importantly, we found that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were particularly enriched in CN1 (<italic>tumor boundary</italic>) and CN2 (<italic>myeloid-cell-enriched)</italic> of VP-MCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.6A</xref>). This indicates that MCPyV-presence does not result in a homogenous enrichment of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but that CD8T cell recruitment is confined to restricted tumor niches. When further analyzing the distribution of CD8<sup>+</sup>T-cell subclusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.6B-C</xref>), we found a relative enrichment of PD1<sup>high</sup>, LAG3<sup>high</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells within the tumor compartment of VP-MCCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.6D</xref>). To quantify whether the regionalized CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration correlates with the organization of CN-CN interactions at the tumor invasive front, we computed the intersections of CNs located at the tumor invasive front (CN1, CN2 and CN3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3E</xref>). Regions of such CN-CN interactions, that are termed spatial contexts, are locations where the characteristic local processes of each CN are interacting through local molecular reactions. For example, CN-CN interfaces are sites where a molecule from one CN contacts cells from another CN that enables unique activation processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. We observed that the spatially restricted influx of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into CN1 (<italic>tumor boundary</italic>) and CN2 (<italic>myeloid-cell-enriched)</italic>, associated with a stronger intermixing of CN1 and CN2 with the CN3 (<italic>T-cell-enriched)</italic> in VP-MCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3F-G</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We reasoned that the stronger infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into CNs of the invasive front might be linked to the presence of immunomodulatory molecules within those CNs. To quantify the distribution of both immunomodulatory surface markers and soluble mediators, we established a protocol in which we combined both multiplex RNA <italic>in-situ hybridization</italic> with CODEX multiplex imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.6E-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">METHODS</xref>). We carried out cell-type annotations and CN identification of this combined CODEX-RNAscope experiment similar to the previously described CODEX experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.6H-J</xref>). Using this orthogonal dataset we found a strong co-localization of PD-L1<sup>+</sup> and CXCL9<sup>+</sup> expression in cells at the tumor invasive front (CN1, CN2, CN3). Critically, we also found a significant enrichment of the immunomodulatory molecules PD-L1 and <italic>CXCL9</italic>, as well as T-cell cytotoxicity marker Granzyme B in CN2 (<italic>myeloid-cell-enriched)</italic> of the tumor invasive front of VP-MCC tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig.6K</xref>).

Furthermore, our observations strongly support that this spatial ICB-response signature might be applicable to both VP and VN-MCC patients alike, thereby offering a personalized treatment management approach.</p><p id="P37">Conversely, we detected that a spatial context defined by the enrichment of a CAFs at the tumor boundary associated both with distant metastasis and low response to ICB.

We validated our model in HPV-linked OPSCC, suggesting common spatially organized mechanism of immunomodulation across viral cancers.

While our study represents the first, and so-far largest exploration of virus-associated immunomodulation within the MCC-TME, it was single-institution with a modest patient cohort size and might therefore not represent the full diversity of Merkel cell carcinoma. It will therefore be imperative to validate our findings in larger, multi-institutional cohorts to confirm the suitability of the proposed biomarkers and tissue signatures for predicting distant metastasis and ICB-response. Our deep, multiplexed spatial analysis in combination with validation using an independent scRNAseq dataset and spatial profiling of a second cohort of virus-associated solid tumors (HNSCC) helps to mitigate this issue. Second, although our data suggest virus-specific modulation of T-cell responses between virus-positive and virus-negative MCC, we did not employ spatial transcriptomics or T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing approaches, which could provide deeper insights into T-cell clonality, antigen specificity, and functional states <italic>in situ</italic>. Third, this study lacks in vivo models to directly assess the causal role of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) in shaping immune responses within the TME.
