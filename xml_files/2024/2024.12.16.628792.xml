Development of new bone-active therapies is hindered by limited understanding of the complex interactions between the cells and genes that regulate the skeleton. To unravel this complexity, we systematically annotated all cells in bone and defined the genes that control their function at single-cell resolution. Integration with data from human gene-mapping studies of rare skeletal disorders and common skeletal disease traits identified novel disease genes, which we validated by functional analysis in more than one thousand genetic mouse models. This multiscale approach expands the repertoire of cells that regulate bone to include endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. This also revealed hundreds of skeletal disease-associated genes in this landscape of cells as potential drug targets. The cellular and genetic mechanisms revealed by this approach overcomes knowledge gaps and helps to accelerate development of next generation therapies to treat skeletal diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Musculoskeletal diseases affect half of individuals over 50 years of age and are a major health burden for society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Osteoporosis is one of the most common, and most disabling, and is characterised by skeletal abnormalities that result in fragility fractures, disability and increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Whilst current treatments prevent deterioration of the skeleton, few restore skeletal integrity, and new approaches are required urgently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Development of new therapies has been hindered by incomplete understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that optimise and maintain bone mass and strength.</p><p id="P5">Knowledge from human genetics can accelerate discovery programs and improve success rates in drug development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Gene-mapping studies of monogenic skeletal disorders have uncovered multiple new mechanisms of skeletal regulation but their utility in gene discovery programs is limited by their rarity and heterogeneity. Population-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of skeletal traits is a complementary approach that has potential to uncover new genetic mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. GWAS have identified over 500 regions of the human genome associated with ultrasound-estimated bone mineral density (eBMD), a measure of skeletal integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Many of these loci contain effector genes, defined as genes with a functional role in regulating the skeleton, yet the identities of genes underlying observed associations at most loci remain unknown. Methods that integrate GWAS with expression quantitative trait locus analysis (eQTL) of bulk tissues can help identify effector genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], but is limited by the current knowledge of gene function in specific cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The application of eQTL methods to single-cell transcriptomic datasets has the potential to address this technical constraint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. However, it is difficult to obtain normal bone cells from healthy humans without underlying disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, one of the key sites of bone turnover, the process by which bone mass and quality are regulated to optimise bone strength, is the endosteal compartment, which is located at the interface between bone and bone marrow. Isolation of cells from this compartment is particularly challenging and data from bone are still not available in the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project or the Human Cell Atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Given that genes expressed in humans and mice are highly conserved and mouse models faithfully recapitulate many human monogenic skeletal disorders, along with recent success in analysing GWAS with transcriptomic data from mouse tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], we reasoned that isolating cells from the endosteal compartment of mice could address these challenges.</p><p id="P6">We hypothesised that integrating gene-expression data from a map of cells isolated from the endosteal compartment of murine bone with human gene-mapping studies of rare skeletal disorders and common skeletal disease traits would identify genes with important functional roles in the skeleton, that contribute to the pathogenesis of human skeletal diseases and might be amenable to therapeutic intervention. We generated a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) map of cells isolated from the endosteal compartment of healthy mice. We integrated this dataset with analyses of: (i) the current nosology of rare monogenic skeletal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], (ii) a new and now largest GWAS of eBMD, (iii) skeletal phenotyping data from the mouse genome informatic (MGI) database and (iv) an in-depth functional analysis of the skeleton in more than one thousand mouse lines with unselected single gene deletions.</p><p id="P7">Our integrated, multiscale approach defined the cellular landscape of the endosteal compartment and identified effector genes expressed by osteoblasts, chondrocytes, osteoclasts, vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells that cause both rare and common skeletal disorders.

Chondrocytes were derived from the metaphysis, which is consistent with their known anatomical location in the growth plate. Cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage included proliferating monocytes and <italic>Cd14</italic><sup>+</sup> monocytes, which were more abundant in the endosteal compartments, <italic>Txnip</italic><sup>+</sup> monocytes which were found predominantly in the bone marrow compartment, as well as dendritic cells and macrophages, which may include osteal macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], were found in both endosteal and bone marrow compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). Cells of this lineage also included a population denoted as osteoclasts (cluster 30), which was found in both endosteal compartments.

We mapped human monogenic skeletal disorder-causing genes and genes associated with polygenic skeletal traits to these gene programs, to identify cell types enriched with disease-associated genes and then prioritised novel genes expressed in these cells for functional validation <italic>in vivo.</italic> This approach defines the landscape of cells in the endosteal compartment that affect the skeleton, identified known and novel genes with functional roles in regulating these cells and discovered genes associated with both monogenic and polygenic skeletal disorders.</p><p id="P47">Our approach generated a comprehensive map of all cell types found in the endosteal compartment, a main site of bone turnover. This included osteoblast lineage cells, which have been described in targeted single cell analyses of bone tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>], and osteoclasts, both of which have a functional role in bone turnover. However, our agnostic approach of sampling all cells as opposed to specific lineages, and our ability to compare cells in the endosteal and marrow compartments, expands the repertoire of cells in the endosteal compartment to include endothelial cells and VSMCs, and specific populations of monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and B and T cells. Many of these cell types were restricted to the endosteal compartment and were not present in the marrow compartment, confirming that the endosteal compartment is a distinct and specialised location within bone. Many of these cell types, and majority of the genes that define these cells, have underappreciated or unknown roles in bone.</p><p id="P48">We used this new knowledge of the entire cellular landscape of endosteal bone compartment to show that gene programs of osteoblast lineage cells, chondrocytes and osteoclasts were enriched with genes causing monogenic skeletal disorders, whereas osteoblast lineage cells, chondrocytes, endothelial cells and VSMCs were enriched with genes associated with eBMD. This is consistent with recent analyses showing enrichment of eBMD-associated genes in osteogenic cells isolated from mice, and cultured human fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. However, our comprehensive approach also revealed endothelial cells and VSMCs to be enriched with eBMD-associated genes. This highlights the underappreciated role of these cells in regulating the skeleton and further suggest that the normal function of multiple cell types is required for maintenance of bone structure and strength. Interestingly, osteoclasts were not highly enriched with genes associated with eBMD. This may suggest that GWAS of eBMD in adults primarily captures genetic signals involved in attainment of peak bone mass rather than bone loss later in life and supports the idea that different cell types may regulate different skeletal traits.</p><p id="P49">Our approach enabled us to prioritise genes for functional analysis, including a detailed analysis of more than 1000 mouse lines with single gene deletions. We prioritised genes with greater cell type restriction, including <italic>Ptprd</italic> (osteoblasts), <italic>Nherf2</italic> (endothelial cells), <italic>Cbx6</italic> (VSMCs) and <italic>Agap1</italic> (osteoclasts) as they may be valuable therapeutic targets with the potential for reduced off-target effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. In each case, the deletion of these genes resulted in structural and functional skeletal phenotypes confirming their functional role in bone. Notably, <italic>Nherf2</italic> was recently shown to have risk-lowering associations for hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Blocking NHERF2 has been proposed as a means for managing blood pressure and our analysis of data in humans suggests this strategy may also increase BMD and lead to reduced fracture risk. However, in mice <italic>Nherf2</italic> deletion led to a decrease in trabecular bone volume. This suggests that a more detailed understanding of the role of <italic>Nherf2</italic> in controlling the skeleton is required. This also highlights the critical importance of understanding patterns of gene expression in individual cells in all tissues in order to predict potential off-target effects.</p><p id="P50">Whilst we prioritised genes with greater cell type restriction, we also identified eBMD effector genes with broader cell type expression. This included <italic>Pls3,</italic> which has been implicated in X-linked osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. <italic>Pls3</italic> was found in osteoblast, chondrocyte, endothelial cell and VSMC gene programs. Deletion of <italic>Pls3</italic> accurately recapitulated the human skeletal phenotype in mice although there was no measurable effect on the number or function of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes. This suggests that the action of <italic>Pls3</italic> in bone is complex and may function through canonical and non-canonical cell lineages. This highlights how some genes are expressed in multiple cell types and have complex effects on the skeleton. The detailed knowledge provided in this study will help design future experiments to investigate how genes that are more widely expressed, including <italic>Pls3,</italic> function in the skeleton.</p><p id="P51">Whilst our multiscale workflow has proven valuable, there are limitations. Firstly, our study focused on the cells of the endosteal compartment rather than the periosteal compartment, the outer surface of bone. Whilst these compartments may differ, mesenchymal cells from these two locations have recently been shown to be similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. Secondly, cells in the endosteal compartment were collected following removal of the bone marrow. Our isolation and sequencing method may not capture fragile cells such as adipocytes, multinucleated osteoclasts, some populations of macrophages or cells embedded in bone such as mature osteocytes. Nevertheless, cells with canonical osteoclast markers were identified which may prove to be mononuclear osteoclasts or the recently identified osteomorphs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Equally, we have also recently described the transcriptome of mature osteocytes which were also enriched with genes associated with eBMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Thirdly, our approach used healthy mouse bone rather than human bone although evidence suggests the transcriptional landscape of mouse and human bone are highly conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. Fourth, our new eBMD GWAS was generated from data in UK-Biobank, which is predominantly a cohort of European ancestry, and has not been replicated in an independent cohort. Lastly, whilst we examined more than 1000 knockout out mouse lines for skeletal phenotypes, this did not include all potential genes. We included 19 bone parameters in our phenotyping analysis including, importantly, fracture and bone strength; however, this list is not exhaustive, and those mouse lines without a phenotype in our analysis might have skeletal phenotypes that were not captured. We also acknowledge that ~33% of all global knockouts are embryonic lethal/perinatal lethal or generally have a failure to thrive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. Whilst our testing was biased towards mouse knockout lines that are viable, this has the advantage of identifying genes that are likely to be better therapeutic targets.</p><p id="P52">In summary, our integrated multiscale workflow provides a new comprehensive cellular and molecular framework through which to understand bone turnover and the regulation of the skeleton. This framework has identified new effector genes and will enable prioritisation of genes for future study. Such an approach can also be applied to other tissues. The foundational knowledge provided by this framework, disseminated by our novel online platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.musculoskeletal-genomics.org/">www.musculoskeletal-genomics.org/</ext-link>), will advance identification of skeletal disease-associated genes and the cells through which they function.

For each sample the cleaned lower limb and caudal vertebrae Ca6 and Ca7 were imaged in frame with 3 standards; a 1mm diameter steel wire, a 1mm diameter spectrographically pure aluminium wire, and a 1mm diameter polyester fibre. Relative bone mineral content and bone lengths were determined as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>]. Briefly, 2368x2340 16-bit DICOM images were converted to 8-bit Tiff images in ImageJ, the grey levels for the polyester and steel standards were used to stretch each image across the 256 grey levels with polyester at grey level 0 and steel at grey level 255 using macros described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>]. Increasing gradations of mineralisation density were represented in 16 equal intervals by applying a pseudocolour lookup table to each image. For each sample the median grey level (0-255) of the femur and caudal vertebrae 6 and 7 was calculated by determining the number of pixels of each grey level in the stretched X-ray image.

The Scanco Medical software suite (μCT Tomography v6.4-2/Open VMS) was used for reconstructions, ROI selection and analyses. 10μm voxel resolution scans of a 1.5 mm long region of mid-shaft cortical bone were used to calculate cortical bone parameters (Cortical thickness Ct.Th, internal endosteal diameter ID, and Bone Mineral Density BMD). The ROI was centred at 56% along the length of the femur, distal to the femoral head, to provide a circular cross section avoiding the linea aspera. Trabecular parameters (Trabecular bone volume per tissue volume BV/TV, trabecular number Tb.N, Trabecular thickness Tb.Th, and trabecular spacing Tb.Sp) were calculated from 5μm voxel resolution scans with an ROI consisting of a 1mm long region of the trabecular compartment beginning 100μm proximal to the distal femoral growth plate.

Load was applied vertically to the mid-shaft of the femur, or evenly across the vertebral end plate with a constant rate of displacement of 0.03mm/second until femoral fracture, or ~1mm of displacement had occurred in the vertebra. Biomechanical properties were calculated by plotting load displacement curves for each biomechanical test and determining yield, maximum and, for femurs only, fracture loads. Stiffness was calculated from the slope of the linear portion of the load displacement curve using the “least squares” method. Percentage energy dissipated at fracture load was calculated, as previously described, by subtracting the elastic stored energy at fracture from the total work energy at fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>].

Plots show residualised Z-scores from the null model for each gene program, with the expected values based on the quantiles across all genes in the data. The black points denote the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile. The dashed black line represents the one-sided (upper) 95% confidence band. Genes are coloured red if they exceed the confidence band, and grey if they do not.

The total number of genes deleted in the gene programs that define individual cell types is noted in the centre of each plot. The central ring shows the proportion of mice (%) with specified skeletal phenotypes. The next ring shows the individual genes deleted in each gene program. The nature of the skeletal phenotype is colour coded according to the key. Gene names in red are those that also cause monogenic skeletal disorders. For instances where heterozygous knockout mice were used, the lethality of homozygous knockouts are shown by the indicated symbols. The next two rings show the impact of gene deletion on cortical and trabecular bone. This is followed by information on which genes are associated with eBMD from the MAGMA analysis (grey and blue ring) and which are restricted to a single cell type (green ring). The outer two rings identify genes that appear in the GO with a skeletal term and in MGI with abnormal bone structure.
