Yet, the construction of baculovirus-compatible multigene expression vectors is complicated and time-consuming. Furthermore, while the baculovirus and yeast are popular protein expression systems, no single method for multigene vector construction is compatible with both. Here we present the modular cloning (MoClo) Baculo toolkit for constructing multigene expression vectors for the baculovirus system and, through compatibility with the MoClo Yeast toolkit, also for yeast. Vector construction by MoClo Baculo utilises Golden Gate assembly, which does not require PCR, primers or the sequencing of intermediate products. As a proof of principle, MoClo Baculo was used to construct baculovirus and yeast multigene vectors expressing the four- and five-subunit human Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. We show that MoClo Baculo simplifies and expedites the construction of multigene expression vectors for the baculovirus system and provides compatibility with yeast as an alternative expression system.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">An increasing number of large multi-subunit macromolecular complexes are subjected to structure determination using cryo-electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Such structural and biophysical studies often require the expression and purification of recombinant multisubunit protein complexes. When the macromolecule complex of interest is of a eukaryotic origin, its subunits are often required to be co-expressed in a eukaryotic host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Among the most commonly used eukaryotic systems for recombinant protein expression are the baculovirus system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] and yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], each offering different advantages.</p><p id="P3">There are several widely used baculovirus expression systems. The Bac-to-Bac system is one of the most commonly used systems for the expression of protein complexes with a few protein subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The Bac-to-Bac system allows the cloning of up to two genes per expression vector, which is then integrated into the baculovirus DNA and packed into baculovirus particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Complexes with more than two protein subunits can be expressed by the Bac-to-Bac system. This is commonly done by the co-infection of insect cells using multiple different baculoviruses, each carrying a different gene. Accordingly, there are many examples of protein complexes that were expressed using co-infection with 3-5 baculoviruses (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]). Yet, beyond that, the efficiency and reproducibility of co-infections is reduced and, therefore, the expression of complexes with more than a few subunits commonly requires the usage of multi-gene vectors.</p><p id="P4">There are several multigene vector systems for protein expression using the baculovirus system. MultiBac recombines multiple genes into one vector using the Cre-lox technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. BiGBac enables the construction of similar multigenic vectors using a Gibson Assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], allowing a maximum of 25 genes in one plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. GoldenBac utilises Golden Gate assembly that simplifies vector construction, where individual genes are PCR amplified only once, at the beginning of the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p id="P5">All current multigene baculovirus expression systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] require PCR or Gibson Assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], and therefore oligonucleotide synthesis. PCR-based approaches may complicate the usage of GC-rich or repetitive templates for the construction of some multigene vectors. Furthermore, most multigene baculovirus vectors do not have a protein tag pre-incorporated in the vector. Instead, large protein tags are often added through a prior cloning step while small tags are included in the cloning primers. These factors increase the reliance on oligonucleotide synthesis and the subsequent sequencing of intermediate products, which increase the time, cost and complexity of the project.</p><p id="P6">The problem of multigene vector construction has already been solved in various organisms using modular cloning (MoClo) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. In MoClo, different ‘parts’ are functional DNA sequence elements that are assembled together to form ‘devices’, which are more complex plasmids. Each ‘part’ is a plasmid that includes one functional element, such as a protein-coding sequence, tag, promoter, or backbone of an expression vector. Each part is generated only once, usually with the aid of gene synthesis or gBlocks, and can then be used repeatedly in different projects or shared between labs. Multiple plasmids, each holding a single part, are digested together by type IIS restriction enzymes to release DNA fragments with cohesive ends that allow multiple parts to assemble together through Golden Gate assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P7">Golden Gate assembly uses Type IIS restriction enzymes, which cut outside of the enzyme recognition site. Thus, one enzyme can produce many different cohesive ends within the same reaction, while only compatible cohesive ends adhere and ligate to each other within a single-pot reaction. Accordingly, Golden Gate assembly can be used for the digestion of multiple plasmids or DNA fragments and their simultaneous assembly into a single vector.</p><p id="P8">The restriction sites are destroyed upon ligation and, therefore, the product cannot be digested once ligated, making the Golden Gate assembly highly efficient as it typically progresses in one direction.</p><p id="P9">MoClo approaches are commonly based on multiple Golden Gate assembly reactions that are carried out iteratively. For instance, multiple plasmids can be assembled in parallel, using multiple independent Golden Gate assemblies with the aid of the same type IIS restriction enzyme. Subsequently, the obtained plasmids can be combined in another Golden Gate assembly, using another type IIS enzyme, where they are ligated again to form an increasingly complex plasmid that includes multiple functional elements. MoClo-constructed plasmids may include multiple genes and all the elements that are required for their delivery, integration into the host, selection, protein expression and protein purification. MoClo is fast, efficient, affordable, and does not require PCR, Gibson Assembly or custom primer design.</p><p id="P10">The MoClo Yeast Toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] was designed for modular cloning of multigene expression cassettes, aiming for synthetic biology applications in the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Although the MoClo Yeast Toolkit was not designed primarily for the expression and purification of recombinant proteins, we reasoned that it would be feasible to modify it for that purpose.</p><p id="P11">Based on a cloning standard inspired by the MoClo Yeast Toolkit, we set out to develop a method for cross-platform multi-gene vector building for protein expression and purification. We focused on constructing parts for modular cloning of expression vectors dedicated to the baculovirus system and yeast, given their broad applicability.</p><p id="P12">Here we present the MoClo Baculo, a multi-gene modular cloning (MoClo) method designed for the expression of proteins using the baculovirus system and in yeast. MoClo Baculo utilises Golden Gate as the only cloning method. The mutation rate is extremely low, given that MoClo does not involve the usage of PCR, Gibson Assembly, <italic>in vitro</italic> polymerases or primers. Therefore, the sequencing of intermediate product plasmids is not required, which dramatically reduces the time, cost and complexity of building multigene constructs. Modular cloning allows for flexible replacement or removal of N- or C-terminal affinity tags when developing a new purification scheme. MoClo Baculo supports the expression of up to 6 proteins from a single multigene construct, however this number can theoretically be expanded by adding adapters. The number of co-expressed subunits can further be expanded through the delivery of multiple multigene constructs. As a proof of concept, we used MoClo Baculo to build multi-gene expression vectors of the 4- and 5-subunits Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). We demonstrate the suitability of such MoClo Baculo expression vectors to express catalytically active PRC2 complexes using the baculovirus system and yeast.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Modification of the MoClo Yeast toolkit for better compatibility with applications of recombinant protein expression and purification</title><p id="P13">We set out to generate a system that would utilise the same set of open reading frames (ORFs) and tag constructs for building different multi-protein expression vectors.</p><p id="P14">Furthermore, we wished to have compatibility with protein expression using the baculovirus system and yeast. We prioritised methods that do not rely on PCR, in vitro polymerase reactions or primers, aiming to avoid the sequencing of intermediate products. We reasoned that the MoClo Yeast Toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], originally developed for synthetic biology applications, would be an ideal starting point.</p><p id="P15">The MoClo Baculo toolkit design is inherited from the MoClo Yeast Toolkit and therefore includes the following part types that are assembled together to construct expression vectors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>): Left Connector (ConL; part 1) that connects functional elements to the plasmid backbone; Promoter, designed for protein expression with (part 2a) or without (part 2) N-terminal tag; an optional N-terminal tag (part 2b); a protein Coding Sequence (CDS; part 3); an optional C-terminal tag (part 4a); a transcription Terminator sequence that is designed to be used with or without C-terminal tag (part 4b or 4, respectively); a right Connector (ConR; part 5) and a backbone (part 6) that can be divided into up to 4 different parts (parts 6a-d) with different functionalities (more below).</p><p id="P16">One important difference between the MoClo Yeast Toolkit and the MoClo Baculo designs is that in the latter one can use the same CDS part with or without tags (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Specifically, in the MoClo Yeast toolkit, the construction of vectors for expressing untagged and N-terminally tagged proteins is done using two different CDS parts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). This design is undesirable for structural biologists, who would benefit from the frequent removal or inclusion of N-terminal tags without having to source two separate CDS parts. Therefore, to allow for removing the N-terminal tag without changing the CDS part, we modified the MoClo Yeast general design of promoters and N-terminal parts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To enable the modular cloning using Golden Gate assembly, each part is domesticated into a chloramphenicol resistance plasmid (pYTK001) that originated from the MoClo Yeast toolkit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1D</xref>). The resulting plasmid holds a single part and is referred to as “Level 0” plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] (see methods section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1C,D</xref> for the flanking sequences that are added to each part, to allow for its domestication and subsequent usage).</p><p id="P18">The newly modified design of MoClo Baculo still allows the replacement of promoters through modular cloning, although it is not fully compatible with the promoter design of the MoClo Yeast toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Therefore, we generated several useful MoClo Baculo-compatible <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> promoters, based on promoter sequences from the MoClo Yeast toolkit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). More <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> promoters can be made as needed. We also designed and generated parts carrying N- and C-terminal tags that are useful for protein expression and purification. Such tags for protein purification include a PreScission (3C) protease cleavable maltose binding protein (MBP) tag, a dual protein A tag and a Strep-tag (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Additional tags can readily be added as individual parts, without bringing the coding sequence into consideration and as long as the correct flanking sequences are added to them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1C,D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Adding compatibility with the baculovirus system for protein expression</title><p id="P19">We next sought to enable compatibility between the MoClo Yeast toolkit to the baculovirus system. To this end, we modified parts of an expression vector used in the Bac-to-Bac expression system (pFastBac1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]), aiming to enable modular cloning. For that, we first aligned backbone sequences from different existing baculovirus expression systems that were previously modified from the Bac-to-Bac systems. This was done to identify commonly used modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>) and regions where the pFastBac1 vector can be modified without negatively impacting performances. Based on this sequence analysis we designed two new parts that originated from the pFastBac1 vector and are termed here baculovirus (BV) ‘Backbone’ (BV BB in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, part 6b-d in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and plasmid pMB.001 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) and ‘Recombination into BV DNA’ (BV rec. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, part 6a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, and plasmid pF003 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The BV Backbone (BV BB, part 6b-d; plasmid pMB.001) includes bacterial replication origin, ampicillin and gentamicin resistance and the right transposition site (Tn7R), which is used for recombination into the baculovirus DNA. The left transposition site (Tn7L) is included within the ‘Recombination into BV DNA’ (BV rec.) part (part 6a; plasmid pF003). Together, the ‘Backbone’ (BV BB) part and the ‘Recombination into BV DNA’ (BV rec.) part include all the functional elements required to connect to each other and to all the other parts that are collectively required to express a single open reading frame, either tagged or not. We envision that the usage of two parts for the backbone would facilitate further backbone modifications in future works. Details regarding adding new parts can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>. For compatibility with the MoClo Yeast cloning standard, we used codon optimization to remove BsaI and BsmBI sites from the sequences that were used to construct all these parts. In the case of parts that are specific for yeast, or may be used for both yeast and baculovirus expression, we also removed NotI sites, as NotI is used to linearise vectors for yeast genome integration. If one wishes to use the optional compatibility between MoClo Baculo to the biGBac system (more below), then PmeI sites should be removed too.</p><p id="P20">For compatibility with the baculovirus expression system, we designed additional new parts using the MoClo cloning standard: polyhedrin promoter (parts 2 and 2a) and SV40 terminator (parts 4 and 4b). All these parts were domesticated into Level 0 plasmids and are compatible with Golden Gate assembly using the type IIS restriction enzyme BsaI. At this point, the system included all the elements required to assemble expression vectors that are compatible with the Bac-to-Bac system. Each of the resulting expression vectors are termed “Level 1” plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, top and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). Level 1 plasmids can express a single protein from an element that is termed a “Transcription Unit”: a functional element required to transcribe an mRNA that is coding for the expression of a desired protein.</p><p id="P21">To enable the assembly of multiple Transcription Units (from multiple Level 1 plasmids) into a single multi-gene baculovirus expression vector (termed “Level 2” plasmid), we required a new backbone that confers additional antibiotic resistance. For that, we added spectinomycin resistance into the ‘Recombination into BV DNA’ part (BV rec., part 6a). The new part 6a (‘Recombination into BV DNA + SpecR’ [BV rec. + SpecR]) can now be assembled together with the Backbone (BV BB, part 6b-d), a Spacer (part 2-4) and Connectors (parts 1 and 5) through a Golden Gate reaction using BsaI. The result is a Level 1 plasmid that is termed here ‘Level 2 Backbone’. The Level 2 Backbone plasmid does not carry a Transcription Unit but, instead, contributes the backbone during the assembly of Level 2 plasmids. Users can assemble their own ‘Level 2 Backbone’ plasmids using parts from the MoClo Baculo toolkit, together with Connector parts from the MoClo Yeast toolkit. However, for the ease of use, we included in the MoClo Baculo toolkit a Level 2 Backbone plasmid (pMB.002) that includes the ConLS’ and ConRE’ connectors. The pMB.002 plasmid allows the integration of up to 6 transcription units into a Level 2 plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, right, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Overall, this design ensures that both single-gene (Level 1) and multi-gene (Level 2) expression vectors are suitable for protein expression using the Bac-to-Bac system and, therefore, confer resistance to ampicillin and gentamicin. In addition to these, multi-gene (Level 2) baculovirus expression vectors also confer resistance to spectinomycin.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Modular cloning of baculovirus expression vectors</title><p id="P22">From this point, modular cloning is carried out using the same workflow that has been described for the MoClo Yeast toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. As the process is described below in brief, it is highly recommended to read the description of modular cloning by Weber et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and Lee et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Briefly, all the Level 0 (chloramphenicol resistant) vectors that carry the parts for a desired Transcription Unit are combined in a single pot Golden Gate assembly, using the type IIS restriction enzyme BsaI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). The produced Level 1 plasmid has lost its chloramphenicol resistance and now both the yeast and baculovirus expression vectors confer resistance to ampicillin in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The Level 1 baculovirus expression vectors also confer resistance to gentamicin in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This transition between antibiotic selection markers is inherited from the modular cloning method and allows selection against precursor plasmids while progressing up to the next plasmid Level through iterative cloning. For the production of baculovirus expression vectors, we use chloramphenicol to select Level 0 plasmids, ampicillin or gentamicin to select Level 1 plasmids and spectinomycin to select Level 2 plasmids. Each Level 1 plasmid can now be used to express a single protein, depending on the transcription unit and the backbone. Multiple Level 1 plasmids can be used to assemble one Level 2 plasmid—a multi-gene expression vector—using the Golden Gate assembly region with BsmBI digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, bottom). Yet, the assembly of Level 2 vectors requires some planning, because the order of the transcription units in a Level 2 vector is defined based on the Connectors (parts 1 and 5) that are included in each of the Level 1 vectors that are combined to assemble a multi-gene expression vector (Level 2).</p><p id="P23">Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] and Weber et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] are highly recommended readings on the topic of connector design, as the MoClo Baculo toolkit uses the connector parts of the MoClo Yeast toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. In brief, connectors are designed such that a right Connector (ConR, part 5) of a given Transcription Unit can be connected only to a complementary left Connector (ConL, part 1) of another Transcription unit. Exceptions are the ConLS’ and ConRE’ connectors that are reserved for the backbone. For instance, ConR1 is connected to ConL1 of another Transcription Unit, ConR2 is connected to ConL2 in another Transcription unit, and so forth (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for the list of connectors). Practically, this means that the order of the transcription units in a given Level 2 vector usually need to be defined at the time when one designs the relevant set of Level 1 vectors that are intended to be used together in a subsequent Golden Gate assembly.</p><p id="P24">Even when Level 2 expression vector is intended for the baculovirus system, we find it convenient to use the same connector parts that were designed by Lee et al for the MoClo Yeast toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. The MoClo Yeast toolkit provides connectors for combining up to 6 transcription units together. If less than 6 subunits are assembled, a linker plasmid can be used to connect the last transcription unit to the backbone (an example for that is described in the next section). It is anticipated that more connectors can be added to increase the number of transcription units in a given multi-gene expression vector, as long as the total length of the construct permits Golden Gate assembly.</p><p id="P25">We find that the sequencing of Level 1 plasmids is not required if they are only used as intermediate products for assembling a Level 2 vector. This is because mutations are uncommon, since no PCR or oligonucleotides are used. Therefore, when Level 1 plasmids are only used as intermediate products, we commonly validate the correct Level 1 plasmid assembly by restriction digestion before proceeding to Level 2 assembly. At the end of the process, the correct assembly of the Level 2 plasmid is validated by restriction digestion followed by whole plasmid sequencing. The obtained Level 2 plasmids are multi-gene expression vectors compatible with the bac-to-bac baculovirus expression system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Adding compatibility with the biGBac system</title><p id="P26">We envisioned that some users may benefit from compatibility between MoClo Baculo and the biGBac system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. This is because the biGBac system allows to connect together 5 multi-gene vectors using Gibson Assembly. Therefore, we decided to generate MoClo Baculo parts that would include the Gibson Assembly linkers of the biGBac system. For that, we modified the pMB.002 plasmid by inserting linker sequences (“A-F”) from pBIG1a-e [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and PmeI restriction enzyme sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref>). We named the resulting plasmids pMB.BIG1a to pMB.BIG1e. These plasmids are functionally identical to the biGBac system plasmids pBIG1a to pBIG1e plasmids, respectively. The compatibility between MoClo Baculo to the biGBac system may allow the optional connection of up to five Level 2 MoClo Baculo plasmids, each with up to six transcription units. The resulting biGBac expression vectors are referred to as Level 3 plasmids here and contain up to 30 transcription units.</p><p id="P27">We believe that most users will not need the compatibility with the biGBac system, and therefore it is marked here as optional. This is because compatibility with biGBac is beneficial only if one wishes to increase the maximal number of transcriptional units from six (Level 2 plasmids) to 30 (optional Level 3; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref>) without adding new MoClo Baculo adapters. However, the added compatibility between the MoClo Baculo to the biGBac system may allow regular users of the biGBac system to construct their expression vectors with the aid of Modular Cloning. This may provide biGBac users with the simplicity of removing or replacing tags without PCR or gibson assembly.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Modular cloning of yeast expression vectors</title><p id="P28">The construction of yeast expression vectors is carried out using the same CDS and tag parts that are used for baculovirus vector building. The process of vector building for yeast expression is nearly identical to the construction of baculovirus vectors, as described above. An exception is that for the construction of yeast expression vectors we normally use chloramphenicol to select Level 0 plasmids, ampicillin to select Level 1 plasmids and kanamycin to select Level 2 plasmids, as described by Lee et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Most of the parts that are used for building Level 1 and 2 plasmids for yeast expression are taken from the MoClo Yeast toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>; boxes over a white background). Exceptions are the following parts that were generated for the MoClo Baculo toolkit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>; boxes over a green or blue background): (i) Yeast promoter parts dedicated for using together with N-terminal tags according to the MoClo Baculo cloning standard and (ii) the same N-terminal tag parts; (iii) CDS parts and (iv) C-terminal tag parts that are both used for baculovirus expression but are also compatible with the yeast expression vectors.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Proof of principle: multi-gene vector construction</title><p id="P29">As MoClo Baculo adapted the Modular Cloning strategy of the MoClo Yeast toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], the efficiency of cloning Level 0 and Level 1 vectors is close to 100 %. As a demonstration of Level 1 cloning, we constructed six different Level 1 plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). These included a backbone plasmid for baculovirus expression (pMB.002) and five Transcription Units for the expression of each of the five subunits of the PRC2-AEBP2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>).

On the other hand, from the point plasmids are constructed, protein expression using the baculovirus system is a slow process (20-30 days under ideal conditions), while the yeast expression system provides a faster progress (6-7 days; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]). Another advantage of the yeast expression system is the lower cost of the media: roughly 40-20% of the per-litre cost compared to the baculovirus system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We propose that one could use MoClo Baculo in order to construct expression vectors for fast and cost-effective protein expression trials in yeast. Subsequently, the best-performing set of ORFs and tags can be assembled into baculovirus expression vectors, aiming for a high-yield protein production in insect cells.</p><p id="P40">A benefit of MoClo Baculo, with respect to most other baculovirus systems (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), is that the entire vector construction process can be automated, allowing high throughput cloning. Specifically, MoClo Baculo is PCR free, which reduces the likelihood of mutations and eliminates the need for primer design and PCR optimization. Open reading frames can be synthesised as plasmids or gene fragments (e.g. gBlocks), such that they can be directly domesticated into Level 0 vectors by Golden Gate assembly. For the same reason, MoClo Baculo would be beneficial also by reducing the time and training required to design and construct complex expression vectors in any lab.</p><p id="P41">As for other MoClo cloning standards, MoClo Baculo would allow labs and institutes to manufacture, store and share collections of ORFs and tags ready for their assembly into multi-gene expression vectors for baculovirus and yeast. MoClo Baculo was designed as a general cloning standard, with the end goal of expression and purification of multi-subunit complexes for applications of structural biology, biophysics and biochemistry.

If one wishes to use MoClo Baculo to construct biGBac plasmids, they will also have to ensure that CDS and tag parts do not include PmeI sites, although this would rarely be a problem as PmeI sites are extremely uncommon. If one wishes only to construct expression vectors for the baculovirus system, not for yeast, then it is not required to remove NotI sites from CDS parts.

Reactions were incubated in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 at 30°C, 100 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, and 5% v/v glycerol) for 30, 60, or 120 min at 30°C. Reactions were stopped by adding 4X LDS loading dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #NP0007) supplemented with 4% 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich #M3148) to a final concentration of 1X LDS and heating at 95°C for 5 min. The reactions were then loaded onto 16.5 % SDS-PAGE gels and ran on ice for 120 min at 160 V in 1X Tris-glycine buffer. Gels were stained with InstantBlue Coomassie protein stain (Expedeon, #ISB1L) before vacuum-drying for 1 h at 60°C. Dried gels were then exposed to a storage phosphor screen for six days before acquiring radiograms using a Typhoon 5 Imager (GE Healthcare). All experiments were performed in three independent replicates that were carried out on three separate days.</p><p id="P57">Densitometry was carried out using ImageLab software (Bio-Rad). Values were interpolated from a standard curve using GraphPad Prism 10.2.1 and the background was subtracted, then values plotted with SD displayed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Data 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS199328-supplement-Supplementary_Data_1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d86aAcDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Data 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS199328-supplement-Supplementary_Data_2.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d86aAcDcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Data 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS199328-supplement-Supplementary_Data_3.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d86aAcDdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Data 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS199328-supplement-Supplementary_Data_4.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d86aAcDeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Data 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS199328-supplement-Supplementary_Data_5.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d86aAcDfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Data 6</label><media xlink:href="EMS199328-supplement-Supplementary_Data_6.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d86aAcDgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS199328-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d86aAcDhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS199328-supplement-Supplementary_Table_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d86aAcDiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD9"><label>Supplementary Table 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS199328-supplement-Supplementary_Table_3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d86aAcDjB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD10"><label>Supplementary Table 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS199328-supplement-Supplementary_Table_4.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d86aAcDkB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD11"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS199328-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d86aAcDlB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the support of the Micromon Genomics facility.

ConL and ConR: Connectors designed to connect the left (ConL) and right (ConR) assemblies of parts originated from multiple Level 1 plasmids. Pro: a promoter compatible with the intended host organism. Promoters are available as type 2a or 2 parts, used in the presence or absence of an N-terminal tag, respectively. N’ Tag: optional N-terminal tag. CDS: coding sequence of the protein of interest. C’tag: optional C-terminal tag. Term: transcription termination sequence. The terminator is available as type 4b or 4 part, used in the presence or absence of a C-terminal tag, respectively. YB1: yeast antibiotic resistance. YB2: 3’ homologous arm, aiming for chromosomal integration in yeast, or for yeast plasmid maintenance. YB3: origin of replication (ori) for bacterial plasmid together with bacterial antibiotic selection marker. YB4: 5’ homologous arm, aiming for chromosomal integration in yeast. BB: origin of replication for bacterial plasmid together with bacterial antibiotic selection marker. BV rev.: Tn7L for bacmid recombination. BV BB: all elements from BB and also gentamicin resistance (GentR) and Tn7R for bacmid recombination. Parts created in this study for BV expression are highlighted in light blue. Parts created in this study for compatibility between the MoClo Baculo to the MoClo Yeast Toolkits were highlighted in light green (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). For the assembly of Level 1 plasmids, parts are subjected to Golden Gate assembly using the BsaI restriction enzyme (scissors). (B) The level 0 plasmids are cleaved using BsaI into fragments with complementary overhangs, as indicated, and these DNA fragments are ligated using a Golden Gate assembly. Level 1 plasmids are transcription units, each capable of expressing a single protein. An exception is where a simple backbone (BB, part 6) is used for the assembly of the transcription unit, which leads to a transcription unit that can be assembled into a functional Level 2 expression vector, although the Level 1 plasmid is not designed to function as an expression vector by itself. The same colour scheme as in A was used. Sites that are dedicated to restriction digestion using BsmBI, during the subsequent Golden Gate assembly of Level 2 plasmids, were marked as colourful hexagons, with the type of overhang coded by its colour (see illustration in the subsequent panel). (C) Multiple Level 1 vectors, including multiple transcription units and one backbone, are subjected to Golden Gate assembly using the BsmBI enzyme to form one Level 2 vector (only bases that are marked by same-colour hexagons can be ligated, using cohesive ends that are formed upon BsmBI cleavage). In some cases, a ‘Linker’ vector can replace a transcription unit in order to link between another transcription unit to the backbone (bottom right in (C)). (D) Level 2 plasmids are multi-gene expression vectors, designed to express a multi-subunit macromolecular complex. The compatible expression system is determined based on the parts selected in (A). Yeast expression vectors were designed to express proteins either after homologous recombination into a chromosome or using a yeast plasmid. The order of the transcription units is determined based on the connectors that were selected in (A).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199328-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Proof-of-principle: construction of multigene baculovirus expression vectors for the expression of 4- and 5-subunit PRC2 complexes.</title><p>(A) Golden Gate assembly of Level 1 plasmids was carried out using BsaI and two of the resulting clones were proceeded for restriction digestion using BsmBI. The plasmids pMB.M.E2, pMB.M.S12, pMB.M.ED, pMB.M.R4 and pMB.AI3 are Level 1 baculovirus expression vectors for the expression of EZH2, SUZ12, EED, RBBP4 and AEBP2 (isoform 3). The plasmid pMB.002 is a Level 1 plasmid that was assembled to contribute to the backbone during subsequent assemblies of Level 2 plasmids. (B) Schematic representation of the plasmids resulted from the Golden Gate assembly reaction that was analysed in (A). Presented are also two ‘linker plasmids’, L6 and L56, that are Level 1 plasmids that include a Spacer and Connector parts from the MoClo Yeast toolkit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], designed to connect the last Transcription Unit to the backbone during the assembly of a Level 2 plasmid. (C) Golden Gate assembly using the Level 1 plasmids from (B) was carried out using BsmBI to construct Level 2 plasmids for a baculovirus expression of the 4-subunit PRC2 (left) or the 5-subunit PRC2-AEBP2 (right). Left: pMB.M.E2, pMB.M.S12, pMB.M.ED, pMB.M.R4, pMB.002 and L56 were assembled to form an expression vector coding for PRC2. In this context, the linker L56 was designed to connect the 4th transcription unit to the backbone. Right: PRC2-AEBP2 expression vector was assembled from the same Level 1 plasmids, with the exception that the Level 1 plasmid pMB.AI3 was added to include also the expression of AEBP2 and the L56 linker plasmid was replaced by the L6 linker plasmid, to connect the 5th transcription unit to the backbone. Four clones were selected from each Golden Gate reaction and were subjected to restriction digestion using MfeI and SalI.
