In this study we describe a bacterial immune system comprising both a caspase-like protease and a TIR-domain protein. We found that the TIR protein, once it recognizes phage invasion, produces the previously unknown immune signaling molecule ADP-cyclo[N7:1”]-ribose (N7-cADPR). This molecule specifically activates the bacterial caspase-like protease which then indiscriminately degrades cellular proteins to halt phage replication. The TIR-caspase defense system, which we denote as type IV Thoeris, is abundant in bacteria and efficiently protects against phage propagation. Our study highlights the diversity of TIR-produced immune signaling molecules and demonstrates that cell death regulated by proteases of the caspase family is an ancient mechanism of innate immunity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Caspases are proteases with central roles in innate immunity and regulated cell death in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The human genome harbors twelve caspase-encoding genes, with some of them promoting inflammation while others functioning in the execution of cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Inflammatory caspases, including caspases 1, 4 and 5, are recruited to activated inflammasomes following pathogen recognition, and are responsible for the proteolytic activation of cytokines and gasdermin D, promoting cell death through pyroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Executioner caspases (e.g., caspases 3, 6 and 7), once activated by initiator caspases (8, 9 and 10), cleave hundreds of protein substrates to promote apoptotic cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Proteases of the caspase family (Pfam PF00656) also exist in prokaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, and were proposed to cleave bacterial gasdermins to activate immunity in response to phage infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Bacterial proteins of the caspase family were also shown to promote cell death when activated by type III CRISPR-Cas systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, the molecular functions of the vast majority of caspase-like proteins in bacteria remain poorly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Toll/Interleukin-1 Receptor (TIR) domain proteins also play key roles in innate immunity. Initially described as protein-protein interaction modules in human Toll-like and interleukin-1 receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, TIR domains in bacteria and plants were later shown to be enzymes that produce immune signaling molecules using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) as a substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In the bacterial defense system type I Thoeris, the TIR-domain protein, once it senses phage infection, produces the signaling molecule 1”-3’ glycocyclic ADP-ribose (gcADPR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. This molecule activates an effector protein that depletes the cell of NAD<sup>+</sup> and aborts phage replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The TIR-domain protein in type II Thoeris, on the other hand, produces the signaling molecule histidine-ADP-ribose (His-ADPR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, which activates an effector protein that disrupts the cell membrane to abort phage propagation. A third type of Thoeris was recently proposed but its mechanism of action and molecular signaling remain unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In plants, TIR-derived signaling molecules are diverse and include phosphoribosyl-AMP/ADP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, 1”-2’ gcADPR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, di-ADPR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, ATP-ADPR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and 2’,3’-cAMP/cGMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Current evidence suggests that the repertoire of immune signaling molecules produced by TIR domains has not been fully unveiled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we describe type IV Thoeris, a bacterial defense system encoding both a TIR-domain protein and a caspase-like protease. We show that upon phage infection, the TIR-domain protein produces a novel signaling molecule, N7-cADPR, that binds the caspase-like protease and triggers promiscuous arginine-specific protease activity. Protease activation leads to indiscriminate cleavage of multiple proteins, including elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), thereby aborting phage infection. Our study establishes a direct functional connection between TIR signaling and caspase activation in bacterial defense against phages.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A TIR-caspase operon provides anti-phage immunity</title><p id="P6">While examining the genomic environment of caspase-like proteins in bacteria, we noticed an abundant two-gene operon encoding a short TIR-domain protein and a caspase-like protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Operons with this gene organization were frequently encoded in the vicinity of bacterial defense systems, suggesting a defensive function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1</xref>). We synthesized and cloned two such operons, one from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 328 and the other from <italic>Pseudomonas sp.</italic> 1 -7, and expressed these in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter. Following a challenge by a panel of phages, we observed that the infectivity of phage T6 was substantially reduced when plated on cells expressing either of the operons, showing that this TIR- and caspase-encoding operon is a novel defense system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Since the <italic>E. coli</italic> 328 operon exhibited slight toxicity upon expression induction, we selected the <italic>Pseudomonas sp.</italic> 1-7 (<italic>Ps</italic>) homolog for further study.</p><p id="P7">Single amino acid substitutions in the predicted catalytic sites of <italic>Ps</italic>TIR (E79Q) and <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase (C129A) proteins abolished defense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), suggesting that the enzymatic activity of both proteins is required for immunity. Bacterial cells expressing the system were able to survive when infected with T6 in liquid culture at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), but died when infected at a high MOI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In addition, infected cells expressing the system did not release phage progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). These results suggest that this defense system functions through regulated cell death or dormancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and provides population-level protection against phage T6. Homology-based searches in a database of ~38,000 prokaryotic genomes revealed that this defense system is found in hundreds of bacteria and archaea belonging to diverse phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Caspase cleaves EF-Tu during phage infection</title><p id="P8">TIR domains were described as NAD<sup>+</sup>-degrading effectors in diverse families of defense systems, including Pycsar, CBASS and prokaryotic argonautes, where their function is to deplete cells of NAD<sup>+</sup>once triggered by phage infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Bacterial caspase-like proteases, on the other hand, were suggested to cleave bacterial gasdermins into active pore-forming effectors to induce cell death following infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. For this reason, we initially hypothesized that <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase would cleave <italic>Ps</italic>TIR into an active NAD<sup>+</sup>-depleting form during infection. However, we did not detect any change in the molecular weight of <italic>Ps</italic>TIR during T6 infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2A</xref>). In addition, we observed only very mild reduction in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels during infection of cells expressing the system, which contrasts with the &gt;95% reduction typically observed in NAD<sup>+</sup>-depleting defense systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2B</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Ps</italic>TIR is unlikely to be an NAD<sup>+</sup>-depleting effector activated by <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase.</p><p id="P9">In Thoeris defense systems, bacterial TIR domains have an alternative role that does not involve NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion. In these systems, TIR domains generate signaling molecules that activate downstream effectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. We therefore hypothesized that <italic>Ps</italic>TIR may produce a signaling molecule during infection, and that this signaling molecule would bind and activate the effector <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase. Under this hypothesis, <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase is expected to cleave cellular or phage target proteins and halt phage infection.</p><p id="P10">To explore possible target proteins of <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase, we chemically labeled NH2 groups in proteins present in lysates of T6-infected cells and subjected the labeled proteins to mass spectrometry (MS). This technique enables the identification of new protein N-termini specifically found in cells expressing the defense system as compared to control cells. A preliminary MS analysis following free amine tagging identified multiple candidate <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase targets, including the elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), a highly abundant cellular protein essential for protein translation, which was previously shown to be the target of the Lit protease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3</xref>). To verify that EF-Tu is a target of <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase, we co-expressed the TIR-caspase system with a C-terminally tagged copy of EF-Tu in an <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain in which <italic>lit</italic> was deleted, and monitored EF-Tu cleavage during phage infection by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Two EF-Tu cleavage products were visible in cells expressing the defense system following T6 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). These cleavage products were absent when the catalytic cysteine in <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase or the catalytic glutamate in <italic>Ps</italic>TIR were mutated to alanine, showing that EF-Tu cleavage requires both caspase and TIR activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The molecular weight of cleavage products and the exploratory MS data suggested that EF-Tu is cleaved after two specific arginine residues (R45 and R59) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), which was confirmed by the loss of EF-Tu cleavage upon mutation of these two residues into glutamines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase is specifically activated during phage infection and cleaves EF-Tu downstream of arginine residues at positions 45 and 59.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Caspase activity is triggered by a TIR-derived signaling molecule</title><p id="P11">We then investigated whether, as in the Thoeris family of defense systems, <italic>Ps</italic>TIR produces a signaling molecule that activates <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase during infection. To do so, we collected lysates from cells expressing <italic>Ps</italic>TIR only and filtered these lysates with a 3 kDa cutoff to retain small metabolites. We then tested the ability of these metabolite extracts to activate EF-Tu cleavage by <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). EF-Tu cleavage was visible when lysates from cells expressing both <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase and tagged EF-Tu were incubated with metabolite extracts derived from infected <italic>Ps</italic>TIR-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In contrast, EF-Tu cleavage was absent when the metabolites were extracted from infected cells expressing RFP or <italic>Ps</italic>TIR<sup>E79Q</sup> instead of <italic>Ps</italic>TIR, or from uninfected <italic>Ps</italic>TIR-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Ps</italic>TIR produces a <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase-activating signaling molecule during infection.</p><p id="P12">To develop a more streamlined assay for <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase activation, we used a synthetic five amino acid peptide comprising the residues preceding the target cleavage site in EF-Tu (position 55-59, EEKAR) fused to 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC). In this assay, which is similar to assays previously used to study human caspases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and caspase-like proteins in bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, peptide cleavage downstream the arginine is expected to release free AMC and emit a fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase was able to cleave the synthetic EEKAR-AMC peptide when incubated with metabolites derived from infected cells expressing <italic>Ps</italic>TIR, but not when incubated with metabolites extracted from infected RFP-expressing control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase activity was even more pronounced upon incubation with metabolites derived from infected cells expressing the TIR protein from the <italic>E. coli</italic> 328 TIR-caspase system (<italic>Ec</italic>TIR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), suggesting that in the experimental conditions used here, <italic>Ec</italic>TIR produces higher amounts of signaling molecule than <italic>Ps</italic>TIR. Together, these results demonstrate that the caspase-like protein is activated by a small molecule specifically produced by the TIR-domain protein during phage infection. We therefore name this defense system type IV Thoeris.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title><italic>Ps</italic>Caspase is a promiscuous arginine-specific protease</title><p id="P13">We then investigated the substrate specificity of the caspase-like protein using synthetic peptides with mutations in the wild-type EF-Tu sequence (EEKAR). Activated <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase was able to cleave EEAAR-AMC and EEKLR-AMC peptides, but not an EEKAA-AMC peptide, indicating that the arginine residue at the P1 position is strictly required for cleavage, but other residues are not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase does not specifically recognize EF-Tu but might rather be a promiscuous protease.</p><p id="P14">To systematically search for additional cellular targets of <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase beyond EF-Tu, we incubated lysates of <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> cells with metabolites extracted from infected <italic>Ec</italic>TIR-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the loss of multiple abundant proteins in the presence of <italic>Ec</italic>TIR-derived metabolites, combined with the presence of a smear of low-molecular weight protein products, suggesting massive <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase-dependent protein degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). We subjected these lysates to chymotrypsin digestion and mass spectrometry analysis to identify cleavage sites in a systematic manner. This analysis revealed that peptides starting directly downstream of arginine, or ending with arginine, were strongly enriched upon incubation with <italic>Ec</italic>TIR-derived metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>), indicating that cleavage occurs downstream of arginine residues. Cleavage events were observed in multiple essential proteins of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>), with a strict requirement for an arginine in the P1 position and a slight preference for small nonpolar residues surrounding the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>). We confirmed the cleavage of one of these target proteins, ribosomal protein RplE, by western blot using cell lysates incubated with <italic>Ec</italic>TIR-derived metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>). Altogether, our results show that <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase is a promiscuous arginine-specific protease that cleaves multiple target proteins once activated by the <italic>Ps</italic>TIR-derived signaling molecule.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Type IV Thoeris produces the new signaling molecule N7-cADPR</title><p id="P15">We next examined the properties of the <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase-activating signaling molecule produced by type IV Thoeris. For this, we sought to take advantage of previously described phage proteins that sequester specific Thoeris-derived signaling molecules as a means to inhibit bacterial defense. Thoeris anti-defense 1 (Tad1) from phage SBSphiJ7 and Tad2 from phage SPO1 are known to sequester the 1”-3’ gcADPR signaling molecule produced by type I Thoeris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, and Tad2 from <italic>Myroides odoratus</italic> (ModTad2) sequesters His-ADPR molecules and inhibits type II Thoeris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. However, co-expression of Tad1, Tad2 or ModTad2 with type IV Thoeris did not inhibit the defensive activity of the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), suggesting that type IV Thoeris does not utilize the same molecule as types I or II Thoeris. Furthermore, incubation of metabolites derived from <italic>Ec</italic>TIR-expressing infected cells with purified Tad proteins did not affect the ability of these metabolites to activate <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase in our reporter assay, suggesting that Tad proteins are unable to sequester the signaling molecule of type IV Thoeris (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5A</xref>). Finally, purified 1”-3’ gcADPR, 1”-2’ gcADPR, ADPR and cyclic-ADPR molecules were unable to activate <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), and conversely, <italic>Ec</italic>TIR-derived metabolites were unable to activate the ThsA NADase effector of type I Thoeris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5B</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the signaling molecule of type IV Thoeris is distinct from that of type I and type II Thoeris.</p><p id="P16">To further examine the nature of the signaling molecule produced by type IV Thoeris, we used HPLC fractionation to purify the molecule from lysates of phage-infected <italic>Ec</italic>TIR-expressing cells, using the peptide-AMC cleavage assay as a reporter system to assess the activity of HPLC fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6</xref>). Initial purification in phosphate buffer (pH=8.0) showed that the molecule rapidly lost activity in these conditions, and we therefore purified it in water (pH=7.0). Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) showed that the molecule has the same mass as the canonical cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>) and MS-MS analysis showed that the fragmentation pattern of the molecule was indistinguishable from that of cADPR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6D</xref>). However, the molecule had a different LC retention time and absorbed light at a different wavelength than cADPR, suggesting that the type IV Thoeris molecule is distinct from cADPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Indeed, synthetic cADPR was unable to activate <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P17">We subjected the purified molecule to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis. Data from 1D 1H, 2D homonuclear COSY and TOCSY, and 2D heteronuclear <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HSQC and HMBC NMR experiments showed that the molecule comprises two ribose moieties and an adenine base, supporting the notion that the molecule is a variant of cADPR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S7</xref>). However, ribose carbon 1”, which in the canonical cADPR is naturally found attached to N1 in the adenine ring, showed a 3-bond HMBC correlation to H8 in the adenine ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, inferred from the H8-C1” and H1”-C8 correlations in the HMBC spectrum). Moreover, similar intensities were observed for peaks correlating position 8 on the adenine base and 1’ and 1” in the two ribose moieties (H1’-C8 and H1”-C8, and H8-C1’ and H8-C1”), indicating a symmetrical orientation of the two ribose moieties relative to carbon atom C8 of the adenine base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Given that ribose carbon 1’ was verified as attached to N9 in the adenine base (H1’-C4 correlation), our results indicate that ribose carbon 1” is attached to nitrogen atom N7 in the adenine base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Altogether, our MS and NMR experiments indicate that the molecule that activates <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase is ADP-cyclo[N7:1”]-ribose (N7-cADPR), a molecule that, to our knowledge, was not described before in natural systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). It was previously shown that N7-methylation of adenosine shifts the wavelength of the absorption maximum from 257 to 272 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, which is in line with the shift in absorption that we observe in N7-cADPR as compared to cADPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Together, our data provide a model for the mechanism of type IV Thoeris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Once infection is sensed in the cell, the TIR-domain protein utilizes NAD<sup>+</sup> as a substrate and generates a cyclized ADPR molecule where the carbon previously connected to the nicotinamide ring becomes covalently attached to the N7 nitrogen atom in the adenine base. This N7-cADPR molecule specifically activates the caspase-like effector of the defense system which then indiscriminately cleaves cellular and potentially phage proteins after arginine residues, causing massive protein degradation in the cell and incapacitating the phage reproductive cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">In this study we discovered the molecule N7-cADPR and showed that it functions as an immune signaling molecule in bacteria. Past studies showed that immune signaling molecules tend to be shared between domains of life. For example, 2’3’ cyclic GMP-AMP functions as an immune signaling molecule in the human cGAS-STING pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, as well as in defense systems of the CBASS family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Similarly, 3’3’ cyclic UMP-AMP, originally discovered as a signaling molecule in bacterial CBASS systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, was later shown to be produced by animal immune proteins in response to dsRNA stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. TIR-derived immune signaling molecules also have parallels between bacteria, animals and plants. For example, 1”-3’ gcADPR, produced by type I Thoeris, was shown to also be produced by the plant immune protein BdTIR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and the human TIR-domain protein SARM1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, although the biological roles of this molecule in plants and human are currently unclear. It is therefore to be anticipated that the new molecule discovered here, N7-cADPR, could also be found to participate in immune signaling in multicellular eukaryotes in future studies.</p><p id="P20">Two types of Thoeris systems were previously studied in detail, and a third type (type III Thoeris) was suggested recently based on an operon architecture that contains TIR domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In type I Thoeris, the effector protein ThsA harbors a SLOG domain that binds the signaling molecule gcADPR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and in type II Thoeris, the signaling molecule His-ADPR is perceived by a Macro domain found in the effector protein. In type IV Thoeris, the caspase-like protease effector encodes a C-terminal domain of unknown function, and we hypothesize that this domain is responsible for binding N7-cADPR to trigger the proteolytic activity of the effector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S8A</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, structural modeling suggests that <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase forms a dimer, in which the C-terminal domains are brought in close proximity to form a putative N7-cADPR-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S8B</xref>). Future studies will be necessary to examine the mechanism of <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase activation.</p><p id="P21">Human caspases can function both as initiators of cell death, where they activate specific death-promoting proteins by proteolytic cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, or as executioners of cell death, where they cleave hundreds of proteins to promote apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Our findings strengthen the understanding that caspase-like proteins have similar roles in bacterial immunity. Bacterial caspase-like proteases were previously shown to cleave bacterial gasdermins into pore-forming effectors that execute a form of pyroptotic-like cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, paralleling inflammatory caspases in human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In type IV Thoeris immunity, the role of the caspase-like protease is analogous to executioner caspases, as it directly executes cell death by cleaving many cellular target proteins, likely shutting off essential processes in the cell and preventing viral replication. Recent work has shown that some type III CRISPR-Cas systems also co-opted caspase-like proteases as a part of their immune mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In particular, a type III-B CRISPR-Cas system employs a cascade of proteolytic events, in which CRISPR-Cas signaling activates a SAVED-CHAT protease to specifically process <italic>PCaspase</italic>, a caspase-like promiscuous protease that cleaves multiple proteins possibly downstream of arginine residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Our results point to a common molecular function of <italic>PCaspase</italic> and the type IV Thoeris caspase as arginine-specific promiscuous proteases responsible for executing cell death or dormancy. Caspase-like proteases were predicted to be associated with other families of defense systems such as CBASS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> and Avs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, but their roles in these systems are currently unknown.

Assignment of the adenine <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C shifts was based on heteronuclear multiple-bound HMBC correlations, observed between 1H and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>C that are 2-3 bonds apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S7E-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). Observation of weak HMBC cross peaks between H2-C5 and H8-C6 further supports the assignment, attributing these to weak, 4-bond correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S7F-G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). The slow chemical exchange observed for the <sup>1</sup>H signal at 9.45 ppm (data not shown) further supports its assignment as H8, known to reveal slow exchange rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. At the absence of protons which are 3-bonds apart, the cyclization details could only be revealed by long-range <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMBC correlations. Two strong cross peaks between the adenine and the two ribose moieties, H1’-C8 and H2”-C8, in addition to correlations between H8-C1’, H8-C1 ” and H1’- C4 observed in the HMBC spectrum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S7H</xref>, marked by red), indicate that the enzyme catalyzes the formation of C1”(ribose)-N7 and C1’(ribose)-N9. <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMBC-derived correlations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>: correlations connecting the adenine with the two ribose moieties are marked by red arrows; other long-range HMBC correlations are shown by black arrows. The down-field shift of H8 (9.73 ppm) that becomes deshielded further supports this cyclization: a similar effect was observed for N7-substituted guanosine (N7-guanosome)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> cleavage assays and mass spectrometry</title><p id="P40"><italic>Ps</italic>Caspase cell lysates and metabolites derived from infected cells expressing <italic>Ec</italic>TIR or RFP (control) were produced as described above.

(<bold>C</bold>) Schematic representation of the <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase reporter assay. A peptide comprising the residues preceding one of the cleavage sites in EF-Tu (EEKAR, positions 55-59) fused to 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) was synthesized. The synthetic peptide was incubated with lysates from <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655Δ<italic>lit</italic> cells and small molecules collected from infected TIR- or RFP-expressing cells. <italic>Ps</italic>Caspase activation leads to peptide cleavage downstream of the arginine residue, thereby releasing the free fluorophore.
