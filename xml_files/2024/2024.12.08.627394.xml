However, the mechanisms underpinning transcriptional heterogeneity remain under-explored.</p><p id="P3">In higher eukaryotes, gene transcription initiates from promoters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, but highly regulated context-specific expression is often controlled by the activity of distal regulatory elements termed enhancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Multiple models have been proposed for enhancer function (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>), but key attributes of enhancer activity include a specific chromatin profile (enrichment for H3K27ac and H3K4me1); the production of short bidirectional transcripts termed eRNAs; the binding of sequence-specific transcription factors; the tendency to come within close proximity of the promoter in 3D space when active; and the ability to drive tissue- and temporal-specific gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Aberrant enhancer activity is being increasingly recognized as a driver of human disease, the most obvious examples involving large genomic rearrangements that bring enhancers close to the genes they aberrantly regulate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Recent work has also identified cancer-specific regulatory programs driven by tumor-associated enhancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. DNA insertions and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can alter transcription factor (TF) binding and thus impact enhancer function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, but less is known about how non-DNA mutations such as epigenetic changes can drive cancer-specific enhancer function.</p><p id="P5">Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of childhood cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Although children with ALL generally respond well to therapy, there are specific subtypes that still confer a poor prognosis, especially in infant ALL <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, although new therapies such as Blinatumomab show great promise frontline treatment for infant ALL <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Even so, there are limited treatment options for ALL patients who relapse <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and even when successful, treatment of childhood ALL can have life-long adverse impacts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. ALL caused by rearrangements of the <italic>KMT2A</italic> gene (formerly <italic>MLL</italic>) producing in-frame gene fusions that create novel fusion proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The most common <italic>KMT2A</italic> rearrangement (<italic>KMT2A</italic>r) is <italic>KMT2A::AFF1</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> which is the major cause of infant ALL and where it has a near silent mutational landscape <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. <italic>KMT2A</italic> rearrangements also cause acute myeloid leukemias (AML) as well as ALL in older children and adults <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Although not as mutationally silent as infants, even in older patients, <italic>KMT2A</italic> rearrangements have a much lower mutational burden than other subtypes of ALL or AML and lack commonly recurring mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Despite the low mutational burden, <italic>KMT2A</italic>r leukemias exhibit substantial transcriptional and phenotypic heterogeneity between individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, providing an ideal model to study transcriptional heterogeneity without the confounding effect of numerous cooperating mutations. KMT2A fusion proteins are generally thought to drive disease through both transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, primarily by binding to the promoters of genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We have recently shown that the KMT2A::AFF1 protein complex drives high levels of gene expression by inducing oncogenic enhancer activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. However, it is unknown how much enhancer usage might differ between patients of the same leukemia subtype, or how differential enhancer usage might drive individual transcription patterns and thereby influence prognostic outcomes.</p><p id="P7">Here, in B-ALL primary patient samples and cell lines with a variety of molecular subtypes, including <italic>KMT2A::AFF1, ETV6::RUNX1, DUX4</italic>/<italic>ERG</italic> and hyperdiploidy, we identified extensive transcriptional heterogeneity and, by extensive chromatin profiling, revealed the existence of a large number of novel enhancers in individual patients. CRISPR-Cas9-based deletion of representative enhancers unique to individual KMT2A::AFF1 cell lines altered target gene expression in a cell-specific manner. For the first time, we were able to use the high resolution 3C technique Micro-Capture-C (MCC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>) in a primary patient sample to show in detail that KMT2A::AFF1-bound enhancers near <italic>MEIS1</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic> contact the <italic>MEIS1</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic> promoters, directly implicating these patient-specific enhancers in the overexpression of these genes.

To explore the mechanistic aspects of differential enhancer activity in greater detail, we compared gene expression differences in two <italic>KMT2A::AFF1</italic> ALL patient-derived cell lines, SEM and RS4;11. RNA sequencing of these cell lines revealed 4,351 differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating significant transcriptional heterogeneity and validating them as suitable models for further study.</p><p id="P15">To compare enhancer usage between the two cell lines, we measured chromatin accessibility, a proxy for enhancer activity, under the assumption that increased accessibility correlates with transcription factor binding. Even though both cell lines are derived from <italic>KMT2A::AFF1</italic> leukemias, significant differences in enhancer accessibility were seen between SEM and RS4;11 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). After filtering, 7,194 putative enhancers were identified and of these 1,677 displayed significantly increased accessibility in SEM cells, with 1,522 increased in RS4;11 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although the majority of the differential enhancers displayed a relatively minor difference in accessibility, with 925 and 1124 enhancers displaying less than a two-fold increase in RS4;11 and SEM cells, respectively, a significant number of enhancers were uniquely detected in one of these cell lines.</p><p id="P16">Strikingly, we identified enhancers with differential activity at known KMT2A::AFF1 target genes such as <italic>GNAQ</italic> and <italic>ARID1B</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. The <italic>GNAQ</italic> gene is associated with intragenic enhancers in SEM cells which are absent in RS4;11 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, blue shading). In contrast, at <italic>ARID1B</italic>, an upstream intergenic enhancer is present in RS4;11 cells but absent in SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, red shading), and an intragenic enhancer in SEM cells shows reduced activity in RS4;11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, blue shading). At both of these genes, the cell line-specific enhancers show an increased frequency of interaction with the promoter, as measured by Capture-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref>), a typical feature of enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">We validated the activity of the differential <italic>GNAQ</italic> and <italic>ARID1B</italic> enhancers by targeting them for CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>). Deletion of the <italic>GNAQ</italic> intragenic enhancer locus in SEM cells decreased expression of <italic>GNAQ</italic> in SEM cells, while in RS4;11 cells no significant change in <italic>GNAQ</italic> expression was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similarly, deletion of the RS4;11-specific <italic>ARID1B</italic> enhancer sequence in RS4;11 cells resulted in a reduction in gene expression, whereas RNA levels were not significantly altered in SEM deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). This is consistent with these regions being active enhancers in a cell line-specific manner.</p><p id="P18">To explore the effect of cell line-specific enhancers on transcription genome-wide, we linked enhancers to the nearest gene. Enhancers displaying increased activity were more frequently linked to genes displaying increased expression (51.8% of enhancer-gene pairs in SEM cells and 64.9% in RS4;11 cells, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>), arguing that these epigenetic differences are functionally relevant. In addition, genes linked to one or more differentially active enhancer(s) displayed significantly increased differences in gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, these regions are <italic>bona fide</italic> enhancers with differential effects on gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Heterogeneity in enhancer activity is common in B-ALL</title><p id="P19">We next wanted to determine if the enhancer heterogeneity we observed in the cell line models also applied in ALL patient samples. First, we leveraged publicly available RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets from a diverse cohort of 24 primary patient samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> comprised of <italic>ETV6::RUNX1, DUX4</italic>/<italic>ERG</italic> and hyperdiploid B-ALL subtypes. We examined the variance in gene expression both between and within the B-cell ALL subtypes and observed substantial transcriptional variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>). While each of the three subtypes clustered separately as expected, using either hierarchical or k-means clustering we identified six distinct clusters of genes based on their expression profile, implying substantial variability within the patient subtypes. For example, expression patterns in clusters 1 and 6 divided patient samples in the hyperdiploid subtype into two distinct subtypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To establish the source of this transcriptional heterogeneity we examined the chromatin accessibility landscape of these samples. We generated a consensus peak set consisting of 71,800 open chromatin regions and categorised these open chromatin sites into promoter (&lt;2.5 kb from the nearest transcription start site (TSS)) and putative enhancers (≥ 2.5 kb; these will also include non-enhancer loci) and correlated normalized read counts between samples at both promoter and enhancer regions Importantly, promoter peaks exhibited a substantially higher correlation (0.81-0.96; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) between samples compared to enhancers (0.52-0.91; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), supporting the proposition that variability in enhancer usage could distinguish leukemia subtypes. To further establish this, enhancer regions were able to separate the B-ALL subtypes into their distinct subsets, whereas promoter regions failed to fully distinguish the <italic>ETV6::RUNX1</italic> and <italic>DUX4</italic>/<italic>ERG</italic> subtypes. This shows that enhancer activity might provide a more robust signature of leukemia subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with enhancers being the main source of transcriptional differences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">We next wanted to refine this analysis and determine whether there was variability in enhancer usage between individual patients. To do this, we intersected the open chromatin regions identified within each sample to the consensus peak set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). Across all subtypes, promoter regions displayed a higher degree of concordance with 45.6-61.2% being accessible in all samples within each subtype. In contrast, putative enhancer regions exhibited a substantially decreased consistency between samples with only 11.9-28.9% of regions being accessible in all samples, implying a high degree of variability in the activity of enhancers between samples. Examples of the variability in enhancer activity could be readily observed at the <italic>INTS9</italic> locus in the hyperdiploid subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), the <italic>SAMD12</italic> locus in the <italic>ETV6::RUNX1</italic> subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) and the <italic>MLLT3</italic> locus in the <italic>DUX4</italic>/<italic>ERG</italic> subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Taken together, these results show two things: 1) different leukemia subtypes share a distinct enhancer signature, and 2) despite this shared enhancer signature, there is also significant variability between samples, suggesting patient to patient heterogeneity.</p><p id="P22">We next aimed to determine if these changes in enhancer activity could be linked directly to gene expression. We compared scaled chromatin accessibility at these enhancers with scaled gene expression of the nearest gene for each patient. Despite the limitation that enhancers do not always regulate the nearest promoter, we observed a notable positive correlation (ranging from 0.36 to 0.62) between putative enhancer accessibility and gene expression for the most variable genes (n=100, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>). This correlation suggests that differential enhancer activity likely contributes to the transcriptional heterogeneity observed between these patient samples.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>There is extensive enhancer heterogeneity in <italic>KMT2A::AFF1</italic> B-ALL patient leukemia samples</title><p id="P23">To identify heterogenous enhancer usage in <italic>KMT2A::AFF1</italic> patient blasts we wanted to be able to compare enhancer usage with gene expression on a single cell level. To do this, we performed 10x single cell (sc) Multiome (ATAC + RNAseq) on FACS-sorted CD19+ blast populations obtained from four <italic>KMT2A::AFF1</italic> ALL patient samples (3 infants and 1 older child). Using the scATAC modality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), we examined the degree of heterogeneity in chromatin accessibility and identified 6,231 regions of open chromatin with significantly altered accessibility between leukemic blasts from the 4 patients (340,494 regions identified in total; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The majority (64%) of differentially accessible regions were located more than 2.5 kb from the nearest TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), predominantly consisting of intronic elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), implying that most of these regions are putative enhancers.</p><p id="P24">To robustly identify active enhancers, we performed detailed epigenetic profiling in nine <italic>KMT2A::AFF1</italic> patient samples (four infants and five children) with a low-cell number optimized chromatin immunoprecipitation protocol, TOPmentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 1</xref>), including the 4 patients with sc-multiome data. We defined a consensus set of putative enhancer regions by identifying H3K27ac enriched regions that were ≥2.5kb from the nearest TSS. Due to the limited material available, resulting in a lack of replicates and variability in sample viability, we devised an autoencoder-based strategy to limit sample-sample noise and identify enhancer regions that displayed substantially altered enhancer activity, marked by increased levels of H3K27ac, between patient blasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). This allowed us to identify 290 patient-specific putative enhancers across the nine patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3A-F</xref>). In many cases, these patient-specific enhancers were associated with the binding of KMT2A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3A-F</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Since we observed patient-specific enhancer activity, we sought to determine the extent of transcriptional heterogeneity between <italic>KMT2A::AFF1</italic> patient samples. To this end, we integrated our single nucleus gene expression data with a published single cell gene expression (scGEX <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>) dataset of <italic>KMT2A::AFF1</italic> blasts from three iALL patients to increase the number of patients in our dataset.. Initial dimensionality reduction, following batch correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicated that each patient sample formed a distinct cluster, implying unique gene expression profiles. Moreover, analysis of differential gene expression between the samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>; FDR &lt; 0.01) revealed a surprising number of genes (3,306) that exhibited heterogeneous expression, with top marker genes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>. This number is comparable to the differential expression observed between <italic>KMT2A::AFF1</italic> cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, marker gene analysis indicated that two key <italic>KMT2A::AFF1</italic> target genes, <italic>MEIS1</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic>, were both highly elevated in chALL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4A</xref>). Returning to our epigenetic data from this patient, we observed a chALL1 unique putative enhancer region downstream of <italic>MEIS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>) and a putative enhancer upstream of <italic>RUNX2</italic> in chALL1 and iALL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>), both of which were enriched for KMT2A binding.</p><p id="P26">Both <italic>MEIS1</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic> expression are increased upon relapse in B-ALL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4B-C</xref> and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>), and expression of <italic>RUNX2</italic> is significantly higher in patients that did not exhibit complete remission (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4D</xref>). High <italic>MEIS1</italic> expression is also significantly correlated with a worse outcome in childhood ALL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4E</xref>), while high <italic>RUNX2</italic> expression significantly correlates with a worse overall survival in <italic>non-KMT2Ar</italic> adult ALL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4F</xref>). Together, these results show that high levels of expression of two key genes associated either with relapse or worse overall survival (i.e. <italic>RUNX2</italic> and <italic>MEIS1</italic>), can be driven by enhancer activity that is specific to an individual patient leukemia sample.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Novel enhancers in <italic>KMT2A::AFF1</italic> leukemias are directly linked to genes that they regulate</title><p id="P27">Our analysis identified multiple unique enhancers in patient samples. To confirm these regions were <italic>bona fide</italic> enhancers, we performed the high resolution 3C method Micro-Capture-C (MCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>), using 75 promoters as viewpoints, in chALL1 blasts, in which we identified putative unique enhancers at <italic>MEIS1</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic>. This revealed that these enhancer elements frequently came into physical proximity with the promoters of <italic>MEIS1</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>) strongly implying that the enhancer elements regulate these genes. We did not observe promoter interactions with the chALL1 <italic>MEIS1</italic> enhancer in the SEM cell line, confirming that these interactions are dependent on the presence of the active enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, we do observe the presence of the <italic>RUNX2</italic> enhancer in SEM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>) in addition to iALL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>), implying that this enhancer is not strictly chALL1 specific but instead is variable among KMT2A::AFF1 patients.</p><p id="P28">Using our MCC data we were able to confirm the targets of additional chALL1 unique enhancers, e.g. at the <italic>CD69</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). In agreement with our hypothesis that these patient-specific enhancers increase the expression of their target gene, <italic>CD69</italic> expression was elevated in chALL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, patient specific enhancers have previously been identified at the <italic>CD69</italic> gene in cases of mixed phenotype acute leukemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. In contrast to <italic>MEIS1, RUNX2</italic> and <italic>CD69, ARID1B</italic> expression was not substantially increased in chALL1 when compared to other patient samples, likely because an <italic>ARID1B</italic> intragenic enhancer that is present in SEM cells is missing in chALL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5B</xref>). Taken together, our data confirm that the differential enhancer regions identified at <italic>MEIS1, RUNX2</italic> and <italic>CD69</italic> are indeed enhancers for these genes, and thus implicating them in oncogene overexpression.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>KMT2A::AFF1 binding is predictive of enhancer activity</title><p id="P29">Having identified differential enhancer usage in <italic>KMT2A::AFF1</italic> leukemias, we wanted to confirm that it was not driven by small-scale changes in DNA sequence at these enhancers. Using WGS we looked for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within the enhancers exhibiting differential activity in the KMT2A::AFF1 cell lines (SEM and RS4;11). Only 25-43.2% of enhancers contained at least one SNV or insertion-deletion (INDEL) and frequencies were comparable between common and cell line-unique enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), implying that mutations in enhancer regions are unlikely to explain most of the differential enhancer activity. Furthermore, we examined if any of these variants exhibited allele-specific bias in our ATAC-seq data, as increased chromatin accessibility might indicate a functional consequence of the mutation. Strikingly, only 0.5-2.2% of enhancers contained one or more heterozygous SNVs exhibiting allele-specific bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that SNVs in these enhancer regions are unable to explain the differences in enhancer activity observed.</p><p id="P30">Our past work has shown that KMT2A::AFF1 binding is essential for maintaining enhancer function at a shared set of KMT2A::AFF1 target genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. The unique enhancers identified in this current study often have KMT2A bound to them (using an antibody that also detects KMT2A::AFF1), implicating KMT2A::AFF1 in driving enhancer heterogeneity. To explore this in an unbiased manner, we created a model to identify the most likely factors driving enhancer heterogeneity in KMT2A::AFF1 ALL. We developed a gradient-boosted decision tree model using 56 lab-generated ChIP-seq datasets from SEM and RS4;11 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) to be able to predict which enhancers would exhibit increased activity in SEM or RS4;11 cells (weighted F1 score of 0.845 for predicting enhancers increased in RS4;11 and 0.736 SEM specific enhancers; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6A-B</xref>), as well as those with unchanged activity. We used this model to identify the datasets with the highest predictive power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>) and verified that the five most predictive features displayed significant enrichment differences between common and cell type-specific enhancer classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Strikingly, the model identified the presence of KMT2A in each cell line as the most important feature for defining differential enhancer usage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>) followed by its fusion partner AFF1 and the KMT2A::AFF1 complex component PAF1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Taken together this implicates binding of the KMT2A::AFF1 complex with differential enhancer usage. In line with this, KMT2A and AFF1 ChIP-seq signal in both cell lines was enriched at cell-specific active enhancers and depleted at inactive enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). This is also consistent with our observation of KMT2A binding at patient-specific enhancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A-F</xref>)</p><p id="P32">Finally, to establish a causative role for KMT2A::AFF1 at these differential enhancers, we next examined the effect of siRNA mediated knockdown of KMT2A::AFF1 in SEM cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> on the level of H3K27ac at these elements, as a proxy for enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). We observed a substantial reduction in the level of H3K27ac at all enhancer subtypes (common, SEM-specific and RS4;11-specific) upon KMT2A::AFF1 knockdown. This reduction was matched by a decrease in enhancer-promoter interaction frequency by Capture-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6D</xref>), with 75.23% of enhancers within 500 kb of the 35 promoters analysed exhibiting a significantly reduced interaction frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). Furthermore, returning to our primary sample specific enhancers, we observed a positive correlation between H3K27ac signal intensity and KMT2A binding at the unique enhancers in each patient (R=0.33-0.75; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I</xref>) in further support of our model predictions. Taken together, these data implicate the binding of KMT2A::AFF1 in the activity of these cell line- and patient-specific enhancers, suggesting that differential binding of the KMT2A::AFF1 complex is a key driver of transcriptional heterogeneity due to the regulation of differential enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6J</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P33">Much work has gone into developing targeted therapies that are effective but relatively non-toxic. Unfortunately, many patients still either fail to respond or relapse for reasons that are not always clear. Cancers with the same driver mutations show varied responses to therapy, along with significant transcriptional heterogeneity. Here, we have shown that even a relatively mutationally silent cancer subtype such as <italic>KMT2A::AFF1</italic> can display extensive transcriptional heterogeneity, driven in part by the usage of patient-specific leukemia enhancers. When important oncogenes such as <italic>MEIS1</italic> and <italic>RUNX2</italic> are overexpressed due to novel enhancer usage, this may have implications for therapeutic response and patient outcomes in leukemia. Variability in enhancer activity has been observed across various cancers, including gastric adenocarcinoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, prostate tumours <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, and luminal breast cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, suggesting that this may represent a broader mechanism contributing to heterogeneity across cancer types.</p><p id="P34">A key question arising from our findings is the origin of these novel enhancers. One hypothesis is that patient-specific SNPs may drive differential enhancer activity by altering transcription factor binding sites, a mechanism proposed for donor-derived lymphoblastoid lines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. However, our analysis of sequencing data from the SEM and RS4;11 cell lines revealed only a small number of SNPs associated with novel enhancers, despite the extensive epigenetic differences observed. This suggests that genetic variation alone is unlikely to fully account for the emergence of patient-specific enhancers in this context.</p><p id="P35">Another possibility is that the target cell in which the leukemia originates may provide unique and distinct epigenetic landscapes for KMT2A::AFF1 binding, and thus create the possibility of differential enhancer usage. Since each <italic>KMT2A::AFF1</italic> ALL patient displayed a distinct pattern of enhancer usage, cell type is unlikely to fully explain the effects observed, unless there are multiple possible cell types of origin, one for each patient. Instead, it is likely that a stochastic element contributes to initial enhancer activation, and is subsequently reinforced by stabilization of KMT2A::AFF1 binding. For example, KMT2A::AFF1 binding has been shown to be altered by DNA methylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, so stochastic and developmental stage-specific differences in DNA methylation patterns in progenitor cells could be a driver of differential binding and enhancer usage.</p><p id="P36">A deeper exploration of the source of these unique enhancers will require more extensive investigation, but this work establishes variable enhancer usage as a common driver of transcriptional heterogeneity in multiple leukemias, suggesting this could be one common mechanism underpinning aspects of patient heterogeneity across different cancer subtypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Tables 1-5</label><media xlink:href="EMS202010-supplement-Supplemental_Tables_1_5.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d89aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS202010-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d89aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S16"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>T.A.M. and A.L.S, were funded by Medical Research Council (MRC, UK) Molecular Haematology Unit grant MC_UU_00016/6 and MC_UU_00029/6.
