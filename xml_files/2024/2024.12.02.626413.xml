It is commonly assumed that cells respond to these gradients by migrating directionally towards the regions of highest ligand density. In contrast with this view, here we show that cells exposed to micropatterned fibronectin gradients exhibit a complex repertoire of trajectories, including directed haptotactic migration up the gradient but also linear oscillations and circles with extended periods of migration down the gradient. To explain this behavior, we developed a biophysical model of haptotactic cell migration based on a coarse-grained molecular clutch model coupled to persistent stochastic polarity dynamics. While initial haptotactic migration is explained by the differential friction at the front and back of the cell, the observed complex trajectories over longer time scales arise from the interplay between differential friction, persistence, and physical confinement. Overall, our study reveals that confinement and persistence modulate the ability of cells to sense and respond to haptotactic cues and provides a framework to understand how cells navigate complex environments.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The ability of single cells to follow gradients in protein concentration has been implicated in a broad range of processes in health and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This type of directed cell migration is typically attributed to chemotaxis, where cells follow gradients in the concentration of soluble factors dissolved into their surrounding fluid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. However, cells can also follow gradients in the density of immobilized proteins, such as those comprising the extracellular matrix (ECM), in a process called haptotaxis. Haptotaxis was first reported by S.B. Carter in 1965, who found that fibroblasts migrate towards regions of higher substrate adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Since then, haptotaxis has been reproduced <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and observed <italic>in vivo</italic> during the immune response and cancer invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">For a single cell to undergo directed migration in response to an ECM gradient, it must first detect differences in ECM density across its body, then polarize in the direction of the gradient, and finally migrate along that direction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Upon contacting the ECM, integrins bind to the actin cytoskeleton through adaptor proteins such as talin, forming dynamic structures known as molecular clutches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Actin is pulled retrogradely towards the cell center by myosin motors, exerting a centripetal force on the clutches while simultaneously polymerizing against the cell membrane to drive protrusion at the leading edge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The dynamics of molecular clutches have been extensively studied in contexts such as cell migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, and mechanotransduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. However, their role in sensing ECM density gradients and driving haptotactic migration remains largely unexplored.</p><p id="P4">Besides gradient sensing, haptotactic migration is determined by the persistence of cell polarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. If polarity is short-lived, cells are expected to respond quickly to spatial variations in the ECM density and adapt their trajectories accordingly. Conversely, if polarity is persistent, cells should sustain directed trajectories regardless of the local ECM cue, displaying an effective memory of previous polarization events. How the combination of ECM gradient sensing and polarity persistence defines cell migration trajectories is not understood. This limitation arises, in part, from the technical difficulties of generating robust ECM gradients while simultaneously measuring the key mechanical variables that govern cell migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. In addition, despite previous theoretical approaches to ECM gradient sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, we lack a theoretical model that integrates such sensing with the stochastic dynamics of cell polarity.</p><p id="P5">Here we combine experimental and theoretical approaches to study the mechanics of single cells in ECM density gradients. We fabricated patterns of increasing and decreasing fibronectin density with different levels of lateral confinement. Upon adhering to the substrates, cells moved towards the regions of highest fibronectin density, demonstrating robust haptotaxis. However, after reaching the peak of fibronectin density, cells displayed a repertoire of complex trajectories depending on the level of confinement. By developing a coarse-grained clutch model, we show that this behavior can be understood in terms of the integration of cell adhesion and persistent stochastic polarity dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P6">We developed a minimal haptotactic migration assay using soft PDMS substrates with a Young's modulus of 12.6 kPa photopatterned with fibronectin lanes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). In a first set of experiments, the lanes were 500 μm in length and 20 μm in width, constraining the cells to migrate in 1D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The fibronectin density varied along the lane, reaching a maximum at the center, and decreasing symmetrically with an approximately exponential profile towards both ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). We seeded single human breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) and tracked their movement for 12-20 hours immediately after seeding. We used H2B-GFP to label and track the nuclei and segmented the phase contrast image to determine the position of the leading and trailing edges. To quantify the density of each pattern, we fluorescently labeled fibronectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4">methods</xref>). This approach allowed us to correlate the fibronectin density experienced by each cell at different time points with its velocity, length, actin dynamics and traction force.</p><p id="P7">Upon adhering to the substrate, cells began to migrate directionally. Surprisingly, rather than simply migrating towards the region of maximum fibronectin density, they displayed oscillatory trajectories, crossing over the fibronectin peak and turning only after hours of migration down the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). To analyze this complex behavior, we initially focused on the first cell run, defined as the trajectory from the moment of adhesion to the first time point when cells stopped or turned. This allowed us to study the response to the gradient without the confounding contribution of the additional ECM deposited by the cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. To represent cell trajectories, we took advantage of the pattern symmetry and mirrored the cellular tracks that started at <italic>x</italic> &gt; 0 so that all trajectories originated from the left half of the pattern (<italic>x</italic> &lt; 0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Shortly after adhering to the patterns, more than 80% of the cells polarized and migrated towards the direction of the highest protein density, indicating a robust haptotactic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-d</xref>, blue color; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). Only a minority of the cells, less than 20%, polarized against the gradient and migrated anti-haptotactically towards the region of less protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c-d</xref>, yellow color). As a control, we confirmed that ∼50% of cells migrating on lanes with uniform fibronectin levels moved towards the center of the patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Video 2</xref>). During this initial run, cells displayed greater elongation near the fibronectin peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Cell velocity was highest when cells migrated up the gradient and decreased progressively down the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). These findings show that cells exhibit a robust initial haptotaxis, but that they can also migrate long distances against the gradient once polarized.</p><p id="P8">We next asked whether haptotaxis depends on cell contractility, similar to other modes of directed migration such as durotaxis. Previous studies have reported contrasting results. Some have suggested that haptotaxis requires the actomyosin machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> while others provided evidence that haptotaxis is independent of myosin and depends on lamellipodia dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. We treated cells with blebbistatin to inhibit myosin II and with Y-27632 to inhibit Rho-Kinase. Both on lanes with homogeneous fibronectin density and on fibronectin gradients, blebbistatin and Y-27632 treatments resulted in longer and slower cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g-h</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). However, none of these treatments diminished the initial haptotaxis response and, in the case of blebbistatin, cells tended to be more haptotactic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i-k</xref>). Taken together, these results show that contractility is not required for efficient haptotaxis.</p><p id="P9">We next analyzed whether the observed systematic changes in cell velocity were due to changes in the velocity of the leading edge, the trailing edge, or both. For this purpose, we examined the velocity of the leading and trailing edges of each cell and compared their values when migrating up and down the fibronectin gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We found that the difference in velocity at the trailing edge was non-significant, indicating that the trailing edge, on average, maintained a constant velocity regardless of the gradient sign. In contrast, the leading edge was significantly slower when migrating down the gradient. This explains the overall reduction in cell velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>) – as well as in cell elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>) – when cells migrate down the gradient.</p><p id="P10">To investigate the actin dynamics underlying the differences in the leading edge velocities, we generated MCF10A cells expressing LifeAct-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Video 3</xref>). The leading edge displayed characteristic lamellipodial dynamics, with a clear retrograde flow and frequent protrusion and retraction events. We quantified these dynamics by measuring actin retrograde flow (<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>), edge extension velocity (<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>), and the number of lamellipodial collapse events per unit time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). We then compared these variables for cells migrating up and down the gradient. Since actin dynamics can depend both on the local fibronectin density and its gradient, we focused on two populations that experience the same fibronectin density at the leading edge, so that the only varying parameter was the sign of the gradient. We found that the actin retrograde flow at the leading edge was significantly faster in cells migrating down the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Actin polymerization velocity (<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>), which we obtained by subtracting the actin retrograde flow from the leading edge velocity, was also increased in cells migrating down the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). In addition, these cells displayed faster leading edge dynamics characterized by more frequent lamellipodial collapse events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Together, these data reveal that cells migrate down the gradient using an increased polymerization velocity that partially compensates the increase in retrograde flow and the more frequent lamellipodial collapses.</p><p id="P11">To further characterize the mechanics of cell migration in our system, we measured traction forces exerted by the cells on both homogeneous and gradient substrates. From the onset of migration, tractions were distributed mainly at the leading and trailing edges, forming contractile force dipoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5a-b</xref>). Tractions increased in magnitude during the first 8 hours of cell migration, both in uniform and gradient substrates, indicating a transient adaptation to the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). To normalize out this transient adaptation and isolate the contribution of the ECM gradient to the traction force, we divided the time evolution of the tractions exerted by each cell on gradient substrates by the average time evolution of tractions exerted by cells on uniform substrates (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S4">methods</xref>). The resulting normalized tractions (<italic>T<sup>norm</sup></italic>) increased with the ECM density, peaked at the center of the patterns, and decreased down the gradient, approximately following the ECM density profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We then examined the spatial profile of traction forces along the front-rear axis. Both for cells migrating up and down the gradient, these traction profiles were asymmetric with respect to the cell center. Specifically, the width and position of the traction peaks differed between the two halves of the cell, and the change in traction sign was shifted towards the cell's leading edge. This asymmetry, which can be understood as a traction polarity, was more pronounced in cells migrating up the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>). To quantify traction polarity, we computed the normalized traction quadrupole <italic>Q</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. For symmetric (i.e. unpolarized) traction profiles the quadrupole vanishes, <italic>Q</italic> = 0, whereas for asymmetric profiles polarized towards the direction of growing <italic>x</italic>, the quadrupole is negative, <italic>Q</italic> &lt; 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref>). Conversely, if the traction field is polarized towards decreasing <italic>x</italic>, then <italic>Q</italic> &gt; 0. Cells migrating up the gradient showed a negative quadrupole that decreased progressively as they approached the maximum of fibronectin density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2k</xref>). When cells started to migrate down the gradient, the quadrupole remained negative but decreased in magnitude, becoming nearly negligible close to the edge of the patterns. We studied how the traction quadrupole is quantitatively related to cell velocity by binning all cells in three groups: cells migrating up the gradient, cells migrating down the gradient (after migrating up the gradient), and anti-haptotactic cells (i.e. migrating down the gradient from the start of the experiment, labeled yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Nearly all cells migrating up the gradient and down the gradient displayed a positive velocity and a negative quadrupole. Hence, when plotted on a <italic>Q</italic> − <italic>v</italic> diagram, they occupied the top-left quadrant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2l</xref>). Conversely, anti-haptotactic cells showed negative velocity and positive quadrupole, thus populating the opposite quadrant of the <italic>Q</italic> − <italic>v</italic> diagram. Overall, cells moving up the gradient tended to display faster velocity and a lower quadrupole than those migrating down the gradient. These data show that cells remain mechanically polarized as they move up and down the gradient and that their velocity is proportional to their mechanical polarity.</p><p id="P13">To explore the biophysical basis of these migratory behaviors, we developed a minimal model that integrates ECM gradient sensing with persistent cellular dynamics driven by active protrusions. Focusing on the early migration dynamics of cells that are initially unpolarized, we considered a generalization of the one-dimensional molecular clutch model with protrusion growth at both the front and back of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, SI Text)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. In this model, adhesive interactions with the fibronectin coating of the substrate give rise to an effective friction coupling the actin flow to the substrate. For systems with homogeneous fibronectin density, our model predicts that, at fixed actin polymerization velocity <italic>v</italic><sub>p</sub>, the actin retrograde flow <italic>v</italic><sub>r</sub> decreases with increasing fibronectin density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>; SI text). To test this, we measured actin flows on homogeneous patterns with varying fibronectin density, and indeed found a decrease of the retrograde flow velocity with fibronectin density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Assuming that the actin polymerization has a persistence of timescale τ, our model recovers the persistent migration dynamics on homogeneous patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Next, we explored the consequences of differences in the concentration of fibronectin <italic>ρ</italic> between the front and back of the cell, i.e. the position-dependent gradient ∇<italic>ρ</italic>(<italic>x</italic>). Based on our model, this gradient gives rise to different friction between the front and back, without the need to assume any additional mechanisms, such as mechano-sensitive couplings between stress and polymerization dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. This friction difference leads to higher productive forces in the protrusion further up the gradient, resulting in faster protrusion growth and net motion up the gradient. Consistent with the experiments, this friction-based mechanism does not rely on the contractility of the cell but is a purely passive mechanism.

We find that for sufficiently large <italic>χ</italic>, the model indeed predicts trajectories strongly biased to move up the gradient and match the percentage of initially haptotactic cells to that measured in the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d-e</xref>). Having fitted this parameter, our model makes a number of additional predictions. Firstly, once cells reach the center of the lane, due to their persistent polarity dynamics, they continue to migrate down the gradient. Quantitatively, our model then predicts that cells cumulatively migrate almost as long a distance down the gradient as up the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>), in agreement with the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Secondly, our model predicts the observed decrease in cell velocity when cells migrate down the gradient compared to their migration up the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>), caused by the stronger frictional interaction at the trailing edge when moving down the gradient. Thirdly, our model predicts maximal traction forces and maximal cell length at the location of highest fibronectin concentration, where productive protrusion forces are the highest (SI text), consistent with the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that a passive friction-based mechanism is sufficient to quantitatively capture the observed cellular responses to fibronectin gradients.</p><p id="P17">To further understand the mechanisms of cell migration down the gradient, we hypothesized that this behavior was related to the spatial cell confinement. Indeed, once cells become highly polarized, a 1D pattern requires a 180° flip in front-rear polarity for a cell to change its direction of migration. In contrast, a gradient in 2D could potentially allow cells to reorient their polarity more effectively through more gradual shifts in orientation. To test this idea, we progressively released the confinement by studying lanes with increasing width in the <italic>y</italic>-direction, orthogonal to the gradient in the <italic>x</italic>-direction, which remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Video 4</xref>). We found that the initial probability of a cell to move up the gradient is independent of the lane width, consistent with the model prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). Interestingly, however, we experimentally observed that the long-term migration dynamics were strongly affected by the release of confinement. On 40 μm wide patterns, we observed oscillatory trajectories involving migration up and down the gradient just as in the narrowest lanes of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a-c</xref> (corresponding to a width of 20 μm). In contrast, in quasi-2D lanes (250 μm in width), cells did not migrate down the gradient but rather made a 90° turn, migrating along the ridge defined by the maximal fibronectin density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). For intermediate lane widths of 60 μm and 80 μm, cells exhibited complex patterns, including circular rotations around the midline, where fibronectin concentration is maximal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To test whether our model of passive friction-based haptotaxis (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Eq. 1</xref>) could capture these complex migration patterns, we generalized it to 2D, adapting the equation for polarity dynamics to a situation where, after initial haptotactic exploration with bi-directional protrusions, cells are polarized (with rotational diffusion, SI text). To take into account spatial 2D confinement, we consider that polarity changes are more difficult on thin lanes due to steric interactions when the width is comparable to cell size. Simulations of our model indeed capture the observed migratory patterns at the trajectory-level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) and recapitulate the distributions of cellular positions in <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d-e</xref>). To further compare data and model, we examined the velocity auto-correlation functions in <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f-g</xref>). The model predicts that, with increasing width, correlations will transition from oscillatory (negative overshoot) to relaxational (decay to zero) in the <italic>x</italic>-direction, while the opposite trend is predicted for the <italic>y</italic>-direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f-g</xref>). This predicted transition from oscillating in <italic>x</italic> to oscillating in <italic>y</italic> was found experimentally as shown by the auto-correlation functions computed from the experimental trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f-g</xref>). Taken together, these results explain how the interplay of gradient sensing, polarity persistence, and physical confinement determine complex migration trajectories.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">The study of cell migration in haptotactic gradients has traditionally emphasized that cells migrate towards the regions of highest ligand density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Our study challenges this notion by demonstrating that cells can migrate long distances down haptotactic gradients and that the resulting trajectories depend on cell confinement and persistence. After adhering to narrow lanes of increasing and decreasing density, most cells polarized and migrated toward the highest protein density, demonstrating haptotaxis. This response was robust and independent of cell contractility. Intriguingly, after reaching the region of highest fibronectin density, most cells continued to migrate down the gradient. We captured the main features of this behavior with a coarse-grained molecular clutch model, which shows that both initial and long-term haptotactic dynamics can be explained by the interplay between friction differences at cell edges and cell persistence. Furthermore, the model predicts that cell responses to ECM gradients depend on cell confinement, which we tested by increasing the gradient width. As predicted, we found that for intermediate widths, complex trajectories such as circles emerged, while for larger widths, cells lost the ability to migrate down the gradient due to smoother polarity re-orientation compared to the effective 1D dynamics observed at narrower widths.</p><p id="P20">Cell migration down a gradient has been previously observed in chemotaxis and durotaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. After an initial phase of chemotactic migration along a gradient of cAMP, single Dictyostelium cells continue to migrate in the same direction when the gradient is removed or weakly inverted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. This effective chemotactic memory has been interpreted in terms of adaptive gradient sensing and bistability of the downstream signaling circuitry. In durotaxis, single glioma cells have also been observed to migrate against a stiffness gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. In this case, negative durotaxis is explained by a biphasic relationship between traction force and substrate stiffness and does not imply an effective memory. The mechanisms underlying migration against haptotactic gradients identified here have a different origin. We show that differences in friction between the leading and trailing edges combined with stochastic polarity persistence suffice to explain an effective memory in ECM gradients. Gradients in friction were recently proposed to drive directed cell migration in a phenomenon called frictiotaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. This type of migration differs from our observations and model in that it relies on unspecific friction rather than specific cell adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">While both haptotaxis and durotaxis can be explained with molecular clutch models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, mechanisms for gradient sensing are distinct. In order to sense a gradient in stiffness, cells must be able to deform the substrate, requiring the generation of a contractile force. Unlike durotaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, haptotaxis is not impaired by disrupting contractility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref>). This is because haptotactic migration is driven by differences in frictional interactions between actin flows and substrate, rather than by substrate deformation. Based on our coarse-grained molecular clutch model, we found that this passive physical effect was sufficient to explain the key features of our data. In future work, our model could be extended to include active gradient sensing by coupling the cell polarity equation to local gradients as in previous work on chemotaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Such an extended approach could help capture additional effects of our experiments such as the differences in actin flow dynamics and traction polarity for cells moving up and down the gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). However, our finding that the friction-based model already captured the initial and long-term migration on 1D lanes, as well as the complex patterns emerging when confinement is relaxed, suggests that these additional mechanisms are not dominant in our system.</p><p id="P22">Gradients in ECM density are common both in physiological and pathological conditions. Spatial variations in fibronectin density have been reported during different processes in development, such as gastrulation or limb formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. In cancer, the aberrant accumulation of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment results in the secretion of large amounts of fibronectin and collagen, which vary within the tumor and decay away from it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. An accumulation of ECM is also the defining feature of fibrotic diseases and a signature of scar tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Understanding how cells interpret these ECM gradients <italic>in vivo</italic> poses substantial challenges. One of such challenges is that an ECM accumulation not only represents a haptotactic cue but also a durotactic one. Our experimental approach allowed us to generate ECM density gradients in the absence of stiffness gradients. Using this approach, we found that haptotaxis of single MCF10a cells is far more efficient than durotaxis reported previously in the same cell type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. A second challenge to interpret directed cell migration in ECM gradients arises from the fact that cells <italic>in vivo</italic> are often confined by their 3D microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. This is well established for cancer cells during invasion or immune cells during infiltration, where migration occurs within narrow channels generated by the porous ECM, dense cellular packings, and tissue interfaces. Our technique enabled the systematic study of how confinement affects haptotactic migration. We established that confinement plays a central role in determining complex cell trajectories, including directed migration down the gradient when confinement is strong or persistent circles when it is mildly relaxed. These new results can contribute to explain the paradoxical behavior of invading cancer cells, which escape the tumor against an ECM gradient, as well as the impaired infiltration of immune cells in immuno-cold tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>.

Kymographs were generated in 4 regions of the leading edge. In each region, actin retrograde flow (actin movement from the edges toward the cell center) and edge velocities were manually measured. The velocity of actin polymerization (<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>) was calculated using the following equation: <disp-formula id="FD2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P46">where <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> is the velocity of the cell’s edge and <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> the actin retrograde flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). To measure cell velocity, length, and fibronectin fluorescence, cell masks were created using the LifeAct-GFP signal as a reference, applying the Otsu threshold in Fiji. The masks and pattern images were oriented with the leading edge on the right side of the images and the trailing edge on the left. These masks were then used to select cells migrating faster than 0.1 μm/min and to calculate the fluorescence slope across the cell. The fluorescence slope was used to classify cells as migrating up the gradient, down the gradient or on homogeneous patterns. The lamellipodial collapse rate was manually measured by quantifying the number of actin peaks in the kymographs of the leading edge and dividing it by the total imaging time (3 minutes). The cell's leading edge was defined as the right edge of the mask, extending 4 μm in length. Fibronectin fluorescence in the leading edge was defined by the mean fluorescence in the first 4 μm of the edge.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Traction force data and asymmetry analysis</title><p id="P47">All traction computations and the following analyses of traction forces were carried out with custom-written MATLAB scripts. Fourier transform traction microscopy was used to measure traction forces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. The displacement fields of the fluorescence microspheres were obtained using a self-written particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) algorithm using square interrogation windows of side length 24 pixels (corresponding to about 7.8 μm) with a relative overlap of 0.75 window length. Segmented binary masks of the phase contrast images were used to extract the tractions under each cell at each time point, after dilation of the segmentation by 15 μm in all directions to include the traction profiles as complete as possible.</p><p id="P48">Traction magnitudes are the absolute values of <italic>x</italic>-traction, averaged over the area of a cell. Traction profiles were calculated by averaging the <italic>x</italic>-component of the tractions within the segmented area across the <italic>y</italic>-axis at every time point. The axial lengths of these profiles were normalized to unit length for each time point, and these length-normalized tractions were averaged together in groups according to the cell trajectory (haptotactic, anti-haptotactic, or homogeneous fibronectin migration) to form the averaged profiles. To remove the trend of increasing traction values with time, the traction magnitudes and profiles are further normalized. For this, the temporal traction development of cells on lanes with homogeneous fibronectin are used as reference. The magnitudes are divided by the average magnitude of the reference cells, depending on time. The profiles are divided by the maximum of the profile of the reference cells, depending on time. This creates unitless traction magnitudes and profiles which typically reach values of about 1 for the reference condition.</p><p id="P49">The normalized second moment <italic>Q</italic> of the 1D-traction profiles was calculated as <inline-formula><mml:math id="M3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∫</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∫</mml:mo><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> analogously to Rossetti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, where <italic>x</italic> is the spatial coordinate relative to the center of mass of the traction segmentation.
