Yet it is unknown whether humans acquired multiple separate internal models, each evolved for a specific domain, or maintain a globally unified representation. Using fMRI, we show that during naturalistic experiences (during movie watching or narrative listening), adult participants selectively engage three topographically distinct midline prefrontal cortical regions, for different forms of predictions. Regions responded selectively to abstract spatial, referential (social), and temporal domains during model updates implying separate representations for each. Prediction-error-driven neural transitions in these regions, indicative of model updates, preceded subjective belief changes in a domain-specific manner. We find these parallel top-down predictions are unified and selectively integrated with sensory streams in the Precuneus, shaping participants’ ongoing experience. Results generalized across sensory modalities and content, suggesting humans recruit abstract, modular predictive models for both vision and language. Our results highlight a key feature of human world modeling: fragmenting information into abstract domains before global integration.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In our lives, we encounter a wide range of situations with complex and ever-changing properties − spatial, temporal and social. To understand and predict future events, we form internal models of our experiences. A well-tuned internal model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> allows us to interact with the world optimally by generating future predictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Understanding how these models are structured and represented are central questions in cognitive neuroscience. A hallmark of cortical computation is the prevalence of functionally specialized modules geared towards processing specific kinds of information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. This may be because different types of environmental variables require different kinds of inductive biases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> for efficient computation. For example, relational properties like reference frames are better captured by graph structures whereas, temporal characteristics of action sequences might require a more sequential structure. Different domains thus may necessitate different prior constraints, and successful generalization requires getting these constraints right<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Organizing world knowledge efficiently11–13(e.g. cognitive map) might therefore require a modular approach to internal model construction, leveraging domain-appropriate inductive biases. Introducing such modular principles has also been shown to enhance artificial learning systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Yet it is unknown whether humans acquired an assembly of many separable and highly specialized models, each representing a world domain, or a more unified global representation. Modular representation of internal models through parallelization of domains would, however, create a coordination problem: how are the contents of these distinct models unified to provide coherent behavior, let alone our integrated experience of the current properties of the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>?</p><p id="P3">There are strong computational reasons to assume that humans possess multiple distinct cognitive maps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> or model spaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, specialized for particular domains of the world. In this study, we introduce three such models, tuned to different domains of the world: states, agents and actions (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). First, navigating a complex world requires an accurate representation of one’s current environment. However, it may not be possible to obtain (or observe) all the variables required for this, requiring strong background information (e.g., memory). A mapping between prior knowledge and observed sensory information underlies the inference of the environmental state. These states provide abstract contexts to situate events and are crucial for accurate future state predictions and learning; their absence can bias inference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Representing these abstract Spatial or State models, is necessary but insufficient for a full world model. This is because states are populated by other people (or generally agents) who each adopt a different reference frame, and thus form distinct goals and perspectives. Modelling these reference frames are crucial to represent the mental states, beliefs and intentions of other agents, ourselves and any interactions. These Agent models, may then be represented quite separately to state representations. This facilitates perspective taking and simplifies joint inference across various combinations of states and agents. In group settings, that form a large portion of human life, accurate representation of relational properties of each agent to oneself and others are key.</p><p id="P5">Third, for a given State and Agent-reference frame, the space of (abstract) transitions or paths one might take through them are vast. Thus, separable representation of temporally abstract actions, or Action models allows the mapping of previously learned action path onto newly learned states or agents. In sum, we suggest three core abstract domains of cognitive representation are needed − States, Agents, and Actions. Each operates on different sources of information about the world. They depend on one another, but generate distinct predictions about the unfolding environment. The errors in each domain demand a fundamentally different kind of update, requiring a modular architecture. Thus, a neural specialization for these domains allows fast and flexible inference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> to the near-infinite permutations of contexts, people and plans that we encounter in our lives.</p><p id="P6">Different sectors of midline prefrontal cortex are sensitive to such properties of world, making this cortical territory a likely site for specialized world models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). State model estimation have been extensively shown to be centered around the ventromedial prefrontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, which encodes them as cognitive maps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> or low-dimensional schemas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This region is also heavily associated with reward processing, however newer perspectives suggest these effects stem from a more general function of state estimation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Sitting dorsal and anterior to vmPFC, the anteromedial prefrontal cortex is heavily involved in social cognition, theory of mind<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, social hierarchy learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and goal processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. All of these activities require referential modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and computing goals (self/others). Further dorsal and posterior, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex is critical for (high-level) action planning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, strategic decisions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, and formulating hierarchical plans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, all of which fall under the notion of modeling temporal properties over longer time-scales. Taken together, it is appealing to position this triumvirate of regions as the core model space within the midline prefrontal cortex. These also form the anterior nodes of the Default-Mode Network (DMN), which is thought to process internal models of experience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">As mentioned above, a modular architecture creates the challenge of integrating different predictions together into a unified format and merging top-down priors with sensory data. Precuneus, the core node of DMN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> is in a strategic position to meet this demand due to its hypothesized role in global integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, interfacing with other cortical networks and being a sensory hub<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Lesions to this region often leads to integratory deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. We propose the Precuneus is where distinct prefrontal predictions relating to states, agents and actions are combined. Integrating these with sensory data allows the brain to maintain a coherent, unified, and up-to-date model of its physical and social environment.</p><p id="P8">In this study, we test this proposal: that the midline PFC regions operate as a partitioned domain-specialized, tripartite model space. This system generates top-down predictions from each model in a parallel, independent manner. We focus on prediction errors; moments when an aspect of one’s current world model is inaccurate and thus updated. One would expect brain regions supporting a particular domain to show increased activity during such updates. Folding this notion onto three distinct models means different kinds of errors trigger updates to unique parts of the world model. We hypothesize that these predictions are then integrated in the Precuneus, thus outfitting the DMN with a modularization within its prefrontal sectors, allowing for hierarchical computation within the network.</p><p id="P9">We explore three fundamental questions about internal model representation using fMRI data collected while participants watched a short movie, where all three domains are intermingled. We collected behavioral data from a different sample of participants watching the movie to determine when people generally updated their beliefs about states (movie situations), agents (movie characters) and actions (what transpired). Using these updates as predictors of neural activity, we investigated whether humans possess a single global representation of the world model or a modular, domain-specific organization. Next, through hidden Markov modeling, we explored whether region-specific neural transitions coincided with subjective belief changes. Third, we tested whether these domain-specific predictions are integrated within core DMN by analysing shared connectivity profiles. Finally, we replicated our key findings in a second dataset that involved a different sensory modality (a spoken story) and level of emotional content. Our results specifically outline how the human prefrontal cortex performs domain-specific world modeling and, more generally, how the DMN integrates these to shape our subjective experience.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P10">Our approach was to use fMRI data from young participants (n=111) passively watching a short movie “Bang you’re dead”, taken from the Cam-CAN project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. We obtained continuous belief-update (prediction updates) time-courses for this movie from separate groups watching online and use this for our analysis of the neuroimaging participants’ BOLD data. Later, we generalize the main results to a separate cohort listening to a story<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> (n=52) while undergoing scanning, using the same methods.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Measuring Belief Updates in State, Agent and Action models</title><p id="P11">Our analysis approach is to identify changes in neural activity, patterns and connectivity and, assess whether these coincide with subjective markers of internal model updates of movie content in each domain. We first probed when belief updates typically occurred in each domain, during the movie. Participants from three independent groups watched the movie and pressed a button whenever they felt their beliefs were updated in one of the three domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>). Briefly, these were contextual updates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (for States; n = 18), belief updates about people (for Agents; n=21) and belief change due to an action taken, that could affect the trajectory of the movie (for Actions; n=19) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 1</xref> for complete instructions). Update time-courses from individual participants were combined and smoothed to give a continuous time-course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). Higher values indicate a greater proportion of individuals watching the movie marked a belief update at that point. These time-courses indicate that the predictions (and the experience) of each domain fluctuate considerably throughout this movie. By collecting these ratings in separate groups of participants to those who provided the fMRI data, we ensured that the fMRI data reflected processing of a fully naturalistic experience, free from instructional, meta-monitoring and responding effects. Group-level ratings were only weakly correlated with one another (States vs Agents, r = 0.31, Agents vs Actions, r = 0.29, Actions vs States, r = 0.28). This indicates that models in different domains were being updated at different times during movie-watching. We also conducted a split-half correlation analysis for each rating, which indicated generally good levels of agreement between participants in the timing of updates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref>) (States r = 0.80, Agents r = 0.49, Actions r = 0.57, see<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13"> Methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Topographically distinct Internal Models in the Midline Prefrontal Cortex</title><p id="P12">Our neuroimaging analysis began by identifying activations that were parametrically modulated by each domain-specific belief update. Updates involve revision and reconfiguration of the current internal model. Thus, these are periods where we would expect heightened processing demand when regions representing domain-specific model content should show increased activity. To test this, all three smoothed update probability time-courses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>) were used to simultaneously predict neural activity. We then contrasted effects of each domain against the other two, allowing us to tease apart whether the regions were particularly involved in each type of belief update.</p><p id="P13">Whole brain maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>) revealed a topographically distinct activation profile in the midline prefrontal sector. vmPFC activity was most strongly correlated with State updates, amPFC with Agent updates and dmPFC with Action updates, in line with our hypothesized model space. A further ROI-level analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>) was conducted on the effects of each predictor (beta values) in each region, using anatomically defined ROIs derived from the Brainnetome atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This analysis showed that the BOLD response to State updates was significantly higher in vmPFC than either amPFC or dmPFC (vmPFC &gt; amPFC, t = 8.2548, p-value = 3.693e-13, d = 0.78, vmPFC&gt;dmPFC, t = 5.1039, p-value = 1.404e-06, d = 0.48), while effects of Agent updates was highest in amPFC (amPFC &gt; vmPFC, t = 4.0458, p-value = 9.718e-05, d =0.38, amPFC &gt; dmPFC, t = 4.9594, p-value = 2.591e-06, d = 0.47) and Action updates highest in dmPFC (dmPFC &gt; vmPFC, t = 5.0828, p-value = 1.536e-06, d =0.48, dmPFC &gt; amPFC, t =3.5133, p-value =0.0006434, d = 0.33). These results suggest a topographically distinct pattern of effects within the PFC for different kinds of model updates. That is, different PFC regions responded to different types of prediction updates during naturalistic experience. The scanning cohort had no instructions to watch the movie in any special way. Yet they showed our predicted separation in the PFC when revisions of beliefs occurred (as indicated in the ratings of independent groups of participants).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Domain-specific increase in Prefrontal Shared Activity during prediction updates</title><p id="P14">The activation effects suggest that specific PFC regions show heightened processing in response to domain-specific belief updates. But this does not confirm that these effects are truly driven by the movie stimulus alone (rather than stimulus-unrelated internally driven thoughts). In naturalistic neuroimaging paradigms, synchronization in the temporal profile of activity across participants is often used as evidence that a region is engaging in stimulus-driven processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. If these regions are indeed generating top-down predictions then periods of belief update should also have particularly high levels of synchronization, i.e., increased shared response across participants. This is because all participants should update or calibrate their predictions in response to events in the movie in similar ways.</p><p id="P15">To tackle these arguments rigorously, we took a principled approach to the update ratings, that stayed constant in all further analyses unless specified otherwise. From the group-averaged time course, we only took the updates that crossed a specified threshold (θ), for each rating. We used θ as 2 SD here (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Method</xref> for details). The underlying logic being, since model updates are a subjective judgement, there is no consensus as to what exactly is an objective update (no matter how many raters are present). At the same time, an update that is most prevalent across raters would have the highest likelihood to be present during the experience shifts (i.e., prediction updates) of the movie-watching cohort. This ensures that ‘base rate’ of updates for each domain are respected and, only those updates that were widely shared across the cohort are analyzed.</p><p id="P16">We then calculated the intersubject correlation (ISC) values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> for these update periods, in our three PFC regions. ISC values were obtained by constructing a 7 TR (scan) window around these time points. These update segments were concatenated and ISC computed on this one long segment, for each participant.</p><p id="P17">We predicted that in each PFC region, ISC would be higher during its preferred domain’s updates relative to other domains. We used a hypothesis driven Bayesian hierarchical regression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> to test this (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We found strong evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>) for these regions being synchronized in a domain specific-manner across participants. In State updates, ISC showed strong evidence in favor of vmPFC showing higher ISC than dmPFC (vmPFC&gt;dmPFC Estimate = 0.16, 95% CI 0.11-0.21, BFfor &gt;150, P = 0.99) and amPFC (vmPFC&gt;amPFC, Estimate = 0.03, 95% CI -0.01 - 0.08, BFfor = 7.35 P = 0.88). Similarly, in Agent updates, amPFC had more ISC than vmPFC (amPFC&gt;vmPFC, Estimate = 0.03 95% CI -0.02 - 0.07, BFfor = 4.81, P = 0.83) and dmPFC (amPFC&gt;dmPFC, Estimate = 0.04, 95% CI 0 - 0.09, BFfor = 15.39, P = 0.94). Finally, in Actions updates, there was evidence for dmPFC being higher than vmPFC (dmPFC&gt;vmPFC, Estimate = 0.11, 95% CI 0.06 - 0.17, BFfor &gt;150, P = 0.99) and amPFC (dmPFC&gt;amPFC, Estimate = 0.04, 95% CI -0.01-0.09, BFfor = 12.02, P = 0.92).</p><p id="P19">These results indicate a topographically tripartite profile in midline PFC that showed domain-specific increase in activation and shared-response during moments of stimulus-driven belief updates.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Prefrontal Neural Transitions track Experienced Belief updates</title><p id="P20">The previous analyses revealed increased activity when participants updated their predictions and consequently showed an increased shared-response in the PFC. Updating one’s current internal models would involve rebuilding the model representations on the fly leading to newer interpretations and experience of the ongoing stimuli. If such a model rebuilding occurs, then each update should also be associated with sustained shifts to the prefrontal neural dynamics of the ongoing experience. The signatures of this could be extracted from the BOLD latent dynamics/transitions. To test this, we used Hidden Markov models (HMMs) to identify transitions in the neural activation states of each PFC region. We then tested how well these transitions aligned with belief updates in the domains of State, Agent and Action.</p><p id="P21">Hidden Markov models are well-suited to tackling such problems in cognitive neuroscience and has been successfully applied onto naturalistic stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. We deployed a HMM (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>) designed to be highly resistant to the timing of participant update variability. We did this by exhaustively bootstrapping and model-fitting across participants over a range of possible latent states and, selecting the most statistically efficient number of states. The final HMM, configured with this number of states, was then estimated multiple times, averaging the latent state transition time points producing a transition time-course for each ROI. We only used the most reliable and consistent update points for a rigorous comparison (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>). We aimed to identify which type of belief update most closely aligned with neural state transitions in each PFC region. To do this, we counted the belief updates occurring immediately after a neural transition, using various TR/scan window sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P22"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref> shows the proportion of belief updates that occurred immediately after neural state transitions in each PFC region, for a range of temporal window sizes. Strong domain-specificity was observed. vmPFC transitions captured State updates more than Agent or Action updates, amPFC was most attuned to Agent updates and dmPFC showed a preference for Action updates. These effects were largely consistent across the size of the temporal windows used, but tended to be statistically significant when using longer temporal windows. This suggests that the subjective experience of an update to predictions occurs sometime after the neural model is reconfigured.</p><p id="P23">These results emphasize that discrete shifts in the prefrontal neural dynamics coincided with updated model predictions, preceding the experienced belief updates. Three separate internal models in the prefrontal cortex appear to mediate these shifts in three key domains during unguided naturalistic experience.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Precuneus selectively integrates updated Prefrontal Representations</title><p id="P24">So far, we have provided evidence consistent with our hypothesis that internal world models relating to States, Agents and Actions are represented in distinct regions of PFC. How do prediction threads from these simultaneous yet spatially distinct systems get integrated and distributed globally?</p><p id="P25">There are two distinct subproblems here. First, prefrontal model contents must be unified to form a global representation of the current state of the world. This can occur within the PFC, or outside it. Second, these integrated representations must be used to constrain processing of incoming sensory information in other parts of the cortex.</p><p id="P26">Functional integration of updated predictions across domains may happen in several ways. First, a decentralized manner within the Prefrontal cortex, suggesting coordination driven by anatomical proximity. Second, centralized integration with the Hippocampus, leveraging its extensive connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Third, network integration in DMN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, with the Precuneus playing a pivotal role due to its integrative dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and network centrality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">To explore these potential integration mechanisms, we utilized intersubject-functional connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> (ISFC) analysis between domain-specific PFC regions and other ROIs during belief updates. ISFC is particularly effective in naturalistic paradigms as it removes stimulus-unrelated connectivity influences. This allowed us to measure and compare how updated prefrontal representations integrate. Using a similar approach to the earlier ISC analysis, we assessed the correlation between each PFC region and other regions during update periods for its preferred domain (e.g., during State updates for vmPFC). We correlated each PFC region with (a) Hippocampus, (b) Precuneus (PCN) and (c) other PFC regions. Employing a Bayesian hierarchical regression, we then compared posterior evidence for each integration hypothesis: within-PFC, PFC-Hippocampus and PFC-PCN.</p><p id="P28">We found evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>) for higher functional integration between PFC nodes and Precuneus than the other two forms of integration during updates. State updates showed, vmPFC having more integration with PCN than the other regions (PCN-vmPFC&gt;HPC-vmPFC Estimate =0.03 95% CI 0.01 -0.05, BFfor = 216.39, <italic>P</italic> = 0.99 &amp; PCN-vmPFC&gt;within-PFC Estimate = 0.2 95% CI 0.18 - 0.22, BFfor &gt;1000, <italic>P</italic> = 0.99). Similarly, in Agent updates, amPFC showed more evidence of integrating with PCN (PCN-amPFC&gt;HPC-amPFC Estimate = 0.06 95% CI 0.04 - 0.08, BFfor &gt;1000, <italic>P</italic> = 0.99 &amp; PCN-amPFC&gt;within-PFC Estimate = 0.16 95% CI 0.14 - 0.18, BFfor &gt;1000, <italic>P</italic> = 0.99). Finally, Action updates had dmPFC displaying more integration with PCN (PCN-dmPFC&gt;HPC-dmPFC Estimate = 0.08 95% CI 0.06 - 0.1, BFfor &gt;1000, <italic>P</italic> = 0.99 &amp; PCN-dmPFC&gt;within-PFC Estimate = 0.09 95% CI 0.07 - 0.11, BFfor &gt;1000, <italic>P</italic> = 0.99). Moreover, the model could account for a fairly large variance in the data (Bayes adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.85).</p><p id="P29">The above results suggest prefrontal representations are integrated within the Precuneus. This is not surprising given the high connectivity between these regions. However, it is still unknown how exactly this integration is carried out within the DMN. Specifically, in our design, how are these updated top-down representations unified and integrated with sensory data? The Precuneus is in a position to achieve this due to its anatomical proximity with visual cortex and functional coupling with the prefrontal sectors.</p><p id="P30">Given the parallel nature of the domains the Precuneus likely has access to all running prefrontal prediction threads. This is helpful if sensory evidence required only one domain to be updated, while (mostly) keeping the other two untouched. For instance, upon finding a restaurant closed, one might update the action strategy without changing the reference frame of wanting food. We hypothesize that integration in the Precuneus follows similar logic, prioritizing updates to representations within the relevant domain of the PFC. Since this involves accessing and switching between multiple running prediction threads, we term this Multithreaded integration. This interpretation allows us to directly test if such a form of functional integration is occurring on the neural representations during the updates.</p><p id="P31">To test this, we utilized intersubject spatial pattern correlation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> (ISPC). This measure is the spatial equivalent of the ISC measure used earlier. It indexes the degree to which the pattern of activation across the voxels in a region is similar across participants in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>). By computing ISPC in Precuneus for each TR, we can construct a time-course of shared patterns across participants. High ISPC values indicate similar shared (stimulus-driven) neural representations. During update time-points this suggests updated prediction representations in the PFC. If Precuneus performs a global integration role, then we would expect its ISPC dynamics to resemble those seen in different PFC regions in a domain-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c</xref>). Around State updates, we would expect the Precuneus ISPC timecourse to be aligned to that of vmPFC, since these regions should be engaged in processing State-related changes. For Agent updates, it should be most similar to amPFC and for Action updates, to dmPFC. Thus, we tested the correlation between two regions’ ISPC values during belief updates of each type.</p><p id="P32">To examine this, we computed ISPC timecourses for all regions and computed correlations between them for different segments of the movie. During State updates, vmPFC ISPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref> bottom) was more correlated with Precuneus ISPC than amPFC and dmPFC (p &lt; 0.001). For Agent updates, amPFC ISPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref> middle) displayed stronger correlations with Precuneus ISPC than vmPFC and dmPFC (p &lt; 0.001). Action updates elicited higher dmPFC ISPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref> top) correlations with Precuneus ISPC than vmPFC and amPFC (p &lt; 0.001).</p><p id="P33">These results indicate that the representational dynamics of precuneus resembles that of different PFC regions at different points during the movie, with the resemblance determined by which domain is currently engaged in model updating. To determine the specificity of this result, we performed similar analyses comparing PFC regions with visual cortex, Hippocampus and with other parts of the DMN: Angular Gyrus, Middle Temporal Gyrus, Retrosplenial Cortex and Posterior Cingulate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Fig 7-12</xref>). None of these regions showed the same domain-specific changes in ISPC correlations with PFC regions, suggesting that the global unification of multi-domain prefrontal predictions here is specific to Precuneus.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Precuneus integrates updated Representations with Sensory Regions</title><p id="P34">The above results suggest that Precuneus selectively unifies the updated prefrontal representations. We hypothesize that it integrates these predictions to form a unified world model. This is then used to influence and constrain processing in sensory and associative regions, also shaping the ongoing subjective experience of the movie. No other node of the DMN, nor key sensory regions, showed the same pattern of domain-selective similarity with PFC. Thus, the Precuneus appears to be in a unique position to integrate top-down predictions with the sensory stimuli processed throughout the cortex during these updates.</p><p id="P35">To test this idea, we took the time periods when updates occurred using the same approach as the preceding analysis and performed a seed-based ISFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> analysis for each domain.</p><p id="P36">Connectivity maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a</xref>) show activity in the Precuneus was correlated with sensory regions (Visual Cortex) during updates in each domain. In contrast, domain-specific Prefrontal nodes showed less connectivity with visual regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5b</xref>). Whether seeing in the Precuneus or PFC, coupling with a unique set of networks specific to a domain occurred; Hippocampal/Parahippocampal regions during States, Temporo-Parietal junction and Anterior Temporal lobe for Agents, in addition to other heteromodal and associative regions. When combined with the previous analysis, these results indicate Precuneus is highly coupled with both the prefrontal top-down predicting regions and bottom-up sensory information. This suggests a role for integrating both of these, during belief updates, shaping the ongoing subjective experience.</p><p id="P37">The results so far are broadly consistent with our conjecture. The midline PFC represents the world in a modular way, fragmented into three domains, actively generating and adapting predictions of it. These separate classes of predictions are then unified and integrated with sensory regions by the Precuneus. Such a network-level process hints to the Precuneus as a hub having access to the integrated form of prefrontal predictions. Thus, this region could potentially be an important neural correlate of unified subjective experience.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Integrated representations in the Precuneus track ongoing subjective experience</title><p id="P38">Integration of top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory information is key for a unified current model of the world. Since the Precuneus connectivity seems to suggest this integration occurs here, we predicted that this region would have a unified representation of the movie experience.</p><p id="P39">Previous studies have observed that this region had similar representations which were relatively higher than other cortical regions, during movie watching and subsequent recall, for both within and across participants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. This suggests the experiential changes due to the movie might be reflected in its neural dynamics. We used emotional Arousal ratings as our measure of overall movie experience. People experience high arousal around moments when they have high uncertainty that change their understanding of a situation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Therefore, we used levels of emotional arousal as a proxy for the degree to which participants are engaged with the unified experience of the movie.</p><p id="P40">First, we repeated our bootstrapped HMM analysis, investigating whether neural state transitions coincide with times when participants experience high Arousal. We predicted that Precuneus would show neural shifts linked with high arousal moments, while transitions in the prefrontal regions would be more specific to their respective domains (as shown previously). Other than setting the threshold θ to 1 SD for Arousal (due to no points surviving at 2 SD threshold we previously used; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>), the exact same procedure was applied here.</p><p id="P41">We observed that periods of high arousal captured a strikingly large proportion of neural state transitions in the Precuneus, more than periods of domain-specific belief updates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6a</xref>, top). This difference was significant throughout all the temporal windows used to model updates/high arousal. Crucially, none of the prefrontal regions showed transitions that coincided with Arousal in the same way. Instead, each PFC region’s transitions coincided with updates in its specific domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6a</xref>). The precuneus effect persisted when we used an alternative definition of high arousal (times where arousal was greater than mean arousal, rather than more than 1 standard deviation higher than the mean) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Fig 6</xref>).</p><p id="P42">Next, we obtained a dynamic intersubject correlation time-course<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> (sISC) for Precuneus and compared the Arousal time series to this. This analysis uses a sliding window to compute ISC at each point in time, thus providing temporal information about shared, movie-driven activity. If a region is tracking the unified experience, then it should correlate more with Arousal, compared to regions carrying only the fragmented experience. Precuneus showed more correlation with Arousal than each of the Prefrontal subregions on participant-level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6c</xref>) (PCN vs vmPFC t = 2.8342, p-value = 0.005467, d = 0.27, PCN vs amPFC t = 2.4467, p-value = 0.016, d = 0.23, PCN vs dmPFC t = 5.1409, p-value = 1.198e-06 d = 0.49). Group-level time courses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6b</xref>, top) showed strong correlations between Precuneus (r = 0.75, p = 1.62e-31) and Arousal, more than each of the prefrontal regions individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6b</xref>) suggesting its representations are unified and covaries strongly with subjective experience. (vmPFC r = 0.58, p =1.29e-16, amPFC r =0.60, p =1.12e-17, dmPFC r =0.22, p = 3.95e-03).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Similar Predictions Accompany Similar Experience</title><p id="P43">We further explored the relationship between the integration of prefrontal predictions in the Precuneus and individuals’ shared experiences of the movie. This was prompted by findings that suggest a close relationship between Precuneus ISC and experienced arousal dynamics. Specifically, we hypothesized that individuals with similar integration of prefrontal predictions in the Precuneus would share more similar experiences than those with different integration profiles. To test this, we correlated the average ISFC between the Precuneus and each PFC region during updates with whole-movie Precuneus ISC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6d</xref>), which showed a significant correlation (r = 0.54, p =1.4e-09). While various unknown factors may influence shaping experience, placing this alongside our broader results suggest that similar levels of prediction integration are associated with comparable shared experience.</p><p id="P44">The picture emerging suggests that the Precuneus unifies prefrontal predictions with bottom-up sensory data into a coherent, continuously evolving experience during unguided natural settings.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Generalization to Spoken Narratives, Input Modality and Emotional Content</title><p id="P45">Are these results limited to this movie’s content? More importantly, is this result limited to the visual modality? To test this, we replicated our two central results - modular prefrontal predictions and integration with the Precuneus - on a different cohort processing a spoken narrative. The narrative was similar in duration to the movie (8min vs 9min) but involved dramatically different content and emotional-valence (humorous c.f. the suspenseful content of the movie). Most importantly, it was presented as spoken audio. This allows us to assess generalizability of our claims across people, content, sensory modality and emotional salience (and a different pre-processing pipeline, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P46">We first tested for activity covarying with State, Agent and Action belief updates. Whole brain maps show remarkably similar prefrontal fragmentation while listening to a spoken narrative, suggesting that these prefrontal modules fragment different types of experience in a highly consistent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7a</xref>).</p><p id="P47">We then compared whether shared patterns during updates in the PFC (via ISPC time-courses) showed domain-specific alignment with the Precuneus ISPC. We found evidence of multithreaded integration in States (p = 0.01) and Agents (p = 0.001), but not in Actions (p = 0.225). This suggests integrated predictions in the core DMN are modality-agnostic and emotion-neutral i.e., abstract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7b</xref>). unlike in the movie data, here we did not find that precuneus ISPC was most correlated with dmPFC during Action updates. This could be because there were fewer characters in this story (two, one of whom narrates). This may put less demands to model potential courses of action independently of the agents making it harder to detect effects in this domain.</p><p id="P48">Overall, this replication addresses potential limitations of using a movie stimulus and provides for an independent validation of some of the main results. In doing so, this cements our claim that humans utilize a set of modular predictive models in vision and language inference during general world modelling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P49">Inductive biases offer useful and computationally advantageous prior knowledge in structuring internal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. By analyzing prediction updates across different domains during naturalistic experience, we uncovered how humans might utilize such biases to represent different internal models. We suggest that humans model the world by partitioning it into three distinct domains, within the PFC. Each model occupies a topographically distinct portion in the midline PFC. Our analyses of fMRI movie-watching data suggest that these three parallel neuronal systems adaptively guide predictions for each domain; namely, States, Agents and Actions. We found evidence that these top-down predictions are then unified in the Precuneus, the posterior hub of DMN. We propose that Precuneus continually integrates top-down predictions with bottom-up sensory information to form and update the current model of the world. These results also generalized from a movie to spoken narrative with very different content. This illustrates how the DMN contains modular representations of abstract predictive models.</p><p id="P50">Our results support our proposal that the joint world modelling process is divided into dedicated modules of States (Spatial), Agents (Referential) and Actions (Temporal) models. Domain activation profiles distinctly mapped to a ventral-dorsal gradient in the midline PFC. These roles align with insights from various lines of work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. However, to our knowledge they have not been previously integrated into a unified theoretical framework, localising them to prefrontal cortex. First, the vmPFC, traditionally associated with reward learning and decision-making, appears to play a broader role in context-based inference. In our study, the vmPFC responded to context changes within the movie. In more goal-directed situations, relevant states might relate to task instructions or the reward value of different stimuli. This supports the theory that State estimation is a core function of the vmPFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We generalize this notion into a model space of States encoded within this region. Here vmPFC not only tracks but also generates predictions about various States in the environment, updating these predictions as necessary to navigate experiences.</p><p id="P51">The amPFC plays a crucial role in various forms of complex social cognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Central to these functions is the ability to construct reference frame models of Agents, enabling generalizations to new or familiar individuals across varying contexts. As a social species, our understanding of the world would be dangerously incomplete without having robust models of the people around us. This allows us to anticipate their emotions and behaviour accurately. In the present study, amPFC activity was coupled with updates in beliefs about the characters in the movie. However, amPFC is also highly engaged in reasoning about our own (future) mental states, suggesting that agent models also guide interpretation of our own motivations and behaviours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. It’s important to reiterate, that agent and state-based predictions are often orthogonal. Individuals exhibit personality traits that are stable across various contexts, and environments possess characteristics that remain consistent regardless of the inhabitants. This orthogonality makes it computationally sensible to code State and Agent predictions separately.</p><p id="P52">Managing a vast state space requires abstracting ways of transitioning, or paths across it. This allows us to navigate through various states to achieve different goals. Modeling temporal properties that evolve over extended periods is crucial for this. The dmPFC, our Action model space, plays a critical role in strategic decision-making<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, hierarchical planning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, and compressing action sequences over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. These functions are vital for encoding and inference through abstract Action models, where specific actions trigger particular paths or sequences. These models are built and represented separately to underlying reference frames (coded by agent models) or the contexts (coded by state models) in which they occur. In our study, a change in State or an Agent’s behaviour triggers an update in the possible trajectories within the inferred story. This requires adjustments to the predicted ‘paths’ across States or future agent behaviors. The ability to generalize actions provides significant advantages in adapting to new goals and compositionally reusing model components elsewhere, a key aspect of human flexibility.</p><p id="P53">Our data make a case for top-down predictions also arising in a parallel, distributed manner akin to bottom-up sensory pathways. Taken together, our data indicate that PFC is a core region from which top-down model predictions can arise. Importantly, it also suggests that specialization across this region is a simple yet flexible adaptation used by the brain. This strategy processes the continuous and incredibly high-dimensional world by ‘carving’ it into distinct domains and separately computing predictions in each<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P54">If our world models are represented across three modular systems, then why does our subjective experience of the world not feel similarly fragmented? Our results are consistent with the idea that Precuneus unifies the prefrontal predictions, integrating them with sensory data. This is not only a core node of DMN (of which Precuneus is perhaps the central node), but structural<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and functional connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> data show that this region interfaces between sensory regions and the PFC. It also acts as a connecting hub between various cortical networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is well-placed to play such an integrative role. The shared representations in this region were selectively aligned to that of each domain-specific PFC region, during their corresponding updates. Such a form of prioritized multithreaded integration of prediction threads was observed to be unique to Precuneus, compared to a host of other regions. Studies have shown the brain could implement multithreading structurally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> and that dopamine might be functionally integrating multiple threads of reward prediction errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Maintaining complex unified representations likely requires such parallel neural architectures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> and multithreadedness can be seen as an adaptation to distributed errors. This leads to robust interareal communication, further bolstering this region’s increasing evidence in global integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P55">We also ruled out other forms of regional integration such as within-prefrontal and with Hippocampus. Consistent evidence emerged for the Precuneus, whose activity was attuned to discrete shifts and continuous cascades of the unified experience. Conversely, the PFC was only selective to domain-specific shifts of experience. We found that activation dynamics in precuneus aligned with ratings of emotional arousal, which index temporally evolving, emotion-laden engagement with stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. The usually high correlation values observed in this region across subjects in studies indicate shared representations during shared experiences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, a proxy for the stimulus-driven states of experience. Such a functional manner of integrating predictions into experience might also underpin neural correlates of consciousness.</p><p id="P56">A dominant question in consciousness research is to adjudicate between various neural theories of conscious processing. Currently, a major theoretical debate is whether it is prefrontal or posterior parietal zones that mediate access to conscious representations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Our results suggests that the answer might be a holistic gathering of both PFC and the Precuneus. Perhaps, PFC is required but ultimately generates an incomplete, coarse-grain experience while parietal integration is critical for the final view. This was in line with our results where individuals with similar prefrontal predictions integrated with the Precuneus had similar shared global experience. As a consequence, it becomes difficult to falsify competing theories that have neural implementation shared with each of these regions. Indeed, such an ambiguous conclusion was observed in a recent adversarial experiment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> which pit these two theories against each another.</p><p id="P57">Alternatively, multiple, concurrent streams of consciousness are central to some philosophical theories of consciousness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Here different neural modules can have ‘control’ at different times. Implementing any theory into neuronal machinery to be called as a neural correlate of consciousness (NCC), requires satisfying several different criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. One such criteria is the differentiation between global and local contents. Fragmented prefrontal representations and their eventual integration within the Precuneus might be seen as a way of differentiating these. Another constraint is that the NCC should be a systematically specific form of conscious processing, rather than an arbitrary or spurious neural association. In our framework, domain-specificity of these modules (e.g. conscious updates to contexts vs people) satisfies such a requirement. Predictive processing frameworks centered on different cortical networks seems to be a promising avenue to explore here. Despite domain-specificity, these regions still responded in a remarkably similar manner during updates to perceptually and emotionally different input. This suggests that these representations are separated from the concrete textures of the senses, something the DMN is in a legitimate position to fulfill.</p><p id="P58">A rich literature of cognitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> and clinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup> supports the role of DMN in higher-order human cognition. Although classically seen as task-negative, this network is implicated in a variety of cognitive activities associated with subjectivity, such as mind-wandering, creative thought, self-related processing and mental time travel. These tasks are inferential in nature and possibly involve construction of rich internal models of experience. Episodic memories of experience are thought to be compartmentalized through event segmentations, which are functionally driven by prediction errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Our data are consistent with this broad view and provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms. The discrete neural transitions observed in the midline prefrontal sectors offer novel investigative links here. One question is whether different aspects of episodic memories (people vs places) are encoded in different ways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Fragmentation of experience may be seen as a possible reason behind consequential clinical accounts like blind-sight, spatial neglect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, dissociative consciousness disorders, and in extreme cases commissurotomy-related phenomenona<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Inability to integrate these prefrontal predictions can offer a fresh perspective in examining psychiatric conditions with independent (and often rebellious) ‘conscious’ entities within.

The present study is suggestive of the dynamic processes and structural constraints by which these priors are updated as an experience unfolds.</p><p id="P59">From a methodological perspective, one strength of our study is that our neuroimaging participants were not given any specific cognitive task to perform while experiencing the story. Having them explicitly provide conscious ratings of their updates would have changed their experience, evoking metacognitive/response-related neural signatures and precluding a fully natural experience of the movie. Our design was specifically aimed to detect naturally occurring predictive changes rather than perceptual changes, viewed through the lens of an individual’s internal model. This approach minimizes instructional effects and offered a window into the nature of our internal models. Like most neuroimaging studies, most of our analysis are correlational, exploiting the model generation and updating processes that occur spontaneously during a naturalistic stimulus. In future works it will be important to exert more experimental control over the nature and timing of such processes, in order to validate our findings. That said, our replication of the main results across two settings supports the value of studying internal models using naturalistic neuroimaging, where a suite of specific analytic techniques has been established in recent years.</p><p id="P60">To summarize, we claim that humans model the world by fragmenting it into different domains first − states, agents and actions. Each of these internal models, potentially leveraging different kinds of inductive biases, are represented along a functionally distinct topography in the PFC. Predictions threads from PFC are integrated within the Precuneus, enabling the DMN to shape and transform these into a unified subjective experience. Such parallel, modular representations highlight the inevitability of distributed processing in the brain. Through the broad framework of predictive coding and ecologically rich designs we hope to have offered a novel and unificatory account of various phenomena associated with the DMN, capturing its possible role in general world modelling.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Stimuli</title><p id="P61">We examined the behavioral and neuroimaging responses of participants to two naturalistic stimuli –a movie and a spoken narrative - sourced from two different datasets.

Before the start of the experiment, participants were given instructions that included a definition of the type of beliefs they were being asked to monitor (State/Agent/Action). An example of a situation in which they would need to update those beliefs (from a scenario unrelated to the stimuli) was also included. Participants were asked to focus on the stimuli (movie/narrative) and press a key immediately when they felt their beliefs in the domain of interest had been updated. Full instructions given to the participants for all three domains can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Table 1</xref>.</p><p id="P71">For each participant, this yielded a binarized time-course indicating the points at which they signaled that they had experienced a belief update. The precise timing of updates varied between participants. Even when two participants experienced an update in response to the same event in the story, they might respond at slightly different times due to differences in their speed of responding, attentiveness and threshold for deciding an update has occurred. To accommodate this variability, we created a 5 second update window around each belief update point, generating a boxcar timeseries for each participant with a value of 1 for the temporal regions at which they experienced updates and 0 for all other times. We then averaged these time-series over participants. The group-mean time-course then represents, for each point during the movie, the likelihood that a person watching the movie would be experiencing an update. Group-averaged time-courses for each domain were then smoothed using local regression smoothing (loess in R, a non-parametric approach) with a 10% span which was kept the same for both movie and story. These smoothed ratings were downsampled to match the fMRI BOLD time-course, providing an update probability for each image acquired during movie-watching (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P72">We computed the correlation between all three update timecourses to check for any strong (r&gt;0.5) coupling between any two domains, which might render the neural analysis less feasible. Additionally, an inter-rater consistency (IRC) analysis was performed to assess the reliability of ratings. For each domain, the participant pool was randomly split into two subgroups. Each subgroup’s time-courses were smoothed, averaged and their group-mean correlated with the other subgroup’s mean. This process was repeated 100 times for each domain in both movie and narrative.</p><p id="P73">The smoothed update probability time-courses were used to predict BOLD activation in univariate analyses. Other analyses (HMM, ISC, ISFC, ISPC; see below) required discrete estimates of periods when updates occurred. To generate these, for each domain, we applied a threshold θ to the smoothed group-averaged timeseries. Time periods where update probability exceeded θ were set to 1 and rest to 0. Where a sequence of multiple TRs/scans exceeded θ, we selected the final TR/scan in the sequence to represent the update. We adopted a θ of 2 SD above the mean update probability for all movie update time-courses and θ of 1 SD above the mean value for the Arousal ratings (since no timepoints were 2 SD higher than the mean). Update timecourses for the narrative used a θ of 1 SD as there was less variation in the update timecourses for this stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Arousal Ratings</title><p id="P74">The continuous ratings of Arousal were collected as part of a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.

To account for motion artifacts, six parameters capturing translation and rotation (X-, Y-, Z-displacements, and pitch, roll, yaw) were removed from the functional data through least-squares regression. Participants exceeding a maximum framewise displacement of 1 mm or angular rotation &gt; 1.5° were excluded from subsequent analyses.

Additionally, the GLM incorporated the three group-averaged smoothed timeseries of the prediction updates as parametric modulators (mean-centered). This allowed us to assess how fluctuations in these prediction time-courses modulated brain activity throughout the movie. Six head-motion parameters defined by the realignment were added to the model as nuisance regressors.</p><p id="P80">We assessed 3 statistical contrast maps − States&gt;Agents+Actions, Agents&gt;Actions+States and Actions&gt;States+Agents with weights [1 -0.5 -0.5] for each map.

Thereafter these segments were extracted and concatenated and used to compute a leave-one-out ISC on each of the concatenated timecourses in each PFC ROI. To do this, we computed the average BOLD timecourses in each ROI and calculated the correlation of these timecourses for each participant with mean of all other participants (minus the selected participant). This method ensured any shared neural activity was a result of stimuli-driven processing than any idiosyncratic noise.

Model convergence was assessed through R-hat statistics, which were found to be ~1.00, sufficiently large estimated sample size for stable posterior estimates, and by visually inspecting the chains for convergence and large autocorrelations. Posterior predictive checks for model validation were conducted by simulating 1,000 samples from the posterior and by fitting with the empirical data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Fig 2, 3</xref>).</p><p id="P91">We were mainly interested in testing the domain-sensitiveness of each of these three ROIs for their respective domain. That is if vmPFC has higher ISC than dmPFC and amPFC during State updates, amPFC higher ISC than vmPFC and dmPFC during Agent updates and dmPFC higher ISC than vmPFC and amPFC during Action updates. For this, we computed Bayes Factors for (and against) these hypotheses and their associated posterior probabilities.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Hidden Markov Modelling</title><p id="P92">Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been extensively used to compute neural state dynamics from BOLD data, and have been particularly powerful in analysing naturalistic stimuli that involve the maintenance of temporally extended internal states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Our goal was to estimate the timing of BOLD hidden latent transitions in each region, and compare that to the belief update points, and contrast it across the neural regions and type of belief updates. We used R package depmix6 for constructing the HMMs.</p><p id="P93">We aimed to implement a group-level HMM. After extracting the ROI BOLD time series for each subject, we fit our bootstrapped HMM as follows. Although HMMs are usually fitted by specifying a number of discrete neural states and then selecting based on some penalizing information criteria, we face a problem of intersubject variability here. That is, different subjects would have variability in update timing for each domain, on each ROI. This meant that the transition points of group-level HMM should be robust to this factor. First, we determined the number of neural states present in each ROI. For each ROI, we randomly removed 10 subjects from the dataset (~10% of data) and estimated HMMs over a range of pre-specified latent states from 2 - 9 (for a total of 8 pre-specified states), from which the best-fitting number of states was adjudicated using Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). This was repeated 30 times with 10 random subjects removed in each run, for a total of 300 ‘subjects’ removed or ~thrice the full dataset (n=111). This resulted in a vector of the best fitting number of states for each HMM run (i.e. 30 such values, one for each run). We took the median as the number of states for the final analysis.</p><p id="P94">Next, using this median number of states, we fit the group-level HMM and obtained the posterior trajectories using the Viterbi algorithm. Since parameter estimation in HMMs (Expectation Maximization algorithm) is inherently stochastic (unless one seeds it), it outputs the transitions between the states with slight temporal differences. To ensure robustness against this, we ran this final HMM (using the median number of states) 10 times, and obtained an averaged transition time course, which indicates the probability of state transitions at each point in time (0-1). Higher values suggest the transition point is consistent across the 10 runs, and hence robust for this ROI. This time course was then binarized by subjecting it to a threshold of 2 standard deviation from its mean (exactly like the belief update time courses), thus identifying scans in which neural state transitions occurred. This allowed us to not incorporate the individual variability in neural transitions in a conservative and quantifiable manner, as well as accounting for the stochasticity in in transition points which is a consequence of Viterbi algorithm, (rather than just seeding it with an arbitrary seed). Thus, our bootstrapped HMM ensured 1) most reliable number of latent states are acquired, 2) with the most consistent transition times obtained for each ROI, 3) while preserving the update dynamics of each ROI individually, in the most statistically efficient manner. Across run similarity and optimal states distributions can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl Fig 4 &amp; 5</xref>.</p><p id="P95">To investigate the degree to which belief updates were coincident with neural state shifts identified by the HMM, we constructed forward windows of duration <italic>t</italic> scans beginning at each neural shift in the final HMM state transition time series. We then counted what proportion of belief updates of each type occurred within the scan windows following HMM transitions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>). We repeated this process for windows of size 0 to 8 scans to ensure that results were robust across different temporal windows.</p><p id="P96">To assess significance, we used non-parametric permutation testing. We repeated each analysis 10,000 times, each time randomly shuffling the time-series of experiential shifts (belief updates), while keeping the neural shifts constant. This yielded a distribution of results under the null hypothesis that the timing of belief updates was unrelated to neural shifts. We were then able to assess where our observed result fell within the null distribution and assign a p-value accordingly. For example, a observed result more extreme than 95% of null results would receive a p-value of 0.05.</p><p id="P97">We used this method to test the hypothesis that HMM neural transitions were more likely to coincide with updates in a region’s preferred domain than in the other two domains. The test statistic here was conditional on the criterion above (i.e., p_Rate1&gt;p_Rate2 &amp; p_Rate1&gt;p_Rate3, where Rate1 is the domain-specific Rating to each ROI while other two are the ‘nonspecific’ ratings).</p><p id="P98">The exact same approach was later deployed for the HMM involving Arousal as well, wherein the hypothesis then becomes p_Arousal &gt; p_Rate1, p_Arousal &gt; p_Rate2, p_Arousal &gt; p_Rate3 to underscore the specialization to the integrated form (i.e., Arousal) than the fragmented form.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Intersubject Functional Connectivity (ISFC) Analysis for functional integration</title><p id="P99">Intersubject functional connectivity (ISFC) is measure of the correlation of the BOLD time-series in a region in one participant to the group-averaged BOLD time-series (without this participant) to a second region.

For each participant, this was achieved by extracting the multivoxel pattern vector at each time point, and correlating that with the group-mean (sans this participant), for a given ROI. This results in a time-course for this participant which reflects the spatially correlated pattern dynamics for that region. From this, for each participant (and for each ROI) we selected three different subsets of this timeseries. In each domain, we identified update points as described earlier and constructed a 9-scan window around them (4.5-scan before and after) resulting in as many segments as there were updates. We extracted data from these segments and concatenated them to give ISPC timecourses for the periods of State, Agent and Action updates.

Predictions were tested by computing contrasts between conditions, of the same form as those used in the original whole-brain GLM. For example, for States this was achieved by comparing vmPFCStates - ((vmPFCAgents+vmPFCActions)/2) with amPFCStates - ((amPFCAgents+amPFCActions)/2) and dmPFCStates - ((dmPFCAgents+dmPFCActions)/2).

World Models.</title><p><bold>a</bold>. Any experience can be divided into models of states (abstract contexts), agents (others’ beliefs/goals), and actions (temporal paths through state space). The midline prefrontal cortex can be viewed as assembling such a model space, configuring the best model for each world abstraction. It generates top-down predictions in a tripartite organization, with domain-specific belief updates recruiting each region selectively. In this example, upon visiting a friend’s home for lunch, you notice their kitchen is a mess. This contrasts with your expectation, prompting a state update from ‘clean’ (State 2) to ‘messy’ (State 1). You observe the friend’s apparent unhappiness during cleaning, possibly due to not offering help (Agent frame 1) changing your representation of their mood (Agent frame 2). Consequentially you consider alternative dining options than eating in, e.g. grabbing food from a nearby food truck (Action path 1) or restaurant (Action path 2). The experience itself appears fused but its deeper compositionality is implicit in the narrative structure of human experience (and later memories). <bold>b</bold>. Design schematic for obtaining belief update time-courses by aggregating reported updates over multiple participants. <bold>c</bold>.

We then compared the timing of these transitions with the belief updates by counting how many updates occurred within different time windows (TRs/scans) following these neural transitions. This varied from 0 to 8 scans. As the window length increases (light grey to black), more belief updates are naturally included. However, the critical prediction is that each region’s transition windows will contain more updates from its preferred domain than from the other domains. <bold>b</bold>.

Inter-subject pattern correlation (ISPC) was computed by correlating voxel patterns at each time point in the movie across participants. This provides a time-course of shared patterns for different ROIs. <bold>c.</bold> During moments of updates, pattern representations in the PFC suggests new predictions. An increased correlation of the time-course between a PFC region and another ROI (here Precuneus), during the update suggests functional coupling on the representational level. If an ROI has high similarity selectively with each of the PFC region for its domain-update, then it integrates new prefrontal representations in a prioritized, multithreaded manner. Threading here refers to switching between multiple prefrontal prediction threads. <bold>d.</bold> Bar plots show correlation strength of each region’s ISPC timecourse during updates with that of the Precuneus. (Top) dmPFC displaying higher similarity with during Action updates than other regions. (Middle) amPFC showing more similarity than other two during Agent updates and (bottom) vmPFC showing similarly specificity with Precuneus during State updates</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199677-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Sensory regions synchronize more with Precuneus than PFC during belief updates</title><p>Intersubject functional connectivity (ISFC) between whole-brain voxels and <bold>a.</bold> Precuneus seed, and <bold>b.</bold> domain-specific PFC seed (for its domain).
