Zygotic STAT3 is required for normal postimplantation development. On an outbred genetic background, <italic>Stat3</italic> null embryos consistently lagged behind their littermates, beginning with significant reduction of epiblast cells at implantation. Remarkably, mutants closely resemble non-affected embryos from the previous day at all postimplantation stages examined. We pinpoint this phenotype to loss of the serine-phosphorylated form of STAT3 which predominates in postimplantation embryonic tissues. Bulk RNA-sequencing analysis of isolated mouse epiblasts confirmed <italic>Stat3</italic> null embryos exhibited developmental delay transcriptionally. Single cell RNA sequencing of mid gestation chimaeras containing STAT3 null embryonic stem cells revealed exclusion of mutant cells exclusively from the erythroid lineage. Although Stat3 null embryonic stem cells can differentiate into erythroid and hematopoietic lineages in vitro, they are out-competed when mixed with wild type cells. Combined with the reduced size of STAT3 null epiblasts after implantation, our results implicate a role for STAT3 in cell proliferation affecting temporal control of embryonic progression and rapid differentiation.</p><p id="P5">For the purpose of Open Access, the author has applied a CC BY public copyright licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising from this submission.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chimeras</kwd><kwd>Developmental delay</kwd><kwd>Pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>STAT3 signalling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Classification</title><kwd>Developmental Biology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P6">Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) 3 is stimulated by the cytokine Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) in murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) via activation of Janus-associated kinases (JAKs) inducing phosphorylation of STAT3 at tyrosine 705 (pY705) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Ni <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>).

Mutation of pY705 ablates ESC self-renewal in standard (serum/LIF) culture conditions, whereas pS727 is apparently not needed in ESCs prior to neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).

In blastocysts, STAT3 regulates cellular metabolism in mitochondria by promoting oxidative phosphorylation and expression of naïve pluripotency-associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Betto <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>), but the role of STAT3 at post-implantation stages is largely unknown.</p><p id="P7">In this study, we outcrossed <italic>Stat3</italic> heterozygous mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Takeda <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>) to the robust CD1 genetic background and examined postimplantation development. Intriguingly, <italic>Stat3</italic> null embryos could survive beyond gastrulation, but exhibited defects in peri-implantation epiblast expansion and temporal control of embryonic progression and metabolism. Using our recently derived <italic>Stat3</italic> null ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kraunsoe <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>), we compared proliferation dynamics in self-renewing ‘2i’ culture conditions, comprising inhibition of MEK/ERK and GSK3, with wild type ESCs derived from the same genetic background. To scrutinise the tissue-forming capacity of embryonic cells lacking STAT3 during development we generated chimaeras by injecting <italic>Stat3</italic> null ESCs into WT CD1 host blastocysts and analysed their ability to contribute to emerging tissues by means of single cell chimaera sequencing using an updated version of our previously optimised protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Guibentif <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Pijuan-Sala <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>).

Here, we examined non-diapause embryos generated by inter-crossing <italic>Stat3</italic> heterozygous mice on the CD1 genetic background to determine at which stage developmental deficiencies might arise. We first compared peri-implantation embryonic day (E) 4.5 <italic>Stat3</italic> null versus wild type (WT) or heterozygous (het) embryos using immunofluorescence (IF) for the epiblast marker, NANOG, and primitive endoderm (PrE) marker, GATA6. Significantly fewer NANOG+ cells were observed in <italic>Stat3</italic> null embryos, whereas the numbers of GATA6+ cells did not differ appreciably between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). A dramatic reduction in the mean number of trophectoderm cells, identified by absence of NANOG and GATA6 and occupation of the outer layer, in mutant embryos compared with WT or hets was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We attribute this phenotype to decreased FGF signalling resulting from the small null epiblasts, as predicted by previous observations implying requirement for FGF4 in trophectoderm proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Nichols <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Nichols <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Surprisingly, on the CD1 genetic background, <italic>Stat3</italic> null embryos could be retrieved as late as E11.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), but consistently exhibited a phenotype more closely resembling the morphology expected for the previous day of development compared with their littermates, with no other obvious morphological defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). This intriguing observation implies that embryos lacking STAT3 are unable to instigate sufficient cell division soon after implantation, when mechanisms for size regulation are normally evoked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Rands, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Snow, 1976</xref>). To our knowledge, the sustained period of developmental delay we have observed lacking overt signs of abnormalities in organogenesis has not been reported previously.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>STAT3 null epiblasts follow a normal, but delayed developmental trajectory</title><p id="P10">Epiblasts were dissected from CD1 <italic>Stat3</italic> het <italic>inter-se</italic> mating at E5.5, E6.5 and E7.5, thus spanning epiblast transition from naïve, via formative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kinoshita <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>) to primed pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Nichols &amp; Smith, 2009</xref>) and the onset of gastrulation. Each embryo was genotyped using extraembryonic tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). From E5.5 to E6.5 the epiblast is basically a homogeneous epithelium poised to respond to asymmetric signals from the extraembryonic tissues. RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) was therefore performed in bulk on denuded epiblasts to compare transcription profiles between <italic>Stat3</italic> WT and null epiblasts. While E5.5 WT and <italic>Stat3</italic> null samples exhibited very similar transcriptional identity, E6.5 null epiblasts were clearly retarded, with an expression pattern intermediate between WT E5.5 and E6.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E,F</xref>). E7.5 null epiblasts grouped more closely with WT E6.5 than E7.5 epiblasts by principal component analysis (PCA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) and unsupervised hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>), suggesting that null epiblasts have not yet advanced from formative to primed pluripotency. <italic>Stat3</italic> null epiblasts exhibited downregulation of naïve and upregulation of primed pluripotency genes at E6.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>), concurrent with preparation for primitive streak formation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Snow, 1976</xref>). However, mutants failed to induce neuroectoderm significantly and displayed reduced intensity of selected primitive streak genes at E7.5, consistent with the temporal delay of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>STAT3 activity is controlled by phosphorylation at Serine 727 in postimplantation embryos</title><p id="P11">Validated antibodies for each of the two STAT3 phosphorylation forms (pY705 and pS727) were used for IF studies on WT CD1 mouse embryos from implantation until gastrulation. As previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kraunsoe <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), nuclear phosphorylated-Y705 STAT3 was detected in peri-implantation embryos at E4.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Apart from the extra-embryonic visceral endoderm, pY705 was barely detectable in WT embryos soon after implantation, but re-emerged in the node region of the primitive streak at mid-late gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The dramatic reduction of pY705 in postimplantation epiblasts correlates with the low level of <italic>Socs3</italic> revealed in the bulk RNAseq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). In contrast, pS727 was abundant in the epiblast, extra-embryonic ectoderm and extra-embryonic endoderm from E4.5 to E6.5, becoming restricted to visceral endoderm, epiblast and its derivatives at E7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). These stages coincide with the requirement for elevated mitochondrial function in the embryo to enable rapid cell division for tissue expansion during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lima <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). To identify potential signalling pathways activated by pS727, we applied candidate inhibitors to WT ESCs to test the phosphorylation reaction <italic>in vitro</italic>. MEK inhibition by PD0325901 (PD03) to block FGF signalling in serum-free medium did not significantly impair phosphorylation of Y705 or S727 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D,E</xref>), whereas S727 phosphorylation was previously shown to depend upon ERK signalling in serum-containing medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, JAK inhibition ablated Y705 phosphorylation, but only partially dampened pS727, indicating that S727 can be phosphorylated by factors distinct or downstream from JAK signalling or LIF-gp130 receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D,E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Self-renewing stem cell lines can be derived from STAT3 null postimplantation epiblasts</title><p id="P12">Despite their reduced size compared with WT littermates, epiblasts from <italic>Stat3</italic> null embryos at E6.5 and E7.5 could be captured and propagated as epiblast stem cell (EpiSC) lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Brons <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Tesar <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) with high efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Their morphology in culture appeared indistinguishable from that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and growth kinetics were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Transcriptional profiles of <italic>Stat3</italic> WT and null EpiSCs exhibited close clustering by means of bulk RNAseq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), implicating a STAT3-independent <italic>in vitro</italic> adaptation to self-renewal during acquisition of the mid-gastrulation anterior streak identity reported for EpiSCs using the original culture conditions, regardless of stage of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kojima <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). Differential expression analysis identified 39 upregulated and 99 downregulated genes in <italic>Stat3</italic> null EpiSCs related to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D,E</xref>). Among the significantly downregulated genes in Stat3 null EpiSCs, the gene ontology (GO) terms for cell migration and cell adhesion were substantially enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Consistent with the small transcriptional changes in Stat3 null EpiSCs compared to WT, neither pY705 nor pS727 STAT3 was detected in WT EpiSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G,H</xref>), which was surprising considering the abundant pS727 STAT3 detected in WT postimplantation epiblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). This suggests that, although the FGF-ERK pathway phosphorylates S727 STAT3 in ESCs in serum/LIF medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), pS727 is not induced significantly by FGF in standard, serum-free EpiSC culture. LIF supplementation is not required for EpiSC culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Brons <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Tesar <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>); however, pY705 and pS727 were both induced by administering LIF to WT EpiSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G,H</xref>). We conclude that STAT3 signalling is dispensable for maintenance of primed pluripotent cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, which is most likely attributable to relatively slow cell doubling times characteristic of EpiSCs in culture compared with pre-primitive streak epiblast cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Snow, 1976</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title><italic>Stat3</italic> null ESCs are specifically excluded from the erythroid lineage in mid-gestation chimeric embryos.</title><p id="P13"><italic>Stat3</italic> null ESCs were previously shown to contribute to all embryonic lineages upon injection into the blastocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Martello <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>); however, single cell resolution analyses were not performed to address cell type specific contributions at the transcriptional level. Importantly, in that study, the <italic>Stat3</italic> null ESCs were derived on an MF1 outbred background, whereas the host blastocysts were inbred C57BL/6. This disparity in genetic backgrounds creates a competitive environment, which in this combination favours the donor cells. This is one motivating factor for the traditional choice of C57BL/6 embryos as hosts for efficient generation of genetically modified mouse lines. Notably, differential signal transduction following activation of gp130/LIFR receptors between mouse strains has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Ohtsuka &amp; Niwa, 2015</xref>). To avoid discrepancy between donor and host genetic background environments we therefore injected labelled CD1 <italic>Stat3</italic> null ESCs into WT host blastocysts from the same breeding stock to eliminate the risk of encountering confounding inter-strain cell competition effects. We performed single cell chimera sequencing (scChimera-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Guibentif <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Pijuan-Sala <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) to search for specific differences between <italic>Stat3</italic> null and WT cells within the same embryo and thereby identify tissues that may be compromised by absence of STAT3.</p><p id="P14">We demonstrated high contribution of <italic>Stat3</italic> null ESC derivatives to E9.5 chimeric embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), thereby validating our experimental approach before embarking upon scChimera-seq. <italic>Stat3</italic> null ESCs were injected into CD1 blastocysts, transferred to pseudopregnant recipient mice and dissected at E7.5, E8.5, and E9.5. Embryos exhibiting 30-40% contribution of donor cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>) were selected for analysis, based upon previous optimisation of scChimera-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Guibentif <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Pijuan-Sala <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). They were dissociated and immediately sorted by flow cytometry into WT versus tdTomato-positive <italic>Stat3</italic> null cells. Cell type annotation of scRNA-seq was performed via label transfer from the previously developed extended atlas of mouse gastrulation and early organogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Imaz-Rosshandler <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Pijuan-Sala <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). <italic>Stat3</italic> null cells exhibited normal overall contribution to chimeras at the single-cell transcriptional level until E8.5. One notable feature of <italic>Stat3</italic> null embryos, revealed by immunofluorescence for the visceral endoderm markers CER1 and FOXA2, is the reduced intensity and abnormal distribution of the cells comprising the anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), an important signalling centre for instructing formation of anterior structures by the underlying epiblast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). In the context of conventional chimeras, the AVE is derived from the host embryo. Support from the WT extra-embryonic tissues provided to the <italic>Stat3</italic> null cells within chimeras might explain why injected cells can apparently keep pace with those of the host embryo in the majority of tissues. However, <italic>Stat3</italic> null cells appeared to be underrepresented in the erythroid lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5</xref>). Pseudotime analysis was performed on erythroid differentiation trajectories in WT and <italic>Stat3</italic> null cells, confirming a significant reduction in contribution to this lineage by <italic>Stat3</italic> null cells in the transition from E8.5 to E9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis along the erythroid pseudotime revealed dysregulation of canonical <italic>Stat3</italic> target genes, such as <italic>Cish</italic> and <italic>Pim1</italic>, as well as failure to upregulate <italic>Stat5a</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5A</xref>).

When cultured separately, proliferation of <italic>Stat3</italic> null ESCs was equivalent to that of WTs over the differentiation time course, reflecting the relatively prolonged cell cycle duration at this juncture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). After 4 and 5 days of culture, EBs were dissociated and stained for Flk1 and Pdgfra and the Flk1<sup>hi</sup>/Pdgfra<sup>–</sup> hematovascular mesoderm population quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis showed that <italic>Stat3</italic> null ECSs differentiated indistinguishably from WT cells to the hematovascular mesoderm population at day 4 and 5. Further differentiation of EBs to hematopoietic progenitors and erythroid lineages was quantified by CD41<sup>+</sup>/c-Kit<sup>+</sup> and Ter119<sup>+</sup>/CD71<sup>hi</sup> respectively. <italic>Stat3</italic> null ESCs differentiated to both primitive erythroid and hematopoietic progenitors with equal efficiency compared to WT, suggesting that the development of these lineages by <italic>Stat3</italic> null cells is not inherently impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>).

Our <italic>in vitro</italic> EB differentiation study supports this hypothesis, since <italic>Stat3</italic> null cells were excluded from the hematovascular mesoderm lineage and further erythroid differentiation when co-cultured with WT cells, whereas <italic>Stat3</italic> null cells were able to differentiate along these lineages normally when cultured alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>).

Given that <italic>Stat5a</italic> expression was significantly decreased in <italic>Stat3</italic> null cells in chimeric embryos, competition between WT and <italic>Stat3</italic> null cells for EPO signalling would likely exist, and STAT3 might regulate primitive erythropoiesis by fine-tuning the EPO-STAT5 signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Greenfest-Allen <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). The critical aspects of temporal control of embryonic development regulated by the distinct S727 phospho-variant of STAT3 revealed here will inform future studies on erythroid differentiation in the absence of STAT3 and development of protocols to investigate the interaction of embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues during gastrulation regulated by STAT3 signalling.</p><p id="P20">Mutations in STAT3 signalling are implicated as the cause of various defects in humans, affecting a range of organs and processes.

Differential expression testing was performed using the TradeSeq package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Van den Berge <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). First, a negative binomial generalized additive model was fitted for every gene using fitGAM with condition=‘genotype’, U=‘embryo pool’, pseudotime=‘slingshot pseudotime’, nknots=6, and cellWeights set to ‘1’ for every cell as all cells belong to the same trajectory. Next, differential genes were detected using conditionTest with l2fc=1. Multiple-comparison correction was done using p.adjust with method=‘fdr’ and genes with corrected p-values of &lt;0.05 were labelled as significant.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS199388-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d68aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S29"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to thank Kenneth Jones for lab management and help with genotyping; Thomas Burdon and Lawrence Bates for helpful discussion on the project; Shizuo Akira for providing <italic>Stat3+/-</italic> mice; Peter Humphreys and Darran Clement (Cambridge Stem Cell Institute), Ann Wheeler and Laura Murphy (Human Genetics Unit, University of Edinburgh) for advanced imaging and analysis; Michael Rennie and Elizabeth Freyer for flow cytometry analysis; Maike Paramor and Vicky Murray for sequencing (Cambridge Stem Cell Institute); UBS, Cambridge for animal husbandry; So Shimamoto and Shota Nakanoh for helpful discussion.
