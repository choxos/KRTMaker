Whilst both enzymes contribute to pervasive genome-wide CpG methylation, DNMT3B has a unique role in developmentally regulated CpG island (CGI) methylation both on the inactive X chromosome and at other sites in the genome. The mechanistic basis for this specificity is poorly understood. Here we have developed an in vitro embryonic stem cell model system to dissect critical determinants of DNMT3B specificity. Our model faithfully recapitulates developmentally regulated CGI methylation and additionally provides novel insights into CpG methylation at cis-regulatory elements. Using genetic complementation, we show that DNMT3B specificity is attributable solely to the catalytic isoform DNMT3B1. Domain swap experiments demonstrate an important role both for the PWWP-ADD chromatin binding and unstructured N-terminal domains. Together, these findings advance our mechanistic understanding of the unique roles of DNMT enzymes in establishing CpG methylation in development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">In vertebrate genomes 5-methyl cytosine (5meC) occurs pervasively at CpG dinucleotides where it is important for regulating both the activity of transposable elements and expression of developmentally regulated genes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Greenberg &amp; Bourc’his, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Schübeler, 2015</xref>). CpG methylation is catalysed by DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs) which can be classified into two categories based on their DNA substrate preference. First, <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferases (including in mammals DNMT3A and DNMT3B) which establish methylation of previously unmethylated CpG sites on DNA and second, the maintenance methyltransferase (DNMT1) which propagates CpG methylation from hemi-methylated DNA on the parent strand to the daughter strand during DNA replication (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gowher &amp; Jeltsch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Schübeler, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Whilst vertebrate CpG methylation is largely pervasive, an important exception occurs at CpG islands (CGIs), elements typically 1-2kb in length located at the 5’ end of a large proportion of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bird, Taggart, Frommer, Miller, &amp; Macleod, 1985</xref>). Despite having a higher than average density of CpG sites, in most instances CGIs remain unmethylated throughout development, regardless of whether the associated genes are expressed (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Illingworth &amp; Bird, 2009</xref>). The basis for CGI hypomethylation is not fully understood but evidence points to at least two default pathways. First, the histone modification H3K4me3, which is enriched at CGIs acts to inhibit the activity of the vertebrate de novo DNA methyltransferases, DNMT3A and DNMT3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). H3K4me3 deposition at CGI is at least in part attributable to the presence of a CXXC domains in specific H3K4 histone methyltransferases which recognises unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Birke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cierpicki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Long, Blackledge, &amp; Klose, 2013</xref>). Secondly, CXXC recognition of CGIs by the enzymes TET1 and TET2 that catalyse removal of cytosine methylation via a hydroxymethylated intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lorsbach et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Ono et al., 2002</xref>). Loss of function of TET1 and TET2 is linked to a gain of methylation at CGIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dawlaty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Ficz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Ito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Although the majority of CGIs remain hypomethylated throughout development, there are circumstances in which CGI methylation does occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Auclair, Guibert, Bender, &amp; Weber, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Borgel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dahlet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Straussman et al., 2009</xref>). An example of this is CGIs associated with meiosis and germline-specific genes that in somatic cells are silenced by a repressor complex that includes the PRC1 polycomb protein PCGF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Borgel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dahlet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Mitsuhiro et al., 2017</xref>). In this instance CGI methylation is largely dependent on the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, rather than its closely related and broadly co-expressed homologue, DNMT3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Auclair et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Borgel et al., 2010</xref>). A second example of developmentally regulated CGI methylation is during X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in the cells of female mammals. Here, CGI on the inactive X chromosome (Xi) gain CpG methylation, also in a DNMT3B-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gendrel et al., 2012</xref>). CGI methylation is important for the maintenance of XCI, occurring downstream of initiation and establishment of chromosome silencing by the cis-acting non-coding RNA Xist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lock, Takagi, &amp; Martin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Sado et al., 2000</xref>). Prior studies have established that methylation of the majority of Xi CGIs is additionally dependent on the chromosomal protein SmcHD1 which is recruited to the Xi at a relatively late developmental stage, 2-3 days after the onset of cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bowness et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gendrel et al., 2012</xref>). A final example where CGI methylation is observed is at tumour suppressor genes (TSG) in cancer cells. Little is known about specific mechanisms in this instance although stochastic gain of methylation and accompanying selection for TSG repression during cancer evolution are likely important determinants (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baylin &amp; Jones, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P6">DNMT3A and DNMT3B are highly homologous with around 85% amino acid similarity. Protein architecture is also highly similar with a C-terminal catalytic domain and centrally located PWWP and ADD domains, both with ascribed roles in chromatin recognition. The N-terminal regions are relatively diverse and are predicted to be unstructured (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Jeltsch &amp; Jurkowska, 2016</xref>). Two recent studies have reported that the N-terminal region of DNMT3A can bind to the histone modification H2AK119ub1 which is catalysed by PRC1 Polycomb complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Weinberg et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with similarities in the features of DNMT3A and DNMT3B, gene knockouts in ES cells indicate that the two proteins are in large part redundant in their role in establishing de novo CpG methylation patterns. Gene knockout results in mid-late embryo lethality in both cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Okano, Bell, Haber, &amp; Li, 1999</xref>). Despite these overall similarities DNMT3A and DNMT3B do have more specific functions, including, as above, in CGI methylation. The mechanistic basis of these specificities, including the role of DNMT3B in CGI methylation is not well understood. A priori, specific functions could be attributable to differences in protein structure and/or the presence of non-catalytic isoforms, notably DNMT3L and DNMT3B3, both of which can modulate DNMT3A/B catalytic activity through the formation of heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chedin, Lieber, &amp; Hsieh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chen, Mann, Hsieh, Riggs, &amp; Chédin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gordon, Hartono, &amp; Chédin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gowher, Liebert, Hermann, Xu, &amp; Jeltsch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Suetake, Shinozaki, Miyagawa, Takeshima, &amp; Tajima, 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In this study we set out to better define DNMT3B specificity in CGI methylation. Accordingly, we established an ES cell-based model that recapitulates developmentally regulated CGI methylation both on Xi and genome wide. By engineering defined perturbations to modify DNMT3B we demonstrate that specificity is conferred by DNMT3B1, the catalytic isoform of the protein with critical roles for the PWWP-ADD domain and the unstructured N-terminal region.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Establishment of an ES cell model that recapitulates Xi and developmentally regulated CGI methylation</title><p id="P8">We set out to develop an ES cell-based model to dissect the mechanisms governing specificity of DNMT3B for Xi and developmentally regulated CGI methylation. Accordingly, we made use of iXist-ChrX, an interspecific XX female mESC line in which the native Xist promoter on one allele is replaced with the TetOn promoter for Doxycycline inducible expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Nesterova et al., 2019</xref>). To test the suitability of this experimental system to study CGI methylation during XCI, we performed MBD-seq at various timepoints during embryoid body (EB) differentiation in the presence of doxycycline and LIF withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). MBD-seq employs the MBD domain of MBD1 for affinity purification of methylated CpG-dense DNA. To correct for variability in IP efficacy or library preparation between experiments, we included human DNA to serve as a calibration control. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref> shows CGI methylation during EB differentiation and Xist gene induction. As expected, we observed a proportion of CGIs across all chromosomes gain CpG methylation over the EB differentiation time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), whilst on ChrX we observed CpG methylation gain on the majority (382/448) of CGIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, lower panel). Selected examples of autosomal and ChrX CGI that gain CpG methylation are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>. We also observed a significant number of non-CGI MBD peaks, lying in most cases &gt;2 kb from the nearest transcription start site (TSS). These peaks are discussed in detail below.</p><p id="P9">For ChrX CGIs we were able to assign MBD-seq reads allelically and this analysis confirmed gain of CpG methylation occurs largely on the Xi. Representative examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>. For each independent CGI on the X chromosome, we defined the earliest time point during EB differentiation at which the MBD-seq signal first showed allelic bias i.e. a larger proportion of MBD-seq reads originating from Xi, (Xi/ (Xi +Xa)) &gt; 0.5). Two trends emerged from this analysis; a small group of 56 CGIs reached an allelic ratio of 1 (AR = 1) at day 4 with levels plateauing through to day 12, referred to herein as “fast methylating” CGIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). Many of the remaining CGIs acquired CpG methylation progressively reaching an allelic ratio of 1 at around 8 days of EB differentiation, referred to herein as ‘slow methylating’ CGIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). This data agrees well with our previous work using non-allelic microarray-based analysis showing that Xi CGI methylation occurs in fast and slow phases, with the latter exhibiting dependence on SMCHD1 for their methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gendrel et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, a small group of 20 CGIs showed gain of CGI methylation on both the Xa and Xi. Here, the number of reads from Xi + Xa increased during the time course, but the allelic ratio remained 0.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). Some CGIs in this group, are associated with germline-specific genes such as <italic>Dusp9, Rhox13, Taf7l, AU022751</italic>, that have been reported previously to gain CGI methylation after mouse embryo implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Auclair et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P10">In addition to X-linked CGIs, a significant number of autosomal CGIs gained CpG methylation through the EB differentiation time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E, H</xref>). Selected examples are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>. Major categories by GO analysis are developmental genes and germline-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). This observation is consistent with prior studies characterising genes that gain CGI methylation during normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Auclair et al., 2014</xref>) and indeed we observe a close overlap of the identified gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We further validated our observations on CGI methylation in an alternative model, homogenous NPC (Neuronal Progenitor Cell) differentiation. MBD-seq was performed on cells collected at day 0,12 and 15 of NPC differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). Similar to the EB differentiation models, we were able to categorise Xi CGIs into fast- and slow-dynamic classes and the identity of CGIs in the two categories largely matched between the two differentiation systems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C-G</xref>). The exact timing of CGI methylation onset however was relatively slow in NPC differentiation, and for this reason we used EB differentiation as the main experimental system for other experiments described below.</p><p id="P12">Together these results demonstrate that differentiating iXist-ChrX cells provide a useful model that faithfully recapitulates key features of Xi and developmental CGI methylation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The role of DNMT3B in CGI methylation</title><p id="P13">We went on to apply the iXist-ChrX model to analyse the specific role of DNMT3B in CGI methylation, generating a gene knockout of <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>Dnmt3b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells behaved similarly to the wild-type (wt) cells in culture, and we observed no changes in morphology, growth rate, ability to differentiate to EBs or transcriptional silencing of the Xi chromosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A-C</xref>). We then performed MBD-seq on <italic>Dnmt3b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells differentiated to day 12 EBs. The allelic ratio analysis revealed that CGIs on the Xi are largely unmethylated in the absence of DNMT3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-C</xref>). Results for independent <italic>Dnmt3b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> clones and replicates were fully consistent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D,E</xref>). Since <italic>Dnmt3b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells have normal levels of DNMT3A, this experiment validates that DNMT3A is not redundant with DNMT3B for methylation of the majority of CGIs on the Xi. However, we did observe that 15/265 of the Xi CGIs that are amenable to allelic analysis in wt cells gained CpG methylation biallelically in the absence of DNMT3B. Examples include <italic>Dusp9, Kcne1l, G530011O0Rik</italic> and <italic>Zfp92</italic> which are methylated independent of XCI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F</xref>). Only 5 out of these 15 DNMT3B-independent CGIs reached an allelic ratio of 1, indicating strong allelic bias towards Xi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F</xref>). Thus, DNMT3B is the predominant (but not the sole) de novo methyltransferase required for Xi CGI methylation.</p><p id="P14">We also examined genome-wide CGI methylation at developmentally regulated genes previously reported to be DNMT3B-dependent. We performed differential MBD-seq analysis to define DNMT3B-dependent and independent loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2G</xref>). Levels of CGI methylation increased from d8-d12 of EB differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2H</xref>), a similar trajectory to that seen for slow methylating Xi CGI. Among these CGIs were well-characterized targets, such as germline-expressed genes, protocadherin genes, genes associated with Wnt/β-catenin pathway and <italic>Dppa3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Auclair et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Yagi et al., 2020</xref>), all of which were hypomethylated in the differentiated <italic>Dnmt3b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> iXist-ChrX line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2I</xref>). Additionally, ICF (immunodeficiency, centromeric instability and facial anomalies), a rare autosomal genetic disorder which predominantly results from mutations in DNMT3B (subtype 1), has been associated with CGI hypomethylation at loci including <italic>Zbtb22, Slc25a31, Slc8a2, Trim42, Ly6k, Tdrd1/6, Rem1, Meioc, Srrm2/4, Znrf4, Jph4, Neurl1b, Mapk8, Kcng4</italic> and <italic>Tnxb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Yagi et al., 2020</xref>). The mouse homologues of these loci were also identified as DNMT3B-dependent CGIs in this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). These results further validate the iXist-ChrX EB differentiation system as a model both for developmentally regulated CGI methylation and Xi CGI methylation.</p><p id="P15">Interestingly, peak calling on the MBD-seq datasets additionally identified a significant number (6812) of non-CGI annotated peaks. Focusing our analysis on the X chromosome (494/6812 non-CGI peaks), we found that there are two classes of non-CGI MBD elements; one class, that is present both in ES cells and EBs and the other, that gains CpG methylation during differentiation. Among the latter, a subset (n =101) showed gain of methylation specifically on Xi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A,B</xref>). Non-CGI MBD peaks generally lie &gt;2kb from the nearest TSS and in these instances their methylation is DNMT3B independent. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C-E</xref>). This contrasts with DNMT3B dependence shown for promoter proximal and CGI peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C-F</xref>). Non-CGI MBD peaks overlapped with regions with high chromatin accessibility (assessed by ATAC-seq) and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq in undifferentiated iXist-ChrX cells, and have a relatively low CG content, suggesting that they likely represent cis-regulatory elements (CREs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3G-H</xref>). During EB differentiation, these non-CGI MBD elements acquire DNA methylation with fast dynamics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3I</xref>), being fully methylated by day 4 of differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>CGI methylation by DNMT3B requires the catalytically active isoform DNMT3B1</title><p id="P16">The <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> gene, unlike <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>, codes for several inactive isoforms that are distinct from their catalytically active counterparts, in both structure and function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). These inactive isoforms have been reported to interact with and regulate catalytic DNMTA/B isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Duymich, Charlet, Yang, Jones, &amp; Liang, 2016</xref>). A catalytically inactive isoform of DNMT3B, DNMT3B3, enhances catalytic activity of both DNMT3A and DNMT3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gordon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Y. Zeng et al., 2020</xref>). Recent work indicates that DNMT3B3 heterodimerizes with catalytic isoforms of DNMT3A/B, and interacts with nucleosomes, so as to place the target recognition domain (TRD) over linker DNA for CpG methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, during development DNMT3B3 is upregulated and its expression is maintained in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chedin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gordon et al., 2013</xref>), leading to the suggestion that it is an essential accessory factor fulfilling a similar role to DNMT3L in germline and early embryo cells. Accordingly, loss of CGI methylation in previously described <italic>Dnmt3b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> ES cells could be attributable to loss of catalytically active DNMT3B1 and/or non-catalytic isoforms, including DNMT3B3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Since DNMT3B isoforms share most of the coding sequence of the gene, engineering mutations of the <italic>Dnmt3b</italic> locus, such that only one isoform is deleted, is not possible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). To overcome this complexity, we used a complementation strategy, in which transgenes encoding specific DNMT3B isoforms were expressed in the <italic>Dnmt3b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> iXist-ChrX parent line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>). For the generation of complementation lines with equivalent expression levels, cDNA encoding DNMT3B isoforms (3B1 or 3B3) were introduced into the TIGRE locus on chromosome 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">H. Zeng et al., 2008</xref>), under a constitutive pCAG promoter, henceforth referred to as <italic>Dnmt3b1</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3b3 knock-in (KI)</italic> lines. Owing to the insertion of sequence encoding Tet-transactivator (rtTA) which allows doxycycline-inducible Xist expression on one allele of the TIGRE locus, the complementation lines carry only a single copy of the respective transgene. Western blot analysis illustrating expression of two independent clones for both <italic>Dnmt3b1-</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3b3-KI</italic> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>.</p><p id="P18">Both the <italic>Dnmt3b1-</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3b3-KI</italic> lines behaved normally with respect to cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>), and Xi silencing was comparable to the wt iXist-ChrX cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Data for independent clones was well correlated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4D</xref>). Analysis of CGI methylation by MBD-seq demonstrates that methylation of DNMT3B-dependent CGIs on Xi is fully rescued in the DNMT3B1 complementation lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). In contrast, there was no detectable Xi CGI methylation on expression of DNMT3B3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Analysis of CGI methylation genome-wide similarly showed complementation in DNMT3B1 but not DNMT3B3 expressing cell lines, with DNMT3B independent MBD peaks being broadly unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D,F</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate that DNMT3B3 is dispensable for the establishment of DNMT3B-dependent Xi and autosomal CGI methylation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>DNMT3B1 PWWP-ADD domains but not the catalytic domain confer specificity for CGI methylation</title><p id="P19">Having established that it is the catalytically active DNMT3B1 isoform that is required for Xi CGI, we next explored the role of individual domains in imparting specificity.

To investigate if these differences could underlie DNMT3B1 specificity for methylating CGIs, we complemented <italic>Dnmt3b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells with a chimeric DNMT3B where the catalytic domain of DNMT3B was replaced by that of DNMT3A (represented as <italic>Dnmt3b-3aCat KI</italic>) and performed MBD-seq on 12-day differentiated EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This chimeric construct was able to fully rescue CGI methylation on Xi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B- D</xref>) and also at DNMT3B-dependent autosomal CGIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). These results demonstrate conclusively that the catalytic domain of DNMT3B does not impart specificity for CGI methylation.</p><p id="P20">The PWWP and ADD domains of DNMT3A and 3B, although largely conserved, have been shown to impart distinct characteristics to the DNMT proteins. The PWWP domain of DNMT3B, for instance, is reported to interact with H3K36me3-modified gene bodies while that of DNMT3A shows preference for H3K36me2-modified intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Baubec et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Weinberg et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, the ADD domain of DNMT3B has been suggested to form weaker interaction with its catalytic domain compared to DNMT3A and to possess an extended conformation that can serve as an interface for protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Boyko et al., 2022</xref>). Such protein interactors could potentially mediate DNMT3B recruitment to its target loci. To test if the PWWP-ADD region of DNMT3B1 has a role in imparting specificity for CGI methylation we expressed a chimeric DNMT3B with the region spanning PWWP-ADD domains replaced by the equivalent domains from DNMT3A (represented as <italic>Dnmt3b-PWWP-ADD_Swap or Dnmt3b-PAS-KI</italic> cells and performed MBD-seq on 12-day differentiated EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A-B</xref>). In ES cells, this chimeric DNMT3B protein showed ectopic CpG methylation in comparison to wt iXist-ChrX cells), and ChromHMM analysis revealed that the MBD-seq signal emerged largely from within exons and intergenic regions, indicating that the chimeric DNMT3B protein is catalytically active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5C-D</xref>). However, most CGIs remained unmethylated both on Xi and autosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Although most CGIs remained hypomethylated using the PWWP-ADD swap construct, there were some exceptions, totalling around 125 of those CGIs that were DNMT3B-dependent in comparative analysis of wt and <italic>Dnmt3b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5E</xref>).

Key advantages afforded by our model include the use of an inducible promoter to initiate Xist expression, providing for homogeneous and highly synchronised onset and progression of XCI, ease of scale up for analyses requiring larger amounts of material, and amenability to genome engineering to test specified perturbations of key factors. Our system recapitulates key features of CGI methylation using different differentiation procedures, reproducing prior observations such as distinct early and late Xi CGI methylation phases during cell differentiation, differentiation-dependent methylation of a defined specific subset of autosomal CGIs, and DNMT3B dependence of CGI methylation on Xi and autosomes. In addition to confirming prior findings, our initial MBD-seq analysis revealed that a subset of non-CGI elements that correlate with distant CREs gain CpG methylation on Xi in a DNMT3B-independent manner. This observation may help to explain a prior observation that loss of DNMT3B1 alone does not result in significant derepression of Xi genes during embryogenesis, contrasting with treatment of somatic cells with demethylating agents which can result in sporadic Xi gene reactivation. Further studies are required to determine the precise contribution of CRE CpG methylation on Xi in establishment and/or maintenance of X chromosome inactivation.</p><p id="P26">Several studies have highlighted that DNMT3 proteins form homo- or heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Xu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Y. Zeng et al., 2020</xref>), with heterodimers involving non-catalytic DNMT3L being important in germ cells and undifferentiated embryonic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bourc’his, Xu, Lin, Bollman, &amp; Bestor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Ooi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Suetake et al., 2004</xref>), and DNMT3B3 implicated in somatic lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Xu et al., 2020</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Zeng et al., 2020</xref>). We used complementation analysis in a <italic>Dnmt3b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background to demonstrate that the catalytic DNMT3B1 isoform alone (possibly as heterodimer with DNMT3A) is sufficient for CGI methylation on the Xi and autosomes and that DNMT3B3 alone, despite being available to heterodimerise with DNMT3A, could not restore this activity. These observations pinpoint CGI methylation specificity to the catalytically active DNMT3B1 isoform, both in XCI and genome-wide. We note that MBD-seq analysis did not detect CpG methylation changes reported previously using limited representation bisulfite analysis of mouse embryos expressing a non-catalytic DNMT3B mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Nowialis et al., 2019</xref>). It may be that these differences require higher resolution than that provided by MBD-seq and in this regard it would be interesting to examine global CpG methylation at single nucleotide resolution in our ES cell model using newly developed long-read sequencing methods.</p><p id="P27">Given our finding that the DNMT3B1 isoform alone is sufficient for CGI methylation, we were able to set about defining which parts of the protein are required for this activity. Our DNMT3A domain swap experiments ruled out unique features of the DNMT3B1 catalytic domain, instead implicating the PWWP-ADD and N-terminal domains as being important for CGI specificity. In addition to the N-terminal truncation mutant, expression of a series of smaller N-terminal deletions also failed to restore CGI methylation, further verifying this finding. We speculate that the DNMT3B1 PWWP-ADD and N-terminal regions synergise in recognising an interacting protein or a specific chromatin feature/post-translational modification, that underlies CGI specificity. An intriguing possibility relates to the histone PTM H3K9me3 which is enhanced/redistributed on Xi following recruitment of the chromosomal protein SmcHD1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ichihara, Nagao, Sakaguchi, Obuse, &amp; Sado, 2022</xref>).

Potential mechanisms include direct binding of DNMT3B to H3K9me3, and here it is interesting to note that the protein ATRX has an ADD domain which has been shown to mediate H3K9me3 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Iwase et al., 2011</xref>).

From day 3 to day 7 EBs were fed with EC10 + 1.5 μg/ml doxycycline by taking the contents of the plate (medium with suspended EBs) out in a 50 ml falcon tube, allowing the EBs to settle (usually within 5 minutes, the exact time depends on the size of EBs; when settled EBs form a loose pellet), aspirating the old medium, gently resuspending EBs in fresh medium, and placing them back in the culture dish. On day 7, the EBs start to attach to the dish. The weakly attached EBs were carefully detached by pipetting and moved back to 10 cm cell culture dishes.
