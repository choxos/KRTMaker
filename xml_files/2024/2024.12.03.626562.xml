Here, we tested the possibility that specific post-translational modifications may involve residues exposed during the folding process by assessing the solvent accessibility of 87,138 post-translationally modified amino acids in the human proteome. Unexpectedly, we found that one-third of phosphorylated proteins present at least one phosphosite completely buried within the protein’s inner core. Computational and experimental analyses suggest that these cryptic phosphosites may become exposed during the folding process, where their modification could destabilize native structures and trigger protein degradation. Phylogenetic investigation also reveals that cryptic phosphosites are more conserved than surface-exposed phosphorylated residues. Finally, cross-referencing with cancer mutation databases suggests that phosphomimetic mutations in cryptic phosphosites can increase tumor fitness by inactivating specific onco-suppressors. These findings define a novel role for co-translational phosphorylation in shaping protein folding and expression, laying the groundwork for exploring the implications of cryptic phosphosites in health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Protein Folding</kwd><kwd>Post-translation Modification</kwd><kwd>Protein Phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>Co-translational phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>Cryptic phosphosites</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Proteins are canonically regarded as physiologically functional in their native conformation. However, the actual landscape of protein conformations is populated by various dynamically interconverting metastable species whose abundance and persistence are determined by the interplay of equilibrium thermodynamic processes, such as the thermally activated transitions between metastable conformations, and non-equilibrium phenomena, for example the polypeptide synthesis or degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The fundamental process where non-native conformers hold unquestioned relevance is protein folding, characterized by the conversion of a newly synthesized, unstructured polypeptide chain to its native three-dimensional conformation. The physio-chemical mechanism underlying this process has long been debated, starting from Anfisen’s seminal work <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Theoretical simulations and in vitro biophysics experiments consistently support the hypothesis that the fast refolding mechanism of isolated small globular proteins (i.e., consisting of a few tens of amino acids) is rather heterogeneous and with multiple competing pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Conversely, larger proteins have a more complex folding kinetics and relatively more defined folding mechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. In particular, chains consisting of a few hundred amino acids typically fold by docking partially folded substructures, called foldons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The emergence of a prominent folding mechanism is arguably further enhanced in vivo by the vectorial nature of ribosomal co-translational folding and because the folding rate-limiting step (i.e., the addition of amino acids to the nascent chain) is much slower than the typical refolding rates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Such a perspective not only conceptually justifies developing reproducible models for the folding pathways of specific proteins but also suggests that, if co-translational folding does take place through relatively consistent steps, kinetically relevant intermediate conformations could influence the whole protein folding process. Protein folding mechanisms and their defects have been linked to protein homeostasis (or proteostasis) and disease at multiple levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Indeed, proper folding of newly synthesized proteins is fundamental for maintaining biological functions. The process is closely monitored by various cellular pathways, which intervene to correct aberrantly folded species or reroute them to degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Sufficiently long-lived off-pathway conformational states that are spontaneously visited during the folding process may be recognized by the quality control machinery as improperly folded species, thus contributing to modulate protein homeostasis. In contrast, the possibility that on-pathway transient conformational states might hold intrinsic biological functions and be directly implicated in regulatory mechanisms has remained largely unexplored <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are chemical changes that occur to proteins after they have been synthesized, significantly altering a protein’s function, stability, localization, and interactions, playing a crucial role in regulating cellular processes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. PTMs include various modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, glycosylation, acetylation, sumoylation, and methylation. Among these, phosphorylation is one of the most common. It involves the addition of a phosphate to an hydroxyl group found in the side chain of specific amino acids, typically serine, threonine or tyrosine residues. Kinases are the enzymes catalyzing such additions of phosphate groups, whereas phosphatases catalyze their removal. Phosphorylation plays diverse roles in cellular regulation. It acts as a molecular switch in signaling pathways, activating or deactivating proteins that deliver signals within the cell. It is also crucial for cell growth, division, and response to external stimuli. Additionally, phosphorylation can alter the activity of enzymes, enhancing or inhibiting their function and allowing cells to adapt to environmental changes rapidly. Adding a phosphate group can also create or disrupt binding sites for other proteins, influencing complex formation and cellular pathways. Furthermore, phosphorylation can change the localization of proteins within the cell, directing them to specific compartments where they exert their function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Lastly, phosphorylation can mark proteins for degradation or protect them from it, thereby controlling protein turnover and maintaining protein homeostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Through these roles, phosphorylation is a critical mechanism for dynamic protein regulation, influencing almost every aspect of cell biology.</p><p id="P4">In this manuscript, we combine experiments, theory and simulations to tackle the central question of whether specific non-native, folding-associated protein conformers could play physiological functions in the protein regulation machinery. Our analyses established that, differently from any other PTMs, phosphorylation may involve amino acids locked into rigid domains buried inside native protein cores. Computer simulations and experimental correlates show that these cryptic phosphosites are transiently exposed in long-lived protein folding intermediates and destabilize native structures when phosphorylated, leading to the rapid degradation of polypeptides. Our findings introduce a novel perspective on the regulation of protein expression, suggesting that co-translational phosphorylation events occurring on cryptic residues may determine the folding and stability of polypeptides. This concept expands our understanding of protein homeostasis with significant implications for physiological processes and therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Bioinformatic analysis to mine cryptic phosphosites in the human proteome</title><p id="P5">By definition, PTMs occur on proteins that have completed their folding pathway and reached their native states. However, there are cases in which the modifying enzyme intervenes on the target protein while the folding process is still ongoing. For instance, glycosylation can occur co-translationally as soon as the target polypeptide emerges from the ribosomal channel <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Such chemical modifications likely involve intermediates that transiently appear along the folding process. This conclusion suggests that specific PTMs may affect the overall expression of a polypeptide by influencing its folding pathway. We sought to explore this possibility for all the main PTMs in the human proteome, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, sumoylation, in addition to glycosylation. PTMs require the target amino acids to be exposed on the protein surface, as the enzymes responsible for adding or removing the specific chemical groups need direct access to the side chains. Conversely, an amino acid buried within the protein’s core is shielded from the solvent and becomes inaccessible for enzymatic modification. We hypothesized that PTMs influencing protein folding pathways may involve residues exposed in on-pathway protein folding intermediates while being hidden from the solvent once the protein has reached is native conformation. To test this hypothesis, we built a computational pipeline aimed at systematically identifying PTMs in the human proteome occurring on hidden residues, named cryptic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). First, data extracted from the database PhosphoSitePlus, which includes the largest collection of experimentally validated PTMs, were cross-referenced with the DeepMind’s AlphaFold protein structure database. This step assigned each PTM from PhosphoSitePlus to the corresponding protein structure in AlphaFold. In an attempt to significantly reduce the likelihood of false positives, we restricted our analysis to PTMs lying within structured domains showing an AlphaFold confidence score (pLDDT) above 65. We then assessed the RSA value of the residues corresponding to the different PTMs in order to determine solvent exposure in the native state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). PTM residues with an RSA value below 0.15 were classified as cryptic, reflecting their poor solvent exposure. The analysis revealed that ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, and sumoylation share a normal-like distribution centered around values of RSA between 0.4 and 0.8, indicating that the vast majority of these PTMs occur on residues exposed on the surface of the corresponding proteins. As expected, the distributions of glycosylation differed significantly, featuring a bimodal distribution with two major peaks centered around RSA values between 0.15 and 0.3 and between 0.4 and 0.6. Such bimodality reflects the aforementioned propensity of glycosylation to occur both co- and post-translationally. In contrast to the distributions of all other PTMs, we observed a complex distribution for phosphorylation. This PTM presented a large density of entries with RSA values ranging between 0.2 and 0.6 but also a sharp peak between 0 and 0.15, likely indicative of residues buried into protein cores. These cryptic phosphosites accounted for 26.4% of all plotted phosphorylated residues. Subsequent stratification of the new dataset of cryptic phosphosites highlighted differences in the relative distribution of the three phosphorylation-permissive amino acids (i.e., serine, threonine and tyrosine) with tyrosine presenting a larger proportion of cryptic phosphosites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, RSA values of cryptic phosphosites did not correlate with proteins’ length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Figure 2</xref>). Approximately 65% of proteins containing cryptic phosphosites presented only 1 or 2 of such residues, while only less than 10% showed 5 or more sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Figure 3</xref>). Overall, these results unexpectedly revealed that a substantial number of phosphorylated amino acids in the human proteome are apparently cryptic, lying within the inner core of proteins’ native states.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Dynamic and structural filtering of false positive cryptic phosphosites</title><p id="P6">The RSA values of cryptic phosphosites were computed on static protein structures predicted by Alpha Fold without considering any thermal fluctuations. However, the latter can activate concerted large scale displacements of groups of amino acids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, termed quasi-rigid or dynamical domains, whose relative motion may change the solvent exposure of putative cryptic sites, leading to higher RSA values. Therefore, our compiled database of cryptic phosphosites likely contains a relevant amount of false positive sites that can become transiently exposed during the thermally-activated internal dynamics of the protein. To address this issue, we used SPECTRUS, a recently described computational method to identify dynamical domains in proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In particular, we designed a multi-step filtering procedure based on structural and dynamic analyses, aimed at excluding cryptic phosphosites that become exposed to the solvent as a result of thermal fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The first step involved removing low-confidence segments (such as loops, linkers, or short disordered regions) from the initial protein dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This refined dataset included individual or contiguous protein domains, with entries containing at least 5 residues within 5 Å of each other. Cryptic phosphosites within domains smaller than 40 residues were excluded due to low reliability of SPECTRUS in handling short polypeptides. The RSA of cryptic phosphosites was recalculated, filtering out residues with an RSA above 0.15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Finally, SPECTRUS identified quasi-rigid domains in this updated protein dataset using a clustering procedure based on the distance fluctuation matrix obtained from β-Gaussian models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Cryptic phosphosites in these domains with top SPECTRUS quality scores were excluded if their side chains had fewer than 80% intra-domain contacts (examples of true and false cryptic phosphosites are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-E</xref>). Such highly stringent filtering steps generated a final database of 10,606 cryptic T, S and Y phosphosites out of ∼218,000 total phosphosites, belonging to 5,496 different proteins out of ∼18,0000 total phosphorylated proteins annotated in PhosphoSitePlus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Figure 4</xref>). These data indicate that ∼5% of all known phosphosites are cryptic. Impressively, the number translates to ∼33% of phosphorylated proteins in the human proteome presenting at least one cryptic phosphosite.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Computational and experimental validation of cryptic phosphosites in model proteins</title><p id="P7">In order to validate the results of the computational analyses, we selected cryptic phosphosites for further computational and experimental assessment. The selection was limited to phosphosites occurring on protein domains shorter than 200 amino acids to facilitate in silico analyses. Furthermore, we selected proteins that contain cryptic sites phosphorylated by identified kinases. Two candidates out of such selection included phosphosites S417 of the SMAD family member 2 (SMAD2, PDB 1DEV), a protein involved in signal transduction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, and residue T382 lying within the kinase associated-1 (KA1) domain of the checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1, PDB 5WI2), a factor involved in DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoint regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Importantly, in both cases, the phosphorylation of the cryptic residues had been previously reported to be associated with loss of function effects or proteasomal degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. One additional phosphosite, the S300 of PYST1 (PDB 1MKP), a member of the dual specificity protein phosphatase subfamily, which was removed by our dynamic filtering of false positive cryptic phosphosites, was added to the list as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. To explore the impact of phosphorylation of the three selected residues, we performed 1 μs MD simulations imposing either -1 or -2 as a possible charged state of the phosphate group. We then compared the RSA of the unphosphorylated forms with their phosphorylated counterparts. Not surprisingly, in all three cases we observed that phosphorylation substantially increased RSA of the corresponding residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A-C</xref>). The rise in solvent accessibility is likely due to the charges from the phosphate group and the steric hindrance it introduces, both of which prompt a conformational shift in the proteins, thereby increasing the exposure of the residues to the solvent. To experimentally investigate the effect of phosphorylation on protein expression, we performed cellular clonal analyses. First, we engineered each protein in three different forms: a WT version carrying the original residue at the corresponding cryptic position and phosphoablative or phosphomimetic mutants. The formers were designed to substitute the original amino acid with an alanine, thus abrogating the possibility of being phosphorylated. Conversely, glutamate or aspartate were introduced to mimic the spatial hindrance and electrostatic properties of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, respectively. A FLAG-tag was also added to the C-terminus of each protein variant to facilitate and standardize immunodetection. Each construct was then inserted into an expression vector downstream of a Tet-inducible promoter, which allows controlling protein expression through the addition of doxycycline. Finally, plasmids encoding for the different protein versions were stably transfected into HEK293 cells and protein levels were evaluated by western blotting upon 24-48 h induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Figures 5-7</xref>). The expression efficiency of the phosphoablative mutants of SMAD2, CHK1 and PYST1 did not significantly differ from the corresponding values of the WT forms. Conversely, phosphomimetic mutants for SMAD2 and CHK1, but not for PYST1, showed statistically significant differences compared to the WT or the phosphoablative mutant. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of cryptic sites in SMAD2 and CHK1 can directly influence their expression efficiency.</p><p id="P8">To further corroborate these observations, we sought to compare the half-life of the different protein variants. We conducted these analyses on selected CHK1 clones. Following the induction of the three different CHK1 variants for 48h, protein synthesis was arrested by removing doxycycline and adding the ribosomal inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). This method enabled us to track protein loads at defined time points after stopping protein synthesis, allowing the construction of a kinetic turnover profile from which we extrapolated a half-life value for the different CHK1 forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> A-C). The measurements revealed a severe reduction of the turnover time for the phosphomimetic CHK1 mutant as compared to the WT or the phosphoablative counterparts (half-life in hours were: CHK1-T382, 6.4 ± 1.7; CHK1-T382A 7.4 ± 1.9, CHK1-T382D, 1 ± 0.5; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Figure 8A</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Finally, we used a previously described enhanced path sampling approach to perform all-atom simulations of the folding process of the CHK1-KA1 domain. Intriguingly, this physics-based reconstruction revealed the existence of three kinetically relevant, metastable intermediates that expose the cryptic phosphosite T382 to the solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 D-E</xref>). Similarly, also for SMAD2 we found kinetically-relevant folding intermediates exposing S417 to the solvent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Figure 8B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Collectively, these results provide evidence for a regulatory mechanism by which the phosphorylation at cryptic phosphosites can occur during the folding process and affect protein homeostasis by drastically increasing degradation rate and leading to rapid turnover.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Phylogenetic analysis of human cryptic phosphorylation sites</title><p id="P11">Amino acids lying within the inner core of proteins are generally more conserved than those on the surface. The conservation stems from the critical role these residues play in maintaining the protein’s structural stability. Core residues are often involved in hydrophobic interactions that help stabilize the protein’s three-dimensional structure, making any variation at these sites more likely to disrupt the whole protein’s architecture. By contrast, surface residues tend to be more tolerant to mutations because their contribution in stabilizing the proteins’ native conformation is generally lower <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. A different pattern of evolutionary conservation has been observed across diverse proteins, where mutations in core residues often negatively affect protein expression, while variation of surface residues can alter proteins’ function and range of interactions without compromising the protein’s overall stability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Cryptic phosphosites are defined by their low RSA, a property shared with amino acids lying within the inner core of proteins. Thus, we sought to test the hypothesis that the cryptic phosphosites listed in our dataset are more evolutionary conserved than non-cryptic phosphosites. To test this hypothesis, we selected 137 representative and non-redundant eukaryotic organisms with a reference proteome deposited in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://uniprot.org">uniprot.org</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 2</xref>). Among these proteomes, we defined orthogroups by the software OrthoFinder. An orthogroup is a set of genes from different species that originated from a single gene in the last common ancestor of those species. These genes are called orthologs and usually retain similar functions across species, although they can undergo divergence over time. Orthogroups provide a framework to analyze gene evolution across species, as they include all the orthologous genes derived from the same ancestral gene. In comparative genomics, orthogroups are essential for studying functional conservation and evolutionary relationships between genes across different organisms. We performed a multiple sequence alignment only for orthogroups containing at least a human gene. Finally, we cross-referenced datasets of cryptic and non-cryptic phosphosites with the alignment of the corresponding orthogroups and calculated the entropic score (ES) for each site. ES is a metric used to express the randomness associated with a particular system, such as the evolutionary conservation of amino acids. We observed two distinct distributions for cryptic and non-cryptic phosphosites, with the former centered on lower ES values (median ES = 0.43) as compared to the latter (median ES = 0.52) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). This finding indicates that cryptic phosphosites tend to be more evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes than non-cryptic phosphosites. Importantly, the distributions of cryptic and non-cryptic phosphosites did not differ from those of all cryptic and non-cryptic residues, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supp. Figure 9</xref>). These results confirm that cryptic phosphosites share a higher evolutionary conservation with amino acids lying within the inner core of proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Several cancer-associated somatic mutations occur in cryptic phosphosites</title><p id="P12">Our data suggest that the phosphorylation of cryptic sites may influence protein expression, leading us to hypothesize that mutations in certain cryptic phosphosites could be associated with human pathologies. To explore this possibility, we conducted a cross-referencing analysis searching for cryptic phosphosites in two comprehensive datasets: COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer), which documents somatic mutations identified in human cancers, and PTMVar, a database listing disease-associated missense mutations occurring in post-translationally modified residues curated from PhosphoSitePlus. Our analysis revealed 221 mutations in COSMIC associated with cryptic phosphosites that have been annotated as cancer-related (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supp. Table 3</xref>) and 138 mutations in PTMVar linked to cancer and other human pathologies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supp. Table 4</xref>). Notably, among these entries, we identified 11 phosphomimetic substitutions that occurred in hotspot loci of tumor suppressor genes, including the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), the Von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL), and the tumor protein 53 (p53) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supp. Table 5</xref>). These findings suggest that phosphomimetic mutations occurring in cryptic phosphosites may directly contribute to increased tumor cells’ fitness by downregulating the expression or altering the function of specific tumor suppressor proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">In this work, we comprehensively analyzed the solvent accessibility of post-translationally modified residues across the human proteome. We unexpectedly found that, in contrast to other PTMs, phosphorylation can occur on residues buried within inner regions of native protein structures. Theoretical modeling of the native structural dynamics revealed that a significant fraction of the buried residues lie within the core of rigid protein sub-domains, thus are unlikely to become solvent exposed under the effects of spontaneous thermal fluctuations or protein-protein interactions. Experimental validation in model proteins confirmed that phosphomimetic substitutions at these sites decrease protein expression efficiency and drastically reduce protein half-lives. All-atom, physics-based simulations of the protein folding process performed by means of a dedicated enhanced sampling algorithm show that, at least in the representative cases we considered, the phosphorylation sites are solvent exposed exclusively in metastable folding intermediates transiently visited along productive folding routes. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses indicate that, in comparison to non-cryptic amino acids, cryptic phosphosites possess a higher evolutionarily conservation typical of residues lying within protein cores. Finally, we identified cases in which phosphomimetic mutations in human cancers at cryptic phosphosites involve specific tumor suppressors, directly indicating a mechanistic significance for this phenomenon. Overall, our findings introduce an entirely new perspective on protein expression regulation with profound biological and therapeutic implications by suggesting that the folding process of several polypeptides could be determined by phosphorylation of cryptic sites.</p><sec id="S9"><title>Dataset reliability</title><p id="P14">The reliability of our dataset is strongly corroborated by multiple lines of evidence. First, unlike other PTMs, which we found almost exclusively occurring on solvent-exposed residues, phosphorylation uniquely involves a distinct subset of amino acids showing extremely low solvent accessibility. This unique feature reinforces the concept that phosphorylation at cryptic sites follows a different accessibility mechanism, limited to folding states where these sites are temporarily exposed, such as during protein folding. The existence of cryptic phosphosites also aligns well with previous observations made in smaller datasets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Secondly, we filtered our dataset of cryptic phosphosites with further computational methods. Dynamical refinement steps were integrated to remove potential false positives, thus focusing only on PTMs lying within rigid protein domains. Despite such a stringent filtering procedure, our analyses cannot completely rule out the possibility that some cryptic sites may become accessible in particular conditions from natively folded proteins, for example as a result of conformational changes mediated by the specific interaction with other proteins. However, validation of some of our dataset’s entries through experimental assessments on selected proteins supported the predictions of our computational analyses. Finally, in contrast to solvent-exposed phosphoresidues, cryptic phosphosites show a higher evolutionary conservation typical of amino acids lying within protein cores. Such a high degree of evolutionary conservation confirms the hidden nature of cryptic phosphosites and suggests that these residues may play important roles across biological systems. Collectively, these findings underscore the robustness and reliability of our dataset, thus providing a completely new perspective on the biological regulation of thousands of phosphorylated proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Insights into SMAD2 and CHK1 biology</title><p id="P15">Our investigation into SMAD2 and CHK1 biology provides examples of the possible impact of cryptic phosphorylation on protein regulation. SMAD2 is a signaling protein involved in the TGF-β pathway, playing a key role in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and development by transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Interestingly, S417 phosphorylation has already been linked to decreased SMAD2 activity, impacting the downstream TGF-β signaling pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Our identification of S417 as a cryptic phosphosite is particularly intriguing as it suggests that this residue may function as a regulatory switch of SMAD2 expression, directly influencing TGF-β signaling. This conclusion implies that the S417 could be a unique site for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating SMAD2 activity in diseases associated with abnormal TGF-β signaling, such as cancer and fibrosis. We also found that CHK1, a kinase involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response, is regulated through phosphorylation at the cryptic sites T382. This observation aligns well with existing literature on CHK1’s regulation through phosphorylation at multiple sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, although our data suggest that phosphorylation of T382 is sufficient for re-routing the protein to degradation. Finally, computational simulations provide evidence that both S417 in SMAD2 and T382 in CHK1 are exposed to the solvent in specific intermediate states populated along their folding pathways. These findings directly support a model by which the expression of SMAD2 and CHK1 may be dynamically regulated during their folding pathway by phosphorylation at the corresponding cryptic phosphosites.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Phosphorylation as a co-translational event</title><p id="P16">Our research sheds light on a potential mechanism whereby phosphorylation at cryptic sites may occur as a co-translational event, adding a fresh perspective to our understanding of protein chemical modifications. Typically, phosphorylation requires exposed residues on the surface of natively folded proteins. Cryptic phosphosites provide a radically different paradigm where residues are modified while proteins are still in the folding process. Such a transient accessibility during folding exposes cryptic residues to kinases with specific spatial and kinetic constraints dictated by the folding process itself. In this framework, other factors like chaperons participating in the folding pathway may play fundamental roles in regulating the accessibility of cryptic sites to the modifying enzymes. Indeed, the existence of ribosome-associated kinases and phosphatases suggests the possibility that these enzymes may directly modify nascent polypeptide chains during translation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. This conclusion supports the notion that specific cryptic phosphosites could be part of a co-translational protein regulation machinery. Interestingly, phosphorylation at cryptic sites could produce effects that go beyond the simple negative regulation of protein expression. While the cryptic phosphorylation cases investigated in this manuscript are primarily associated with destabilizing effects, leading to increased protein degradation, we cannot exclude that in several cases cryptic phosphorylation could positively affect protein folding, stability, or reroute the folding pathway toward alternative conformations. For example, phosphorylation of a cryptic site could favor recruitment of chaperons or phosphorylation reading modules expanding the conformational landscape of the protein, as already observed for the cochaperone Cdc37 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Overall, these conclusions support a previously unappreciated role for phosphorylation in the co-translational fine-tuning of protein expression and stability.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Relevance of cryptic phosphosites in physiology and therapy</title><p id="P17">It is appealing to hypothesize that cryptic phosphorylation may serve as an intrinsic quality control mechanism to prevent the accumulation of misfolded proteins, acting as a safeguard in the protein folding process. This regulatory strategy could selectively tag proteins for degradation before they achieve their mature conformation, ensuring that defective or improperly folded proteins do not accumulate and disrupt cellular homeostasis. In this scenario, cryptic phosphosites could thus represent critical kinetic control points within the folding pathway. During the normal folding process, cryptic phosphosites may remain only briefly exposed by folding intermediates, escaping modification by kinases. However, in the case of incorrect or stalled folding, folding intermediates may linger in their partially folded states, prolonging the exposure of cryptic phosphosites. This extended availability would allow kinases to phosphorylate the exposed residues, effectively marking the protein as defective. The phosphorylation of cryptic sites in improperly folded polypeptides could thus serve as a co-translational signal for cellular degradation pathways such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system or autophagy. This process would ensure that faulty proteins are efficiently cleared before aggregating or interfering with cellular functions. Importantly, this hypothesis introduces a kinetic dimension to protein quality control, where the timing and dynamics of folding intermediates become integral to the decision-making process of protein fate. This framework also raises intriguing questions about the interplay between folding kinetics, kinase activity, and degradation pathways. For example, could specific kinases act as “sensors” of misfolded states by targeting cryptic phosphosites exposed during aberrant folding events? Additionally, might cryptic phosphorylation serve as a degradation signal and a means to reroute folding intermediates back toward productive folding pathways under certain conditions? Cryptic phosphorylation as a kinetic checkpoint provides a compelling model for how cells might exploit transient structural features of folding intermediates to maintain proteostasis.</p><p id="P18">Our findings also reveal an intriguing link between cryptic phosphosites and cancer. By cross-referencing our dataset of cryptic phosphosites with somatic mutations catalogued in the COSMIC and PTMVar datasets, we identified hundreds of mutations in cryptic phosphosites annotated as disease-related. Notably, some of these mutations are phosphomimetic substitutions, in which amino acids with similar charge characteristics to phosphorylated residues replace cryptic phosphosites. Such a substitution pattern in tumor-suppressor genes directly suggests a possible adaptive advantage in certain cancers, where cryptic phosphosite mutations may reduce protein expression or function, thus enhancing tumor fitness.</p><p id="P19">The possibility of using advanced path sampling algorithms to accurately predict protein folding mechanisms with an atomic level of resolution and identify the on-pathway folding intermediates has already been exploited to develop a new approach for rational drug discovery termed pharmacological protein inactivation by folding intermediate targeting (PPI-FIT) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. This scheme is based on identifying small molecules that selectively bind to pockets that are transiently solvent-exposed only in on-pathway folding intermediates but become buried in the native state, in close analogy with cryptic phosphosites. The interaction of a small ligand with a folding intermediate prevents the completion of the folding process, thus triggering the protein quality control machinery to send the polypeptide to degradation. The identification of cryptic phosphosites provides an additional perspective to this therapeutic paradigm. Cryptic phosphorylation could directly affect our understanding of diseases associated with protein misfolding and aggregation, offering novel therapeutic angles for conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, where the balance between proper folding and degradation is altered. Many cancers exhibit dysregulated protein expression and stability, and targeting cryptic phosphosites could be a promising strategy to selectively degrade oncogenic proteins or proteins involved in cancer cell survival pathways.</p><p id="P20">In summary, our study establishes cryptic phosphosites as critical regulators of protein expression and highlights their potential as therapeutic targets across a wide spectrum of human diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Assembly of the cryptic phosphosites library</title><p id="P21">To analyze PTM sites within the human proteome we extracted structural data from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database in the form of PDB files.

While this time window is small when compared to the inverse rate of many protein conformational reactions, it is sufficiently long to explore possible local rearrangements leading to an increase in solvent exposure. Simulations were conducted with Gromacs 2018.6 and Gromacs 2024.software, using the Charmm36m force field <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> in explicit TIP3P water.

We enforced charge neutrality by adding the appropriate number of counterions to reach a final concentration of 150 mM NaCl. We performed energy minimization via the steepest descent method, followed by equilibration under constant volume and temperature (NVT) for 200 picoseconds (ps) at 310 K, and then constant pressure and temperature (NPT) equilibration for another 200 ps. In both equilibrations we used the V-rescale thermostat <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> at 310 K and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat at 1 bar <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.

In practice, however, the applicability of plain MD simulations to protein folding is hindered by the fact that biopolymers are frustrated systems and that completing the protein folding reaction involves overcoming entropy-driven free-energy barriers of many units of thermal energy, k<sub>B</sub>T. As a consequence, even generating a single productive folding trajectory would typically require integrating the equations of motion for o(10<sup>6</sup>) particles for 10<sup>12</sup>-10<sup>15</sup> time steps. Unfortunately, these numbers are several orders of magnitude larger than those accessible even to the most powerful special-purpose supercomputer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.

In principle, the resulting dataset may contain several false positives. Indeed, phosphosites that appear to be buried in the static PDB structure may become solvent-exposed during thermal oscillations. To exclude these false positives from the initial dataset of cryptic phosphosites, we performed a dynamical analysis based on the SPECTRUS package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. This software exploits a specific elastic network model to efficiently characterize structural fluctuations in the native state via normal mode analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. By comparing the relative weights of the normal modes, SPECTRUS infers alternative decompositions of the protein structure in quasi-rigid subdomains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. These alternative decompositions are then ranked according to a quality score that pinpoints significant subdivisions based on the balance of intra- and inter-domain distance fluctuations compared to a random reference case <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Since normal mode analysis is ill defined in unstructured regions, we preliminarily removed low-confidence segments from our initial protein dataset, typically loops, linkers or short disorders regions, having an AlphaFold score lower than 65. The resulting dataset included individual protein domains or contiguous domains considered as a single entry if they had at least 5 residues within 5 Å from each other. Cryptic phosphosites lying within protein domains encompassing less than 40 residues were excluded from the analysis, due to the low reliability of normal-mode analysis to characterize the internal dynamics of short polypeptides. The RSA value of cryptic phosphosites was then re-calculated on the new set of entries, filtering out residues showing a new RSA value higher than 0.15. Finally, SPECTRUS identified quasi-rigid domains among the new protein dataset by generating β-Gaussian models for each entry and performing a spectral decomposition based on such model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Cryptic phosphosites lying within quasi-rigid domains belonging to the subdivision with the highest SPECTRUS relative quality score were eliminated when their side chain made less than 80% of intra-domain contacts.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Plasmids</title><p id="P34">All expression plasmids were purchased from VectorBuilder.

Cells were maintained in 100 mm Petri dishes, with routine subculturing every 3-4 days. To ensure consistency in experimental conditions, the cells used in the experiments were not passed more than 15 times. HEK293 cell line was obtained from ATCC (ATCC CRL-1573). Flp-In T-REx 293 cells, obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific (R78007), were cultured with medium containing 100 μg/mL zeocin (InvivoGen, ant-zn-1) and 10 μg/mL blasticidin (InvivoGen, ant-bl-1) for selection and maintenance. All plasmids were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were selected with the appropriate selection medium (200 μg/mL hygromycin for CHK1 constructs, 100 μg/mL hygromycin, and 10 μg/mL blasticidin for PYST-1 and SMAD2) until stable pools were obtained. Cells were then counted and seeded in 100 mm Petri dishes at a very low confluence (∼100-200 cells per dish) and maintained in a selection medium, which was changed every 2-3 days, until cellular clones were clearly visible by eye. By using a pipette tip each clone was scraped from the dish and moved to a 48-well plate first, and a 6-well later, for recovery and expansion. Once clones were stabilized, they were frozen and stored at -80 °C or liquid nitrogen tanks. Doxycycline, acquired in powdered form (Sigma-Aldrich, D9891), was dissolved in sterile-filtered water to create a 100 mg/mL stock solution. Dilutions were made to obtain single use aliquots of 1 mg/mL. All solutions were kept at -20°C. Further dilutions produced in single-use aliquots of 1 mg/mL were stored at -20°C. Treatment with doxycycline entailed diluting the stock solution in the medium before applying it to the cells, ensuring accurate dosage. Cycloheximide, obtained in powdered form (Sigma-Aldrich, 239763-M), was dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 50 mg/mL and subsequently aliquoted for storage. These aliquots were preserved at -20°C.

Samples were then heated at 95 °C for 8 minutes to ensure denaturation. Proteins were resolved according to their molecular weights under denaturing conditions using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). All the samples were loaded into pre-cast gels (Bio-Rad, Any kD™ Criterion™ TGX Stain-Free™ Protein Gels, #5678124/#5671125) and subsequently electro-transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes employing the Trans-Blot Turbo RTA Mini 0.45 μm LF Transfer Kit (Bio-Rad, #1704274). To prevent non-specific binding, membranes were incubated for 30-60 minutes in a blocking solution consisting of 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween (TBST). Blots were incubated with the primary antibody (anti-FLAG M2, code F1804, Sigma-Aldrich diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution) overnight at 4°C. Membranes were then washed three times with TBST, each lasting 10 minutes. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat polyclonal HRP Anti-mouse, code 115-035-003, Jackson ImmunoResearch, diluted 1:10.000 in blocking solution) for 1 hour at room temperature. After three additional washes with TBST and a final rinse with Milli-Q water, detection of the protein bands was achieved using either the Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Kit (GE Healthcare, #RPN2232) or the Amersham™ ECL Select™ Western Blotting Detection Reagent (#RPN2235), depending on the required signal intensity. Visualization of the signals was performed using the ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad). The final quantification of protein loads was achieved through densitometric analysis of the corresponding western blot bands. Each signal was normalized against the corresponding total protein lane, determined utilizing the enhanced tryptophan fluorescence technology of stain-free gels (Bio-Rad). For SMAD2 and PYST1, for which we observed no leakage of the inducible promoter, each signal was further divided by the loading reference to control image exposure, allowing the cross-comparison of different gels. For CHK1, for which we detected expression leakage in almost all expressing clones, signals were normalized on the corresponding non-induced controls.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Phylogenetic analyses</title><p id="P37">To perform a comparative genomics study of cryptic phosphosites, we utilized OrthoFinder2, a robust platform for comparative genomic analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.

PTMs, were cross-referenced with protein structures from DeepMind’s AlphaFold database. This approach matched each PTM entry from PhosphoSitePlus to its corresponding protein structure in AlphaFold. The analysis focused on PTMs within structured regions, specifically those with an AlphaFold confidence score (pLDDT) exceeding 65.

Scatter plots reporting the relative expression levels of clones for each individual construct: for SMAD2, S417 (WT), S417A (phosphoablative mutant), and S417E (phosphomimetic mutant); for CHK1, T382 (WT), T382A (phosphoablative mutant), and T382D (phosphomimetic mutant); for PYST1, S300 (WT), S300A (phosphoablative mutant), and S300E (phosphomimetic mutant). All the protein variants were tagged with the FLAG epitope to facilitate quantification. The expression of each clone was assessed by western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. For SMAD2 and PYST1, protein levels in the different clones were expressed as the ratio of corresponding protein lanes in the induced samples (I) and a reference control (R) to allow cross-comparison among different gels. For CHK1, we observed leakage in the non-induced controls of expressing clones. Therefore, each signal was expressed as the ratio between induced (I) and non-induced (NI) signals. Samples showing a negative ratio were set to 1. Statistically differences were evaluated by a multiple Mann–Whitney U test: for SMAD2, WT vs S417A, p = 0.11626, WT vs S417E, p = 0.00001 (****), S417A vs S417E, p = 0.00001 (****); for CHK1, WT vs T382A, p = 0.14486, WT vs T382D, p = 0.08444, T382A vs T382D, p = 0.00555 (*); for PYST1, WT vs S300A, p = 0.58915, WT vs S300E, p = 0.16544, S300A vs S300E, p = 0.48166.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201708-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Experimental and computational investigation of cryptic phosphosite T382 in CHK1.</title><p><bold>A-C</bold>. CHK1 stability was analyzed in three selected clones expressing CHK1 variants at codon T382: WT T382 (A), phosphoablative mutant T382A (B), and phosphomimetic mutant T382D (C). After doxycycline induction (72 h, 1 μg/mL), protein synthesis was stopped with cycloheximide (CHX) and CHK1 levels were monitored at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 h using western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody; β-actin signal served as loading control. For each time point ≥3 biological replicates were produced (except for the T382D clone at 16 h, where only one replicate was obtained). Panels (i) display representative western blots for each CHK1 form, detected with an anti-FLAG antibody. Panel (ii) illustrates the quantified data (mean ± standard deviation), normalized to the baseline level (t<sub>0</sub>). The degradation kinetics were modelled using a one-phase decay curve from which half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) values were derived. Data analysis and curve fitting were performed using the GraphPad Prism software. <bold>D</bold>. The plot on the left shows the atomistic reconstruction of the CHK1 KA1 domain folding pathway. Lower-bound approximation of the transition path energy is related to the folding of KA1. The energy is plotted as the negative logarithm of the probability distribution (-ln(p)), which is expressed as a function of the collective variables Q and RMSD (65×65 bin matrix). Gaussian blur was applied. The highly populated native state appears as expected in the bottom-right corner (high Q and low RMSD). The indexed squares define the most-populated partially unfolded regions of interest (-ln(p)). Well thresholds from most to least stable: A≤ 2.5 kBT, B≤ 3.5 kBT, C≤ 3.5 kBT, D≤ 3 kBT).
