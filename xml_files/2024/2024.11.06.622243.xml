Melanocortin-2 receptor accessory protein-2 (MRAP2) is a single transmembrane protein that interacts with MC4R to potentiate it’s signalling, and human mutations in MRAP2 cause obesity. Previous studies have been unable to consistently show whether MRAP2 affects MC3R activity. Here we used single-molecule pull-down (SiMPull) to confirm that MC3R and MRAP2 interact in HEK293 cells. Analysis of fluorescent photobleaching steps showed that MC3R and MRAP2 readily form heterodimers most commonly with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Human single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics show MRAP2 is co-expressed with MC3R in hypothalamic neurons with important roles in energy homeostasis and appetite control. Functional analyses showed MRAP2 enhances MC3R cAMP signalling, impairs β-arrestin recruitment, and reduces internalization in HEK293 cells. Structural homology models revealed putative interactions between the two proteins and alanine mutagenesis of five MRAP2 and three MC3R transmembrane residues significantly reduced MRAP2 effects on MC3R signalling. Finally, we showed genetic variants in MRAP2 that have been identified in individuals that are overweight or obese prevent MRAP2’s enhancement of MC3R-driven signalling. Thus, these studies reveal MRAP2 as an important regulator of MC3R function and provide further evidence for the crucial role of MRAP2 in energy homeostasis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The melanocortin receptor-2 accessory protein 2 (MRAP2) is a single-pass transmembrane protein that modulates the function of several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in the hypothalamus that regulate food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). These GPCRs include melanocortin receptor-4 (MC4R), a central regulator of appetite, inactivating mutations of which are the most common genetic cause of obesity, and the receptor for ghrelin (growth hormone secretagogue receptor, GHSR), which enhances appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Similarly to MC4R, human genetic variants in MRAP2 have been identified in several families and individuals with obesity and reduce MC4R activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). MRAP2 was identified as a homolog of MRAP1, an accessory protein that is essential for the cell-surface expression and ligand responsiveness of melanocortin receptor-2 (MC2R), which regulates adrenal development and steroidogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Unlike MRAP1, the MRAP2 protein is not essential for GPCR expression at the cell surface. However, MRAP2 enhances MC4R expression at neuronal primary cilia, a microtubule-based organelle with a vital role in appetite regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), suggesting that MRAP2 may establish signaling hubs that favour receptor signaling.</p><p id="P3">Deletion of the MRAP2 gene from mice on a variety of genetic backgrounds is associated with extreme obesity, increased fat mass and visceral adiposity, analogous to MC4R knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Double knockouts of MRAP2 and MC4R demonstrate that MRAP2 facilitates the action of MC4R, but that there are also MC4R-independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). MRAP2 mice lack the early-onset hyperphagia of MC4R knockout mice, and humans with MRAP2 genetic variants exhibit hyperglycaemia, hypertension and high blood cholesterol more frequently than those with MC4R mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). This is consistent with studies showing that MRAP2 can modulate the signaling profile of several GPCRs involved in energy homeostasis. Thus, MRAP2 enhances signaling by MC4R and the ghrelin receptor, while it suppresses the activity of the prokineticin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), orexin receptor-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and melanin concentrating hormone receptor-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). One study identified &gt;40 putative binding partners for MRAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>); however, signaling data was not provided for most receptors, and some had previously been described as non-interacting proteins, therefore further work is required to validate these findings. Additionally, while several studies have shown that MC4R signaling is impaired by some MRAP2 genetic variants identified in overweight or obese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), their effect on signaling by other MRAP2 interacting proteins remains to be explored.</p><p id="P4">Co-immunoprecipitation studies have shown that MRAP2 can interact with all five members of the melanocortin receptor family when overexpressed in cell-lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). MC3R is a negative regulator of the central melanocortin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). It is required for the normal activation of AgRP neurons in response to nutritional deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Deletion of MRAP2 from AgRP neurons also blunts their fasting-induced activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), similarly to MC3R, and it has been hypothesized that a complex signaling system may exist between MC3R, MRAP2 and other receptors at these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). There is some evidence that MC3R may interact with MRAP2, although this is inconclusive. MRAP2 coimmunoprecipitates with MC3R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) and enhances ciliary expression of the receptor in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). However, co-expression of MC3R and MRAP2 has been shown to reduce cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), enhance signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), or have no effect on signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). This motivates a more comprehensive examination of the effect of MRAP2 on MC3R activity. Such inconsistencies are common in the MRAP2 literature, including for MC4R, with MRAP2 initially described to reduce MC4R cell surface expression and impair it’s signaling, then later shown to increase MC4R function, consistent with mouse knockout studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). These discrepancies are likely due to large variations in studies seeking to investigate MRAP2 function. These include overexpressing MRAP2 at DNA ratios of 3-20x that of GPCR, although no rationale is provided for these experimental decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). As such, these high concentrations of MRAP2 could lead to overexpression artefacts and false positive results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). A recent preprint demonstrated that MRAP2 is still capable of enhancing MC4R signaling when the two proteins are expressed at equal concentrations, and that MRAP2 overexpression may affect GPCR oligomer assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), indicating that studies of equal concentrations of MRAP2 and GPCRs are required to ensure that molecular details are not missed.</p><p id="P5">MRAP2 facilitates signaling by some GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) and suppresses responses by other receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Studies focussed predominantly on the ghrelin receptor have elucidated several mechanisms by which MRAP2 may enhance signaling. These include a reduced ability to recruit β-arrestin proteins albeit with no change in receptor cell surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). A similar mechanism has been suggested for the Prokineticin Receptor-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) and MC4R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Additionally, MRAP2 biases GHSR signaling to reduce Rho activation, enhances G protein coupling of MC4R, and may reduce MC4R oligomerization that can suppress receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). The structural regions involved in MRAP2 interaction with GPCRs remain largely unexplored. MC4R homology models based on the cryo-EM structure of the MC2R-MRAP1 complex suggest that MRAP2 may interact with transmembrane helix (TM)-5 or TM6, but no mechanistic studies were performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Additionally, while large truncation mutations (e.g. deletion of the transmembrane region, deletion of the C-tail) of MRAP2 show loss of interaction or impaired signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), these do not provide insights into the specific residues involved or their mechanisms of action.</p><p id="P6">Here we examined the effect of MRAP2 on MC3R activity in HEK293 cells. We demonstrated that MRAP2 interacts with MC3R in a 1:1 dimer to enhance cAMP signaling, reduce β-arrestin recruitment and impair receptor internalization. Structural homology models and alanine mutagenesis identified critical residues important for the interaction. Finally, we demonstrated that MRAP2 variants identified in individuals that are overweight or obese reduce MC3R signaling and enhance receptor internalization.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>MRAP2 is colocalised with MC3R in neurons involved in energy homeostasis</title><p id="P7">Previous studies have been unable to determine whether MRAP2 interacts with MC3R to influence receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). As co-expression in the same cells is a requirement for biologically relevant MC3R-MRAP2 interactions, we first assessed expression of the transcripts encoding MC3R and MRAP2 proteins in HYPOMAP, a single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) and spatial transcriptomic atlas of the human hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). snRNA-seq data allowed quantification of the expression of the two genes in neuronal cells. MRAP2 was expressed in ~35% of all neuronal cells and was detected in 57% of MC3R-positive neurons indicating that the two proteins have some co-expression in physiologically relevant cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). By comparison, in HYPOMAP, MRAP2 was detected in 53% of MC4R-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Visium spatial transcriptomics revealed that MRAP2 is expressed throughout the hypothalamus, particularly in regions where there is greater neuronal density, whereas MC3R expression is more restricted to the arcuate nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamus and periventricular region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). MRAP2 transcripts are present under the same spatially barcoded spots as <italic>MC3R</italic> transcripts in these regions, which are known to have important roles in energy homeostasis and appetite control.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>MRAP2 interacts with MC3R</title><p id="P8">Our studies have shown that MC3R colocalises with MRAP2 in hypothalamic neurons that are known to regulate energy homeostasis. To determine whether MC3R and MRAP2 are likely to interact we first assessed protein proximity in transiently transfected HEK293 cells using the NanoBiT split-luciferase system with both proteins tagged at the C-terminus. There was increased luminescence observed in cells co-expressing MC3R and MRAP2 (100 ng each) compared to cells expressing MC3R and the negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar luminescence values were observed in cells transfected with either iteration of NanoBiT tags (i.e. LgC-MC3R and SmC-MRAP2 or SmC-MC3R and LgC-MRAP2). Saturation curves were performed in which a fixed amount of MC3R (100 ng) was transfected with increasing concentrations of MRAP2. This showed a hyperbolic increase in the luminescence indicating the signal is unlikely to be due to random collisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Co-transfection of cells with untagged MRAP2 to compete with SmC/LgC-MRAP2 reduced NanoBiT luminescence values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), providing further evidence that the two proteins may interact.</p><p id="P9">Although NanoBiT assays can indicate proximity between proteins, these assays do not measure interactions with single complex precision and cannot accurately measure stoichiometry. To assess this and verify the interaction, we used the single-molecule pull-down (SiMPull) technique, which has previously been used to assess heteromeric GPCR complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We generated MC3R and MRAP2 constructs with N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) or FLAG epitopes followed by a SNAP, Halo or CLIP tag amenable to labelling with organic dyes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), and demonstrated that MC3R maintained receptor function, MC3R and MRAP2 colocalized in cells when transiently transfected and MRAP2 could enhance signaling by a known interacting receptor, MC4R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). We first used SiMPull to determine the expression and stoichiometry of MC3R homomers. Cells were transfected with HA-Halo-MC3R and labelled with membrane impermeable CA-Sulfo646 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), then cells were lysed, receptors immobilized by anti-HA antibodies and single molecules imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. The majority of molecules showed single bleaching steps (~83%), while approximately 15% had two steps per molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-D</xref>), indicating that most MC3R is monomeric at the cell surface. In the absence of anti-HA antibodies very few molecules (6 molecules across 5 images) were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). We also examined MRAP2 stoichiometry by SiMPull as it has been described to form homodimers or higher-order oligomers in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). We first verified that the known dimeric GPCR mGluR2 produced single-molecules with two photobleaching steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Cells were then transfected with HA-Halo-MRAP2, labelled with CA-Sulfo646 and imaged. MRAP2 showed single bleaching steps in ~68% of molecules, while ~28% had two bleaching steps, indicating some dimer formation may occur. A small number of molecules (&lt;5%) had three or four bleaching steps corresponding to higher-order oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E-G</xref>). Therefore, MRAP2 primarily forms stable monomers or dimers when expressed alone.</p><p id="P10">To assess MC3R and MRAP2 heteromers, HA-Halo-MC3R and FLAG-CLIP-MRAP2 were transfected in HEK293 cells and Halo and CLIP tags labelled with CA-Sulfo646 and BC-DY547 fluorophores, respectively, prior to lysis. Receptors were immobilized by anti-HA antibodies and fluorescence co-localization was assessed. In the absence of MC3R, there were negligible single molecules observed (13 molecules across 5 images) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). In co-transfected cells, co-localization was present in almost 30% of MC3R spots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Photobleaching step analysis showed 1-step each for MC3R and MRAP2 in ~74% of co-localized spots, while some 2- and 3-step bleaching was observed for MRAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I-J</xref>). Less than 5% of spots showed two MC3R and two MRAP2 bleaching steps. To verify these findings the SiMPull experiments were repeated with the Halo and CLIP labels swapped. Thus, cells were transfected with HA-Halo-MRAP2 and FLAG-CLIP-MC3R, then labeled and imaged as described. FLAG-CLIP-MC3R expression alone produced few single molecules (24 molecules across 5 images) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). These studies had a similar total number of co-localized spots (~32% of receptor spots). Bleaching step analysis of these spots showed 63% had one MC3R and one MRAP2 step, while 21% had two MRAP2 steps, ~7% had 3 steps for MRAP2, and ~7.5% had two steps each for MC3R and MRAP2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). In contrast, MRAP2 did not pull-down or colocalize with SSTR3, a receptor that is not known to interact with MRAP2 and whose signaling is not enhanced by MRAP2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). These studies indicate that MC3R is more likely to interact with MRAP2 in a 1:1 stoichiometry but can interact with more than one MRAP2 molecule.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>MRAP2 increases MC3R signaling</title><p id="P11">Previous studies have provided conflicting data regarding whether MRAP2 affects MC3R signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). As our SiMPull data indicates that MRAP2 interacts with MC3R in a 1:1 stoichiometry, and there is no evidence that high concentrations of MRAP2 are required for its effects on MC3R, we performed our assays with equal concentrations of DNA. MC3R-induced increases in cAMP (assessed by Glosensor assays) were observed in cells expressing equal concentrations of MC3R and MRAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). This effect was retained when transfecting as little as 25 ng of MC3R and MRAP2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>) and therefore subsequent studies were performed using 25 ng of each plasmid to reduce overexpression artefacts. The endogenous antagonist AgRP was still able to inhibit MC3R activity in the presence of MRAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). MRAP2 had no effect on MC3R cell surface expression when assessed using cell impermeable SNAP-647 labelling and fluorescence quantification or ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Identification of residues required for MC3R and MRAP2 interactions</title><p id="P12">To understand how MRAP2 may interact with and facilitate MC3R signaling we used AlphaFold2 to predict structural homology models. We first predicted the structure of MC3R and MRAP2 in a 1:1 stoichiometry as the SiMPull data indicated this was the most common form of the heterodimer. Of the five predicted models, one had multiple side chain collisions that could not be reduced with model refinement, and large unstructured regions, and therefore was not further assessed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). The other four models had a high confidence threshold, and predicted MRAP2 interacts with TM5-TM6 of MC3R, regions that are known to have an important role in receptor activation and G protein coupling to MC3R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). The models predicted that MRAP2 may insert within the membrane in two orientations (i.e. an extracellular N-terminus in two models and intracellular in the other models), consistent with previous studies that indicated that MRAP2 may insert in this orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). The model ranked with the highest confidence (Model 1) contained more structured regions than the other models, including a loop close to the ligand-binding pocket of MC3R and a helical structure in the juxtamembrane G protein-binding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), similar to that observed in the MC2R-MRAP1 cryo-EM model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Models 1-4 were assessed to determine all possible contacts between MRAP2 and MC3R, which identified twenty-two possible interactions observed in at least one model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). We hypothesized that those residues identified in ≥3 models are more likely to be genuine contacts and therefore performed alanine mutagenesis of these residues in the FLAG-MRAP2 construct to determine whether they affect MC3R activity. We additionally assessed one residue (T68) located in the TM region close to these other residues that was predicted to form contacts in two models.

Mutation of K42, W50, L53, F61 and L64 reduced MC3R-induced responses such that they were indistinguishable from MC3R responses in the absence of MRAP2.

Alanine mutagenesis was performed on three MC3R residues, Thr245 (TM6), Leu260 (TM6), Pro272 (TM7), and the effect on cAMP signaling first assessed in the absence of MRAP2. Mutagenesis of the three residues had no effect on MC3R cell surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>), and the Thr245Ala and Pro272Ala MC3R variants had no effect on agonist-induced responses in the absence of MRAP2. Leu260Ala reduced MC3R signaling and therefore this residue may have a role in MC3R activation that is distinct from MRAP2-induced effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Addition of MRAP2 did not further enhance MC3R-induced signaling by any residue above MRAP2-WT responses indicating that all three may contribute to MC3R-MRAP2 interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p id="P15">As previous studies have suggested that dimeric MRAP2 interacts with MC3R, we also performed AlphaFold2 structural homology modelling with one MC3R and two MRAP2 residues.

As this correlated with the SiMPull data that indicated binding of monomeric MRAP2 is preferential, we did not investigate these models in further detail.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>MRAP2 increases MC3R internalization</title><p id="P16">Previous studies have shown that MRAP2 enhances GPCR signaling by impairing β-arrestin recruitment and consequently reducing receptor internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). To determine whether MRAP2 uses a similar mechanism to enhance MC3R signaling, bystander BRET assays were performed measuring proximity between Nluc-tagged β-arrestin-2 and Venus-tagged Kras, a marker of the plasma membrane, in the presence of MC3R. BRET was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner in all cells although responses were significantly reduced in MRAP2 transfected cells when compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). This suggests that MRAP2 impairs MC3R-mediated β-arrestin-2 recruitment and to further investigate this we assessed β-arrestin-2-YFP expression in MC3R expressing cells by SIM imaging. Under basal conditions β-arrestin-2 is distributed across the cytoplasm in cells expressing MRAP2 or pcDNA control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). In the presence of agonist, β-arrestin-2 is recruited to the plasma membrane rapidly in control cells. In cells expressing MRAP2, β-arrestin-2-YFP forms punctate structures, but plasma membrane recruitment is only apparent following 20 minutes exposure to agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p id="P17">As MRAP2 impaired MC3R-induced β-arrestin-2 recruitment to the plasma membrane it was hypothesized that MRAP2 would reduce receptor internalization. To assess this, cells were transfected with CLIP-MC3R, labeled with cell impermeable BC-DY547, then the amount of surface labelled receptor quantified following exposure to vehicle or agonist for 30 minutes in 96-well plates. Surface labeling of MC3R was reduced following exposure to ligand, consistent with agonist-induced internalization of the receptor. When the percentage difference was quantified, there was a significantly greater internalization in control cells than MRAP2 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). To assess internalization in more detail cells were transfected with HA-HALO-MC3R and incubated with an HA antibody and either vehicle or NDP-MSH for 30 minutes, then imaged by SIM. Endocytosis of fluorescently-labeled MC3R was apparent in control and MRAP2 expressing cells exposed to ligand, although there appeared to be more internalized receptor in cells transfected with MC3R without MRAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). When the number of vesicles was quantified, MRAP2 expressing cells had fewer vesicles in both vehicle and NDP-MSH treated cells when compared to cells expressing empty vector, indicating that both constitutive and agonist-driven MC3R internalization is reduced by MRAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Consistent with reduced internalization, there was significantly less colocalization between the early endosome marker Rab5 and MC3R in MRAP2 expressing cells when assessed by SIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F-G</xref>) in both vehicle and agonist exposed cells. Thus, MRAP2 impairs both constitutive and agonist-driven MC3R internalization.</p><p id="P18">These studies suggest that MRAP2 may enhance MC3R signaling by retaining the receptor at the cell surface due to reduced internalization. To assess whether blocking MC3R internalization results in an increase in receptor signaling, cells were pre-treated with Dyngo-4a, which impairs clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>), then signaling assessed by cAMP Glosensor assays. Impairment of internalization enhanced MC3R-induced cAMP responses in cells expressing pcDNA, such that these were no longer different to MRAP2 responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>). Pre-treatment of MRAP2 expressing cells with Dyngo-4a had no effect on MRAP2 responses. This suggests impaired receptor internalization is one mechanism by which MRAP2 enhances GPCR signaling.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Obesity-associated variants in MRAP2 impair MC3R function</title><p id="P19">Previous studies have identified associations between MRAP2 genetic variants and obesity, hypertension and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). It is possible that these variants may affect the function of other GPCRs that MRAP2 associates with, and we therefore examined MC3R function in HEK293 cells expressing twelve different MRAP2 human variants. The twelve MRAP2 variants were selected based on their predicted location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>) either in the N-terminal ligand-binding region (G31V, P32L), transmembrane domain (F62C), C-terminal unstructured region (N88Y, V91A) or C-terminal helical structure within the G protein binding region (R113G, S114A, L115V, N121S, R125C, H133Y, T193A). The variants had no significant effect on MC3R expression at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>). The G31V and P32L variants were not predicted to affect interactions with MC3R in the AlphaFold2 models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>) and had no effect on MC3R-mediated cAMP responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). MRAP2-F62 forms backbone interactions with other residues within the MRAP2 transmembrane helix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). The variant MRAP2-F62C significantly impaired MC3R-mediated cAMP responses such that they are not significantly different to cells expressing pcDNA. MRAP2-N88Y also significantly reduced MC3R-mediated cAMP responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). The R113G and S114A variants were predicted to lose contacts with adjacent MC3R and MRAP2 residues, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>), and significantly impaired MC3R-induced cAMP signaling, as did the neighbouring L115V variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F-G</xref>). Similarly, three other variants within the MRAP2 C-terminus (N121S, R125C, T193A) also significantly reduced MC3R activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7H-I</xref>).</p><p id="P20">The effect of the variants on MC3R internalization was examined by labeling cells with SNAP-surface-647 following exposure to vehicle or agonist for 30 minutes and quantifying the surface labeling. Fluorescence was reduced in all cells, consistent with agonist-induced internalization. Most variants had a similar effect on MC3R internalization as the wild-type MRAP2 protein (i.e. significantly decreased internalization compared to pcDNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7J</xref>). Two MRAP2 variants, S114A and L115V, had internalization levels that were significantly different to MRAP2 wild-type and instead had similar internalization to that observed in cells transfected with pcDNA, indicating that these variants impair the effects of MRAP2 on internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7J</xref>). Three variants, N88S, R113G and N121S, had an intermediate profile which was not significantly different to pcDNA or MRAP2 wild-type, indicating that these may partially impair MRAP2’s effect on internalization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">Our studies have shown that MRAP2 interacts with MC3R to enhance signaling and expands the repertoire of receptors that have been robustly demonstrated to interact with MRAP2. While MRAP2 has been described to interact with &gt;40 GPCRs, signaling data has not been provided for most receptors, and often the data is not replicable between different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). In contrast, our data provides multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that MRAP2 facilitates MC3R signaling. Firstly, we have shown that MC3R and MRAP2 are co-expressed in human neurons that regulate energy homeostasis and food intake, and that the proportion of neurons that co-express MC3R and MRAP2 is similar to MC4R and MRAP2 co-expression, which are widely accepted to interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Secondly, the two proteins interact at the single-molecule level, and MRAP2 enhances signaling at low levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Thirdly, disruption of putative interacting residues impairs MRAP2-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Fourthly, MRAP2 uses similar mechanisms to those described for other receptors to impair β-arrestin recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Finally, human variants in the MRAP2 transmembrane domain and C-terminus implicated in receptor interactions impair signaling and affect internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, we are confident that MC3R and MRAP2 form heterodimers that contribute to MC3R function.</p><p id="P22">Several groups have shown that MRAP2 may form dimers at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), and this has led to the assumption that MRAP2 exists in a dimeric form at the membrane which is necessary for its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). However, studies of MRAP2 dimerization examined the protein in isolation and therefore the effect of co-transfected GPCRs and heterodimer stoichiometry on MRAP2 were not established. Our SiMPull experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) show that MRAP2 can form dimers at the cell surface, consistent with previous studies, although, monomeric MRAP2 is more prevalent. Moreover, when co-expressed with receptor, most complexes comprise one MC3R molecule interacting with monomeric MRAP2. Consistent with this stoichiometry, our structural homology models similarly predicted binding by monomeric MRAP2, and published structures of MC2R and MRAP1 also have a 1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). It is possible that in an environment in which GPCR expression is low, MRAP2 may form dimers at the membrane, but when co-expressed with GPCRs it favours heterodimerization with the receptor in a monomeric form. However, our SiMPull analyses demonstrated a sizable proportion of MRAP2 is in a monomeric form at cell surfaces when the cells were transfected only with HALO-MRAP2, and therefore it is likely that there are both monomers and dimers at the cell surface, although our choice of detergent could have impacted these quantities. Our cell surface labeling strategy with membrane impermeable dyes would also not be able to detect MRAP2 inserted in a C-terminal out orientation, and therefore we cannot discount that these dimers may also form. Examination of additional complexes will be required to determine whether this 1:1 stoichiometry is important for other MRAP2-GPCR interactions. As our studies, and those of a recent preprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), have shown that overexpression of MRAP2 is unnecessary, future studies should also assess the 1-to-1 stoichiometry.</p><p id="P23">We identified five residues in MRAP2 that may contribute to receptor interactions and/or facilitate signalling. These residues are all located in the transmembrane helix, a region that has previously been shown to be important for potentiation of GHSR signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) by MRAP2. The transmembrane region is also important for MRAP1 interactions with MC2R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), and it is likely that there is a shared mechanism by which these accessory proteins facilitate GPCR signaling. Cryo-EM structures of MC2R with MRAP1 demonstrate that the accessory protein interacts with TM5 and TM6 of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Our homology models of MC3R and MRAP2 predict interactions with TM5 or TM6 of the receptor, and alanine mutagenesis of three residues within TM6 impaired MRAP2’s ability to facilitate MC3R signalling. MC3R conforms to common class A G protein coupling mechanisms whereby outward movement of TM6 allows formation of a large cytoplasmic cavity between TM5-TM7 that can accommodate G protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Similar activation mechanisms have been described for MC2R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) and MC4R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), and we propose that MRAP2-TMD interactions with TM5-TM6 of GPCRs, allows the receptor to adopt a structural conformation that is more readily activated and/or allows G proteins to couple more efficiently. Such facilitation of a ‘partially preactivated state’ that can be more readily activated has been described for the RAMP2 accessory protein’s ability to potentiate signalling by the parathyroid hormone type-1 receptor (PTH1R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Interactions between TM4 and TM5 of PTH1R and the RAMP2 transmembrane domain are important for establishing this preactivated state.</p><p id="P24">Consistent with previous studies of other GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) we also found that MRAP2 impairs β-arrestin recruitment. Although the mechanism by which MRAP2 impairs β-arrestin binding is unknown, the AlphaFold2 models suggest that the intracellular MRAP2 α-helix may sterically block the β-arrestin binding site which is likely to involve the intracellular ends of TM5 and TM6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). However, such a mechanism would also be expected to impair G protein coupling suggesting that the cytoplasmic α-helix may undergo conformational changes following receptor activation. Further studies of the structure of the MRAP2 cytoplasmic region could provide insights into these mechanisms. Reduced β-arrestin recruitment and the consequent impairment in receptor internalization could explain some of the effects of MRAP2 on GPCR activation. Consistent with this, blocking MC3R endocytosis using Dyngo-4a enhanced receptor signaling and previous studies have shown that AgRP inhibits MC3R activity, at least in part, by enhancing recruitment of β-arrestin and promoting receptor endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). However, while we showed multiple MRAP2 variants impaired MC3R cAMP signaling, not all affected receptor trafficking, and it is possible that other mechanisms exist that allow MRAP2 to promote receptor signaling.</p><p id="P25">Previous studies of MRAP2 in human populations identified &gt;25 variants associated with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). One group also reported hyperglycaemia and hypertension occurred more commonly in individuals with MRAP2 mutations than in those with MC4R and suggested that MRAP2 variants may affect signaling by other GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). This was based on the finding that the variants did not all impair MC4R function, and the phenotype was dissimilar to that in individuals with MC4R mutations. Our studies show that eight MRAP2 variants impair MC3R-mediated cAMP activity, while three variants (P32L, V91A, H133Y) found exclusively in individuals with normal weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) had no effect on signaling or trafficking. Whether inhibition of MC3R contributes to any of the clinical findings identified in individuals with MRAP2 variants is unknown. Mice with deletion of <italic>Mc3r</italic> have a high ratio of fat-to-lean mass but are not markedly obese unless fed a high fat diet, and heterozygous mice have normal weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). However, mice depleted of both <italic>Mc3r</italic> and <italic>Mc4r</italic> are significantly heavier than <italic>Mc4r<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), suggesting MC3R can contribute to weight gain. In contrast, depletion of<italic>Mc3r</italic> from AgRP neurons causes an anorexia and starvation phenotype, consistent with its known orexigenic role in these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). In humans, rare inactivating MC3R variants have been associated with obesity, but these findings are inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Recently, several functionally inactivating MC3R heterozygous mutations have been linked to childhood growth and timing of puberty with normal weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). One homozygous individual had also been overweight/obese since childhood and had type-2 diabetes and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Therefore, further studies of individuals with MRAP2 or MC3R variants are required to better understand how inactivating variants contribute to disease.</p><p id="P26">We also showed that MRAP2 variants can affect pathways other than the cAMP pathway. Five variants located in the intracellular domain that impaired cAMP signaling also reduced internalization. Although we know little about the MRAP2 C terminus, structural homology models suggest part of this region may form an α-helical structure that lies within the MC3R cleft in which G proteins and β-arrestin bind. Several of the variants (R113G, S114A, L115V, N121S) that affect both signaling and trafficking are present in this structure and we hypothesise that these variants disrupt the ability of the MC3R to engage with G proteins, resulting in impaired signaling. It will be important to investigate whether MRAP2 variants affect multiple aspects of GPCR signaling, as studies of MC4R have demonstrated inactivating mutations that contribute to obesity may not affect canonical signaling, but can affect internalization, homodimerization or other G protein pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Moreover, MRAP2 variants should be tested to determine whether they affect signaling by other GPCRs.</p><p id="P27">In summary, we have shown that MRAP2 directly binds to MC3R to enhance Gs-mediated signaling and impair β-arrestin recruitment. Our mutagenesis studies and examination of human genetic variants demonstrated that the MRAP2 transmembrane domain and a putative C-terminal helix play an important role in facilitating MRAP2-mediated enhancement of MC3R activity and may have applicability to other GPCRs. Novel therapies that disrupt or enhance these sites could have important implications for treating disorders of food intake including obesity and anorexia.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Plasmid constructs and compounds</title><p id="P28">A full list of plasmids with their source can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>.

Forty-eight hours later, media was removed and replaced with Fluorobrite complete medium. Nano-Glo reagent was then added at a 1:100 dilution and BRET measurements recorded using a Promega GloMax microplate reader at donor wavelength 475-30 and acceptor wavelength 535-30 at 37 °C. The BRET ratio (acceptor/donor) was calculated for each time point. Four baseline recordings were made, then agonist added at 8 minutes and recordings made for a further ~40 minutes. The average baseline value recorded prior to agonist stimulation was subtracted from the experimental BRET signal. All responses were then normalized to that treated with vehicle to obtain the normalized BRET ratio. AUC was calculated in GraphPad Prism and these values used to plot concentration-response curves with a 4-parameter sigmoidal fit.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Glosensor cAMP assays</title><p id="P39">HEK293 cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with 200 ng pGloSensor-20F plasmid, and equal amounts of MC3R and MRAP2 (25-500 ng for transfection tests, and 25 ng for all other studies). Forty-eight hours later, cells were seeded in 96-well plates in FluoroBrite complete medium. Cells were incubated for at least 4 hours, then media changed to 100 μL of equilibration media consisting of Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free HBSS containing 2% (v/v) dilution of the GloSensor cAMP Reagent stock solution (Promega). Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Basal luminescence was read on a Glomax plate reader for 8 min, then agonist added and plates read for a further 30 minutes. For FLAG-CLIP-SSTR3 studies, cells were preincubated with 10 μM forskolin for 5 minutes to elevate cAMP levels, then assays performed as described for MC3R with somatostatin-14 (Sigma) added as the agonist.
