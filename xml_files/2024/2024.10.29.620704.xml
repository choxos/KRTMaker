They detect diverse stimuli including endocrine, immune, neuronal, microbial, and dietary signals, through a complex array of receptors, ion channels, and transporters, to modulate the release of over 20 hormones. These molecular sensors serve as potential drug targets to modulate hormone secretion, but until recently, catalogues of such targets in human colonic EECs have not been produced.</p><p id="P2">To address this gap, we performed bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing on fluorescently labelled EECs isolated from human colonic organoids, identifying and cataloguing potential druggable targets. This catalogue includes receptors, orphan GPCRs, transporters, and hormones not previously reported in human colonic EECs. Comparison with murine EECs highlighted interspecies similarities and differences, key data to facilitate the design and optimise the predictive accuracy of pre-clinical models. We also functionally validated two receptors not previously identified in human EECs: IL-13Rα1, was expressed in both peptide-producing EECs and serotonin producing Enterochromaffin cells (ECs), and its ligand IL-13 stimulated the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and serotonin measured in real-time, and GPR173, which was selectively expressed in ECs and, when activated by its agonist Phoenixin-20, also promoted serotonin release.</p><p id="P3">These analyses provide a valuable resource for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating gut hormone secretion, with potential applications in treating gastrointestinal, metabolic, and other related disorders.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are vital sensors and signal transducers within the gastrointestinal epithelium. Although they comprise only ~1% of epithelial cells, EECs form an extensive hormone-producing network capable of converting luminal, neural, and immune signals into hormonal responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. EECs have traditionally been classified by the predominant hormone they secrete, e.g., L-cells produce glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), Glucagon like peptide-2 (GLP-2), and Peptide YY (PYY); K-cells secrete Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP); and enterochromaffin cells (ECs) release serotonin (5-HT). Recent advances using fluorescent reporter mice revealed that EEC profiles are shaped by their differentiation trajectory, gut location, and positioning along Wnt and BMP gradients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. EECs respond to various luminal stimuli including nutrients, pH, and microbial metabolites, releasing over 20 peptide hormones to control that regulate digestion, metabolism, microbial-host cross talk, gut-brain communication and immune defence. Consequently, EEC dysregulation has been implicated in obesity and diabetes, gastrointestinal diseases, inflammation, autoimmune conditions, and certain cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Given their diverse roles, EECs are valuable therapeutic targets and are thought to be important mediators of the metabolic benefits observed in bariatric surgery. Currently, several long-acting variants of individual or combined gut hormones such as GLP-1 and GIP are in development or approved as therapies for obesity and type 2 diabetes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, gaining deeper insights into EEC function and how these cells sense stimuli may uncover new druggable targets, enabling more precise control of therapeutic gut hormone secretion from specific EEC subtypes or gut regions. This could broaden therapeutic approaches and introduce new treatment options, including dietary interventions or small molecule drugs. Dietary strategies have the advantage of being more suitable for prevention or population-level interventions and could be more affordable for healthcare systems with limited funding.</p><p id="P6">Despite their significance, studying human EECs has been difficult due to their sparse distribution and challenges of isolating and maintaining them in culture. Much of our understanding is based on murine models, where fluorescent labelling techniques have mapped EEC distribution. However, the development of organoid technology and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing has revolutionized the field. These advances allow us to grow three-dimensional human intestinal organoids and study EECs in unprecedented detail <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">We have taken advantage of this technology to map druggable targets expressed in human colonic EECs. We compared this dataset with data from mouse colonic EEC subtypes to probe interspecies similarities and differences and identified novel receptors enriched in human colonic EECs. Among those, we selected IL-13Rα1 and GPR173, and corroborated their effects on hormone secretion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. By providing a map of human colonic EEC cell surface targets we hope to facilitate the identification of novel EEC biology and therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Generation of human colonic CHGA reporter organoids</title><p id="P8">Chromogranin A (CHGA) is a marker of neuroendocrine cells and marks EECs in the gut epithelium.

The fluorescent tag mNeon was inserted 7 base pairs prior to the stop codon (TGA) of the endogenous <italic>CHGA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To enrich for both peptide producing EECs and ECs, we combined two previously published differentiation protocols. This involved the use of differentiation medium which consisted of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), with the removal of epidermal growth factor (EGF) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and a 48-hour pulse treatment with a Notch inhibitor (iNotch), MEK inhibitor (iMEK), and ISX-9 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).

Colocalization of CHGA and mNeon was confirmed by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), indicating successful tagging of CHGA-expressing cells. We evaluated our differentiation method using time-course qPCR of whole colonoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). The stem cell marker <italic>SOX9</italic> and the endocrine progenitor markers <italic>NGN3</italic> and <italic>PAX4</italic> were upregulated early in the differentiation process, with the endocrine progenitor markers showing a slight delay relative to <italic>SOX9</italic>.

Conversely, markers of mature endocrine cells (<italic>CHGA</italic>, <italic>NEUROD1</italic>, tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (<italic>TPH1</italic>), preproglucagon (<italic>GCG</italic>)) increased over time, peaking on day 11.

The mNeon<sup>+ve</sup> population exhibited EEC marker genes like <italic>CHGA</italic>, <italic>CHGB</italic>, and <italic>SCG5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), and transcription factors (TFs) associated with EEC development including <italic>FEV</italic>, <italic>INSM</italic>, <italic>NKX2-2</italic>, <italic>NKX2-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c</xref>).

Hormone-encoding genes, including <italic>GCG</italic>, which produces the incretin GLP-1, and the anorexigenic peptide YY (<italic>PYY</italic>), were enriched in mNeon<sup>+ve</sup> cells.

Other classical gut hormones, secretin (<italic>SCT</italic>) and neurotensin (<italic>NTS</italic>), were expressed at lower levels.</p><p id="P12">Beyond the well-known gut hormones, our analysis of genes predicted to produce secreted products identified several additional neuropeptides and hormones not previously reported in human colonic peptide EECs or ECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c</xref>). These included galanin (<italic>GAL</italic>), a potent inhibitor of gut hormone secretion (including GLP-1, PYY, and NTS) and a known regulator of energy homeostasis and intestinal motility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Additionally, we found previously unreported expression of relaxin 1 (<italic>RLN1</italic>), which modulates the reproductive system and gut motility <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>; calcitonin gene-related peptide (<italic>CALCB</italic>), a neuropeptide with functions in the gut including the regulation of mucosal blood flow, epithelial homeostasis, exocrine and endocrine secretory processes, motor activity, and nociception <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>; and neurokinin B (<italic>TAC3</italic>), a member of the tachykinin family of neuropeptides involved in reproduction, gastric acid secretion, GI motor and sensory control, and inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Interestingly, our analysis also revealed the presence of follistatin-like 5 (<italic>FSTL5</italic>), a secretory glycoprotein previously implicated in the olfactory system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. While its role in the gut is unclear, it has been shown to inhibit proliferation in liver hepatocellular carcinoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">Among the top differentially expressed receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>) were the bile acid receptor (<italic>GPBAR1</italic>) and free fatty acid receptor 2 (<italic>FFAR2</italic>), both implicated in the regulation of postprandial nutrient sensing and gut hormone secretion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. These receptors have been reported to be expressed by EECs and/or ECs. Several hormone receptors were also enriched, including the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (<italic>GIPR</italic>). Its ligand, GIP, is an incretin secreted from K-cells in the small intestine. Our data corroborated the presence of the neuropeptide Y receptor type 1 (<italic>NPY1R</italic>), which has previously been identified on colonic goblet cells, endocrine cells, and enterocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. NPY1R mediates some effects of the NPY-like family of peptides on gut functions, including secretion of GLP-1, inflammation, barrier function, and absorption <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Additionally, the galanin receptor 1 (<italic>GALR1</italic>) and the relaxin family peptide (<italic>RXFP4</italic>) were also present. RXFP4 and its ligand, insulin-like peptide 5 (INSL-5), are thought to play a role in the regulation of food intake and gut motility. Recent data revealed co-localization of RXFP4 with serotonin in the lower gut of mice and single cell RNA-sequencing has suggested its presence in a subset of human colonic ECs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">EECs and ECs are strategically positioned to receive information from various sources, including enteric and vagal neurons. They can respond to classical neurotransmitters released by these neurons, and to dietary and microbial signals that in some instances act as ligands for neurotransmitter receptors. Our data demonstrate the presence of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor (<italic>GABBR2</italic>), the cholinergic receptor (<italic>CHRNB2</italic>) and the dopamine receptor D2 (<italic>DRD2</italic>) in mNeon<sup>+ve</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), extending previous findings in mice to humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

They possess multiple receptors which allow them to respond to immune mediators and can directly secrete cytokines and other modulators. For example, we found the receptors: interleukin-13 (IL-13) receptor <italic>IL13RA1, ULBP1, CLEC7A, KLRC3, TNFRSF19</italic>, and <italic>CD5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), and cytokines including <italic>CCL5, CCL15, CSF1, IL17, IL11, IL23</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c</xref>), and various tumour necrosis family members, enriched in mNeon<sup>+ve</sup> cells. The presence of <italic>IL13RA1</italic> and <italic>IL17</italic> corroborates the known role of IL-13 in controlling ECs in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and the previously reported production of IL-17C by EECs in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">We also identified differentially expressed transporters consistent with the chemosensing role of EECs and ECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c</xref>), including <italic>SLC22A17</italic> (iron transporter), <italic>SLC38A11</italic> (amino acid transporter), <italic>SLC17A9</italic> (ATP uniporter), <italic>SLC26A7</italic> (anion exchange transporter), and <italic>SLC8A1,</italic> a sodium/calcium exchanger.

In support of this, we found that IL-13 significantly increased GLP-1 secretion in colonoids derived from three separate donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). IL-13 has been shown to stimulate serotonin secretion from BON-1 cells, a human carcinoid cell line that produces serotonin (5-HT) and other neurotransmitters and peptides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. However, it remains unknown whether IL-13 can stimulate serotonin secretion from primary human ECs. Accurately measuring serotonin secretion from primary human cells is challenging. Unlike secretion protocols for gut hormones, which rely on sensitive immunoassays, real-time serotonin measurement requires electrochemical techniques that necessitate placing electrodes near the secreting cells. This is impractical without a reporter to mark the cells of interest. Previously, 5-HT release from individual ECs in mice has been indirectly visualized by measuring Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in fluorescently labelled ECs in organoids, or by indirectly measuring activation of biosensor cells expressing the serotonin-gated ion channel (5-HT<sub>3</sub>R) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">Here, we employed Fast Scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FSCV), an electrochemical technique used to simultaneously identify and quantify monoamines, to investigate whether the IL-13/IL-13Rα1 pathway stimulates serotonin secretion from primary human ECs. This method allows for real-time and label-free detection of extracellular 5-HT as a change in current at a carbon fibre microelectrode (CFM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Combining with CHGA-mNeon colonoids enabled the measurements to be performed in or near primary ECs.

However, human EEC biology and their therapeutic control have remained challenging to characterise beyond the well-studied incretin axes. By leveraging advanced methodologies, including CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and organoid models, we and others have begun to address longstanding challenges in accessing and studying human EECs at high resolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. By generating human CHGA-mNeon colonoids and developing a small molecule EEC differentiation protocol, we facilitated the isolation and visualization of EEC populations for transcriptomic profiling. In addition, we utilized TPH1-CFP and PYY-GFP transgenic mouse models to enable comparative analyses of EEC subtypes across species. This dual-species approach allowed us to map both conserved and species-specific features of EEC biology. By integrating bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing with functional assays we sought to delineate the molecular landscape of colonic EECs. This approach led to the identification of a broad array of previously unreported neuropeptides, hormones, and receptors in human colonic EECs. These findings expand our understanding of the signalling pathways that govern EEC function and highlight novel candidates for further exploration. Moreover, we corroborate the presence of key chemosensory receptors, such as the bile acid receptor GPBAR1 and free fatty acid receptor FFAR2, reaffirming the critical role of EECs in nutrient sensing and gut physiology.</p><p id="P32">In addition to their roles in nutrient sensing, hormone secretion, and gut motility, EECs are increasingly recognized for mediating immune-gut communication. Though their immunological functions remain relatively underexplored, we show that human colonic EECs express receptors and signalling molecules associated with immune function, including cytokine and chemokine receptors. This suggests that EECs sense inflammatory signals and modulate immune responses via hormone and peptide release. For example, we demonstrate that IL-13 enhances GLP-1 and serotonin secretion, indicating that EECs may link immune regulation, particularly TH2 responses, with metabolic processes and or gut defence. Further research is needed to clarify this crosstalk and its role in disease.</p><p id="P33">We employed fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) for the first time in gut organoids to validate serotonin secretion from ECs. FSCV provides unparalleled temporal resolution, allowing for the detection of rapid and transient changes in serotonin release that are often undetectable with conventional methods such as ELISA. Using this approach will facilitate a deeper understanding of the finely tuned regulatory mechanisms governing serotonin secretion from ECs. For instance, we identified GPR173 as a novel receptor exclusively expressed by ECs. FSCV enabled us to demonstrate that the GPR173 ligand, Phoenixin-20, modulated serotonin release by increasing the frequency of release events. These findings suggest that GPR173 may influence gut motility, inflammation, or mood regulation, given the established role of serotonin in the gut-brain axis.</p><p id="P34">Our interspecies transcriptomic comparisons revealed both conserved and divergent expression patterns, underscoring the limitations of exclusively using animal models for studying EEC biology. Conserved expression was observed for receptors such as NPY1R and FFAR2 whereas receptors like GPR3, GPR160, ULBP1, RXFP4 displayed human-specific expression, highlighting species-specific differences. This emphasizes the importance of conducting direct studies on human tissues to gain a comprehensive understanding of EEC function, particularly in the context of drug development. Additionally, the cross-species catalogue enables novel targets to be identified which can be further explored in mouse models of disease.</p><p id="P35">Overall, we provide a transcriptomic catalogue of human colonic EECs and the functional validation of two novel receptors involved in EEC biology. The identification of previously uncharacterized receptors, channels and transporters in the database presents the field with an opportunity to identify novel therapeutic interventions in metabolic, gastrointestinal, and inflammatory diseases. Future research should prioritize <italic>in vivo</italic> validation of targets within disease-specific contexts where gut hormones play key regulatory roles.
