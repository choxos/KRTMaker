Through the extracellular release of metabolites, lytic viral infections supply 2-10% of photosynthetically fixed carbon in the ocean for bacterial respiration. Despite its significance for the carbon cycle, we lack tools to detect the viral shunt in the natural environment and assess its ecological impact. Here, we study the use of exometabolites as biomarkers for the viral shunt by applying molecular, metabolomics, and oceanographic tools in blooms of the cosmopolitan microalga <italic>Gephyrocapsa huxleyi</italic> across the Atlantic Ocean, spanning four biogeochemical provinces between Iceland and Patagonia. We mapped the distinct metabolic footprint of its viral infections using exo- and endometabolomics approaches and detected nineteen organohalogen metabolites across the blooms, showing their global formation. Time-resolved comparison of particulate and dissolved metabolite pools during an induced mesocosm bloom indicated virocells – actively infected host cells – as the source of the halogenated metabolites. Three trichloro-iodo metabolites were present during demise of all virus-infected blooms, highlighting them as suitable metabolic biomarkers. The environmental stability of these halometabolites in the DOM pool over a few days can recapitulate viral infections at earlier stages of phytoplankton bloom succession.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>algal bloom</kwd><kwd><italic>Gephyrocapsa huxleyi</italic></kwd><kwd>alga-virus interaction</kwd><kwd>virocell</kwd><kwd>vDOM</kwd><kwd>halogenation</kwd><kwd>biomarker</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Viruses are the most abundant biological entities in the ocean with estimated 10<sup>7</sup> viral particles per mL seawater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). As infective agents, viruses are key players in the marine environment that can infect between 1% and 60% of their host populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). During interaction with their hosts, viruses remodel host cell metabolism and introduce auxiliary metabolic genes, thus creating a distinct cell state referred to as virocell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The virocell metabolism has important consequences for the chemical composition of the surrounding seawater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The release of all intracellular metabolites into the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool at the end of a lytic infection diverts the carbon flux away from grazers to heterotrophic microorganisms such as bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). This fundamental ecosystem pathway known as the ‘viral shunt’ enhances microbial respiration in the surface ocean and impacts the fate of carbon in microbial food webs. However, we still lack tools to map the carbon flux through the viral shunt and thereby assess the impact of viral lysis on the marine carbon cycle. Recently, new methods have been developed to quantify ongoing viral infections at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and taxon-specific cell lysis rates via extracellular ribosomal RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) in the marine environment. The composition of virus-induced DOM (vDOM) differs from exudates and lysates of non-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), suggesting that taxon-specific vDOM signatures can be used as metabolic biomarkers to quantify the viral shunt of specific algal blooms in the marine environment.</p><p id="P3">The cosmopolitan bloom-forming microalga <italic>Gephyrocapsa huxleyi</italic> (formerly known as <italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic>) is a key player in the marine carbon and sulfur cycles, and a sensitive reporter of the ecological consequences of climate change, such as ocean acidification and poleward species expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Viral infection by the <italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic> virus (EhV) is a major cause of mortality in the large-scale blooms of <italic>G. huxleyi</italic>, controlling the metabolic landscape during bloom demise. In a recent mesocosm experiment, we induced <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> blooms and followed changes in the exometabolic landscape throughout bloom succession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Viral infection led to a distinct metabolic footprint during bloom demise characterized by metabolites with a dual halogenation of chlorine and iodine that are rare in the marine environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Despite the formation of volatile organohalogens that contribute to atmospheric ozone depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), little is known about the role of marine phytoplankton blooms as a source for halogenated metabolites, which are characterized by their high bioactivities and environmental persistence. Since there are limited diagnostic tools to map the viral shunt in the ocean, we aimed to assess the use of the dual halogenated metabolites as possible biomarkers for the viral shunt in widespread blooms of <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> across the Atlantic Ocean.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Sampling oceanic blooms at various phases</title><p id="P4">To encompass the wide distribution range of <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> and its association with temperate and subpolar waters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), several phytoplankton blooms were sampled across the Atlantic Ocean, spanning four biogeochemical provinces between Iceland and Patagonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Dataset S1</xref>). The sampling included three Boreal summer blooms in the Northeast Atlantic (V1-2, B1), four Austral summer blooms in the Southwest Atlantic (G1-4), and two non-bloom reference sites (G5-6). Four of these blooms were followed in Lagrangian drifts which allowed the repeated sampling of these blooms for 3-5 days (V2, B1, G3, G5). Coccolithophores have a distinct optical signature based on the scattering of light from their calcite exoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) that can be detected by satellite remote sensing. <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> blooms were thus identified using satellite imagery taken by the MODIS/Aqua instrument, with blooms being characterized by an elevated particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) signal of &gt;0.7 mmol m<sup>-3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). PIC ranged from as low as 0.3 mmol m<sup>-3</sup> (Gayoso G1) to ~2 mmol m<sup>-3</sup> (VICE V1 and V2, Gayoso G3 and G4) and as high as 2.5 mmol m<sup>-3</sup> (Breizh B1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Dataset S1</xref>). In addition, the <italic>in</italic>-<italic>situ</italic> abundance of <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> was enumerated using on-board flow cytometry. The calcite exoskeleton of <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> increases the side scattering of light and distinguishes its cells from other nanoeukaryotic phytoplankton. Blooms in the open ocean typically reach cell densities of 1-10×10<sup>6</sup> cells L<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). In correspondence with the satellite PIC signal, <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> cells were present at all locations, with cell abundances reaching as high as 3.7×10<sup>6</sup> cells L<sup>-1</sup>, indicating intense blooms (B1 and G4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). A moderate PIC signal, despite low abundances of &lt;1×10<sup>6</sup> cells L<sup>-1</sup> (V1 and V2), may be explained by light scattering of coccoliths that were shed from dying cells during bloom demise, while the low PIC signal at G1, despite a high cell abundance, is due to the deep bloom depth of ~50 m. The temporal bloom dynamics at each location were assessed by mapping satellite data of PIC and chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> (Chl <italic>a</italic>) around the time of sampling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref> for a detailed example). Pre- and post-bloom phases are defined by having &lt;0.7 mmol m<sup>-3</sup> PIC. During the bloom phase, the PIC signal increases with the peak of the bloom and onset of the demise phase being marked by reaching a minimum Chl <italic>a</italic>:PIC ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). During the demise phase, the Chl <italic>a</italic>:PIC ratio increases due to the attenuation of the PIC signal. The Boreal blooms V1 and V2 were in an early and late demise phase, respectively. The five-day drift sampling (B1) captured the onset of demise of an intense bloom of <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> (&gt;3×10<sup>6</sup> cells L<sup>-1</sup>). The Austral bloom samplings captured a bloom phase (G4), an early demise phase (G3) and two late demise phases (G1, G2). The sampling of several <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> blooms in their demise phase allowed to examine whether this was the result of viral infection and whether metabolic biomarkers can be applied to report the formation of DOM through the viral shunt.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Metabolic footprints of viral infection in bloom demise</title><p id="P5">Oceanic bloom samplings often provide snapshots in time and require molecular and metabolic biomarkers to assess the bloom and infection states. The vDOM of induced <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> blooms is characterized by several novel metabolites with a dual halogenation of chlorine and iodine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This unique metabolic hallmark renders them potential metabolic biomarkers for the viral shunt in oceanic <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> blooms. To assess whether this dual halogenation differs in its occurrence from other halogen-bearing exometabolites, we mapped all halogenated metabolites throughout the phytoplankton bloom succession of the induced mesocosm blooms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). Iodinated metabolites were detected specifically during the <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> bloom demise and depended on the extent of viral infection. In contrast, brominated and chlorinated metabolites were already present extracellularly at the onset of the <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> bloom and increased during the demise phase independent of the infection level. The total concentration of chloro-iodo metabolites was strongly correlated with viral abundances (cell-bound and free EhV; ρ = 0.82-0.83, p &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, a weak correlation was found with virus-derived glycosphingolipids (vGSLs; ρ = 0.65, p = 0.11) that serve as intracellular biomarkers for viral infection. No positive correlation was found with the abundance of <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> and other phytoplankton community members, such as nano- and picoeukaryotes, bacteria, or physicochemical water properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). These observations reinforce the link between the formation of the chloro-iodo metabolites and active viral infection, and highlights the possibility to utilize iodinated metabolites, specifically chloro-iodo metabolites, as metabolic biomarkers for vDOM formation in open ocean blooms of <italic>G. huxleyi</italic>. The high correlation (ρ = 0.97, p &lt; 0.01) between the two intracellular infection markers (cell-bound EhV and vGSLs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>) emphasizes that intra- and extracellular viral infection markers have different dynamics: intracellular markers report the virocell state, while extracellular chloro-iodo metabolites report the post-lysis state of vDOM formation.</p><p id="P6">We aimed to examine the sensitivity of the chloro-iodo metabolites as metabolic biomarkers in the natural environment. Using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics approach, we profiled diverse oceanic blooms covering the widespread occurrence of <italic>G. huxleyi</italic>, from Iceland to Patagonia, and different bloom phases. Despite the tenfold lower cell abundances compared to induced mesocosm blooms, we detected several chloro-iodo metabolites in the oceanic <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> blooms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In total, a suite of 19 chloro-iodo metabolites was detected intra- and extracellularly in the environmental samples by applying an untargeted metabolite profiling approach using LC-MS in positive and negative ionization modes. Most detected metabolites were dichlorinated (11 metabolites) and trichlorinated (7 metabolites), with one metabolite being monochlorinated. The largest number (9-11 metabolites) was detected in filter samples from two North Atlantic blooms in their demise phase (V1, V2). <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> abundances were low in both locations (&lt;10<sup>6</sup> cells L<sup>-1</sup>), while the infection level was higher at the early demise phase (V1), as reflected by intracellular EhV abundances enumerated by qPCR of the major capsid protein (<italic>mcp</italic>) gene. Chloro-iodo metabolites were found with higher intensities at the early demise phase (V1), and the weak metabolic signature at the late demise phase further dissipated during the 3-day drift (V2a-c). During the drift with the intense Boreal summer bloom (B1a-d), four chloro-iodo metabolites were detected at similar intensities throughout the drift period. Satellite imagery showed that this bloom reached the lowest Chl <italic>a</italic>:PIC ratio during the drift period compared to the preceding and following week (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). <italic>In</italic>-<italic>situ</italic> measurements showed decreasing cell abundances and slightly increasing intracellular EhV abundances, suggesting it to be virus-infected bloom at the onset of the demise phase. Among the Austral summer blooms, the highest number and intensity of chloro-iodo metabolites were found in a demised bloom (G2) that showed the highest EhV abundance along the Patagonian Shelf. In an adjacent post-bloom phase station (G1), two metabolites were detected at low intensity. No chloro-iodo metabolites were found at the bloom phase stations (G4, G5) that showed higher cell counts (1.6-3.7×10<sup>6</sup> cells L<sup>-1</sup>) but lower EhV abundances, and at the reference sites (G3, G6). Notably, there is a difference in the occurrence pattern of intracellular viruses – reporting a pre-lysis state – and of extracellular chloro-iodo metabolites – reporting a post-lysis state. For example, while the intracellular viral abundance at the late demise phase station G2 was low, several chloro-iodo metabolites were detected extracellularly. This may indicate the difference in the fate of intracellular biomarkers, e.g. by cell lysis and sedimentation, compared to dissolved metabolites, e.g. by bacterial degradation and lateral transport via ocean currents. The detection of several chloro-iodo metabolites in their demise phase in oceanic blooms suggests that they can be used as sensitive metabolic biomarkers to assess the impact of lytic viral infection through the viral shunt on the biogeochemistry and succession of <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> blooms.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Tracking the transition from intra- to extracellular carbon pools through viral lysis</title><p id="P7">To assess the transfer of the chloro-iodo metabolites to the marine DOM and possible transformations by biotic and abiotic processes, we compared their presence within the DOM fraction, representing the extracellular pool and the particulate organic matter (POM) fraction, representing the intracellular pool. The high temporal resolution of the metabolic profiling of the induced blooms enabled us to map the chloro-iodo metabolites over 11 days and identify variations in both pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Two metabolites (#25 and #27) were found solely as cellular metabolites (vPOM) across all blooms and may have rapid turnover times upon cell lysis, e.g., by bacterial degradation or chemical transformation, making them part of the highly labile DOM. Six chloro-iodo metabolites were found solely extracellularly. Of these, metabolite #22 was present exclusively as vDOM across all bloom samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Dataset S2</xref>), suggesting an extracellular origin, e.g., as a transformation product of the viral lysate by the heterotrophic microbial community. About half of the chloro-iodo metabolites (9 metabolites) were found intrac- and extracellularly, suggesting a cellular origin and flux into the DOM. The intracellular origin is further supported by the observation that most of these metabolites were first detected in the POM fraction. However, they were enriched extracellularly by the end of the demise phase. The accumulation of chloro-iodo metabolites in the DOM suggests that they are stable for at least a few days. This finding is supported by the reoccurring detection of chloro-iodo metabolites during the drift with a demising bloom in the North Atlantic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) and suggests that some of these metabolites may be recalcitrant to bacterial degradation. The release and stability of the chloro-iodo metabolites in the DOM pool can capture and recapitulate the dynamics of viral infections at earlier stages of the bloom dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Trichloro-iodo metabolites are sensitive metabolic biomarkers</title><p id="P8">Metabolites #7, #14 and #29 were detected frequently in samples from the North and South Atlantic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), suggesting that they are most sensitive as metabolic biomarkers in the natural environment. They were detected both at early (V1, B1) and late (V2, G2) demise phases. Interestingly, in the demise phase of an intense bloom in the North Atlantic (B1), metabolites #7 and #14 were detected extracellularly and, at lower and decreasing signal intensities, intracellularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), while vGSLs as intracellular infection markers were not detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). This suggests that chloro-iodo metabolites can report viral infections of past bloom events even when intracellular infection markers, such as vGSLs and <italic>mcp</italic> (viral major capsid protein gene), are low or already diminished below detection limit following the cell lysis at the end of the infection. All three halometabolites are trichloro-iodo metabolites, and metabolite #7 seems to be a hydroxylated derivative of #14 based on predicted elemental composition and similar mass fragmentation patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Dataset 2, Figure S3B</xref>). While metabolites #7 and #14 both increased in the DOM pool throughout the demise of the induced mesocosm bloom, they showed a different partitioning between the POM and DOM pools, with a higher prevalence of metabolite #7 in the DOM and a higher prevalence of metabolite #14 in the POM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). As metabolite #29 was found in the oceanic blooms with a similar occurrence pattern to #7 and #14, it may function as an additional metabolic biomarker despite its lower signal intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The absence of metabolite #29 in the mesocosm bloom suggests site-specific metabolic variability governed by e.g., host and virus strain differences and metabolic plasticity. As the detection of metabolites #7 and #14 in environmental samples appeared robust regarding various extraction and analysis approaches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>), they can be easily incorporated into environmental sampling strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P9">Molecular biomarkers are powerful tools to assess host-pathogen interactions such as viral infections in the marine environment. For <italic>G. huxleyi</italic>, several gene-, transcript- and lipid-based biomarkers have been identified that can shed light on viral infections of natural blooms. The viral gene marker <italic>mcp</italic> allows to assess the abundance of EhV virions intra- and extracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), while gene expression analyses can resolve the fraction of actively infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) and the various states of the infection cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). In addition, a suite of lipid markers can reveal the presence of susceptible (sGSLs), infected (vGSLs), and resistant (resistance-specific GSLs, rsGSLs) cells in <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> blooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). While this suite of molecular biomarkers allows to characterize viral infections at the cellular level, we lack biomarkers to study infection outcomes beyond host cell death, such as the carbon flux into the DOM pool through the viral shunt. So far, the viral shunt has been assessed only indirectly by measuring host and virus abundances and their specific growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). The chloro-iodo metabolites assessed in this study are promising candidates as metabolic biomarkers for directly quantifying the formation of vDOM in <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> blooms, due to their specificity, sensitivity, and environmental stability.</p><p id="P10">Both abiotic and biotic processes can lead to the formation of halogenated metabolites in the marine DOM pool. The chloro-iodo metabolites of the <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> vDOM are aliphatic metabolites, as suggested by their elemental composition and H/C ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4, Dataset S2</xref>). Aliphatic substrates are mainly halogenated via radical enzymatic pathways mediated by Fe(II)/α-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases and a few Vanadium- and flavin-dependent halogenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). The presence of 2-3 double bonds further suggests the involvement of halogenases that employ an electrophilic mechanism targeting electron-rich substrates via alkene addition or aromatic substitution reactions. However, we currently lack knowledge on the presence and role of halogenases in blooms of <italic>G. huxleyi</italic>. In addition to enzymatic halogenations, sunlight can also lead to organohalogen formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Photosensitized DOM and reactive oxygen species can induce reactive halide species that non-specifically halogenate metabolites. The seawater concentration of bromide, photolability of iodinated DOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), and reduction potential of chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) lead to a preferential bromination, however, no brominated exometabolites were found as constituents of the <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> vDOM. Furthermore, photoiodination preferentially affects lignin-like substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), strengthening the role of enzymatic pathways in forming the aliphatic chloro-iodo metabolites. Strikingly, other aliphatic organochlorines were detected in sediment traps from the Arabian Sea, and their origin was suggested to be <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> following <italic>in</italic>-<italic>situ</italic> and culture-based measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). These findings highlight the relevance of the still largely unknown biotic sources for organochlorines in the surface ocean. Finding aliphatic chloro-iodo metabolites in several virus-infected <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> blooms in the Atlantic Ocean suggests that alga-virus interactions are an important biotic source for organohalogens in the marine environment.</p><p id="P11">The chloro-iodo metabolites are likely persistent metabolic biomarkers in the marine environment owing to their polyhalogenation with up to four halogens. Culture-based studies showed that the majority of cyanobacterial vDOM (80%) gets respired within 48 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). However, chloro-iodo metabolites require multiple dehalogenations before their metabolic degradation. This may explain their rapid accumulation during the mesocosm experiment and stable occurrence over several days during the Lagrangian drifts with the North Atlantic blooms. In turn, this may further lead to their sequestration as recalcitrant DOM without effective dehalogenation processes. Deiodination can occur by photolysis due to the low C-I bond energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) and depends on solar radiation and water circulation. Boreal <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> blooms, with their proximity to areas of deep-water formation, are thus more likely to lead to the transport of chloro-iodo metabolites into the deep sea and sequestration as recalcitrant DOM. Dechlorination is rather driven by microbial dehalogenation due to the photostability of the C-Cl bond. Polyhalogenated compounds, such as the chloro-iodo metabolites, are more persistent to microbial dehalogenation, which facilitates their transport and accumulation in the DOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) and POM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) pools of the deep sea. Future <italic>in</italic>-<italic>situ</italic> experiments using on-deck incubations and sediment traps will help to shed light on photolytic and microbial dehalogenation processes and to model the transport and sequestration of chloro-iodo metabolites in the marine carbon cycle.</p><p id="P12">For a comprehensive understanding of the consequences of viral infections at the ecosystem level, biomarkers for other infection outcomes need to be developed, including the trophic transfer of carbon through selective feeding on virocells, or carbon export to the ocean floor through the viral shuttle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). The development of such biomarkers is particularly relevant considering the global climate change affecting carbon cycling in the marine environment in unprecedented ways. Accordingly, there is a critical need for diagnostic tools that inform about the impact of climate change on the abundance, activity, and health of marine phytoplankton communities. For example, satellite remote sensing of surface water Chl <italic>a</italic> revealed changes in phytoplankton distribution and biomass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) supported by <italic>in</italic>-<italic>situ</italic> observations that revealed further effects on biodiversity and species turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). In addition, proxies are emerging that offer insights into phytoplankton activity, such as bio-optical measurements of primary production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), which is a key trait of marine phytoplankton communities. Among the existing molecular biomarkers that can report on phytoplankton health are enzymes and lipids that indicate macro- and micronutrient limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) and cell quotas in energy-rich lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) and essential fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) that have cascading nutritional effects at higher trophic levels. However, we still need biomarkers to monitor the prevalence and consequences of phytoplankton diseases, such as viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, which are rather understudied compared to marine macroorganisms. Environmental metabolomics, as applied in this study, proved to be crucial for finding ecologically relevant biomarkers, and will benefit from current efforts in implementing metabolite analyses in global ocean surveys.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Sampling and in-situ enumeration of G. huxleyi blooms</title><p id="P13">A summary of all samples with their relevant metadata is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Dataset S2</xref>.</p><sec id="S10"><title>AQUACOSM VIMS-Ehux mesocosm experiment</title><p id="P14">Blooms of <italic>G. huxleyi</italic> were induced by nutrient addition in four mesocosm bags at the Marine Biological Station Espegrend, Norway, between 23 May and 16 June 2018, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).
