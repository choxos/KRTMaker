However, the effect of Aβ during normal – i.e., non-pathological – brain aging remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the natural impact of Aβ precursor protein (<italic>app</italic>) on the aging brain using a short-lived vertebrate model, the turquoise killifish (<italic>Nothobranchius furzeri</italic>). We identified amyloid precursor protein derivatives in the killifish brain across different age groups and found that pyroglutamated amyloid beta —a neurotoxic Aβ variant—accumulates intra-neuronally in an age-dependent manner, co-localizing with the apoptosis marker TUNEL. The presence of intraneuronal pE11 was recapitulated in old (non-pathological) human brains, indicating that this phenotype is shared among vertebrates. To determine whether Aβ contributes to spontaneous brain aging, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate an “amyloid precursor protein a” (<italic>appa</italic>) knock-out killifish strain. Notably, <italic>appa</italic> -/- mutants exhibited reduced cell death and inflammation, an overall younger proteome, as well as improved learning capacity in old age. Taken together, we found that Aβ precursor protein broadly affects vertebrate brain aging, making it a promising target for anti-aging interventions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The aging brain undergoes several changes, including protein aggregation, inflammation, and neuronal degeneration, which is associated with a decline in cognitive capacity. These changes are often exacerbated during neurodegenerative diseases, which possibly represent alternative aging trajectories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Amyloid beta (Aβ) is a highly studied peptide that aggregates in the brain of normal – i.e., non-pathological – aging individuals as well as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Genetic and pharmacological induction of Aβ can drive neurodegenerative symptoms in worms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, flies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and monoclonal antibodies and vaccination strategies targeting Aβ are being developed to slow down cognitive decline in AD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. However, whether Aβ plays a key role in normal aging and whether it can be targeted to reduce the degenerative brain phenotypes of the normal aging brain remains largely unexplored.</p><p id="P3">The investigation of the effect of spontaneous Aβ accumulation during aging requires an animal model whose natural aging trajectory includes both Aβ accumulation, as well as neurodegenerative phenotypes. Therefore, we set out to investigate the Aβ dynamics in a naturally short-lived vertebrate, which displays robust brain aging phenotypes, the turquoise killifish (<italic>Nothobranchius furzeri</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Turquoise killifish have a median lifespan between three and eight months and rapidly develop a range of age-related phenotypes overlapping with human aging. These phenotypes include sarcopenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, cancer susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, telomere attrition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, impaired regenerative capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, as well as a decrease in antibody diversity and increased immunosenescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, the killifish brain is subjected to age-related protein aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, astrogliosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, neuronal degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and reduced neurogenic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, which together might underlie a decreased learning capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Considering that these brain aging phenotypes arise spontaneously, the turquoise killifish has been proposed as a promising model to study spontaneous neurodegenerative processes within the context of aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Here, we investigate the role of Aβ in normal brain aging. Using transcriptomics, proteomics, and immunohistochemistry, we show that with age, the killifish brain becomes subjected to a robust inflammatory state accompanied by accumulation of pyroglutamated Aβ, a post-translationally modified and particularly toxic Aβ variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Finally, we show that knocking out the <italic>appa</italic> isoform of the Aβ precursor genes mitigates age-related brain phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Amyloid beta is evolutionary conserved between humans and turquoise killifish and is expressed in the aged turquoise killifish brain</title><p id="P5">The turquoise killifish is a naturally short-lived species, reaching sexual maturity within 3 to 5 weeks post-hatching. In this study, we define killifish (strain ZMZ1001) as “young,” “aged,” and “old” based on their ages of 6 weeks, 6 months, and 9 months, respectively. These age categories correspond to survival rates of 100%, 89%, and 44% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Old individuals display several visually apparent aging phenotypes, including spine curvature, craniofacial alterations, as well as melanocytotic tailfins in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The brain morphology of the turquoise killifish resembles that of a typical teleost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) and has been extensively described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. The turquoise killifish genome contains two paralogs of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) which encode the amyloid beta (Aβ) sequence, <italic>appa</italic> and <italic>appb</italic> (coding sequences provided in <bold>Table S1).</bold> Both paralogs show a highly conserved Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> sequence from human to killifish, as well as conserved beta- and gamma-secretase cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Alphafold3 predicts similar 3D architecture for killifish (<italic>appa</italic> derived) and human (<italic>APP</italic> derived) Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> multimers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-D</xref>). This becomes evident by the superposition of the C-terminal regions of the isolated monomers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). These findings suggest that the high aggregation propensity of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> is likely conserved between killifish and humans. To investigate whether Aβ is detectable in the aged turquoise killifish brain, we performed immunohistochemistry using two Aβ-targeting antibodies. Considering that the available antibodies are not specifically raised against the killifish Aβ peptide, together with the known risks of misinterpretation of non-specific signals in the aged brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, we first addressed the binding specificity of the antibodies. To that end, we used the 4G8 antibody, targeting the Aβ<sub>17-24</sub> epitope which is fully conserved between humans and killifish, and can bind full-length APP and various APP-derivatives including Aβ. Additionally, we used the pE11 antibody, which targets N-terminally truncated and pyroglutamated Aβ, through recognition of the N-terminal pyroglutamate group and the first six amino acids after truncation (Aβ<sub>pE11-16</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). While 4G8 broadly marks full-length APP and its derivatives, pE11 specifically targets the post-translationally modified Aβ (Aβ<sub>pE11</sub>), enabling the tracking of cleaved and toxic Aβ rather than its precursors. We focused on detecting Aβ<sub>pE11</sub>, not Aβ<sub>pE3</sub>, as the pE11 target epitope is conserved between humans and killifish. Even though the 4G8 and pE11 antibodies bind different epitopes of the Aβ<sub>pE11</sub> peptide, we found a strong co-localization between 4G8 and pE11 signal throughout the anterior rhombencephalon (AR) of aged (6-month-old) killifish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). To mitigate the possibility that both antibodies bind the same structure in an epitope-independent manner, we blocked the epitopes by incubating antibodies with synthetic Aβ<sub>pE11-42</sub> peptide prior to the immunohistochemical staining. While incubation with albumin did not impact the staining pattern of pE11 or 4G8, the signal of both antibodies was almost completely abolished by the pre-incubation with Aβ<sub>pE11-42</sub> peptide, indicating that both antibodies bind to their targets in the killifish brain through their epitope binding domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A, B</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that the aged turquoise killifish brain contains APP-derivatives, including pyroglutamated Aβ.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Turquoise killifish develop age-related brain inflammation while expressing key players of Aβ biogenesis</title><p id="P6">To investigate the age-dependent expression levels of <italic>appa</italic> and <italic>appb,</italic> as well as other key players of Aβ biogenesis, we performed whole brain RNA-sequencing on six young (6-week-old) and six aged (6-month-old) female turquoise killifish (<bold>Table S2</bold>). Interestingly, genes downregulated with age indicate a strong decline in cellular proliferation (e.g. <italic>mki67</italic>), consistent with the reported loss of neurogenic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Genes upregulated with age (e.g., <italic>stat1, irf9, rsad2, cmpk2</italic>) suggest a strong age-related induction of inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), in agreement with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. To validate a potential age-related inflammatory state in the turquoise killifish brain, we tested markers of brain inflammation in the hypothalamus and optic tectum through immunohistochemistry by targeting Lymphocyte Cytosolic Protein 1 (LCP1), a pan-leukocyte marker employed to visualize microglia in the zebrafish and killifish brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D-F</xref>). Indeed, we found a strong age-related increase in the surface area covered by LCP1, which validates the age-related inflammatory state suggested by the transcriptomics data. As LCP1 is an actin-binding protein, the staining pattern visualizes cytoskeletal architecture of brain leukocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Next, to adress whether key players in Aβ biogenesis are actively transcribed in the killifish brain and would support a potential role for Aβ during killifish brain aging, we plotted their expression in young and aged brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). These key players include amyloid precursor proteins <italic>appa, appb</italic>, the APP family members <italic>appl1, appl2</italic>, the glutaminyl cyclase <italic>qpctl</italic> which pyroglutamates Aβ, the beta-secretase <italic>bace1</italic> and the family member <italic>bace2</italic> as well as the gamma-secretase subunits <italic>psen1, psen2, ncstn</italic> and <italic>aph1b</italic>. While all factors showed consistent expression in the turquoise killifish brain, no age-related changes were observed at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). In summary, the aging killifish brain becomes subjected to a robust inflammatory state and expresses transcripts encoding key players of Aβ biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Aβ<sub>pE11</sub> accumulates across the rostro-caudal axis of the killifish brain</title><p id="P7">Next, we investigated whether the 4G8 and pE11 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>) show any age-related changes. In the anterior rhombencephalon (AR) of young 6-week-old fish, 4G8 signal is already detectable and covers a similar percentage of the tissue area as seen in their aged 6-month-old counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>), which may reflect the binding of 4G8 to full-length APP. In contrast, the young AR seems largely devoid of any pE11 signal, while pE11 signal was robustly present in the aged AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-F</xref>). These findings suggest that while full-length APP and its derivatives might be present in the brain throughout killifish lifespan, Aβ<sub>pE11</sub> accumulates only at a later age. To explore the full spatiotemporal extent of the accumulation of pyroglutamated Aβ, we characterized the pE11 signal in seven different brain regions along the rostro-caudal axis, at four different ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4-8</xref>). While the pE11 signal remained nearly undetectable until three months of age, the pE11 covered surface area peaked at six months, which was consistent in all investigated brain regions. At nine months of age, the pE11 covered surface area showed a decreasing trend when compared to the six-month timepoint, which was validated in an independent cohort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>). The decline in pE11 covered surface area between 6- and 9-months of age suggests an increase in clearance, or a reduced production of Aβ<sub>pE11</sub>. Alternatively, the reduction of pE11 between 6- and 9-months could be due to the death of pE11<sup>+</sup> cells, and/or due to the selective disappearance of animals with high Aβ<sub>pE11</sub> levels. Taken together, these results indicate that Aβ<sub>pE11</sub> accumulates spontaneously across the rostro-caudal axis between 3- and 6-months of age in the brain of the turquoise killifish.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Amyloid beta predominantly localizes intraneuronally and colocalizes with TUNEL</title><p id="P8">In the human AD etiology, Aβ is typically known to localize in extracellular beta-sheet aggregates known as Aβ plaques but has also been described to localize intraneuronally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. To assess Aβ localization in the killifish brain, we first investigated the occurrence of extracellular plaques using the 4G8 and pE11 antibodies. Through an immunohistochemical approach using these antibodies, we could not identify any large extracellular signals which would be indicative of the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques. Instead, we found that 4G8 and pE11 signal mainly localized around nuclei, suggesting a predominantly intracellular localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4-8</xref>). To investigate the potential intraneuronal localization of Aβ<sub>pE11</sub> in the aged killifish brain, we co-labeled pE11 together with an antibody targeting neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and neuronal cytoplasmic marker acetylated tubulin (acTub). Indeed, pE11 localized directly around NeuN<sup>+</sup> nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) and colocalized with acTub (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>), indicating that Aβ<sub>pE11</sub> predominantly localizes intraneuronally. To address whether the intraneuronal localization of pyroglutamated Aβ is unique to the killifish or whether its localization is evolutionary conserved and also present in aged human brains, we performed pE11 staining on the brains of normal non-pathological (&gt;80 years old) and AD diagnosed individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11, S12</xref>). Strikingly, we detected intraneuronal pE11 signal in both the cortex and the hippocampus of normal aged human brains, as well as in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. In addition, we detected pE11 signal in extracellular plaques of the Alzheimer’s disease brains, which is in line with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. These findings indicate that pyroglutamated Aβ is not limited to a specific human pathology, but instead is broadly present the in aged vertebrate brain in an intraneuronal fashion. Pyroglutamated Aβ has been shown to be exceedingly neurotoxic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Therefore, to investigate whether pE11<sup>+</sup> cells show signs of DNA double stranded breaks typically indicative of programmed cell death, we adopted TUNEL staining.

Using two guide RNAs targeting the second exon of the <italic>appa</italic> gene, we introduced a 16bp deletion leading to a frameshift.

To investigate whether <italic>appb</italic> acts redundantly to counteract the lack of appa-derived APP, we performed a Western blot using the 22C11 antibody targeting the full-length APP. 22C11 should target both wild-type APPA and APPB, as the epitope targeted by 22C11 is highly conserved in both homologs (16/16 amino acids) and might also detect killifish APLP2 (12/16). APLP1 is less conserved (9/16). We observed a significant reduction (&gt;50%) of APP levels in the killifish <italic>appa</italic> mutant brain lysates, indicating that the still functional <italic>appb</italic> could not compensate in full for the loss of <italic>appa</italic> derived APP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B, C</xref>).

At 6-months of age, the <italic>appa</italic> mutants displayed an upregulation of proteins involved in mitochondria (e.g. DHRS12, SLC25A3, NDUFV1), translation (e.g. RPS7, RPL27, RPS13), and DNAJ-chaperones (e.g. DNAJC5AA, DNAJA1L, DNAJB3, DNAJA3A), as well as a downregulation of amyloidosis associated factors Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) and beta-synuclein (SNCB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F, G</xref>). Compared to same-aged wild-type siblings, 7.5-month-old <italic>appa</italic> mutants showed an upregulation of keratins (e.g. KRT4, KRT5, KRT18) and a downregulation of proteins involved in the lysosome and proteasome, as well as proteins involved in inflammation related ontologies, such as the defense response (e.g. C4B, TGFB1), and the JAK-STAT cascade (e.g. STAT1A). In addition, we observed downregulation of proteins involved in necroptosis (e.g. MLKL, XIAP) which is suggestive of a reduction in programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H, I</xref>). To validate the potential mitigation of age-related cell death in the <italic>appa</italic> mutants, we performed TUNEL staining in tissue sections of the hypothalamus superior lobe and anterior rhombencephalon. While TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells were consistently present in brains of wild-type sibling, <italic>appa</italic> mutant brains contained a lower TUNEL<sup>+</sup> covered surface area in both investigated regions at as early as 6-months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J-L</xref>).

To validate the potential mitigation of age-related inflammation, we performed an immunohistochemical staining using an antibody targeting Lymphocyte Cytosolic Protein 1 (LCP1) as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D, E</xref>). The 6-months-old <italic>appa</italic> mutant brain displayed a significant reduction of LCP1 covered surface area in the hypothalamus superior lobe, and a declining trend in the anterior rhombencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5M-O</xref>). Together, LC-MS and histology show that the knock-out of <italic>appa</italic> mitigates spontaneous cell death and inflammation in the aging turquoise killifish brain. To determine whether the beneficial effects of <italic>appa</italic> knock-out are restricted to inflammation and cell death, or whether they represent a broader mitigation of brain aging, we investigated whether we could detect a proteome-wide shift towards a younger proteome in the <italic>appa</italic> mutants compared to their wild-type siblings. To that end, protein group abundances were compared between young (6-week-old) and aged (6-month-old) brains, as well as between <italic>appa</italic> mutant and wild-type sibling brains at two different ages (6 and 7.5 months). Subsequently, the log2 fold-change (log2FC) values from both the young-versus-old and appa mutant-versus-wild-type comparisons were plotted against one another. In 6-month-old <italic>appa</italic> mutants, the differentially abundant proteins did not correlate with age-related changes in protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5P</xref>). However, in 7.5-month-old <italic>appa</italic> mutants, we observed a highly significant negative correlation (slope = -0.265, p = 2.31e-13) indicating that proteins upregulated with age were downregulated in the mutants, and <italic>vice versa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5Q</xref>). Proteins upregulated with age but downregulated in the <italic>appa</italic> mutants included proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. APOEB, PFN1, LGALS9) and inflammation (e.g. IFI44L, C4B, CMPK2), while proteins downregulated with age and upregulated in the <italic>appa</italic> mutants included extracellular matrix components (e.g. COL1A2, KRT5) as well as proteins involved in neuronal function (e.g. GRM8, PCDH2AC, PPFIA2).

To investigate whether APP/Aβ contributes to non-pathological age-dependent learning deficiency, we developed an active avoidance test based on previous literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. In short, fish (28 <italic>appa</italic> mutants and 30 wild-type siblings) were individually tested by placing them in an arena consisting of two circular compartments, connected through a narrow opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). After a 15-minute acclimatization period, fish were subjected to 40 consecutive cycles, where a conditionate stimulus (light), was coupled with a non-conditioned stimulus (air bubbles). Each one-minute cycle corresponded to 30 seconds of light exposure, with the latter 15 seconds combined with exposure to air bubbles, followed by a rest phase of 30 seconds. Untrained fish showed a preference to remain in the light, with 84% of the fish staying within the light during the first cycle of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Due to the pairing of the light with an adverse non-conditioned stimulus (air bubbles) across the 40 cycles, the fish learn to avoid air bubbles once cued with light. Indeed, even 7.5-month-old wild-type fish (n = 30) become increasingly proficient at actively avoiding the light with 16% (first cycle) to 46% (last cycle) of the fish escaping the bubbles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S23</xref>, Table S4). However, the 7.5-month-old <italic>appa</italic> mutants (n = 28) outperform their age-matched wild-type siblings and show an increased rate of successful escapes after the 6<sup>th</sup> cycle onwards, while reaching an average escape rate of 55% during the last cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S23</xref>).

Significant improvements in the <italic>appa</italic> -/- mutants were observed when comparing the speed at which their top scores were reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>) and when considering both top scores and the speed (i.e. the number of the learning cycle) at which the top score was reached simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). To gain insight into the biological significance of the learning improvements observed in the <italic>appa</italic> -/- mutants at 7.5-months of age, we performed the active avoidance test on an independent cohort of young killifish (6-week-old, n = 16) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S24</xref>). While young fish show a higher escape rate in the first 5 cycles of the experiment compared to all other non-young counterparts, the 7.5-month-old mutants performed not only better than age-matched controls, but similar to young fish for the remaining cycles.

An important clue suggesting a potential causal effect of Aβ in the normal aging brain was provided by a previous study describing the cognitive fitness of aged human carriers of the Islandic APP variant (A673T).

Therefore, the turquoise killifish genome carries an exceptionally high mutation load, which likely contributes to the polygenic basis of their robust aging phenotypes and compressed lifespan.

In this study, we recapitulate previously reported brain aging phenotypes of the turquoise killifish, including the aggregation of protein, inflammation, and cellular degeneration. Furthermore, we describe an additional brain aging phenotype, the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ<sub>pE11</sub>.

D.E.M. de Bakker was financed by a Rubicon scholarship (452021116) from the Dutch Research Council (NWO) as well as by a research grant from the “Balance of the Microverse” Excellence Cluster from the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena. This project was funded by the MPI-AGE and from the FLI in Jena. We would like to thank all the past and current members of the Valenzano lab at the MPI-AGE and at the FLI for their continuous input and support.</p></ack><sec id="S32" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The produced transcriptomic datasets will be made publicly available at the Gene Expression Omnibus from NCBI.
