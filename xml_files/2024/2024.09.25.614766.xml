A promising treatment approach being tested in clinical trials is HTT lowering, which aims to reduce levels of the mHTT protein. Target engagement of these therapies in the brain are inferred using antibody-based assays to measure mHTT levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is frequently reported as absolute mHTT concentration based on a monomeric protein standard used to generate a standard curve. However, patient biofluids are a complex milieu of different mHTT protein species, suggesting that absolute quantitation is challenging, and a single, recombinant protein standard may not be sufficient to interpret assay signal as molar mHTT concentration. In this study, we used immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry (IP-FCM) to investigate different factors that influence mHTT detection assay signal. Our results show that HTT protein fragmentation, protein-protein interactions, affinity tag positioning, oligomerization and polyglutamine tract length affect assay signal intensity, indicating that absolute HTT quantitation in heterogeneous biological samples is not possible with current technologies using a single standard protein. We also explore the binding specificity of the MW1 anti-polyglutamine antibody, commonly used in these assays as a mHTT-selective reagent and demonstrate that mHTT binding is preferred but not specific. Furthermore, we find that MW1 depletion is not only incomplete, leaving residual mHTT, but also non-specific, resulting in pull down of some wildtype HTT protein. Based on these observations, we recommend that mHTT detection assays report only relative mHTT quantitation using normalized arbitrary units of assay signal intensity, rather than molar concentrations, in the assessment of central nervous system HTT lowering in ongoing clinical and preclinical studies, and that MW1-depletion not be used a method for quantifying wildtype HTT protein.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Huntington’s Disease</kwd><kwd>Biomarkers</kwd><kwd>Huntingtin Detection</kwd><kwd>Huntingtin Lowering Therapies.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating, inherited neurodegenerative disease with progressive cognitive, psychological and physical symptoms. HD is caused by expansion of the CAG repeat tract in exon 1 of the huntingtin (<italic>HTT</italic>) gene above a critical threshold of ∼35 repeats, resulting in expression of a polyglutamine (polyQ) expanded form of the HTT protein, referred to as mutant HTT (mHTT)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">The Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993</xref>). HTT plays important roles in proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Harding and Tong, 2018</xref>), axonal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Vitet et al., 2020</xref>), transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Benn et al., 2008</xref>), cellular stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Liu and Zeitlin, 2017</xref>), and mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Carmo et al., 2018</xref>) and the expression of mHTT is considered responsible for the molecular pathogenesis cascade, including both loss of function and gain of toxic function, resulting in HD phenotypes in HD animal models and patients. However, despite being a monogenic disorder, the mechanisms of HD pathophysiology are complex, and remain the subject of intense study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Saudou and Humbert, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The majority of candidate therapies currently being tested in clinical trials for HD aim to lower levels of the mHTT protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Tabrizi et al., 2019</xref>). To infer target-engagement of these drugs, mHTT levels, usually from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), are monitored using ultrasensitive detection assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Southwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wild et al., 2015</xref>). Decreased mHTT levels in HD model mouse brain following intracerebroventricular administration of <italic>HTT</italic>-targeting antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were shown to induce correlative mHTT lowering in CSF, validating CSF mHTT quantitation as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for HTT lowering clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Southwell et al., 2015</xref>). mHTT is also a monitoring biomarker for HD, and its levels track with proximity to disease onset as well as cognitive and motor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Southwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wild et al., 2015</xref>). Numerous different mHTT detection assays have been developed to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fodale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Landles et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Reindl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Southwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Weiss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wild et al., 2015</xref>), all of which employ capture-probe antibody pairs, one which is used to immunoprecipitate and the other is used for detection of mHTT for biofluid samples. Moreover, a single full-length mHTT protein standard is often used to determine a molar concentration of mHTT from assay signal.</p><p id="P4">mHTT exists in many different proteoforms including alternatively spliced fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Neueder et al., 2017</xref>), proteolytically cleaved fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">El-Daher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Graham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Landles et al., 2010</xref>), in complexes with a myriad of binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Greco et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Harding et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ratovitski et al., 2012</xref>) and with different polyQ tract lengths generated via somatic expansion mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aviolat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Telenius et al., 1994</xref>). However, our current understanding of the relative distribution of these proteoforms in biofluids and other samples from people with HD or HD animal models, or how they track with disease, remains limited.</p><p id="P5">One limitation of mHTT detection immunoassays is the inherent bias in which specific proteoforms are detected, which is defined by the epitopes of the antibody pair that are used. Different antibody pairs will preferentially detect different proteoforms of mHTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Landles et al., 2021</xref>) and no one pair of antibodies can detect all or “total” HTT in the complex milieu of species that exists in biological samples given the fragmentation and variety of conformations of this protein. Additionally, the commonly used MW1 antibody, which was raised against the DRPLA-19Q/GST fusion protein, binds polyQ expanded proteins, and can form stoichiometrically heterogenous interactions with mHTT species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bravo-Arredondo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Owens et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that polyQ length functions as an additional variable for detection assay signal, in addition to mHTT concentration. Indeed, the variable stoichiometry of MW1-mHTT polyQ interactions compared to other anti-HTT antibodies likely accounts for the so-called detection paradox where mHTT concentration exceeds total HTT concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fodale et al., 2020</xref>). This paradox suggests that absolute quantitation of mHTT may not be possible with immunoassays with a single protein standard across an array of patient samples where CAG number, and hence polyQ length, is variable, and that defining molar concentrations of mHTT by such a methodology may be misleading.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we set out to explore different factors which can influence mHTT detection assay signal using a suite of HTT proteins, including a comprehensive allelic series of full-length HTT samples, spanning wildtype to juvenile HD polyQ tract lengths. Employing an IP-FCM assay, as well as other immunoassay approaches, we show that a variety of mHTT properties and assay condition considerations influence assay signal and show that using a single protein standard across an array of biological samples is not sufficient to allow accurate calculation of mHTT concentration. We also explore the binding specificity of the MW1 antibody and demonstrate that detection of polyQ expanded mHTT is preferential but not specific. Together these data support a new paradigm for mHTT detection, where results are reported as relative quantitation in reference to a given standard protein rather than reporting absolute concentrations. Moreover, that MW1-depletion should not be used to quantify wildtype HTT protein.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Purification of an allelic series of full-length HTT protein samples</title><p id="P7">Previously, we designed and developed an open-source toolkit for the eukaryotic expression and purification of full-length HTT proteins with different polyQ tract lengths and N- or C-terminal FLAG tags for purification and/or detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Harding et al., 2019</xref>). This toolkit is a unique resource for HD research as it encompasses a fine-grain allelic series of HTT proteins corresponding to wildtype control (Q23, Q25, Q30), HD threshold inflection point (Q36), adult-onset HD (Q42, Q52, Q54) and juvenile-onset HD (Q60, Q66). Regardless of polyQ tract length, all proteins can be co-expressed with HAP40, an important interaction partner of HTT whose levels track with HTT in cells and which functions to stabilize the large HTT protein molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Harding et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Huang et al., 2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Xu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P8">All HTT proteins were purified from insect cells using a two-step protocol, FLAG-affinity chromatography and gel filtration, and verified by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). We have previously validated HTT and HTT-HAP40 samples produced using this toolkit with numerous biophysical and structural methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Harding et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">2019</xref>) to show they are pure, monodisperse, folded and functional samples amenable to downstream interrogation. We further complemented this suite of HTT proteins with mHTT fragment proteins described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Southwell et al., 2015</xref>), to ensure better coverage of the milieu of mHTT species which are present in patient and HD animal model biofluid samples. The fragment proteins included a construct spanning aa. 1-171 with Q68 fused to aa. 1744-2234, hereafter called fusion HTT Q68, and aa. 1-586 with Q68, hereafter called N586 HTT Q68.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay for ultrasensitive detection of HTT shows that protein concentration and polyQ tract length influence assay signal</title><p id="P9">To measure the signal elicited from our panel of HTT proteins under different conditions, we used a micro-bead-based immunoprecipitation-flow cytometry (IP-FCM) assay. This assay was previously optimized, and a capture-probe antibody pair were identified which permit ultrasensitive detection of mHTT in HD mouse model and patient CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Southwell et al., 2015</xref>). Our IP-FCM assay employs the HDB4E10 antibody (hereafter HDB4), which was raised against an epitope within the bridge domain aa. 1844-2131 of HTT and also recognizes an epitope in exon 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), and the polyQ-specific MW1 antibody which is employed in other published mHTT detection assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fodale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Landles et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Reindl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Weiss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wild et al., 2015</xref>). Assay signal from our HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay and a different ultrasensitive mHTT detection assay also suitable for use in CSF that employs Singulex technology, showed statistically significant correlation of mHTT assay signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Analysis of a titration of our allelic series of purified full-length HTT samples using the IP-FCM assay reveals that assay signal is modulated by polyQ length as well as concentration, with greater assay signal measured for higher protein concentrations and longer polyQ tract lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Replotting these data as a function of polyQ tract length shows that the relationship between polyQ length and assay signal at a defined protein concentration is approximately linear under the conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Different structural properties of the HTT protein can influence IP-FCM assay signal</title><p id="P11">Next, we investigated how different structural features of the HTT protein might influence HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay signal. Beyond polyQ tract length, HTT proteoform heterogeneity in HD patient CSF is expected due to alternatively spliced fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Neueder et al., 2017</xref>), or fragmentation due to proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">El-Daher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Graham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Landles et al., 2010</xref>), as well as aggregation of the protein into higher order oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Recombinant proteins used as standards can also differ by the position of their purification tags which can further modulate their structure and/or conformation. Using a suite of HTT proteins, we investigated these variables.</p><p id="P12">Firstly, full-length and fragment HTT proteins bearing approximately the same polyQ tract were assessed using the HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay, revealing significantly different profiles for each protein over equivalent concentration titrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Despite all three proteins containing approximately the same polyQ-tract length, the assay signal is influenced by the context of these epitopes with the greatest signal observed in the full-length protein, potentially due to conformational flexibility and/or other structural changes that different epitope flanking sequences confer to the protein molecule.</p><p id="P13">Next, we assessed full-length HTT proteins, with either N- or C-terminal FLAG tags and polyQ tract lengths of Q23 or Q66 using the HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). For HTT Q66, proteins bearing a C-terminal FLAG tag compared to an N-terminal FLAG tag show lower assay signal. A similar trend is also seen for HTT Q23 at higher concentrations of protein, with N-terminally tagged HTT Q23 eliciting higher assay signal that C-terminally tagged HTT Q23. This finding suggests that affinity tag positioning can alter the accessibility or conformation of antibody epitopes. Indeed, the MW1 epitope begins just 17 residues after the N-terminal tag and flanking sequence composition is known to influence the biophysical properties of the polyQ tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Duennwald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Shen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We then looked at the effects of HTT protein oligomerization and aggregation on IP-FCM assay signal. The gel filtration elution profile of apo HTT has a distinct shape, reported by multiple groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Harding et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Pace et al., 2021</xref>). The main peak corresponding to monomeric HTT eluting after ∼0.6 column volumes preceded by dimer, tetramer and increasingly higher order oligomer peaks eluting ahead of the monomer peak, with the largest oligomers and aggregates eluting in the column void volume (∼0.3 column volumes). FLAG-affinity chromatography purified HTT Q54 (∼85% pure) was concentrated (input) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, middle) and applied to Superose6 Increase 10/300 column, then we collected eight 1 mL fractions spanning all peaks (fractions 1-8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, left). The concentration of the eight gel filtration fractions and input sample was normalised and then samples of each analysed by HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay at different dilutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, right). Fractions corresponding to mHTT monomer yielded the lowest signal in this assay (F6-8), with signal increasing as oligomeric state increased to the largest assemblies (F1). The change in assay signal with oligomeric state might reflect avidity effects occurring in higher order assemblies of HTT protein, where adjacent epitopes across protein molecules are more likely to be in closer proximity, as is reported for other aggregate protein immunoassays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Pan et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>IP-FCM assay buffer can influence assay signal for some HTT protein complexes</title><p id="P15">HTT is a protein scaffold and is reported to bind more than 500 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Greco et al., 2022</xref>). Because of the varying interaction interfaces and conformational changes induced by complex formation, we hypothesised that different protein complexes of HTT are likely to have altered epitope availability. HAP40 is the only structurally validated interaction partner of HTT and can bind HTT with either wildtype (Q23) or disease expanded (Q54) polyQ tract lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Harding et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Huang et al., 2021a</xref>). Assay buffer components, such as detergents, can influence protein complex structure and stability. Performing our IP-FCM assay with a buffer more closely resembling physiological conditions, such as artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), a difference in assay signal can be observed for apo compared to HAP40-bound forms of HTT for the Q54 form of the protein (p&lt;0.0001 for all concentrations, 2way ANOVA multiple comparisons of log-log data) but not Q23, indicating that expanded exon 1 might be differently structured in these two proteoforms of HTT. However, when the assay is performed under more stringent buffer conditions, such as with the detergent NP-40 (1% (v/v/)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), this difference in signal is lost. This could be due to NP-40-mediated disruption of the HTT-HAP40 complex itself or conformational uniformity of exon 1 structure for apo and HAP40-bound HTT in the presence of detergent.</p><p id="P16">Next, we compared the assay signal obtained from human CSF samples diluted 1:1 in either aCSF or a buffer containing NP-40 detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Although samples with relatively low assay signal gave comparable signal in both buffer conditions, as shown by their proximity to the X=Y line, those with higher mHTT concentration as denoted by higher assay signal showed much higher signal in NP-40 buffer compared to aCSF. Again, this indicates that detergent in assay buffer can modulate epitope availability and binding by the HDB4/MW1 antibody pair in the IP-FCM assay format, perhaps related to changes in HTT complex formation, conformation or structure under different buffer conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>MW1 has preference but not specificity for mHTT and can deplete wildtype HTT</title><p id="P17">The MW1 antibody is also used to pretreat samples for analysis in ultrasensitive wildtype HTT detection assays, with the aim of depleting biofluid samples of mHTT, leaving only wildtype HTT to be detected with polyQ length-independent immunoassay antibody pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Boyanapalli et al., 2022</xref>). However, our HTT allelic series IP-FCM data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) show that MW1 has only preference, not specificity for mHTT, suggesting that such an assay approach may also deplete wildtype HTT. This corroborates previously studies which drew the same conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bennett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Owens et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We conducted a parallel experiment with Hu97/18 mouse CSF depleted using MW1 and assessed the depleted CSF and MW1 IP fraction using HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM. The depleted CSF shows reduced signal in the assay compared to the sample obtained by MW1 IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). This finding confirms that MW1 binds both HTT Q18 and Q97 in this experiment, and binding preference, but not complete specificity is shown by MW1 to mHTT. The degree to which each form of HTT is depleted from a biofluid samples likely depends on the relative affinity of MW1 for the specific polyQ tract lengths of the HTT proteins in question, as well as avidity effects, which will be driven by the relative concentrations of the proteins and the MW1 antibody in the depletion experiment conditions.</p><p id="P19">To test this hypothesis, we first used MW1 in an immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment with Hu97/18 HD model mouse brain lysates.

For ELISA, HTT was adhered to the plate surface and a titration of MW1 antibody was incubated prior to detection with HRP-linked secondary antibody as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Denis et al., 2023</xref>). The MW1 titration was optimised to ensure binding saturation as seen by stabilised A<sub>450</sub> readings as MW1 concentration increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). This permitted calculation of binding affinities of MW1 for each HTT protein, reported as apparent K<sub>D</sub> values (K<sub>app</sub>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), as the stoichiometry of binding complex for each polyQ tract length is unknown and varies as a function of the levels of HTT immobilised on the plate surface. In this assay, A<sub>450</sub> values change as a function of MW1 concentration and polyQ tract length. This finding parallels our earlier observations of small Q-length changes influencing immunoassay signal in our IP-FCM analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We observe that K<sub>app</sub> decreases exponentially with polyQ tract length indicating increasingly high affinity binding to longer polyQ tract length HTT proteins. This indicates that, in solution, MW1 binds HTT in a polyQ tract length dependent manner, as others have shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bravo-Arredondo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Owens et al., 2015</xref>), but also highlights how MW1 only has preference for mHTT and is not specific for HTT species with polyQ tracts above the disease threshold length.</p><p id="P21">To understand if this finding for MW1-epitope interaction is specific to HTT, we next investigated another polyQ tract containing protein, ataxin-3. Using two different polyQ length ataxin-3 proteins, we repeated the ELISA protocol with ataxin-3 Q10 or Q80 adhered to the plate this time. We observe the same pattern for these two proteins with A<sub>450</sub> maximal signal greatly increased for Q80 vs Q10 and the calculated K<sub>app</sub> values much lower for Q80 than Q10, indicating much tighter binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P22">In our western blot analysis of the full-length HTT allelic series, approximately equal amounts of each HTT protein were analysed by western blot, probing with MW1 and also EPR5526, a polyQ independent antibody which targets another region of the exon 1 sequence. Similar to our ELISA experiments, we observed polyQ tract length dependent binding of MW1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>) with only faint bands observed for HTT proteins with wildtype polyQ tract lengths. Calculating the normalised signal ratio of MW1/EPR5526, we observe an inflection point ∼Q36 with stabilised signal ratio for HTT proteins with polyQ tract &gt;42. Together, this further validates our conclusion that MW1 interaction with HTT is polyQ length driven but not specific for mHTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">In this study we show that mHTT ultrasensitive detection assay signal is dependent on many factors beyond protein concentration, including fragmentation, protein-protein interaction, affinity tag positioning, oligomerization and polyglutamine tract length. Additionally, we demonstrate that MW1 has preference but not specificity for mHTT and can bind wildtype HTT, albeit with reduced affinity compared to disease-range polyQ tract length proteoforms of mHTT.</p><p id="P24">Biological fluid samples from HD animal models and patients, such as CSF, contain a heterogenous mix of mHTT and wildtype HTT species, including fragments and oligomeric assemblies, subsets of which could be detected with different antibody pairs in ultrasensitive immunoassays. However, to absolutely quantify mHTT, wildtype HTT or total HTT, many different antibody pairs and protein standards would have to be used and interpreting overlapping signals in these assays to absolutely define the precise mHTT proteoform composition in a sample would be very challenging. Another caveat in capturing different HTT proteoforms in immunoassays it that HTT antibody generation has been historically focused on targeting the N-terminal region of the protein, especially epitopes within the exon 1 region of the protein. It is possible that C-terminal fragments of HTT that arise from different proteolytic cleavage events are still not accounted for with the antibodies currently used in these assays. HTT is a protein scaffold in both its wildtype and disease forms, forming complex 3D structural assemblies of multi-protein complexes. Whether any of the interactions are maintained for extracellular HTT in different biofluid samples is unclear. This is an important consideration for HTT detection assays as some HTT protein-protein interactions almost certainly shield or occlude HTT antibody-epitope binding and thus alter assay signal. We demonstrate that buffer conditions of different stringency can alter assay signal arising from apo HTT compared to HTT in complex with HAP40. Ensuring all proteoforms are detected would be critical for absolute determination of “total” HTT protein levels, which cannot be achieved with current technology.</p><p id="P25">Our data demonstrate that mHTT detection assay signal is influenced by polyQ tract length, corroborating the findings of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Vauleon et al., 2023</xref>). MW1 interaction with HTT is dependent on the polyQ tract length, showing preference but not specificity for disease-length polyQ tracts for both the denatured and native full-length HTT protein. This finding means that even measuring a single form or fragment of mHTT in a cohort of patient samples would be very difficult given the variation of polyQ tract length between individuals and even within a single patient sample due to variation over the disease course which arises due to somatic expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aviolat et al., 2019</xref>). This mismatch in polyQ tract length protein standards and biological samples accounts for the mHTT detection paradox where mHTT levels exceed total HTT quantified in a single sample due to vastly different antibody-protein stoichiometry and therefore assay signal between antibody pairs used to detect HTT. This finding is applicable to other polyQ containing proteins where polyQ tract expansion also occurs during disease as we demonstrate with our analysis of wildtype and SCA3 representative ataxin-3 proteins.</p><p id="P26">Even with these caveats in mind, ultrasensitive HTT detection assays still have an important role to play in our evaluation of HTT as a biomarker of HD, and for assessment of target engagement of HTT-lowering therapeutics. We propose the recommendations laid out in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="BX1">Box 1</xref>, which advocate for relative quantitation of HTT to be reported by such assays rather than reporting HTT protein concentration, and that mHTT depletion assays are reconsidered as an approach to measure wildtype HTT. Relative reporting of assay data will also allow data interoperability and comparison across different clinical and preclinical studies.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Protein Construct Information</title><p id="P27">All protein expression constructs used in this study have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Denis et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Harding et al., 2019</xref>) and are available through Addgene.
