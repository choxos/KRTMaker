A major factor responsible for such seamless assembly are the preferential interactions between the constituent macromolecules, either associative or segregative, that can drive de-mixing to produce co-existing phases, and thus provide a dynamic intracellular compartmentalization. But how these two types of interactions, occurring simultaneously within the cytoplasmic space, influence each other is still largely unknown. This makes understanding and applying the molecular interactions that interfere with each other in such crowded environments crucial when engineering increasingly complex synthetic cells. Here, we show that the interplay between segregative and associative phase separation within cell-mimicking vesicles can lead to rich dynamics between them. Using on-chip microfluidic systems, we encapsulate the associative and segregative components in cell-sized containers and trigger their phase separations to create hierarchical structures that act as molecular recruiters, membrane targeting agents, and initiators of condensation. The obtained multiphase architecture provides an isolated microenvironment for condensates, restricting their molecular communication as well as diffusive motion, and leading to budding-like behaviour at the lipid membrane. In conclusion, we propose segregative phase separation as a universal condensate regulation strategy in managing molecular distribution, condensate location, as well as membrane interaction. We believe our approach will facilitate controlling the behaviour of membraneless organelles within synthetic cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The interior of a living cell is an incredibly crowded and dynamic environment packed with a vast array of biopolymers and organelles. In this extraordinarily crowded aqueous space, proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules constantly deplete and interact, creating a highly active and bustling ecosystem. Bottom-up synthetic biology is an approach that aims to unravel the underlying fundamental principles by constructing self-assembled, cell-mimicking systems from fundamental biomolecules. This makes understanding and applying the molecular interactions that interfere with each other in such crowded environments crucial when building synthetic cells. Commencing with simple models, such as cell-sized vesicles, one can customize and engineer biological systems, leading to increasingly complex intracellular architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Both membrane-bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) and membraneless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) modules can be constructed to achieve this, with the latter being more dynamic and gaining increasing attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Within the intracellular environment, membraneless organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) serve multifaceted functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) and often interact with cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). As a result, understanding and applying model membraneless organelles is key to engineering more complex synthetic cell systems, achieving basic cellular functions, and move towards specific applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Since the groundbreaking discovery of membraneless organelles such as P granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) and the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), the mechanism behind their formation, the phenomenon of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), has garnered increased recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Based on how the molecules are organized within the resulting phases, LLPS can be broadly characterized as either associative phase separation (APS) or segregative phase separation (SPS). APS occurs when there are strong intermolecular forces, such as charge-based attraction between the molecules, causing them to form a condensed liquid phase, commonly referred to as a coacervate or a condensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). In contrast, SPS is driven in mixtures of polymers with distinct chemical properties, resulting in immiscible, segregated polymer-rich phases, and thereby minimizing contact between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In recent years, there have been active efforts to mimic cellular systems by triggering APS inside synthetic cells leading to dynamic processes, such as reversible condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), intracellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), biochemical reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), and membrane interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In the cellular environment, the functional effectiveness of condensates is tuned by confining them to distinct locations such as the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, or nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Thus, replicating these behaviors within synthetic confinements would represent a significant stride in the realm of synthetic cell studies. Despite fruitful advancements, achieving the precise localization of coacervates requires cumbersome procedures including the use of additional ingredients in the membrane and condensates, e.g., charged lipids and condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), condensates with hydrophobic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), or sealing membrane pores with condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Another challenge is the restriction of the coacervate movement, with existing strategies allowing them to move freely across the entire membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). This non-specific localization may not always be favorable for coacervate functionality, for example, to attain cell polarity or restrict physical contact with other membrane-bound entities. Last but not least, the cross-talk between condensates and the membrane’s inner leaflet still requires further exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). The wetting behavior of condensates is primarily being investigated via interactions with the outer membrane leaflet, leading to shape changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) and coacervate penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Likewise, triggering intracellular coacervation and their interactions with the membrane from the inner leaflet may lead to budding- or even exocytosis-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Thus, gaining spatiotemporal control over internal coacervates is important for engineering synthetic cells.</p><p id="P5">SPS, on the other hand, is considered an important tool for mimicking cellular behavior in a crowded environment. Utilizing common molecular crowders, SPS is widely applied for intracellular compartmentalization via temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), or osmolyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) trigger. The resulting LLPS can influence morphological changes in the membrane including budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), tube formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), asymmetric division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) as well as distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), and phase separation of membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Using liposomes, prior studies have used SPS to construct polar structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), or liposomes with multiple distinct compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). However, although APS and SPS are both well-established individually, their simultaneous and dynamic occurrence within the cytoplasmic space remains unclear. Therefore, understanding the interaction between APS and SPS and combining their respective advantages is of great significance for the study of synthetic cells.</p><p id="P6">In this paper, we explore and utilize SPS-APS interplay in microconfinements to regulate various coacervate behaviors including molecular enrichment, membrane-targeting, restricted diffusion, and budding at lipid membranes. Using polyethylene glycol (PEG)/dextran (DEX) as the SPS system and poly-L-lysine (PLL)/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as the APS system, we first conducted bulk experiments to demonstrate the recruitment of coacervates and the physicochmically restrictive environment offered by the SPS-induced membrane-free confinements (SMCs). Then, utilizing on-chip microfluidic production techniques, we encapsulated the APS and SPS components within water-in-oil-in-water double emulsions as well as liposomes. Based on these two synthetic cell models, we investigated either free or membrane-bound SMCs in regulating coacervates. Osmolarity-triggered SMCs were found to relocate specific coacervate components (PLL), capable of targeted migration to the membrane. Via a pH trigger, we constructed multiphase coacervate-in-SMC architectures that could be either suspended in the lumen or distributed on the membrane in the form of micron-sized buds. When confined to the membrane by SMCs, the coacervates remained largely isolated from each other and showed highly restricted diffusion. Overall, we achieved diverse coacervate regulation strategies in vesicles using APS-SPS-membrane interplay. This universal strategy provides a new path for mimicking membraneless organelles in synthetic cells and further studying the complex interactions between SPS, APS, and the lipid membrane for advancing synthetic cells.</p><sec id="S1"><title>SPS physicochemically regulates condensate dynamics</title><p id="P7">We utilized PEG (8 kDa) and DEX (≈10 kDa), two commonly used chemically dissimilar and electrically neutral polymers, as a model system for SPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). To facilitate subsequent experiments, we first established binodal curves for PEG/DEX using a variation of cloud-point titration for varying conditions of pH, viscosity, and buffer concentrations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref> for details, also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure ??</xref>). Regardless of the varied conditions, the system exhibited consistent binodal curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>), providing us with a reliable compartmentalization system in the subsequent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). As a model APS system, we used PLL and ATP, an extensively used molecular pair that undergoes complex coacervation via electrostatic attraction. To begin investigating the APS-SPS interactions, we assessed the tendency of PLL and ATP to get sequestered into one of the SPS phases, by calculating their partition coefficients (<italic>K</italic>) for the two phases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref> for details). As can be clearly seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, there is a pronounced increase in the ratio of PLL fluorescence in the DEX-rich phase over that in the PEG-rich phase (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>PLL</italic></sub>), with the values increasing significantly further with increasing concentrations of PEG or DEX. On the contrary, <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>ATP</italic></sub> exhibited a value around 1 irrespective of the PEG/DEX concentrations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>), indicating ATP did not show any significant preference for either phase.</p><p id="P8">To further investigate the regulation of coacervates within a segregative system, we triggered APS and SPS simultaneously by mixing the four components under phase separation conditions, i.e., DEX and PEG concentrations were above the binodal, and the pH (6.3) was suitable for PLL/ATP coacervation. We obtained multi-phase emulsion droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>), where PLL/ATP droplets were formed and confined within the DEX-rich SMCs, segregated from the PEG-rich environment. We also noted strong partitioning of DEX in the formed condensates, clear from the fluorescence overlap of cy5-labelled DEX and FITC-labelled PLL. We observed the coalescence of SMC domains as well as of the coacervates present inside. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref> shows, PLL/ATP condensates readily fused with each other upon physical contact, followed by their relaxation into a bigger spherical condensate, indicating their liquid-like behavior within the DEX-rich phase. However, the physical contact was possible only for the coacervates within the same SMC. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref> show the coacervate movement strictly within the SMC domains, even when accentuated by an external fluid flow. Thus, SMC domains acted as incubation chambers for the condensates and physically restricted them.</p><p id="P9">Next, we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to examine the diffusion of coacervate components in such a setting. To check this systematically, we bleached the FITC-PLL fluorescence of entire coacervates in four different environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref>): (i) without any DEX or PEG; (ii) in presence of 12 mM DEX; (iii) in presence of 12 mM PEG; and (iv) in presence of 12 mM PEG + 12 mM DEX (SPS conditions). In the first case, we obtained a fluorescence recovery of 85% within 20 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref> - green panel). The addition of DEX reduced the extent of recovery to almost 50% within the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref> - red panel). In presence of PEG, the recovery further decreased to only 22% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref> - black panel). This trend reached its highest extent for the coacervates in SMCs, where only 15% fluorescence was recovered after 20 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref> - blue panel). The extent of recovery is affected by the PLL concentration in the surrounding dilute phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), especially since the entire coacervate was bleached. In the case where DEX and/or PEG was present, the decrease in recovery is likely aided by the higher viscosity of the surrounding environment, slowing down the diffusion of PLL molecules. Additionally, the depletion effect by crowding agents has been demonstrated to induce the higher partitioning of PLL in the coacervate phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), further hindering the recovery. The lowest recovery in the case of coacervates confined within SMCs is a result of concentrated, and thus highly viscous DEX-rich surrounding, and confirms a chemically isolated environment, even for multiple coacervates present within the same SMC. We also observed concomitant differences in the diffusion coefficients of the PLL molecules (<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>app,PLL</italic></sub>). Compared to the control case of no PEG or DEX (1.1 <italic>μ</italic>m<sup>2</sup>/s), <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>app</italic>,<italic>PLL</italic></sub> in PEG and DEX solutions (both ≈ 0.6 <italic>μ</italic>m<sup>2</sup>/s) was substantially lower (p-value &lt; 0.05, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1j</xref>), likely due to the increased viscosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). The coacervates confined within the SMC exhibited even lower diffusion coefficient, <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>app</italic>,<italic>PLL</italic></sub> ≈ 0.4<italic>μ</italic>m<sup>2</sup>/s. Thus, these FRAP results indicate that the molecular diffusion between the coacervates and their environment, as well as with neighboring coacervates, is strictly restricted when the coacervates are confined within SMCs.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>APS-SPS multiphase structures within non-membranous microconfinements</title><p id="P10">Based on the interactions between APS and SPS in bulk, we next turned our attention to whether this hierarchical structure of membraneless compartments would still arise in confined synthetic cell models. We began with applying a simplified synthetic cell model: water-in-oil-in-water double emulsions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). The required APS and SPS components were efficiently encapsulated within double emulsions (osmolarity ≈ 70 mOsm) using a previously established microfluidic platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref> for details). The concentration of the SPS components were kept below the binodal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>) while the pH was kept at 4.5 in order to prevent coacervation. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a-b</xref> show, we simultaneously triggered both APS and SPS within the double emulsions using a hypertonic (500 mM sucrose), high pH (8.6) buffer. The hypertonic buffer caused water efflux, decreasing the double emulsion volume, and increasing the concentration of the encapsulated SPS components above the binodal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), while the high pH environment caused proton flux across the boundary, increasing the pH value of the lumen and inducing complex coacervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Thus, post-trigger, the homogeneous interior of the double emulsions underwent both APS and SPS, resulting in a multiphase structures. The process was similar to what was observed in bulk settings, in which DEX-rich phases readily fused with each other, eventually forming a single SMC, in which the coacervate was confined. We observed that while some double emulsions first showed SPS and others APS, all of them ultimately formed similar multiphase structure. As seen in bulk experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>), we observed increased cy5-DEX fluorescence in the coacervate, suggesting a secondary DEX enrichment within the coacervate.</p><p id="P11"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref> shows the size variation of double emulsions post-trigger. The double emulsions shrunk from ≈ 41 <italic>μ</italic>m to ≈ 38 <italic>μ</italic>m in the first half an hour, and then showed a gradual but still noticeable shrinkage over the next 3 hours before reaching a plateau. Afterward, their size remained constant at ≈ 36.5 <italic>μ</italic>m. Based on the observed volume reduction, concomitant increase in the encapsulated DEX and PEG concentrations were calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref> for details). These final concentrations were above the binodal curve, aligning with the observed SMC formation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>, the proportion of double emulsions containing multiphase structures increased rapidly until it plateaued at 70% after 4 hours. We noted that the obtained multiphase structures were not stable over a long-term as the coacervate gradually dissolved over 12 hours (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure ??</xref>). Nonetheless, we were able to construct a multi-level compartment within double emulsions over the time scale of a several hours, with the MSCs effectively restricting the coacervates.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>SMCs recruit coacervate components to the lipid membrane</title><p id="P12">To further understand the role of the SPS regulation system in a biomimetic system, we turned to liposomes - aqueous confinements surrounded by a lipid bilayer. We used Octanol-assisted liposome assembly (OLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), a liposome generation-visualization microfluidic technique to conduct these experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Based on the well-known interaction between the DEX-rich domain and lipid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), we thought of directing the APS molecules to the membrane via SMCs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a-b</xref>, cell-sized (10 − 20 <italic>μ</italic>m in diameter) liposomes were produced, encapsulating the APS and SPS components. To start with, we solely triggered SPS by adding an equal volume of feeding aqueous solution (containing 600 mM sucrose in 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0) to the liposome suspension (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Materials and Methods</xref>). The final pH of the mixture was measured to be 5.1 due to buffering, thus no induction of APS is to be expected. We further demonstrated only SPS formation by triggering the same system in double emulsions, which eliminates any membrane interactions and thus makes it easier to assess the phase separation, and exclusively observing SPS formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure ??</xref>). As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref> shows, clear shrinkage in the liposome size was observed after feeding (panels at 384 s), confirming the expected response to the hypertonic environment. Meanwhile, multiple SMCs formed, as evidenced by the increased DEX fluorescence. As expected, there was an overlap of PLL and DEX fluorescence within SMC regions, indicating the recruitment of PLL.</p><p id="P13">Notably, the SMCs, with PLL recruited inside, readily interacted with the phospholipid membrane. By scanning across different planes, all liposomes within a batch (<italic>n</italic> = 79) were observed to have formed bud-like structures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref> shows an example, displaying two planes of a liposome 30 minutes post-trigger. In the plane of the SMC bud, marked by a circular lipid structure on the membrane surface, high DEX and PLL fluorescence intensities were observed within the buds. The equatorial plane (insert) shows the non-budded part of the liposome with no SMC localization at the membrane. An intensity profile across the bud (dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>), showed a strong peak in both DEX and PLL fluorescence, as well as increased lipid fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). This overlap of increased lipid fluorescence confirms the pronounced nature of these SMC buds, while being covered by the lipid membrane.</p><p id="P14">Due to the recruitment within SMCs, PLL molecules were transported to the membrane surface. By plotting the PLL fluorescence intensity as a function of the distance from the center of the liposomes, the PLL fluorescence was indeed observed to be localized at the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 10). Furthermore, these PLL-enriched SMCs at the membrane could be seen undergoing fusion events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>). As the two SMCs (indicated by white arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>) came into contact, they merged into a single entity (indicated by green arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>). These fusion events suggest that the coverage of SMCs by the membrane is incomplete, resulting in protruding buds that are open at the base. Apart from the fusion, the budded SMCs also showed two-dimensional diffusion on the membrane surface (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3g</xref> shows the trajectories of several membrane-bound SMCs, restricted along the membrane surface. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3h</xref>, their mean square displacement (MSD) increased linearly in time (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99), indicating an unrestricted two-dimensional (2D) diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Thus, even if the budded SMCs are coupled to the membrane, they, and as a result the sequestered cargo, are free to diffuse along the membrane.</p><p id="P15">In conclusion, we demonstrated the transport capability of SMCs for APS components towards the lipid membrane as well as their diffusive motion at the membrane surface. This targeted recruitment is key for triggering coacervation at the membrane, to which we then turned our attention.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Regulation of coacervates by membrane-interacting SMCs</title><p id="P16">Based on the SPS-induced PLL migration, we further explored the possibility of inducing coacervation at the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). For this, we applied similar hypertonic conditions by adding equal amounts of feeding aqueous solution (containing 500 mM sucrose in 15 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6) to the liposome suspension (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Materials and Methods</xref>). The resulting pH after mixing the solutions in equal parts was 6.3, sufficient for APS triggering. This was also demonstrated by triggering both SPS and APS in the double emulsions using the same encapsulated components and triggers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure ??</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref> shows fluorescence time-lapse images of the process in liposomes (also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 3</xref>). As can be seen, both SPS and APS occured within minutes inside the liposome, along with the expected shrinkage of the liposome. The SMCs initially appeared within the liposome interior, after which they wetted the membrane surface and reshaped the liposome into a ‘flower-like’ shape. The SMC domains, representing the ‘petals’, showed strong partitioning of PLL into them. PLL/ATP coacervates were subsequently formed in SMCs and remained close to the membrane. Noticeably, unlike in the case of double emulsions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), SMCs with coacervates did not remain suspended in the lumen but ultimately migrated to the membrane surface.</p><p id="P17"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 4</xref> show the 3D rendering of the final morphology of a liposome, captured 20 minutes post-trigger. Multiple DEX-rich petals (in cyan) could be seen, restructuring the liposome into a flower shape. The liposomes showed different morphologies in different planes due to the random distribution of the petals, some of which harbored the formed coacervates (in green) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure ??</xref>). Fluorescence-based frequency maps for DEX and PLL further clarified the DEX-rich nature of the petals and the strong confinement experienced by the coacervates within them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Methods</xref> for details). The formed SMC domains remained quite stable since the attached membrane dynamically arrested their coarsening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref> shows, after 20 minutes of incubation in a high pH, hypertonic environment, 52% of the liposomes (<italic>n</italic> = 27) still maintained multiple ‘petals’ as opposed to a single SMC; 57% of these SMCs contained coacervates.</p><p id="P18">Similar to the bulk results, DEX fluorescence intensity heat map based on confocal images clearly showed sequential DEX recruitment in the flower-shaped liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f</xref>). The first recruitment happened in the petals where the DEX intensity was 2.5 times that of the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4g</xref>). Further fluorescence enhancement occurred at the condensates trapped within, showing about 1.7 times further increase in the intensity. As pointed out by the arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4h</xref>, the confined coacervates showed a budding behavior, protruding away from the liposome but still surrounded by the lipid membrane. Based on these observations, we concluded that both SMCs and DEX-rich coacervates interact with membranes, forming relatively large petal-like and much smaller bud-like protrusions, respectively.</p><p id="P19">Importantly, the coacervates were not only restricted by SMCs, and also by their budding behaviour. The individual trajectories in each petal shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4i</xref> confirm the random but restricted motion of coacervates (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 6</xref>). Due to the separation of the SMCs, the coacervates remained isolated and could not come in contact with others residing in different petals. We analyzed the diffusive behaviour of the coacervates, based on their MSD. While the MSD trajectory increased linearly at the beginning, it soon plateaued for longer time periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4j</xref>), indicating this diffusion was free at short times but the effect of barriers became dominant at longer times. Such diffusive motion, exhibiting free movement but within a bounded region, resembled a corralled diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Indeed, the corresponding equation, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) MSD ≃ <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the corral size, <italic>D</italic> is diffusion coefficient, and <italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub> are constants determined by the corral geometry, fitted the observed MSD behaviour very well (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99). The corresponding corral size <inline-formula><mml:math id="M3"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> was calculated as 0.7 <italic>μm</italic><sup>2</sup>, representing the average restricted area provided by the SPS domain. Comparing the diffusion of these confined coacervates with the membrane-diffusing SMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) indicated that the diffusion coefficient of the SMC buds was 2.8 times higher than that of the coacervate buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4k</xref>). This slower diffusion is likely caused by the higher viscosity and the crowded environment in the DEX-rich SMCs.</p><p id="P20">Thus, we demonstrated APS-membrane interplay with SMCs acting as the mediator between the membrane and the lumen. Such SPS-based regulation of coacervates can prove useful in directed compartmentalization within engineered synthetic cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="discussion | conclusions"><title>Discussion and Conclusion</title><p id="P21">It is well-established that preferential interactions between constituent molecules, either associative or segregative, can destroy homogeneity, drive de-mixing, and produce co-existing phases within cellular systems. But how these two types of interactions, occurring simultaneously and dynamically within the cytoplasmic space, influence each other is still largely unknown. Using a model system consisting of four components in synthetic giant vesicles, we have demonstrated that SPS can regulate APS at both molecular and coacervate level. We further showcase that the APS-SPS-membrane interplay can generate an entirely new degree of freedom regulating dynamic reorganization, spatial localization, movement restriction, and surface interactions of condensates within the crowded aqueous space.</p><p id="P22">We show molecular enrichment via SPS-based membraneless confinements (SMCs) recruiting and transporting molecules to the membrane (or keeping them in the lumen), allowing further condensation under the right conditions. Such membrane-targeted migration of molecules could improve the efficiency of on-membrane or transmembrane reactions and it will be beneficial to assess the generality of such affinity-based compartmentalization in diverse chemical systems including elastin-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) and other polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), or even nanoliposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Interestingly, SMCs have also been demonstrated to partition non-biorelevant components like metal particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>) or organic polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). These substances, which normally do not exist in living organisms, may bring new functionalities to synthetic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>).</p><p id="P23">We further demonstrated that SMCs can spatially restrict the coacervate movement. Moreover, due to the lack of molecular communication across coacervates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), even within the same SMC, each coacervate can be considered independent. Therefore, for reaction cascades, these coacervate-in-SMC multiphases may be a good strategy for providing a membrane-free domain. Also, as the observed SPS is mainly driven by concentration and is stable across a wider pH range, one can easily switch the electrostatic environment to tune APS individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Such hierarchical multiphase assembly with distinct triggers allows for a more flexible and dynamic control.</p><p id="P24">While high-throughput single emulsion microfluidics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>) provides an efficient solution for studying sub-compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>), the phase separation largely depends on the encapsulated components rather than the subsequent external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>), making the single emulsion system relatively inflexible. The double emulsion system we used here provides the ability to trigger processes within the containers simply by tuning the extracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Notably, double emulsions are robust in various physicochemical variations including pH, temperature and osmotic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), making them a handy system if membrane interactions are not necessary or to be deliberately avoided.</p><p id="P25">When it comes to the use of liposomes, APS-membrane interactions are facilitated via SMCs. With existing coacervate-membrane binding usually relying on conjugations including charge-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) and hydrophobic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) interactions, SMCs-based delivery shown here can be considered a conjugation-free strategy. Furthermore, more often than not, APS/SPS interactions with the membrane are studied from the outer leaflet, partly owing to the difficulty of encapsulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Because of our microfluidic approach, we are able to study them from inside the liposomes, allowing us to mimic a more natural system.</p><p id="P26">In synthetic cell confinements, the isolation of coacervates as individual reaction hubs has high significance but still requires exploration. Here, the membrane-bound SMCs offer microchambers for the co-existence of multiple similar condensates within a single liposome. As SMCs can be stable for hours without fusion, they can provide independent compartments for their subordinate coacervates, and this stability could be further prolonged using lipids with different fluidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Taken together, our results highlight a heretofore unappreciated factor producing new functional levels of organization in cells. Given the vast molecular diversity of the cytoplasmic crowd, which inevitably results in both associative and segregative tendencies, our findings suggest a universal physicochemical principle and a non-specific biological strategy to spatially and temporally regulate biomolecular condensates. This approach has broad applications in controlling the behavior of membraneless organelles and construct diverse synthetic cell architectures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"

(b) A combined binodal curve of PEG (8 kDa) and DEX (10 kDa), obtained by cloud-point titration, under different conditions of pH (3.8 to 9.7), viscosity (with and without glycerol), and ionic strengths (15 and 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer) used throughout this work. Regardless of the conditions, the binodals showed the same trend. The color depth corresponds to the number of data points. (c-d) Three-dimensional surface plots representing the partition coefficients (<italic>K</italic>) of (c) FITC-PLL and (d) cy3-ATP within the SPS system, where K represents the ratio of fluorescence in the DEX-rich phase over that of the PEG-rich phase. Colors represent the extent of partitioning, with red being higher partitioning and blue being lower partitioning. (e) Microscopy images (from left to right: bright-field, DEX fluorescence, PLL fluorescence, merged fluorescence) showing the formation and restriction of coacervates within DEX-rich domains. The dotted circle indicates the boundary of one such SPS domain. As can be seen, fluorescent DEX gets further enriched within the coacervates. Scale bar, 20 <italic>μ</italic>m. (f) PLL/ATP coacervates show their usual liquid-like behavior in the form of droplet fusion within SPS domains. (g) The coacervates remain confined within the DEX-rich domains even in presence of an external fluid flow, as shown by their confined trajectories. Dotted circle indicates the SMC boundary. (h) Time-lapse fluorescence images showing the fluorescence recovery of PLL (3 mg/ml)/ATP (4 mM) coacervates in varying conditions. For f-h, scale bar, 5 <italic>μ</italic>m. (i) Fluorescence recovery curves of FITC-PLL after bleaching the entire PLL/ATP coacervates under varying conditions as indicated in h. (j) Corresponding diffusion coefficients of PLL after fitting the FRAP curves obtained in i. In e-g, the experiments were conducted by mixing 3 mg/ml PLL (unlabelled: FITC-labeled = 5:1, mass ratio), 4 mM ATP, 12 mM DEX and 12 mM PEG. In h-j, the experiments were conducted by mixing 3 mg/ml PLL (unlabelled: FITC-labeled = 5:1, mass ratio) and 4 mM ATP without PEG and DEX (green panel), with 12 mM DEX (red panel), with 12 mM PEG (black panel), and with 12 mM DEX and 12 mM PEG (blue panel).

(b) Bright-field and fluorescence time-lapse images showing the initial state, coacervate formation, and their restriction within SMCs after feeding the double emulsions with a hypertonic, high-pH buffer. The bright-field images show the double emulsion shrinkage as a result of the hypertonic trigger. The DEX fluorescence (shown in cyan) shows the initiation of SPS, eventually leading to a multiphase structure, with the inner DEX-rich phase, marked by a higher intensity. The PLL fluorescence (shown in green) shows a process almost identical to DEX channel, eventually forming a coacervate within the SMC. The images at 0 min show a representative double emulsion before the trigger. The last two fluorescence panels are taken from the bottom plane while the rest are all captured at the equatorial plane. Scale bar, 20 <italic>μ</italic>m. (c) Corresponding mean diameters of the double emulsion population showing significant reduction in size for the first two hours after the trigger; no significant difference (marked NS) was observed after 2.5 hours. Data points represent mean values while the error bars indicate standard deviations (n ≥ 55 double emulsions for each data point). (d) The initial concentration of the encapsulated PEG and DEX (red circle) crosses the binodal (black curve, obtained by fitting the experimental data) after the trigger (blue square, calculated from the volume change). (e) A plot showing the percentage of double emulsions containing coacervates in SMCs after the trigger (n ≥ 61 double emulsions for each data point). For all the experiments, the encapsulated mixture consisted of 7.3 mM DEX (unlabelled: cy5-labeled = 1000:1, molar ratio), 8.6 mM PEG, 2.4 mg/ml PLL (unlabelled: FITC-labeled = 5:1, mass ratio), 0.8 mM ATP, and 15% v/v glycerol in 15 mM citrate-HCl (pH 4).
