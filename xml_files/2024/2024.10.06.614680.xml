However, converging recent evidence in rodent models as well as human neuroimaging suggests that the hippocampus may be involved in a wider range of memory domains, including motor sequence learning (MSL). Nevertheless, no direct link between hippocampal ripples and MSL has yet been established. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography from the hippocampus in 20 epilepsy patients during a MSL task in which participants showed steady improvement across nine 30-second training blocks interspersed with 30-second rest (‘offline’) periods. We first demonstrate that ripple rates strongly increase during rest periods relative to training blocks. Importantly, ripple rates during rest periods tracked learning behaviour, both across blocks and across participants. These results suggest that hippocampal ripples during offline periods play a functional role in motor sequence learning and that the hippocampus may be involved in offline learning beyond episodic memory.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>ripples</kwd><kwd>motor learning</kwd><kwd>consolidation</kwd><kwd>offline periods</kwd><kwd>iEEG</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">How does the human hippocampus contribute to learning and memory? Following the report of patient H.M.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, the distinction between hippocampus-dependent ‘declarative’ and non-hippocampus-dependent ‘non-declarative’ memory has been widely accepted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. However, mounting evidence has begun to challenge the exclusive role of the hippocampus in canonical forms of declarative memory (e.g., episodic memory). For instance, the hippocampus has been implicated in short-term memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, working memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, non-conscious forms of learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> as well as motor skill acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Irrespective of the type of learning, another key question is at which stage of learning hippocampal contributions unfold. That is, learning can be roughly divided into online and offline components, with the former denoting on-task acquisition and retrieval, and the latter including post-acquisition rest periods, spent either awake or asleep. Interestingly, accumulating evidence points to an important role of hippocampal engagement during offline periods, even in tasks that seemingly do not require the hippocampus during acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Hippocampal neurons fire in large synchronous population bursts called sharp waves superimposed by high-frequency bursts named ‘ripples’. Initially observed in rodent hippocampus, ripples during offline states have been linked to replay of navigational trajectories along with consolidation of spatial memories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In humans, hippocampal ripples can be reliably observed via direct recordings from patients undergoing invasive monitoring for the surgical treatment of refractory epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In episodic memory tasks, human ripples have been associated with memory performance both during online recall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> and offline sleep periods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Beyond episodic memory tasks though, the involvement of hippocampal ripples in learning remains unclear.</p><p id="P4">In the present study, we ask whether hippocampal ripples play a functional role in motor skill learning. To this end, we examined hippocampal ripple attributes during a motor sequence learning paradigm in epilepsy patients. We report a strong increase of ripple rates during offline rest relative to online task periods. Importantly, these offline ripple increases were directly linked to learning behaviour, tracking performance improvements within and across participants.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P5">Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from the human hippocampus were obtained from 20 participants (11 male, mean age 30.5 years, range 20 – 58 years, 2 left-handed; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) undergoing invasive monitoring as part of their treatment for refractory epilepsy at the University Hospital Erlangen (Erlangen, Germany). Ethical approval was granted by the ethics commission of the Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (142_12B). Written informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Behavioural task</title><p id="P6">Participants performed an explicit motor sequence learning (MSL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>) task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> with their non-dominant hand where they repetitively typed a 5-item numerical sequence (1-4-2-3-1) displayed on a screen as quickly and as accurately as possible. Keypress 1 was performed with the little finger, keypress 2 with the ring finger, keypress 3 with the middle finger, and keypress 4 with the index finger. Individual keypress times and identities were recorded for behavioural data analysis. Participants performed the typing (‘training’) task for 9 consecutive blocks, with each block lasting 30 seconds. 30 seconds rest periods were interleaved between training blocks (8 blocks of rest periods). During the training task, participants were instructed to fixate on the five-item sequence continuously displayed on the screen. To facilitate sequential training, a hexagon was shown below the to-be-pressed item and would only proceed to the next item upon a correct key press. During the rest periods, the sequence was replaced with a countdown proceeding from 30 to 0 in one-second increments, and participants were instructed to fixate on this countdown. The experiment was designed and delivered using MATLAB (MathWorks) and Psychophysics Toolbox v.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Before the task started, a practice session was administered using the simplified sequence 4-3-2-1-4. For an exploratory analysis, 8 participants were randomly assigned to a “sound” condition, whereas 12 were assigned to the “no sound” condition. In the “sound” condition, keypress 1-2-3-4 were paired with the tones CDEF, respectively. A linear mixed effects analysis revealed no effects of sound condition on learning rates (F<sub>(1,158)</sub> = 1.104; <italic>p</italic> = 0.295). Similarly, a linear mixed effects analysis revealed no effects of handedness on learning rates (F<sub>(1,158)</sub> = 0.509; <italic>p</italic> = 0.295). Therefore, participants were pooled together for all subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Learning metric</title><p id="P7">Motor sequence performance was quantified integrating speed and accuracy, using the inverse of time (in seconds) required to complete a correct keypress. A keypress was deemed correct if it occurred within any correct 5-item response pattern (1-4-2-3-1, 4-2-3-1-1, 2-3-1-1-4, 3-1-1-4-2, 1-1-4-2-3). This approach allowed us to quantify motor sequence learning within each training block at the resolution of individual keypresses. Block performance was summarized as the median typing speed over the 30-seconds training block<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Recording system and electrodes</title><p id="P8">Recordings were performed using Behnke–Fried depth electrodes (Ad-Tech Medical Instrument Corporation). The electrodes were connected to an ATLAS system (Neuralynx) and recorded with a sampling rate of 2048 Hz. Electrode placements were determined by clinical criteria and only patients with hippocampal electrodes were included in the current study. We used a bipolar referencing scheme using the two most medial electrode contracts. For visualization, electrode coordinates were converted to MNI space (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) using the brainstorm-toolbox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Ripple detection</title><p id="P9">After pre-processing steps (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>), ripples were identified by an initial time domain detection procedure followed by a frequency domain assessment for accepting/rejecting candidate events.

For identified ripples, we summarized four attributes: 1) ripple rate (Hz), calculated by using the number of detected ripple events divided by artifact-free experiment time in seconds, 2) ripple duration (ms), 3) ripple max amplitude (mV) calculated using the ripple band-passed signal, and 4) ripple peak frequency (Hz).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P10">To capture the improvement of typing speed across learning blocks, linear mixed-effects models were employed, using participant and block number as random effects [<italic>Typing Speed<sub>ij</sub> ~ Block<sub>j</sub> + (Block<sub>ij</sub> | Participant<sub>i</sub>)</italic>].

Results confirmed that participants’ typing speed reliably improved across blocks, with an increase of 0.09 correct key presses per block (F<sub>(1,159)</sub> = 89.58; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Random effects confirmed that participants’ learning slopes were positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>), showing that all participants’ typing speed improved across training blocks.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Ripple attributes for MSL training and rest periods</title><p id="P14">Hippocampal ripples were detected based on established criteria after rigorous artifact rejection (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Methods</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref> shows the grand-average ripple across <italic>n</italic> =38 contacts along with an individual ripple example. After ripple events were detected, we examined four attributes of ripples during MSL training vs. interspersed resting periods: rate, duration, amplitude, and peak frequency (with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). Results revealed an increase of ripple rate during resting compared to training periods. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref> illustrates this effect by showing a raster plot of ripples pooled across all contacts, participants and training vs. resting periods. Group linear mixed-effects analysis of ripple attributes, with task condition (training, resting) as a fixed effect and participant as random effects, revealed a significant main effect of task for ripple rate, where ripple rates were higher during resting periods than during training periods by 0.01 Hz on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>, F<sub>(1,50)</sub> = 24.250; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Ripple duration was longer during resting compared to training periods by 1.336 ms (F<sub>(1,50)</sub> = 4.098; <italic>p</italic> = 0.048), but this effect did not survive Bonferroni correction.

If so, ripple rates during resting periods should mirror behavioural performance increases across blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Examining training and resting ripple rates across blocks, we indeed observed a steady increase in resting ripple rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). To quantify this effect, we used a group linear mixed-effects analysis to examine the interaction between MSL experiment blocks (1-8) and task condition (training vs rest), using task condition and block number as fixed effects and participant as random effects. Results revealed a significant interaction between task condition and block number on ripple rate (F<sub>(1,524)</sub> = 6.109; <italic>p</italic> = 0.014), due to the difference between resting vs. training ripple rates increasing by 0.01 Hz on average per block. We tested the model against its nested model (only including main effects of condition and block, without the interaction term), using a Likelihood Ratio (LR) Test, which confirmed that the interaction significantly contributed to the modulation of ripple rate (LR = 6.108; <italic>p</italic> = 0.014). To more directly test the association between offline ripple rates and performance increases across blocks, we modelled the slope of typing speed and the slope of normalised rest ripple rates across learning blocks using linear mixed-effects models, with blocks as a fixed effect and block/participant as random effects. We then extracted the slope term for each participant and correlated the normalised resting ripple slopes with typing speed slopes. Across participants, we observed a positive correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>; Spearman’s rho = .556; <italic>p</italic> = .022). In short, participants who showed a greater performance increase across blocks of training also had higher ripple rate increases across blocks of resting periods.</p><p id="P16">Lastly, we wanted to test whether offline ripples not only track MSL performance across participants, but also predict – within a given participant – block-to-block changes in performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). In other words, are stronger performance improvements from block <italic>n</italic> to block <italic>n</italic>+1 accompanied by greater ripple rates in the intermittent resting period? To tackle this question, we used a group linear mixed-effects analysis to examine whether the normalised ripple rates during rest periods (ripple rate during resting compared to training) can predict typing speed, with block number and participant as random effects. We used typing speed in the previous block as a covariate, allowing to isolate whether changes in typing speed between blocks are predicted by ripple rates during interleaved rest periods. Group linear mixed-effects analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between offline ripple rate and typing speed improvement, such that every unit increase in normalised ripple rates is associated with a 0.08 keypresses/second increase in typing speed (F(1,231) = 12.048; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). We tested the model against its nested model (only including typing speed in the previous block as the fixed effects; without ripple rate), using a LR Test, and found that normalised rest ripple rates significantly contributed to the prediction of typing speed during the subsequent block (LR ratio = 5.64; <italic>p =</italic> .018).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Hippocampal ripples have recently emerged as a viable mechanism to support episodic memory processes in humans. However, beyond episodic memory, we have the remarkable ability to continuously acquire complex motor skills, from riding a bicycle to playing a musical instrument. Before becoming effortless and automatic, this kind of learning involves integrating separate movements into a unified and coordinated sequence of actions under certain rules or constraints. Here, using a well-established motor sequence learning (MSL) task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), we asked whether the hippocampus might be involved in learning such motor skills. We first confirmed that all participants improved performance across experimental blocks. Next, we demonstrated that hippocampal ripple rates were strongly modulated by MSL resting vs. typing periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Finally, we found direct links between these offline ripple rates and learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Specifically, rest period (vs. typing) ripple rates not only increased with block number, but also predicted performance changes across blocks as well as across participants. These findings suggest that hippocampal ripples during rest periods contribute to motor sequence learning.</p><p id="P18">A recent human iEEG study examined hippocampal ripples during various cognitive tasks and found that ripples were not unique to episodic memory behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Instead, ripples occurred with similar attributes during other visual perceptual tasks. Of note, ripples showed highest occurrence rates and longest durations during resting states (6-min eyes open/closed) compared to active tasks. These results dovetail with evidence that the hippocampus contributes to learning during offline periods even in tasks that show no apparent hippocampal involvement during active acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. It deserves mention though that recent work in humans has also implicated hippocampal ripples during ‘online’ parts (encoding and retrieval) of episodic memory tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, albeit without assessing ripples during offline delay periods in the same experiment. Our current results suggest that at least in motor skill acquisition, offline ripples might play a more important role for behavioural improvements than online ripples.</p><p id="P19">How might hippocampal ripples during offline periods contribute to motor skill learning? A recent model proposes that the hippocampus may act as a sequence generator, connecting encoded items of different modalities in space/time via ripples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. We speculate that during MSL rest periods, the hippocampus may reactivate information about the sequence, leading to behavioural improvements in task performance. The relevance of offline periods for motor skills acquisition has been well established. For example, distributed practice, where frequent rest periods are interspersed with practice (training) blocks, has been shown to be more effective for skill learning compared to massed practice, where the same total amount of practice is performed over longer continuous blocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In light of our current findings, one tentative interpretation of this pattern is that an increased number of offline periods provides more opportunity for the hippocampus to drive reactivation and set consolidation processes in motion. It is interesting to note that ripples increased not only in occurrence during offline periods in our paradigm, but also in duration (although the effect did not survive Bonferroni correction). Ripple duration has previously been associated with memory reactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and hippocampal-cortical communication during sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Indeed, human fMRI work has provided evidence of hippocampal reactivation after motor skill learning and its relation to consolidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, recent studies employing fine-grained block-by-block analyses of MSL tasks (‘micro-online and -offline gains’) have shown that interspersed rest periods promote consolidation at much shorter timescales (i.e., seconds and minutes) than previously thought<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Accordingly, the ripple engagement we observed during MSL rest periods may reflect a form of rapid consolidation via reactivation that contributes to behavioural improvements across training.</p><p id="P20">While our work focused on hippocampal ripples, motor sequence learning most likely requires dynamic interactions between the hippocampus with cortical (e.g., motor cortex) as well as other subcortical regions (e.g., striatum). Indeed, using multivariate decoding of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, spontaneous replay of the motor sequence representation was reported in sensorimotor and hippocampal regions during wake rest periods, which predicted the magnitude of rapid consolidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Future work combining hippocampal recordings with systematic coverage of specific cortical areas will be needed to understand how hippocampal ripples may drive the cortical replay of motor sequences.</p><p id="P21">In conclusion, our findings integrate and extend prior work in the human and animal hippocampus to suggest that hippocampal ripples during offline periods are associated with motor skill learning. This finding adds growing support to the view that hippocampal ripples serve as an internally generated and state-dependent mechanism for learning beyond the episodic memory domain.</p></sec><sec
