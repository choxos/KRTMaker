Such patterns fulfill both biotic and abiotic functions, mediating plant-pollinator communication and providing protection against damaging UV rays or desiccation. These motifs are often evolutionary labile, varying in size, shape and hue between closely related species and constitute excellent systems to illuminate the evolutionary processes that generate morphological diversity or instead lead to the repetitive emergence of similar forms. <italic>Hibiscus trionum</italic> flowers have a prominent bullseye pattern combining a purple center contrasting against a white margin. <italic>H. trionum</italic> belongs to a small clade of <italic>Hibiscus</italic> known as the Trionum Complex that displays a range of petal patterns within and between species. Here, we integrate phylogenomic approaches, molecular techniques and genetic manipulation to solve species relationships across the Trionum Complex, identify key genes involved in the production of bullseye pigmentation, and reveal molecular events underpinning pattern variation during the evolution of the group. We find that repetitive bullseye reduction events primarily occur through independent modifications of a single genetic locus encoding BERRY1, an R2R3 MYB that regulates anthocyanin pigment production in petals. Moreover, we demonstrate that buff-tailed bumblebees <italic>(Bombus terrestris)</italic> discriminate against flowers with smaller bullseye sizes suggesting that a reduction in bullseye proportions potentially impacts plant fitness and contributes to trait distribution across the group. Collectively, our results demonstrate how repeated mutations in a single locus led to morphological variation in petal patterning, a trait that contributes to angiosperm reproductive isolation and speciation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The molecular basis underlying the repeated evolution of similar morphological characteristics across the tree of life remains a central question of evolutionary biology. Replicated evolution, a term encompassing both parallel and convergent evolution, led different species and populations to independently evolve similar features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">James <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>). While this sometimes relies on the modification of homologous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lenormand <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>), it remains unclear why some genes are more likely than others to mediate parallel or convergent changes. The evolution of color patterns in both plants and animals provides phenotypically striking traits that can be utilized to unravel the molecular mechanisms supporting the evolution of diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Manceau <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Orteu &amp; Jiggins, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Galipot <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). With more than 350,000 extant species, the angiosperms are a living repository of natural diversity. The diversification of flowering plants yielded a remarkable array of morphologies and colorful patterns that decorate corollas. Remarkably, similar motifs are often found in distantly related species. Striking examples include petal stripes in <italic>Gazania</italic> and <italic>Phlox</italic>, venation patterns in <italic>Veronica, Geranium</italic> and <italic>Antirrhinum</italic>, or bullseye patterns in the poached egg plant (<italic>Limnathes douglasii</italic>) and baby blue eyes (<italic>Nemophila menziesii</italic>). Such commonalities hint towards a limited but functionally important set of patterns that independently arose across distantly related angiosperms. It also provides multiple systems with which to investigate the processes that have led to the repeated emergence of similar traits.</p><p id="P3">Petal patterns play crucial roles in key biological processes including plant-pollinator communication, defense against herbivory, and protection from abiotic factors and thus are likely to contribute directly to plant fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fairnie <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>). Insect pollinators can display innate or acquired preferences for given motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gumbert, 2000</xref>), influencing their choice of flower to visit. Importantly, petal patterns also function post-landing, acting as visual guides to lure pollinators toward pollen and/or nectar rewards and increase the chances of successful pollination. The lower petal lobes of the purple monkeyflower (<italic>Mimulus lewisii</italic>), for example, display prominent yellow markings surrounded by dark pink stripes with a white border. Mutants lacking these nectar guides or with reduced petal coloration exhibit significant reductions in pollinator visitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Owen &amp; Bradshaw, 2011</xref>). Further work in yellow monkeyflowers (<italic>Mimulus guttatus</italic>) reinforced the importance of pigmentation patterns for pollinator attraction as bumblebees preferred the flowers of the <italic>red tongue</italic> mutant with an expanded anthocyanin region over wildtype flowers with smaller anthocyanin spots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Ding <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>). Petal patterns also play important roles to protect against abiotic stress. In wild sunflowers (<italic>Helinathus annuus</italic>), larger UV-absorbing bullseyes increased a flower’s tolerance to desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Todesco <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>). <underline><styled-content style="color:#D13438">I</styled-content></underline>n silverweed flowers the size of the UV bullseye positively correlates with the amount of exposure to UV irradiation, possibly enhancing pollen protection from UV-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Koski &amp; Ashman, 2015</xref>). In both species, the UV-absorbing bullseye results from the preferential or restricted production of flavonols at the petal base which protect against environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Pollastri &amp; Tattini, 2011</xref>). Hence, the evolution of petal patterns is shaped by both biotic and abiotic factors and investigating the processes mediating changes in petal patterning provides insights into the mechanisms facilitating the emergence of adaptations and speciation.</p><p id="P4">The patterns on the petal surface are produced by a combination of features including epidermal cells that differ in their shape, texture, and pigmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kay, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Johnson &amp; Midgley, 1997</xref>). Plant pigments are divided into three classes: carotenoids, betalains and flavonoids. The carotenoid and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways are widely distributed across the plant kingdom while betalains are restricted to the order Caryophyllales. Flavonoids are the predominant class of pigments in angiosperm flowers and produce a wide array of colors. Flavonoids comprise several subgroups, including flavonols and anthocyanins, which are colorless/’cream’-like and blue/red, respectively. Flavonoid biosynthesis begins with the production of chalcone, followed by several hydroxylation steps to produce the precursors for flavonols and anthocyanins. Thereafter, the pathway branches whereby the enzymes dihydroflavonol (<italic>DFR</italic>) and anthocyanidin synthase (<italic>ANS</italic>) produce anthocyanins while flavonol synthase (<italic>FLS</italic>) yield flavonols, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>). The accumulation of these pigments, in varying combinations and abundance, and in different regions of the petals, gives rise to the spectrum of color patterns on the petal epidermis. Petal coloration can also be influenced by the physical properties of epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Moyroud <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Riglet <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). For instance, conical cells can focus light into the anthocyanin-containing vacuole enhancing color intensity, while semi-ordered striations of the cuticle can produce a weak iridescence and blue halo effect that increases flower salience to pollinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Whitney <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Moyroud <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The genetic components underpinning the production of petal patterns have been functionally characterized in a limited number of model species. Flavonoid biosynthesis is regulated at the transcriptional level by the MBW complex, combining two types of transcription factors (TFs), an R2R3 MYB (myeloblastosis) and a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein, and a scaffold WD-repeat protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Ramsey &amp; Glover, 2005</xref>). MYBs and bHLHs constitute two of the largest TF families in plants and as such, several MBW complexes exist to tightly regulate the expression of late flavonoid biosynthetic genes. In <italic>Antirrhinum majus</italic>, the venation pattern present on the lateral sides of the corolla tube is produced by overlapping expression patterns of the MYB TF AmVENOSA and its bHLH partner, AmDELILA. Together, they combine with a WD40 co-activator, forming an MBW complex that activate anthocyanin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Shang <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). <italic>AmVENOSA</italic> expression is restricted to a wedge of cells between the vein and adaxial epidermis while <italic>AmDELILA</italic> is broadly expressed in the epidermal cells of the corolla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Goodrich <italic>et al</italic>.1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Jackson <italic>et al</italic>. 1992</xref>). Therefore, the restricted expression of <italic>AmVENOSA</italic>, the MYB element of the MBW complex, is the main driver of the venation pattern. The mechanisms accounting for the spatial regulation of <italic>MYB</italic> transcription has only been explored in a few systems including <italic>Mimulus verbenaceus</italic> leaf stripes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">LaFountain <italic>et al</italic>. 2024</xref>) because many species used in the study of petal patterning cannot be genetically manipulated with ease. Hence, the upstream processes accounting for the restriction of MYB expression are still poorly understood across angiosperms.</p><p id="P6">Venice mallow (<italic>Hibiscus trionum)</italic> produces flowers with a striking bullseye pattern, and this herbaceous species has recently emerged as a model system to understand petal pattern evolution and development at both the macro- and microscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Moyroud <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Riglet <italic>et al</italic>. 2024</xref>). <italic>H. trionum</italic> belongs to the Trionum clade within the Malvaceae family and specifically falls into the Trionum Complex that appears to have experienced a recent radiation event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Craven <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). The size of the bullseye varies extensively across the Trionum Complex providing an attractive system to investigate the processes underpinning petal pattern variation and possibly replicated evolution. In this study, we first used a phylogenomic approach to solve species relationships across the Trionum Complex and uncovered multiple instances of bullseye pigmentation reduction. Combining molecular approaches and genetic manipulations <italic>in planta</italic>, we found that independent occurrences of bullseye size reductions are due to recurring modifications of a MYB-encoding locus, <italic>BERRY1</italic>. This locus restricts anthocyanin production to the petal base and acts as a principal driver of bullseye pattern formation. Importantly, pollinator behavior assays revealed that bumblebees easily discriminate between flowers of varying bullseye size, suggesting that repeated mutations within a single locus are sufficient to generate morphological variations in a trait likely to impact speciation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>Bullseye pattern reduction occurred several times independently across the Trionum Complex</title><p id="P7">To investigate petal pattern evolution across the Trionum Complex, we first undertook a phylogenomic approach to clarify the relationships between the four species within the group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Whenever possible, we included several accessions from each species to capture some of the morphological diversity existing within some species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Craven <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Moyroud <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>). For instance, <italic>H. verdcourtii</italic> individuals from the Emerald and Theodore localities in Queensland (referred to as population 1 and 4, respectively) exhibit a red bullseye, while New South Wales individuals from the Narrabri region (population 5) produce cream flowers lacking a pigmented bullseye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Individuals with different bullseye patterns can also be found in the same region. For example, plants producing red bullseye flowers (<italic>H. verdcourtii</italic> population 2) or cream flowers with a faint pink halo (<italic>H. verdcourtii</italic> population 3) are both present in St. George, Queensland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Craven <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Similarly, a commercial accession of <italic>H. trionum</italic> used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">van der Kooi <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Moyroud <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>) produces a visibly smaller bullseye than the one of <italic>H. trionum</italic> CUBG, our wildtype reference accession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Moyroud <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Riglet <italic>et al</italic>. 2024</xref>) and wild individuals from New Zealand (<italic>H. trionum</italic> Bream Head, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Craven <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Moyroud <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P8">As expected, accessions assigned to the same species clustered together in our phylogenomic reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Our analysis also identified <italic>H. richardsonii</italic>, the other diploid species of the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">de Lange, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Murray <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>), as sister to <italic>H. trionum</italic>. This finding is in line with previous morphological and ecological studies where the status of <italic>H. richardsonii</italic> as a separate species or a variant of <italic>H. trionum</italic> was debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">de Lange, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Craven <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). We found that all accessions produced smooth conical cells in the distal part of the petal and striated tabular cells in the proximal petal region except for the five <italic>H. verdcourtii</italic> accessions that all produced smooth tabular cells in the proximal petal region, regardless of their corolla pigmentation pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). This indicates (i) that the genetic mechanisms controlling cell shape, cuticle texture, and pigment production are somewhat distinct and (ii) that the ability to produce a striated cuticle was either gained after the divergence of <italic>H. verdcourtii</italic> or lost along the lineage leading to <italic>H. verdcourtii</italic>. Finally, our phylogenetic reconstruction identified pigmentation as the most labile feature of epidermal petal cells as accessions lacking pigmentation at the petal base (<italic>H. verdcourtii</italic> populations 3 and 5) or producing a reduced pigmented bullseye (<italic>H. trionum</italic> Commercial Variety and <italic>H. richardsonii</italic>) did not cluster together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Therefore, understanding the genetic basis accounting for multiples instances of bullseye pigmentation reduction provides an excellent opportunity to study the mechanisms mediating replicated evolution.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>A single genetic locus accounts for reduction of the pigmented bullseye in <italic>H. richardsonii</italic>, the sister species of <italic>H. trionum</italic></title><p id="P9">We previously found that the boundary separating proximal and distal regions is specified closer to the petal base during the pre-patterning phase in <italic>H. richardsonii</italic> compared to wildtype <italic>H. trionum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Riglet <italic>et al</italic>. 2024</xref>). This boundary shift is sufficient to produce a smaller structural bullseye in <italic>H. richardsonii</italic> as striated tabular cells cover a smaller portion of its petal. However, the pigmented area appears even smaller than the proximal domain suggesting that additional changes affecting the control of pigment production, rather than the pre-patterning process itself, must also have occurred during evolution along the lineage leading to <italic>H. richardsonii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Riglet <italic>et al</italic>. 2024</xref>). Here, we aim to clarify the genetic basis accounting for such reduction in pigmentation.</p><p id="P10">To precisely characterize differences in pigmentation between wildtype <italic>H. trionum</italic> and <italic>H. richardsonii</italic> bullseyes, we first examined and compared the morphological and chemical features of fully open flowers (stage 5) from both species. We found that the pigmented bullseye covered on average 15% of the petal surface in wildtype <italic>H. trionum</italic> while the <italic>H. richardsonii</italic> bullseye represented only 3% of the petal surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). This five-fold reduction in pigmented bullseye size was mainly attributed to a drastic reduction in anthocyanin levels in the <italic>H. richardsonii</italic> proximal region compared to wildtype <italic>H. trionum</italic>, with anthocyanin content of the proximal region being at least 15-fold lower in <italic>H. richardsonii</italic> compared to <italic>H. trionum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Minor pigment accumulation in the distal petal is likely attributed to light-induced anthocyanin production on the abaxial petal. Total flavonol content was 1.4 to 2.6-fold higher in <italic>H. richardsonii</italic> petal tissue compared to wildtype <italic>H. trionum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Taken together our data indicate that the pigmented bullseye of <italic>H. trionum</italic> is generated by restricting anthocyanin synthesis to the proximal petal region while flavonols are preferentially produced in the distal petal domain and that bullseye reduction in <italic>H. richardsonii</italic> is likely due to impaired anthocyanin synthesis. Similarly, in the <italic>Clarkia gracilis</italic> species complex, petal spots vary among subspecies and the presence of basal and central petal spots was correlated to higher anthocyanidin levels in those regions compared to unspotted petals that had lowered anthocyanidin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Martins <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). In <italic>H. richardsonii</italic>, the reduction in anthocyanin production could favor precursor availability toward the flavonol branch of the flavonoid pathway, possibly accounting for the increase in flavonols recorded in the proximal and boundary regions of <italic>H. richardsonii</italic> petals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To start uncovering the molecular mechanisms accounting for the difference in bullseye pigmentation between wildtype <italic>H. trionum</italic> and <italic>H. richardsonii</italic>, we crossed the two species together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The hybrid produced flowers with a pigmented bullseye similar in size to wildtype <italic>H. trionum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A and 3B</xref>). Closer inspection of the boundary region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) revealed differences in the composition and pattern of cell types between the hybrid and wildtype <italic>H. trionum</italic> parent. In the parental wildtype <italic>H. trionum</italic>, the boundary region was characterized by three cell types: (1) striated pigmented tabular cells, (2) smooth pigmented tabular cells, and (3) smooth non-pigmented tabular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). In <italic>H. richardsonii</italic>, the reduction in bullseye pigmentation resulted in only two cell types at the boundary: (1) striated and (2) smooth non-pigmented tabular cells. Interestingly in the hybrid, striated non-pigmented tabular cells replaced the smooth pigmented tabular cells found in wildtype <italic>H. trionum</italic>. This indicates that although the hybrid appears identical to wild type <italic>H. trionum</italic> at the macroscale, the dominance of the <italic>H. trionum</italic> phenotype is somewhat partial as the hybrid only displays a near full-size pigmented proximal region. In the F2 population obtained after the hybrid was allowed to self-pollinate, the two parental and hybrid phenotypes were recapitulated and these morphologies segregated in a near-Mendelian ratio as 40, 41 and 96 individuals displayed a <italic>H. trionum</italic>-like, <italic>H. richardsonii</italic>-like and hybrid-like phenotype, respectively. This indicates the change in pigmented bullseye dimensions is largely due to a single locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Similarly, a single Mendelian locus controls the presence of “light areas” on the proximal petal in <italic>M. lewisii</italic>. The hybrid from a cross between <italic>M. lewisii</italic> and <italic>M. cardinalis</italic> displayed the light areas phenotype, indicating the <italic>M. lewisii</italic> allele is dominant for this pigment pattern trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Yuan, <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Expression patterns of a <italic>DFR</italic> and a <italic>FLS Hibiscus</italic> homolog correlate with petal pigmentation</title><p id="P12">The flavonoid pathway is often targeted by evolutionary processes, generating diversity across many flowering species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kellenberger &amp; Glover, 2023</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that differences in petal patterning between <italic>H. trionum</italic> and <italic>H. richardsonii</italic> is also a consequence of modifications to this pathway. The flavonoid biosynthetic pathway is well-characterized in plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). A common dihydroflavonol precursor is produced before the pathway diverges to synthesize anthocyanins or flavonols. <italic>DFR</italic> and <italic>FLS</italic> are key enzymes involved in the production of anthocyanins and flavonols, respectively. From the <italic>H. trionum</italic> genome, we isolated three homologs for each gene. We measured their expression as petals developed (stages 1-4, prior to flower opening, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Moyroud <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>) in the proximal and distal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4B and 4C</xref>). Among the three <italic>DFR</italic> homologs, <italic>HtDFR1</italic> was expressed at the highest levels in the proximal region: <italic>HtDFR1</italic> expression was eight to 11-fold higher at the petal base compared to the distal region throughout petal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4B</xref>). <italic>HtDFR2</italic> and <italic>HtDFR3</italic> expression levels in the proximal petal were almost negligeable and thus we concluded that they are not likely involved in anthocyanin production at the petal base (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2 and S3</xref>). <italic>HtFLS2</italic> was highly expressed during the first three stages of petal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>) before declining at stage 4, following a similar temporal dynamic yet complementary spatial expression pattern to <italic>HtDFR1</italic> as its expression was consistently four to 19-fold higher in the distal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).

Taken together, these results demonstrate that <italic>HtDFR1</italic> and <italic>HtFLS2</italic> are the main players in shaping the bullseye pattern, and the spatial accumulation of anthocyanins and flavonols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-D</xref>) directly reflects their expression patterns. In <italic>Dianthus caryophyllus, Rosa multiflora</italic>, and <italic>Camellia japonica</italic> flowers, expression of <italic>DFR</italic> and <italic>FLS</italic> homologs also correlate with red and white flowers, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Luo <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>). In <italic>Clarkia gracilis, DFR</italic> expression patterns coincide with petal spots formation during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Martins <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>).

Our results also argue for functional divergence between the <italic>DFR</italic> and <italic>FLS</italic> homologs. Such diversification involved divergence of their expression patterns but whether this was accompanied by changes in coding sequences affecting the biochemical properties of the enzymes they code for remains to be determined.</p><p id="P13">To determine whether <italic>HtDFR1</italic> was responsible for bullseye anthocyanin production, we generated <italic>35S::HtDFR1</italic> transgenic lines in <italic>H. trionum</italic>. Strong overexpression lines with ectopic pigmentation in the distal petal were observed, however, a single transgenic line produced flowers devoid of a pigmented bullseye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). We hypothesized that this was likely due to silencing of <italic>HtDFR1</italic> triggered by transcript overaccumulation similar to results in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> T-DNA supertransformants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Schubert <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we quantified <italic>HtDFR1</italic> transcription levels in transgenic lines exhibiting either phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). We found that the presence of distal pigmentation was accompanied with a 300-fold averaged increase in <italic>HtDFR1</italic> expression in the distal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Reciprocally, <italic>HtDFR1</italic> transcription was minimal (15-fold lower than WT expression) in the proximal petal domain of white flowers, confirming that <italic>HtDFR1</italic> expression matched the strength of the phenotype observed. We concluded that the absence of pigmentation was likely due to <italic>HtDFR1</italic> silencing, such that the transgenic line producing white flowers corresponded to a knockdown (KD) line for <italic>HtDFR1</italic>. Total anthocyanin and flavonol measurements in both lines confirmed visual observations: anthocyanin levels were five-fold higher in the distal petal region of the <italic>HtDFR1</italic> overexpression line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Conversely, flavonol levels were two-fold higher throughout the entire petal of the <italic>HtDFR1</italic> knockdown line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). The lack of <italic>HtDFR1</italic> activity in the knockdown line likely increased precursor availability for flavonol biosynthesis, possibly accounting for increased flavonol levels.</p><p id="P14">Although <italic>HtDFR1</italic> overexpression produced distal petal pigmentation, anthocyanin levels in the distal petal domain remained 13-fold lower compared to anthocyanin production in the proximal region suggesting that other elements, such as substrate competition between ectopic HtDFR1 and endogenous HtFLS2, could limit anthocyanin production. A clear bullseye pattern was still visible in the <italic>HtDFR1</italic> knockdown line despite the near-complete absence of anthocyanin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), highlighting the contribution of the structural elements (differences in cell shape and texture between the proximal and distal region) to the visual appearance of the petal.

We reasoned that some of the TFs regulating <italic>HtDFR1</italic> transcription must be preferentially expressed in the proximal region of the petal. To identify such regulatory genes, we dissected stage 1 petal primordia lacking a visible pigmented bullseye into distal and proximal regions and performed RNAseq to detect differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A, Supplementary Data 1 &amp; 2</xref>). Using a four-fold difference as a threshold, we identified 938 and 343 genes preferentially expressed in the proximal or distal petal regions, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>). Among those ~1300 genes, three MYBs stood out: two that were almost exclusively expressed in the proximal petal domain, which we named <italic>HtBERRY1</italic> and <italic>HtBERRY2</italic>, and one, that we named <italic>HtCREAM1</italic>, was preferentially expressed in the distal petal region.

Based on a high degree of sequence similarity (82.9% identity and 94.8% similarity), and overlapping patterns of expression between <italic>HtBERRY1</italic> and <italic>HtBERRY2</italic>, we assumed both paralogs are likely to act redundantly. Therefore, we focused on <italic>HtBERRY1</italic> for functional investigations as it was expressed at higher levels than <italic>HtBERRY2</italic> during petal development. The <italic>35S::HtBERRY1</italic> line (<italic>HtBERRY1</italic> OE) produced flowers with ectopic pink pigmentation in the distal petal: their corolla was entirely colored as the distal region produced 30-fold more anthocyanin than in wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>), however a distinct bullseye pattern was still visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). This phenotype was consistent with the predicted role of <italic>HBERRY1</italic> as a positive regulator of anthocyanin production. We also measured higher anthocyanin levels in the ovary and all other petal regions of this line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>), corroborating the ectopic pigmentation and the ability of HtBERRY1 to promote anthocyanin production. Flavonols levels decreased by 30% and 50% in the proximal and boundary regions, respectively, when compared to wildtype <italic>H. trionum</italic>. This could be due to competition between anthocyanin and flavonol production with the increase in anthocyanin biosynthesis resulting in less precursor available for flavonol synthesis. Flowers from the <italic>35S::HtCREAM1</italic> (<italic>HtCREAM1</italic> OE) line were more similar to wildtype but displayed a paler bullseye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Flavonoid quantification indicated this was due to reduced production of anthocyanin pigments (60% decrease compared to wildtype <italic>H. trionum</italic>) in the proximal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>). Interestingly, the lack of anthocyanin was not accompanied by increased flavonol synthesis: we found that flavonol content was reduced to levels resembling that of the <italic>HtBERRY1</italic> OE line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>), suggesting that when constitutively overexpressed, <italic>HtCREAM1</italic> could dampen the whole flavonoid pathway.</p><p id="P19">To begin constructing the gene regulatory network controlling pigment production in the <italic>H. trionum</italic> petal, we measured the expression of the three MYB regulators along with the structural genes <italic>HtDFR1</italic> and <italic>HtFLS2</italic> in both <italic>HtBERRY1</italic> and <italic>HtCREAM1</italic> OE lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). We found increased <italic>HtFLS2</italic> expression in the distal region of <italic>HtCREAM1</italic> OE petal (1.5-fold) suggesting HtCREAM1 promotes <italic>HtFLS2</italic> transcription. In the <italic>HtBERRY1</italic> OE line, <italic>HtBERRY1, HtBERRY2</italic> and <italic>HtDFR1</italic> expression in the proximal petal increased by ~15-, six- and four-fold compared to wildtype <italic>H. trionum</italic>, respectively. These results indicate <italic>HtBERRY1</italic> promotes anthocyanin production in part through the activation of <italic>HtDFR1</italic> transcription. Given the similarity in coding sequences between the two paralogs, we assume that HtBERRY2 is also likely to activate <italic>HtDFR1</italic> transcription. Our results support the existence of a positive feedback loop where <italic>HtBERRY1</italic> promotes its own expression as well as <italic>HtBERRY2</italic> transcription. Interestingly, both <italic>HtCREAM1</italic> and <italic>HtFLS2</italic> expression decreased (four- and 1.7-fold, respectively) in the distal petal when <italic>HtBERRY1</italic> was constitutively overexpressed. This suggests that HtBERRY1 could repress the expression of <italic>HtCREAM1</italic> and perhaps <italic>HtFLS2</italic> directly or indirectly (via <italic>HtCREAM1</italic>). Taken together, our results allow us to start building a small gene regulatory network accounting for the restriction of anthocyanin production to the proximal petal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>).</p><p id="P20">The bullseye pattern is a consequence of the spatial restriction of <italic>HtDFR1</italic> activity to the petal base. This spatially restricted expression is due, in part to the localized expression of one of its activators, <italic>HtBERRY1</italic>, to the proximal petal region as constitutive overexpression of <italic>HtBERRY1</italic> was sufficient to trigger ectopic expression of <italic>HtDFR1</italic> and yield anthocyanin production in the distal region. Interestingly, the coloration obtained in the distal domain in <italic>HtBERRY1</italic> OE line was not as intense as in the proximal domain and the anthocyanin levels remained 12-fold lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D-F</xref>). This could be due to several reasons. First, a lack of or restricted availability of a HtBERRY1 partner could limit its ability to activate <italic>HtDFR1</italic> expression in the distal region (alternatively, other TFs contributing to <italic>HtDFR1</italic> expression might be lacking in the distal region). Secondly, differences in the chromatin landscape at the <italic>HtDFR1</italic> promoter could impair effective binding of HtBERRY1 to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. However, our expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6</xref>) suggests that <italic>HtDFR1</italic> is expressed at similar levels in both proximal and distal regions in the <italic>HtBERRY1</italic> OE line and rules out both hypotheses. Alternatively, competition with <italic>HtFLS2</italic> for precursor availability could prevent <italic>HtDFR1</italic> from synthesizing anthocyanin effectively in the distal petal region, or limited expression of enzymes acting downstream of <italic>HtDFR1</italic> in that same region could account for dampened anthocyanin production. The fact that <italic>HtCREAM1</italic> and <italic>HtFLS2</italic> are both downregulated in the distal region of <italic>HtBERRY1</italic> OE make it unlikely that competition between <italic>HtDFR1</italic> and <italic>HtFLS2</italic> is the main cause of the paler hue of the distal domain of <italic>HtBERRY1</italic> OE line. Taken together, our results suggest that HtBERRY1 promotes pigment production by at least three different routes: first, by inducing the expression of <italic>HtDFR1</italic>; second, by promoting its own expression as well as the expression of its paralog <italic>HtBERRY2</italic>; and third, by reducing the transcription of <italic>HtCREAM1</italic> and <italic>HtFLS2</italic>, limiting possible competition between <italic>HtDFR1</italic> and <italic>HtFLS2</italic> in the proximal region and thus favoring anthocyanin synthesis over flavonol production in the bullseye center. Whether HtBERRY1 directly represses <italic>HtCREAM1</italic> and/or <italic>HtFLS2</italic> transcription remains to be tested – if this is the case, HtBERRY1 must be able to act as both an activator and a repressor by forming different MBW complexes involving different bHLH partners. The R2R3 MYB subfamily, to which HtBERRY1 belongs, is the largest of the four MYB families and can be characterized by two adjacent imperfect MYB repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wu <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>). Aside from other functions, more than half of R2R3 MYBs are involved in the regulation of specialized metabolism such as phenylpropanoid biosynthesis which result in end products such as flavonoids. The importance of MYB regulation in the flavonoid pathway has been demonstrated numerous times in several species including <italic>Petunia hybrida</italic> and <italic>Antirrhinum majus</italic>.

However, a dual role for an R2R3 MYB as transcriptional activator and repressor has not been previously reported.</p><p id="P21">Having identified some of the genetic interactions regulating pigment production in the petal of <italic>H. trionum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6K</xref>), we hypothesized that one of those interactions or actors of this network was possibly impaired in <italic>H. richardsonii</italic>, interfering with anthocyanin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). First, the expression of <italic>HrCREAM1</italic> could be enhanced in <italic>H. richardsonii</italic>, repressing anthocyanin production. Alternatively, the expression of the <italic>BERRY</italic> genes could be reduced, yielding a smaller pigmented bullseye in <italic>H. richardsonii</italic>. To test these hypotheses, we isolated orthologs of <italic>BERRY1/2</italic> and <italic>CREAM1</italic> in <italic>H. richardsonii</italic> and measured their expression in developing petals of <italic>H. richardsonii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). The expression of <italic>HrCREAM1</italic> was three- to 76-fold lower, not higher, than that of <italic>HtCREAM1</italic> in both proximal and distal petal regions, allowing us to reject the first hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). <italic>HrBERRY1</italic> expression was barely detectible and <italic>HrBERRY2</italic> transcription was also significantly reduced by at least 2.5-fold in the proximal region, likely accounting for the lowered expression of <italic>HrDFR1</italic> in developing petals of <italic>H. richardsonii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We also examined the coding sequence of each MYB regulator. We identified a single base pair substitution (A&gt;T, 105bp) in the first exon of <italic>HrCREAM1</italic> but this was a synonymous mutation encoding a glycine residue at position 35. We found the coding sequence of <italic>HrBERRY1</italic> contained eleven SNPs compared to its orthologue in <italic>H. trionum</italic> (three substitutions in exon one, four in exon two, and four in exon three) and a large 2063bp insertion in the second intron (2445bp instead of the 382bp-long intron found in the second intron of <italic>wildtype H. trionum</italic>). Two of the SNPs within the exons introduced premature stop codons: a T&gt;A substitution at position 17bp and G&gt;A substitution at position 159bp. Thus, the <italic>HrBERRY1</italic> transcript should produce short, truncated proteins that are likely non-functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest a scenario where the low expression of <italic>HrDFR1</italic> is caused by a lack of HrBERRY1 activity. If this is the case, the functional <italic>H. trionum</italic> and non-functional <italic>H. richardsonii BERRY1</italic> alleles should segregate with the bullseye size phenotype. To test if the presence of a non-functional <italic>HrBERRY1</italic> allele correlated with a reduced bullseye phenotype, we examined the segregation of the <italic>HtBERRY1</italic> and <italic>HrBERRY1</italic> alleles in the F2 population first described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>.

Interestingly, we could amplify a <italic>BERRY1</italic> ortholog, <italic>HvBERRY1</italic>, in populations 1, 2 and 4 who all yield individuals with red bullseye flowers, but we failed to amplify this gene in populations 3 and 5 whose flowers are devoid of red pigmentation in the proximal petal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).

Similar to the findings in the F2 population of wildtype <italic>H. trionum</italic> x <italic>H. richardsonii</italic>, pigmentation loss was largely due to a change affecting a single locus in <italic>H. verdcourtii</italic>. Blind genotyping of 34 F2 individuals revealed that the presence/absence of <italic>HvBERRY1</italic> was a perfect predictor of the presence/absence of a red bullseye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>), supporting the idea that the loss of <italic>HvBERRY1</italic> accounts for the loss of petal pigmentation in <italic>H. verdcourtii</italic>. Taken together, our results reveal a case of replicated evolution, where the pigmented bullseye underwent several independent reductions across the Trionum Complex.

Real flowers are complex objects which can combine differences in shape, scent and temperature in addition to differences in pigmentation and those other features could influence pollinators’ response.

Consistently, in <italic>Antirrhinum</italic>, Petunia and maize, the R2R3 MYBs, rather than their bHLH partners, are often the main drivers of localized anthocyanin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Piazza <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Schwinn <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Albert <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>). Understanding why MYBs rather than bHLHs tend to limit the production of pigment to subregions of the epidermis is unclear. It could reflect fundamental differences in the transcriptional regulation of both families, or instead indicate that the MYB components are less likely to have pleiotropic effects than their bHLH partner. Together, these findings underscore that evolution often recycles molecular mechanisms to generate petal diversity, revealing that the investigation of regulatory networks provide critical insights into how repeated evolutionary outcomes are achieved.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Plant material and growing conditions</title><p id="P28">Wildtype <italic>H. trionum</italic> L.

In the H. richardsonii and F2 <italic>H. richardsonii</italic>-like boundaries, pigmentation was absent, and striation was lost. In the F1 and F2 hybrid-like boundaries, both pigmented and non-pigmented striated cells were present, with striation loss occurring after pigmentation loss.
