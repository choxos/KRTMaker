During chromosomal DNA replication, DNA unwinding by the CMG DNA helicase must be coupled with ongoing DNA synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Because of the anti-parallel nature of the DNA strands, DNA synthesis occurs continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously as Okazaki fragments (OkFs) on the lagging strand. OkFs are initiated by DNA polymerase α-primase (Polα): the DNA primase generates 7-10 nt RNA primers that are extended as DNA ~20 nt by the DNA polymerase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Rfc1-5 (RFC) loads the ring-shaped PCNA sliding clamp processivity factor on the 3’ DNA end generated by Polα, promoting completion of OkF synthesis by DNA polymerase δ (Polδ). Displacement of the 5’ end of the previous OkF by Polδ generates a flap which is cleaved by endonucleases, primarily Fen1, and the two OkFs are ligated together by ligase I (Lig1). Leading strands of the bidirectional replisomes are generated from OkFs; the leftward leading strand comes from the first OkF made by the rightward travelling replisome and vice versa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. When Polδ from these first OkFs reaches the CMG, DNA polymerase ε (Polε), which associates with CMG and is required for its formation, normally takes over for the duration of leading strand synthesis. Polε associates with dual processivity factors CMG helicase and PCNA to perform bulk leading strand synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. We refer to the proteins required for OkF elongation (PCNA/RFC/Polδ), together with Polε, as the <underline>Pr</underline>ocessive DNA <underline>S</underline>ynthesis <underline>M</underline>achinery (PrSM), that together promote fast, processive and accurate DNA synthesis of leading and lagging strands.</p><p id="P4">DNA replication forks can stall as a result of nucleotide depletion or at DNA lesions from endogenous or exogenous sources. In response to fork stalling, cells activate the DNA damage checkpoint pathway that promotes a coordinated cellular response to ensure cell survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Fork stalling in the absence of the checkpoint results in replication fork collapse, accumulation of single-stranded (ssDNA), DNA damage, and cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Restoration of a functional checkpoint after fork stalling does not restore cell viability, suggesting that the checkpoint prevents a catastrophic, irreversible event associated with stalled forks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. We currently do not fully understand what happens when replication forks stall, how replication forks restart or how the DNA damage checkpoint prevents irreversible fork collapse. In this paper we use DNA replication with purified proteins to characterise fork stalling, restart, and the mechanism of fork stabilization by the DNA damage checkpoint.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>DNA replication fork stalling and restart in vitro</title><p id="P5">We exploited the reconstitution of DNA replication with purified budding yeast proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> on a circular 10.6 kb DNA template containing a single origin of replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> to study the nature of DNA replication fork stalling and restart. Replication of this template at our standard deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) concentration (80 μM each dNTP) in the absence of Fen1 or ligase results in production of leading strand products of approximately half the plasmid length (~5.3 kb), and similar levels of DNA synthesis as discontinuous Okazaki fragments (OkFs) in the lagging strand (~0.2-0.4 kb) within 10 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). To induce DNA replication fork stalling, we performed DNA replication at several reduced dNTP concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). At 1 μM total dNTP concentration (the ‘low dNTP concentration’ throughout the manuscript), leading strand DNA synthesis is initially slow (~0.12 kb/min) and then stops after 6-8 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C</xref>). OkFs initiate but remain short (&lt;0.1 kb); they primarily comprise DNA not RNA because they have incorporated α<sup>32</sup>P-dCTP and are resistant to alkaline hydrolysis during the processing of samples. OkFs continue to initiate and accumulate even after leading strand synthesis stops, resulting in 2-3X more incorporation in the lagging strand than in the leading strand after 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>). Therefore, CMG continues to unwind DNA, leading strand synthesis stops, but OkFs continue to initiate and accumulate.</p><p id="P6">We added a high concentration of unlabelled dNTPs after different times at low dNTP concentration to promote and visualize DNA synthesis restart from stalled forks. After 5 min at low dNTP concentration, the amount of leading and lagging strand synthesis is roughly equivalent and synthesis is still occurring slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>); dNTP addition at this point induced rapid synthesis, reaching near full length by 2.5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, after 20 min at low dNTP concentration, when leading strand synthesis has been stalled for &gt;10 min and excess initiated OkFs have accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), addition of dNTPs led to leading strand synthesis restart that was very slow and far from complete after 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) and even after 60 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>). After 10 min at low dNTP concentration, two distinct populations of restart were observed, one fast and one slow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, lanes 6-8). This indicates that the difference in restart between 5 and 20 min is not a progressive slowing of restarting forks, but likely due to the acquisition of a discrete mode of slow DNA synthesis after extended fork stalling. Similar results were obtained when replication products were resolved on formaldehyde/formamide denaturing gels without alkaline treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>), indicating that the apparent aberrant restart is not due to alkaline hydrolysis of the nascent DNA at positions of incorporated ribonucleotides, which could have been favoured after extended incubation at low dNTP concentration. Restart speed after 5 min at low dNTP concentration is comparable to unperturbed replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1F</xref> and Yeeles <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>), and was unaffected by omission of Polδ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1G</xref>), indicating that Polε is sufficient for leading strand synthesis during short stalling and restart. Restart after 20 min was roughly 5 times slower than after 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1F</xref>). Excess OkF initiation after 20 min and aberrant restart were still seen when we used a catalytically inactive Polε mutant (ΔCAT-Polε)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and omitted Polδ from reactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1H</xref>), indicating that DNA synthesis during the aberrant restart is catalysed primarily by Polα.</p><p id="P7">Inclusion of Fen1 and Lig1, enzymes that promote OkF maturation and ligation, during stalling and restart led to production of a completely replicated closed circular plasmid (CC) after restart of the 5 min incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, it did not restore normal leading strand synthesis restart after 20 min at low dNTP concentration and most replication products never reached completion (CC). Though there was some ligation of OkFs evident during restart, this was only partial even after 45 min. Therefore, the presence of OkF maturation machinery during stalling did not suppress aberrant restart. Note that during the low dNTP pulse, no ligation was observed with Fen1 and Lig1 at 5 min at low dNTP concentration indicating that little or no OkF completion and maturation occurred even from the beginning of the reaction.</p><p id="P8">Replication at low dNTP concentration of a chromatinised DNA template<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> was very similar to naked DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>): leading strand synthesis stopped at a simlar point and excess, short OkFs continued to accumulate over time. Therefore, the core DNA replication machinery can promote continued unwinding through chromatin even when leading strand DNA synthesis is inhibited. Similar to naked DNA, addition of dNTPs after 5 min at low dNTP concentration promoted efficient leading strand synthesis restart whereas restart was aberrant after 20 min, indicating that the presence of chromatin does not rescue defects in replication fork restart.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The DNA damage checkpoint protects stalled forks</title><p id="P9">The checkpoint kinase Rad53 slows replication forks by phosphorylating and inactivating Mrc1 and Mcm10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Omission of Mrc1 and reduction of Mcm10 concentration (Mcm10 cannot be omitted because it is required for initiation), slows replication fork progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and prevented accumulation of OkFs at later times, which allowed normal restart after 20 min at low dNTP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Addition of Rad53-phosphorylated Mrc1 and Mcm10 during fork stalling followed by unphosphorylated Mrc1 and Mcm10 during restart, which mimics events during fork stalling and restart <italic>in vivo</italic>, also limited OkF generation during fork stalling and rescued restart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). Therefore, the Rad53 checkpoint kinase can protect stalled DNA replication forks at least in part by preventing unrestrained DNA unwinding.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Excess OkF initiation prevents restart</title><p id="P10">How does unrestrained fork progression prevent normal restart after 20 min of stalling? Generation of excess ssDNA could deplete soluble RPA and affect restart, as has been postulated as a cause of fork collapse in human cells lacking a functional checkpoint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Whilst 80 nM RPA is sufficient for maximal levels of DNA replication in the absence of stalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) even 10 times more RPA (800 nM RPA) did not rescue fork restart after either 20 or 10 min at low dNTP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A</xref>), arguing that RPA depletion is unlikely to be the cause of the aberrant restart observed upon fork stalling in our system.</p><p id="P11">We next asked whether continued OkF initiation and accumulation during extended CMG unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>) was responsible for the aberrant restart. The frequency of OkF initiation on naked DNA templates can be modulated by changing Polα concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Reducing Polα concentration during low dNTP treatment partially rescued the restart defect after 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) and completely rescued restart after 10 min at low dNTP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Further reduction in Polα level resulted in reduced overall replication, presumably because of defects in establishing leading strand as well as lagging strand replication, and was therefore not interpretable.</p><p id="P12">As an alternative approach, we asked whether addition of competitor DNA mimicking either ssDNA or a short incomplete OkF could prevent normal restart after 5 min at low dNTP concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). Addition of a a 61 nt ssDNA oligonucleotide (competitor ssDNA) had no effect on restart after 5 min at low dNTP concentration, whilst the same oligonucleotide with an anealed 30 nt complement (competitor primed DNA) blocked normal restart after 5 min at low dNTP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) resulting in restart very similar to that seen after 20 min. Addition of the same OkF-mimic also caused aberrant restart after 20 min with phosphorylated Mrc1 and Mcm10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the continued accumulation of OkFs rather than ssDNA is the cause of the aberrant restart seen after 20 min at low dNTP concentration, and the checkpoint acts to prevent accumulation of excess OkFs.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Depletion of PrSM factors contributes to fork stalling and causes aberrant restart</title><p id="P13">Excess incomplete OkFs could sequester any or all PrSM factors and, consistent with this, more PCNA was loaded onto DNA after 20 min than 5 min at low dNTP concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4A-S4C</xref>). Moreover, addition of extra PCNA, RFC, Polε and Polδ together, rescued restart from forks stalled for 20 min at low dNTP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Individual dropouts showed that all four PrSM factors contributed to efficient restart after 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B and 4C</xref>), indicating that each PrSM factor is likely depleted to some extent. PCNA and RFC by themselves improved restart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and dropout of either PCNA or RFC led to reduced restart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Although dropout of Polε had a smaller effect than dropout of Polδ, there was a very substantial reduction in rescue when both polymerases were omitted indicating that, in the absence of extra Polδ, extra Polε can support restart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P14">DNA synthesis stopped in the leading strand while lagging strand synthesis continued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that leading strand stalling occurred despite the continued presence of dNTPs. During the low dNTP incubation, we found that addition of extra PCNA and RFC promoted further leading strand synthesis without additional dNTPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4D and 4E</xref>). Therefore, the concentration of PCNA and RFC that is required and sufficient to sustain leading strand synthesis at the beginning of the reaction at low dNTP concentration, becomes insufficient as DNA replication proceeds at low dNTP concentration, indicating that replication at low dNTP concentration leads to early depletion of PrSM factors and contribute to fork stalling. Depletion of PCNA has relatively mild effects on leading strand synthesis during replication at high dNTP concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>; however, omission of PCNA from the beginning of the reaction at low dNTP concentration profoundly affected leading strand DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4D</xref> and Yeeles <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>). This residual synthesis is catalysed by Polα since similar synthesis is seen when PCNA and Polδ are both omitted in the presence of either WT Polε or ΔCAT Polε (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4E</xref>). Taken together, these experiments indicate that PrSM depletion contributes to fork stalling at low dNTP concentration in addition to being critical for restart.</p><p id="P15">Mrc1 phosphomimicking mutants that reduce DNA replication fork speed have been shown to partially suppress the DNA damage sensitivity of a <italic>rad53</italic> mutant <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. We wanted to determine whether excess PrSM factors could also suppress the effects of fork stalling in a checkpoint-deficient background. To avoid documented cell lethality associated with chronic overexpression of PCNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, we designed an experimental strategy to induce an acute overexpression of PCNA and/or Rfc1 from a galactose-inducible promoter together with entry into S phase in the presence of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Under these conditions, the sensitivity of a <italic>rad53</italic> mutant to MMS was significantly decreased by exression of Rfc1 and PCNA individually or in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4F and S4G</xref>), consistent with the idea that PrSM depletion contributes to cell lethality in the absence of a functional DNA damage checkpoint.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>PrSM factors protect nascent DNA from nuclease attack</title><p id="P16">DNA synthesis at low dNTP concentration progressed with similar dynamics using WT or exonuclease mutant (exo<sup>-</sup>) Polε up to 20 min; and restart was similar with both polymerases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>). However, the signal intensity and leading and lagging strand lengths were reduced at later times in reactions containing WT but not exo<sup>-</sup> Polε (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A and S5B</xref>), indicating that, at later times at low dNTP concentration, the exonuclease of Polε was degrading nascent DNA.</p><p id="P17">This suggested that depletion of PrSM factors may make DNA ends available for nucleolytic attack. To test this, we used a primed DNA model substrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref>). The exonuclease of Polε degrades the substrate effectively, and RFC with or without PCNA provides protection from DNA degradation by Polε (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). We next asked whether PrSM factors could protect DNA from other 3’ to 5’ exonucleases, the bacterial ExoIII and the yeast Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5D and S5E</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5C and 5D</xref> show that all PrSM factors contribute to maximum protection from both nucleases. Drop-outs of PCNA or RFC resulted in reduced protection (lanes 4 and 5). RFC provided protection on its own (lane 8). Exo<sup>-</sup> Polε provided only very weak protection in the absence of PCNA and RFC (lane 9) but in their presence contributed to maximum protection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5F</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We then asked whether PrSM factors protect nascent DNA from degradation by nucleases during replication. Addition of the ExoIII nuclease after 30 min at low dNTP concentration resulted in degradation of leading and lagging nascent DNA products, which was prevented by addition of extra PrSM factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Therefore, PrSM depletion, in addition to affecting DNA synthesis restart, exposes nascent DNA ends, making them susceptible to nucleolytic attack. Of the four PrSM factors, RFC is especially good at protecting exposed DNA ends from nuclease attack.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">From our work using a defined, reconstituted DNA replication system a picture emerges of 1) what happens when DNA replication forks stall in response to nucleotide depletion, 2) how forks restart and 3) how the DNA damage checkpoint protects stalled forks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Leading strand synthesis at 1 μM dNTP stalls after ~5 min and ~0.6 kb of synthesis but OkF synthesis continues for at least another 15 min resulting in ~3X more incorporation. Based on the amount of synthesis (3X ~0.6 = ~1.8 kb) and the size of the OkFs (~0.1 kb), after 20 min at low dNTP concentration, there are approximately 18 OkFs for every leading strand. From the start, these OkFs are incomplete, since even at the 5 min time point, inclusion of Fen1 and Lig1 did not lead to OkF ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). CMG unwinds DNA at a rate of ~0.14 kb/min in the absence of DNA synthesis and the presence of Mrc1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>; therefore, not more than 2.7 kb of DNA would be unwound in 20 min; consequently, the 18 OkFs are initiated roughly every 150 nt or less and are, therefore, more densely packed along the lagging strand than at 80 μM dNTPs, where the OkFs are ~300 nt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). Consistent with this, OkFs only increase in size to ~0.1 kb even after normal restart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, OkF initiation after uncoupling from leading strand synthesis occurs frequently along the template at low dNTP concentration.</p><p id="P20">Our results provide information about how DNA synthesis restarts after stalling. After a short (5 min) time at low dNTP concentration, leading strand synthesis resumes normally even in the absence of Polδ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1G</xref>) suggesting that Polε remains engaged with the 3’ end of the leading strand even as leading strand synthesis is slowing. We note that although Polε does not require PCNA for DNA synthesis in high dNTPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, at low dNTP concentration PCNA loading by RFC is essential for leading strand DNA synthesis and restart by Polε (Yeeles <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4D and S4E</xref>). The overall rate of leading strand synthesis at 80 μM dNTPs is greatly stimulated by PCNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> suggesting transient stalling or uncoupling might occur without PCNA even at normal dNTP concentrations. Lagging strand synthesis by Polδ also appeared to restart normally after 5 min at low dNTP concentration as we saw near complete ligation of OkFs after adding dNTPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P21">After extended time (10-20 min) at low dNTP concentration, normal restart no longer occurs after dNTP addition. Instead, leading strand synthesis rate after restart is very slow. Polα is sufficient for this synthesis rate, and even after extended incubation, lagging strands are not completely ligated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) indicating that lagging strand synthesis restart is also aberrant. This restart resembles restart in human cells after aphidicolin arrest with checkpoint inhibitors described in the accompanying manuscript in that the rate of replication after restart is very slow and completely dependent upon Polα. Our results suggest that RPA depletion is not the cause of this phenomenon, consistent with work in the accompanying manuscript showing that aberrant fork restart precedes RPA exhaustion. Low levels of RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) reduce the frequency of OkF initiation without affecting the leading strand synthesis rate, consistent with previous results using a more minimal replication system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. At very low RPA levels, the amount but not the length of the leading strand is diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting there is a defect in generating the Okazaki fragment that seeds leading strand synthesis, but once initiated, leading strand synthesis is minimally affected by RPA depletion. In the accompanying manuscript, we show that RPA exhaustion contributes to DNA damage primarily at late times. Thus, RPA depletion may inhibit OkF synthesis at late times, contributing to more ssDNA and further RPA depletion. Aberrant restart is due to the sequestration of PrSM factors by excess OkFs, which prevents resumption of processive DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast to leading strand synthesis restart after 5 min at low dNTP concentration, for which Polε is sufficient, Polδ appears to be more important than Polε in restart after 20 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1F and 4B</xref>). We suggest that this is because Polδ synthesises DNA rapidly and processively with PCNA outside the context of CMG and thus is the ideal polymerase to ‘recouple’ leading strand synthesis to CMG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, in much the same way it establishes the leading strand from an OkF during the early stages of replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> and how it recouples leading strand synthesis to CMG after translesion synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">Our model is supported by observations <italic>in vivo</italic> using strand-specific ChIP-Seq methods showing that the DNA damage checkpoint prevents PCNA accumulation on hydroxyurea-stalled lagging strands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> and uncoupling of leading and lagging strand synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>; moreover, these phenotypes are suppressed by Mrc1 deletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Although this was attributed to accumulation of toxic ssDNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, we propose that this is instead due to accumulation of excess OkFs. Our results are also consistent with the fact that Polδ mutants show synthetic lethality with the checkpoint kinases Rad53 and Mec1 in yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> and even transient depletion of Polδ causes lethality of Mec1 mutant yeast cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.

PrSM factors protect 3’ DNA ends from nuclease attack, both from heterologous nucleases like ExoIII and potentially relevant nucleases like Mre11 and the proofreading exonuclease of Polε (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), the latter of which has been implicated in fork collapse in yeast in the absence of a functional checkpoint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. The requirements for protection and restart are not identical; RFC by itself is sufficient for some protection but not for restart, and thus its depletion may have the most profound consequences <italic>in vivo</italic>, as argued in the accompanying manuscript. A recent report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> indicates that RFC can bind to 5’ as well as 3’ DNA ends which could also protect nascent DNA from attack by 5’ to 3’ nucleases like Exo1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Regardless, PrSM factors may also indirectly protect DNA ends by promoting OkF completion and ligation.

In our reconstituted system, loss of processive DNA synthesis after PrSM depletion was irreversible unless new PrSM factors were added to the reaction. Irreversibility was still observed when we added Elg1-Rfc2-5, the PCNA unloader (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S6A-S6B</xref>) even after pre-phosphorylation by Rad53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6C</xref>). This is not very surprising for three reasons: first, excess OkF initiation depletes all four PrSM factors, not just PCNA. Second, after unloading PCNA, there still remains an excess of 3’ ends from incomplete OkFs competing with the 3’ end of the leading strand. And third, Elg1-Rfc2-5 was proposed to unload PCNA after OkF maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, but maturation does not occur at low dNTP concentration after addition of Lig1 and Fen1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), presumably because they cannot act on incomplete OkFs and they require interaction with PCNA, and so may also be compromised after PrSM depletion. Further work is needed to understand how PCNA loading and unloading is regulated in unperturbed and stalled forks.</p><p id="P25">Given these uncertainties, it appears that prevention of PrSM depletion is the best strategy for survival, and our results indicate that the DNA damage checkpoint plays a crucial role in preventing PrSM depletion by slowing unwinding from existing forks through phosphorylation and inhibition of Mrc1 and Mcm10. Prevention of continued origin firing through Rad53-phosphorylation of Sld3 and Dbf4 likely also contributes to preventing excessive OkF synthesis and PrSM depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Plasmids and yeast strains</title><p id="P26">Yeast strains generated in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>.

When fork stalling occurs in the absence of the checkpoint (<bold>A</bold>), DNA unwinding continues and allows excess generation of incomplete OkFs, which sequester the PrSM factors. PrSM depletion causes aberrant restart by Polα and exposes nascent DNA to nuclease attack. When fork stalling occurs in the presence of the checkpoint (<bold>B</bold>), the Rad53 DNA damage checkpoint kinase prevents excess OkF generation by phosphorylating the replication proteins Mrc1, Mcm10, Sld3 and Dbf4 to inhibit DNA unwinding and origin firing. By preventing accumulation of incomplete OkFs, the checkpoint prevents PrSM depletion, which allows processive DNA synthesis restart and protects nascent DNA from nuclease attack.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199833-f006"/></fig></floats-group></article>
