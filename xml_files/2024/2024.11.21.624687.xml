The capability for producing custom-shape high-quality backbones for very large proteins would further expand the scope of protein design. To this end, here we introduce the AlphaFold2 (AF2) cycler (af2cycler) design pipeline. AF2cycler is used to refine draft protein backbone geometries of arbitrary shape created by the Chroma diffusion model or other methods, using a combination of AF2 and ProteinMPNN to achieve high designability with minimal deviations from the initial target structure. In silico testing on multiple protein designs (100-1000 amino acids) demonstrated improvements in structural integrity and designability after af2cycling confirmed by enhanced ESMFold repredictions. Experimental wet lab validation through the design of a variety of test proteins with distinct shapes, each comprising 1000 amino acids, showed structural agreement between in silico predictions and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, establishing the af2cycler’s efficacy in translating designs into real-world results. Af2cycler provides a convenient and reliable protein design workflow, particularly for large proteins, with potential for expanding to applications in areas such as design of higher-order protein complexes and multi-state backbone optimization.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2"><italic>De novo</italic> protein design, which aims to create entirely new proteins from first principles, has become an important focus in computational biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). This field promises transformative applications in biotechnology, medicine, and synthetic biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The recent awarding of the Nobel Prize for AlphaFold2 highlighted its groundbreaking ability to predict protein structures with atomic accuracy, reshaping our understanding of protein folding. While originally developed for structure prediction, AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) has also demonstrated its utility in <italic>de novo</italic> protein design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), especially in generating binders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) and high-quality backbones, particularly for large proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Despite these advancements, existing approaches to <italic>de novo</italic> protein design, including diffusion and flow matching methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), often struggle when tasked with designing larger proteins. Although notable exceptions, such as Proteus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), have shown success in this space, current approaches may yield designs with suboptimal backbone configurations, including over-compactness and irregular geometries.</p><p id="P3">Chroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), a recently developed computational approach for de novo protein design, offers a flexible and intuitive platform for generating complex protein structures. Chroma’s programmability allows users a convenient approach for specifying desired structural features, such as shape or secondary structure content, while maintaining the freedom to explore a vast conformational space. Its user-friendly interface and broad adaptability make it accessible to a wide range of researchers, enabling rapid prototyping of custom proteins with minimal computational expertise. Although Chroma generates visually promising large protein structures that avoid compactness issues that may arise in methods like RFDiffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1 A &amp; B</xref>), further analysis using ESMFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) reveals that Chroma-generated designs tend to exhibit low designability when subjected to more rigorous structural criteria (TM Score &gt; 0.85) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1 C</xref>). Subsequent solubleMPNN-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) sequence redesign does not increase the in-silico success rate significantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p><p id="P4">We hypothesized that optimizing backbone quality of Chroma-generate protein design drafts would help addressing these issues and translate into reduced risk of experimental failure. In previous work AF2 showed great potential for the design of large proteins with high experimental success when combined with ProteinMPNN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1 D</xref>). We thus developed a pipeline termed the <bold>af2cycler</bold> that leverages AlphaFold2’s intrinsic denoising capabilities in combination with ProteinMPNN to refine Chroma-generated backbones, leading to significantly enhanced designability with minimal alterations to the original design target, which we refer to as the “initial draft backbone”.</p><p id="P5">The protein design pipeline consists of three key steps: First, initial protein design drafts are generated using the Chroma diffusion model, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Chroma can utilize a variety of conditions like shapes, symmetries or sequences and generate custom protein structures. Chroma Design is then used to generate a sequence. Both the sequence and the corresponding structure are then processed through the af2cycler, the central piece of this pipeline (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In this stage, the Chroma-generated backbone undergoes a refinement process using AlphaFold2 and ProteinMPNN, designed to improve its structural integrity and designability (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> green box). The final step involves first sequence generation using solubleMPNN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) and subsequent screening of the sequences with ESMFold to assess their folding accuracy and selecting the most promising candidates for experimental validation.</p><p id="P6">The af2cycler, illustrated in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, leverages AF2’s intrinsic ability to start with a template as an initial guess and locally descend the learned energy potential to refine input structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). In this process, the Chroma-designed protein “draft” sequence, without coevolutionary data, is fed into AF2. The draft structure generated by Chroma is provided as a template, initial guess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) and used to initialize the structure module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). One pass through the AF2 network is performed (zero-recycle prediction) and because a template matching the sequence is provided, this initial AF2 prediction is only slightly changed when compared to the original backbone, correcting structural inaccuracies without major alterations. This step can be understood as a single “denoising step.”.</p><p id="P7">Following this, ProteinMPNN is employed to generate a new sequence based on the refined structure (AF2 output). The ProteinMPNN sequence logits are then scaled by introducing a per-residue confidence (C) that is derived from the sum of contacts from the AF2 distogram. This scaled MPNN logits are summed with gumbel noise scaled by the complement of the confidence (1-C). Finally, the original sequence is updated by adding this noise augmented MPNN sequence and an argmax operation is performed before the sequence is input again into AF2. The confidence weighting is designed to assess how well-packed each residue is, adding more noise to under-packed residues and amplifying the weight of the ProteinMPNN logits in residues with sufficient contacts. This approach is based on the hypothesis that high-quality backbones will produce well-defined ProteinMPNN sequences, which converge toward a consensus sequence that encodes the backbone structure effectively.</p><p id="P8">The refined sequence, along with the updated AF2 prediction, is then cycled back into AF2 for additional refinement. This cycle of AF2 prediction and ProteinMPNN redesign is repeated for 10 to 20 iterations, or until the design reaches convergence, as determined by confidence metrics such as pLDDT and PAE.</p><p id="P9">The refined structure generated by the af2cycler can then undergo a final redesign using solubleMPNN to produce a completely new sequence. This sequence is subsequently validated by ESMFold, which repredicts the folding of the sequence into the intended structure. By integrating this final validation step, we ensure that the newly designed protein will adopt the desired conformation. Af2cycler harnesses the high programmability and user-friendly nature of Chroma, creating an effective, versatile, and reliable pipeline for the design of large proteins. Af2cycler enhances the draft designs by correcting structural inaccuracies, making this approach particularly suitable for designing large, complex proteins that maintain their stability and functionality.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Computational benchmarking</title><p id="P10">To evaluate the impact of the af2cycler on protein design quality, we generated a test set of 50 proteins per length ranging from 100 to 1000 amino acids (AA) using Chroma (1000 steps, no additional conditioners). The af2cycler was then applied to these designs, performing 10 denoising steps on each. Notably, the af2cycler made only slight modifications to the backbone structures (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), with minimal deviations for smaller proteins, while larger designs exhibited a greater increase in root mean square deviation (RMSD) and TM Score (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2 A</xref>). This increase primarily resulted from larger rearrangements in elongated domains (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Despite these changes, the overall TM-score remained high (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2 A</xref>), even for designs up to 1000 AA, indicating strong structural similarity to the original Chroma designs.</p><p id="P11">Following the af2cycler treatment, we generated sequences for both the original Chroma backbones and the af2cycler-refined backbones using solubleMPNN. We observed a significant reduction in MPNN scores for the af2cycler-treated designs compared to those generated directly from the Chroma backbones (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>), indicating that the cycled backbones represented higher-quality, more idealized structures. Additionally, we calculated the net charge of the designed sequences and found that the af2cycler-treated backbones had a lower net charge compared to the untreated designs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Interestingly, both groups of solubleMPNN-designed sequences were more negatively charged than those generated by Chroma alone, likely due to the low sampling temperature (0.1) used in solubleMPNN.</p><p id="P12">We further evaluated the designability of these sequences by repredicting their structures with ESMFold. The af2cycler-treated backbones demonstrated significantly higher designability, with median TM-scores exceeding 0.85, even for the largest 1000 AA designs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) and a median RMSD of 5 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2 B</xref>). These predictions also showed lower predicted alignment error (PAE) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>) and higher pLDDT (predicted local distance difference test) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2 C</xref>), further supporting the high success rate for large designs. Importantly, analysis of the designed structures revealed that the af2cycler did not reduce the overall complexity of the proteins (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>), as the all-vs-all TM-scores of the designs were unaffected by the denoising process. Surprisingly, despite the strong bias towards helical structures in larger designs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2, D</xref>), the overall structural diversity remained high even at larger sizes (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). These findings demonstrate that the in-silico metrics of Chroma-generated structures can indeed be enhanced by treatment with the af2cycler.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Experimental investigations</title><p id="P13">For laboratory testing, we chose to af2cycler-design proteins consisting of 1000 amino acids, with tertiary structures approximating different letters of the Latin alphabet, as this “shape conditioning” feature was readily available in the Chroma software package. We expected these distinctive shapes to be easily identifiable in negative stain transmission electron microscopy (nsTEM), aiding structural investigations. For each letter of the Latin alphabet, we designed a set of five draft designs using Chroma with shape conditioning. These drafts were then subjected to 10 iterations of the af2cycler, followed by sequence generation with solubleMPNN and structural validation using ESMFold. As above, the af2cycler led to improvements of the backbone quality as manifested by reduced RMSD to design targets and reduced overall PAE of the predictions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We manually selected protein candidates considering high confidence scores. Proteins that did not maintain their intended shapes or showed poorly distinguishable simulated 3D volumes (such as ‘M’ or ‘B’) were excluded from testing, as we expected to experience difficulties in resolving their structures in negative-staining TEM imaging. Twelve proteins with shapes corresponding to the letters D, N, A, V, K, X, H, O, E, P, S and L were selected and expressed in E. coli and purified using Nickel-NTA chromatography.</p><p id="P15">All constructs expressed and SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis confirmed the correct molecular weight (MW) of the proteins. The purity after Nickel-NTA chromatography purification was sufficient for further analysis. For the six proteins with the highest yield, we also performed native size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and found that the measured MWs were larger than expected, suggesting that the proteins adopted a non-globular shape that deviated from the standard radius assumed by the SEC calibration (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). We imaged the proteins subsequently using nsTEM and found homogenous, monomeric protein distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>). We computed 2D class averages from individual particle images using RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). For 10 out of the 12 tested proteins, the resulting 2D classes showed strong agreement with the expectations from the designed proteins, successfully representing the intended letter shapes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4</xref>). While certain proteins, such as ‘H,’ exhibited some flexibility, as indicated by more diverse 2D classes, most proteins predominantly maintained their designed shapes. Only for the ‘S’ and ‘L’ shaped proteins the 2D classes from nsTEM analysis did not result in strong agreement to the designed shape (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>).</p><p id="P16">These findings demonstrate the viability of the af2cycler pipeline to rapidly prototype custom-shape large proteins with high likelihood of successful experimental outcome.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Pushing the size limit of protein design</title><p id="P17">Encouraged by these initial results, we explored the size limitations of the Chroma-af2cycler design pipeline. We observed that the final confidence scores, specifically pLDDT and PAE, did not reach as high levels anymore for protein designs comprising more than 1000 amino acids (AAs) in length. This suggests that AlphaFold2 may be approaching its functional limits for accurately predicting structures at this scale, even when provided with a template, an initial guess, and all-atom initialization. However, despite this limitation, the af2cycler was still able to generate backbones that could be used for subsequent sequence design with ProteinMPNN even for proteins comprising up to 1500 AA, as exemplified with a triangular protein with 1500 AAs that we drafted in Chroma and subjected to 20 iterations of af2cycler refinement. AF2, supplemented with initial guess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) and all atom initialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) struggled to accurately predict this large structure, yielding a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 10 Å. However, AlphaFold3 (AF3-server) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) was able to predict the structure with higher accuracy (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Due to constraints in the computational resources available to us, we were unable to run ESMFold on sequences longer than 1000 AAs. Experimentally, we tested a candidate sequence for the 1500-AA triangle design. The protein was expressed using mild conditions, and purification via Ni-NTA chromatography yielded a clean sample with the expected molecular weight (MW), as confirmed by SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Subsequent imaging with nsTEM revealed globular proteins, with triangle-like shapes. Reference-free 2D class averages generated from nsTEM data, showed good agreement with the design within the resolution, and an initial 3D reconstruction produced a 3D volume that overlayed well with the AF3 prediction (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). These findings demonstrate that the Chroma-af2cycler pipeline has the potential to be extended to accommodate protein designs as large as 1500 AAs and possibly beyond.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">De novo protein design has emerged as a frontier in computational biology, driven by the ambition to create new proteins that meet specific functional and structural criteria. Diffusion-based methods, like Chroma, offer an intuitive and flexible platform for designing complex proteins, but challenges remain in terms of improving the in silico and in vitro success. The af2cycler pipeline addresses these limitations by combining AF2’s denoising capabilities with the sequence design potential of ProteinMPNN. The af2cycler refines initial draft designs from Chroma or other input to improve their designability, yielding higher-quality structures suitable for further computational work and experimental validation. Our computational benchmarking revealed that the af2cycler improved TM-scores and reduced PAE for Chroma-generated drafts across a range of protein sizes, without large alterations to the original design. The af2cycler-refined designs folded well and showed their intended shapes when imaged through negative stain electron microscopy.</p><p id="P19">Furthermore, the af2cycler adds to the observation that protein backbones which were designed utilizing AF2 (either via hallucination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) or the af2cycler) deliver very high designability, even up to lengths of 1000 amino acids. Interestingly, the usage of RFDiffusion partial diffusion as a denoising tool did not increase the designability of Chroma designs as much as the af2cycler did (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Moving forward, we anticipate that the af2cycler’s capabilities can be extended by the community towards more complex applications, ranging from multi chain design, binder design or design of multiple protein conformations, building on the open-source integration of af2cycler in the ColabDesign codebase.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Materials &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Chroma design of draft proteins</title><p id="P21">Chroma draft backbones were design using the available code on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/generatebio/chroma/tree/main">https://github.com/generatebio/chroma/tree/main</ext-link>) on A100 GPUs.

af2cycler:</title><p>Schematic representation of the af2cycler. Red arrows indicate the flow of structural information, while blue arrows indicate the flow of sequences. The af2cycler works by first using Chroma to design proteins that satisfy a certain condition. Secondly, the resulting structures as well as the designed sequences (with ChromaDesign) are put into the af2cycler main loop. The sequence is predicted with AF2 using the structure as a template. The resulting structure is used for the next round, as well as an input to ProteinMPNN. The distogram from the AF2 prediction is used to calculate a per residue confidence, capturing the number of contacts each residue has. The ProteinMPNN logits are then scaled with this confidence, while the compliment (1-C) is used to scale gumbel noise. The sum of these two is added to the one hot sequence and another argmax operation is performed, before putting this sequence back into AF2. Finally, the resulting structure is subject to solubleMPNN sequence design and a final ESMFold prediction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS200695-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>In silico benchmarking:</title><p>A) Overlays of Chroma designed structures (grey) to af2cycler output (color) for different amino acid (AA) lengths.
