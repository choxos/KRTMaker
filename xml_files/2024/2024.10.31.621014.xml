<italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> gene, which lead mTOR pathway hyperactivation and epileptogenesis. Cortical tubers are the hallmark of TSC and represent disorganized cortical structure underlying the generation of focal seizures. Here, we report single-nucleus RNA sequencing in resected cortical tubers vs matched pediatric controls. Strikingly, in spite of severe cortical disorganization, we found that cortical tubers preserve all neuronal subtypes, even the rarest ones. Moreover, we showed that principal neurons largely preserve spatial position based on transcriptional signatures. Principal neurons and layer 1-2 GABAergic neurons that modulate upper cortical circuits exhibited the largest gene expression changes. Interestingly, multiple mTOR pathway gene expression changes in TSC counteracted mTOR hyperactivation. TSC neuronal, but not glial, networks exhibited massive metabolic reorganization with a reduction in mitochondrial respiration and a concomitant switch to fatty acid metabolism. Finally, we show that neuron-specific AMPA receptor signaling might underlie epileptogenesis in TSC and could represent a potential candidate for therapeutic targeting.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Tuberous sclerosis complex, or simply tuberous sclerosis (TSC), is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that affects several major organs of the body, including the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. It is characterized by monogenic loss-of-function mutations in either the <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. TSC can become manifest in various conditions in the brain and often most severely in treatment-resistant epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The TSC1/2 complex is part of the canonical mTORC1 pathway and inhibits mTOR (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) signaling by inhibiting the mTOR activator RHEB (Ras homolog enriched in brain)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Activation of the mTOR pathway leads to protein synthesis and increases metabolism, enhancing synthesis of nucleotides and lipids and activating glycolysis; inversely, catabolic pathways such as autophagy and lysosome biogenesis are inhibited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Inhibition by TSC1/2 counteracts mTOR activation and restricts cell growth. In the brain, the balance between mTOR and TSC1/2 coordinates multiple developmental processes, such as neuronal maturation and axonal growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In TSC, the epileptic phenotype might arise already within the first year after birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, when developmental processes are peaking, which is likely due to lack of TSC-mediated mTOR inhibition.</p><p id="P3">The etiology of epileptogenesis in TSC is still poorly understood. Hallmark pathological characteristics of TSC include cortical tubers with cytomegalic neurons, reactive astrocytes, and altered synaptogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Typical cortical layer structure within cortical tubers is lost and disorganized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The lack of cortical structure and miswiring of neuronal networks within the epileptic focus are thought to be the main contributors to epileptogenesis, with perturbed developmental processes playing the key role in epileptogenic network miswiring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Studies on both animal models and resected tubers from patients have provided important knowledge about the morphology, circuits, and molecular hallmarks of TSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and identified potential developmental mechanisms, such as impaired neuronal migration and maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Yet, both human iPSC-derived neurons and animal models cannot recapitulate the pathology of the disease entirely, especially regarding the high complexity of cortical neuronal types that are present in the human brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">An alternative approach to determine how neuronal complexity is perturbed in the epileptic focus and might contribute to epileptogenesis would be to study resections of brain tissue from epilepsy surgery using single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq). The high potential for this technology to reveal disease-related mechanisms in complex human brain disorders has been shown by multiple studies investigating various brain disorders, such as schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, autism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and multiple sclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. For epilepsy, such an approach was first applied to analyze cortical epileptogenic regions associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The data unraveled previously unknown proepileptogenic mechanisms, such as increased action of AMPA auxiliary subunits and large metabolic and developmental changes in molecular signaling, and identified deep-layer principal neurons, PVALB and VIP GABAergic neurons, as the most vulnerable neuronal subtypes potentially forming a network underlying epileptogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Other sc/snRNA-seq analyses revealed a glial role in such epileptogenic networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Therefore, we initiated an in-depth, unbiased study to characterize the transcriptional landscape, cellular identity, and potential epileptogenic networks of frontal cortical tubers of TSC using snRNA-seq on resected TSC surgical samples matched to control pediatric samples. Using comprehensive computational analyses, we discovered that, despite a highly disorganized cortical layer structure, virtually all layer-specific neuronal types are present in cortical tubers, even very rare ones. Furthermore, using single-molecule FISH (smFISH), we demonstrated that molecular signatures associated with layer specificity were preserved although, histologically, a cortical lamination structure was lacking. Interestingly, the largest gene expression changes appeared in principal neurons of L2_3_CUX2 and L5_6_FEZF2 together with ID2 GABAergic neurons, the latter residing mainly in L1 and targeting upper cortical circuits and apical dendrites of L5_6_FEZF2 neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Although cell type-specific molecular patterns are maintained in TSC, the metabolism-associated transcriptomic landscape was extensively modified, exhibiting a strong reduction in the generation of mitochondrial energy and a concomitant increase in fatty acid metabolism. Interestingly, in spite of mTOR hyperactivation at protein level, at transcriptional level we identified potential homeostatic mechanisms counteracting mTOR hyperactivation and circuit overexcitation. Finally, we found neuron-specific changes in AMPA receptor signaling, including AMPA auxiliary subunits, which might provide targets for future therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>All neuronal subtypes of the neurotypical cortex are present in cortical tubers of TSC</title><p id="P7">Cortical tubers resected from the frontal cortex of pediatric patients carrying <italic>TSC2</italic> mutations and corresponding postmortem neurotypical control samples (11 and 6 individuals, respectively, ranging between 2 months and 17 years of age, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>) were processed for snRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To ensure that the postmortem gene expression signature had only limited impact, only very low postmortem interval (PMI) samples were used (6-9 h, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). Mutations of the <italic>TSC2</italic> gene in TSC samples were previously identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, and a total of nine point mutations were represented among TSC2 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>): Six were frameshift mutations (deletions or insertions) and three were missense/nonsense mutations causing either faulty protein readout or termination of translation. Regardless of the mutation location site, all were loss of function.</p><p id="P8">The sample cohort was thoroughly balanced for potential confounders, such as sex and age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). During tissue processing each sample was sorted using general nucleus marker 7-AAD followed by neuronal nucleus marker NeuN. To ensure that snRNA-seq captured a sufficient number of neurons and to avoid overrepresentation of oligodendrocytes (see Methods), NeuN+ and NeuN-fractions were collected and mixed at a ratio of 80% to 20% to perform snRNA-seq using the 10x Chromium v3.1 assay. In total, 166,524 nuclei were identified after sequencing using Cellranger (45,944 mean reads per nucleus) and after secondary cell calling with Cellbender and quality control filtering, which included ambient RNA, low-quality cells, cells with high mitochondrial reads, and doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1a-f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">2a-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">3a-f</xref>), 100,282 nuclei (64,322 from TSC and 35,960 from controls) passed for further analysis. The resulting nuclei were of high quality with 8,445 median unique molecular identifiers and 3,017 median genes detected. The efficiency of this sorting strategy was confirmed after the sequencing with approximately 80% neurons and 20% non-neuronal cells identified in the snRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Cell types were annotated manually using a combination of literature-based markers and previously analyzed datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> in a hierarchical manner, initially dividing them into glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells [OPCs], and microglia), neurons (excitatory neurons, GABAergic inhibitory neurons), immune cells, and cells of vascular origin (pericytes and endothelial cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>, for non-neuronal cells <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4a-h</xref>, for neuronal cells <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5a-h</xref>). Neurons were subdivided further using layer-specific markers for the excitatory neurons L2-3_CUX2, L4_RORB, L5-6_FEZF2, and L5-6_THEMIS and markers of the cardinal families of GABAergic inhibitory neurons PVALB, SST, VIP, and ID2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Importantly, biological covariates, such as sex, age at resection, or seizure frequency, had limited impact on snRNA-seq data clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e-g</xref>). Final subclustering of neurons into individual subtypes revealed 25 inhibitory GABAergic and 15 excitatory neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h,i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5a-h</xref>). One excitatory cell population expressing a mixture of canonical layer markers was named “to be determined” (TBD). Although we confirmed that these cells were not doublets and they passed-low quality filtering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5e,f</xref>), we could not annotate this population. Owing to this and as the TBD cluster consists of cells with a generally lower transcriptional depth than the rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5g,h</xref>), we excluded the TBD cluster from subsequent differential analyses.</p><p id="P10">Surprisingly, although the classical laminar-wise neuronal positioning in cortical tubers was found to be severely disorganized in neuroanatomical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, at the molecular level all canonical cell types and all neuronal subtypes that are present in neurotypical cortex were also present in TSC tubers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h,i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). Even the rarest excitatory and GABAergic neuronal subtypes, such as L5_6_THEMIS_NR4A2_NTNG2 (0.84% of total neurons) and L3_CUX2_SPOCK3_PRSS12 (1.10% of total), and ID2_LAMP5_MEIS2 (0.23% of total) and SST_TH (0.27% of total), were present in TSC tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). Thus, our data demonstrate the advantage of molecular phenotyping at the single-cell level for identifying specific neuronal subtypes in the disorganized cortex.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Deep-layer excitatory neurons, PVALB inhibitory neurons, and microglia are enriched in TSC</title><p id="P11">Although, as shown above, TSC contains all neuronal and glial subtypes that are identified in the normal cortex, the cellular abundance of specific cell subtypes and their gene expression signatures in TSC might be altered, which might underlie epileptogenesis. Thus, we performed differential analysis of cellular composition and gene expression between conditions. Rigorous statistical testing showed no significant impact of covariates on gene expression or cell composition differences, including sex, age, snRNA-seq processing steps and sample loading on flowcells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 6a-h</xref>). By projecting overall gene expression or cellular abundance on multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, we showed that two conditions were clearly separated, indicating that TSC has unique transcriptomic and cell composition signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To characterize changes in cell-type composition in TSC, we implemented Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) as implemented in <italic>Cacoa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. While simply comparing proportions of cell types makes them inherently interdependent on each other, CoDA corrects for such interdependency, thus allowing for independent comparison of cellular abundance for each cell type in a sc/snRNA-seq dataset. We analyzed the cellular composition of NeuN+ and NeuN- cells separately to avoid introducing bias due to the enforced 80% to 20% mixing ratio of NeuN+ to NeuN- cells. Among excitatory neurons, layer-4 subtype L4_RORB_SCHLAP1_MME was decreased in TSC, whereas deep-layer excitatory neurons L5_6 THEMIS_SEMA3A and FEZF2_TLE2_ABO were enriched in TSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Additionally, the Neu_dev_THY1 neuronal subtype was enriched in controls -- this subtype was detected almost exclusively in the youngest neonatal control sample (age 2 months) and expressed excitatory, but not GABAergic inhibitory markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). Interestingly, several subtypes of GABAergic inhibitory neurons were enriched in TSC, including major subtypes of the PVALB neurons PVALB_MEPE and PVALB_LGR5, where the former corresponds to interlaminar/translaminar basket cells and the latter likely representing another basket-cell subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Additionally, SST_TH neurons were the subtype of GABAergic neurons with the highest enrichment in TSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). SST_TH neurons are a rare subtype of GABAergic neurons that have been reported to express TH protein and are thus potentially dopaminergic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">To circumvent annotation bias, we performed cluster-free compositional analysis, i.e., by identifying changes in cell composition using graph-based density on UMAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. This analysis confirmed an increased cellular abundance of deep-layer excitatory neurons (L5_6_FEZF2_TLE4_HTR2C, L5_6_FEZF2_TLE4_ABO and L5_6_THEMIS_SEMA3A) and inhibitory PVALB_LGR5 neurons in TSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), as above. Additionally, lower densities of upper middle-layer excitatory neurons (L2_CUX2_LAMP5_PDGFD and L4_RORB_SCHLAP1_MME) were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), which might indicate that TSC has the opposite impact on upper- and deeper-layer neurons by expanding deeper layers in TSC with concomitant reduction in the upper layer neurons.</p><p id="P14">An isolated look at non-neuronal cells shows strong compositional changes in several cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Microglia exhibited a large enrichment in TSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), thus confirming previous studies showing potential infiltration of microglia into cortical tubers and increased microglia activation in drug-resistant seizure patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. However, we did not find evidence for inflammatory pathway upregulation in microglia in TSC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). Other non-neuronal cell types were reduced, including both major blood vessel cell types − endothelial cells and pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), suggesting a perturbation of the blood-brain-barrier in TSC. Additionally, astrocytes were also reduced in TSC samples (both assessed by independent comparison of cellular abundances by CoDA − <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, and graph-based density − <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>), which was unexpected, as astroglia have been described in TSC tissue both by morphological studies and immunophenotyping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Finally, cluster-free analysis of non-neuronal cells confirmed all of our findings and, in addition, allowed us to detect enrichment of oligodendrocytes in TSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). This enrichment was likely missed in annotated cluster-based comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>) due to only part of the oligodendrocyte cluster being enriched in TSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). The finding suggests the existence of a specific oligodendrocyte population that is enriched in TSC.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Massive gene expression changes in TSC that are associated with energy metabolism and glutamate signaling</title><p id="P15">To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying TSC etiology that can contribute to seizure generation within the epileptic focus, we assessed changes in gene expression for each cell type in TSC. First, to evaluate overall gene expression change per cell type, we implemented an expression distance metric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Strikingly, we found that almost all subtypes of cells showed significant changes in gene expression in TSC compared to neurotypical controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>), which suggests that there is a general, extensive change in gene expression across many cell types in TSC. Among neurons, the largest changes occurred in subtypes of excitatory neurons of L2_3 and L5_6 as well as in GABAergic inhibitory neurons of the ID2 family that mainly reside in L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The largest expression shifts in non-neuronal cell types were observed in astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The population sizes of other cell types such as endothelial cells, pericytes, and immune cells were too small to calculate the expression distance metric.</p><p id="P16">Cluster-free differential expression analysis can identify transcriptomic changes in cell populations that do not depend on UMAP clustering and are not linked to a specific cluster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Interestingly, implementation of cluster-free differential expression analysis showed major changes in excitatory neuron subtypes across all layers, with the largest changes in upper L2_3_CUX2 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). This cluster-free approach also uncovered profound gene expression changes in blood vessel cells − endothelial cells and pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>) − that could not be analyzed by classical cluster-based differential expression as there were too few of these cell types in the dataset. In addition, the cluster-free approach confirmed transcriptomic changes in OPCs and astrocytes. Taking both cluster-based and cluster-free comparisons of gene expression together, the most pronounced gene expression changes were in excitatory neurons across all layers (with L2_3 dominating), layer 1 GABAergic neurons of ID2 family and OPCs, astrocytes, and blood vessel cells.</p><p id="P17">To detect differentially expressed (DE) genes that can be associated with molecular changes in TSC, we performed DE analysis for each subtype. Interestingly, the genes involved in mitochondrial respiration (e.g., <italic>UQCRB, ATP5F1E</italic>, and <italic>COX7C</italic>) and protein biogenesis (e.g., ribosomal protein genes, <italic>EEF1A1</italic>, and <italic>NACA</italic>) were greatly downregulated across TSC neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Extended Data Table 3</xref>). By assigning genes to complex I-V, we showed that downregulation affected all five complexes of the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16">Extended Data Fig. 10</xref>). Interestingly, we found a significant modulation of glutamate receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">Extended Data Fig. 11</xref>) and, in particular, of AMPA receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>) in TSC neurons across multiple cortical layers, which resembles the data for TLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.

Interestingly, while a major energy generation process such as mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation was downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Extended Data Table 4</xref>), fatty acid-associated energy generation pathways were upregulated in TSC, in particular in excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). A focused analysis on energy generation pathways further confirmed a massive decrease in oxidative phosphorylation gene expression with fatty acid usage being concomitantly upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), whereas there was only minor downregulation of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Extended Data Table 5</xref>).

Interestingly, we found a rather contrasting pattern of gene expression changes for principal neurons vs GABAergic neurons. Thus, several key mTOR pathway genes were mildly upregulated in principal neurons, either broadly across the layers (e.g., <italic>TSC1, MTOR</italic>, and <italic>ULK1</italic>) or specifically in certain layers/sublayers (<italic>AKT1</italic> in L2_3_CUX2_FREM3_NTNG1, <italic>PXN</italic> in L5_6_FEZF2_LRRK1_SEMA3E and L5_6_FEZF2_TLE4_ABO, and <italic>PLD1</italic> in L4_RORB_SCHLAP1_ARHGAP15 and L4_RORB_SCHLAP1_MET), but not in GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F20">Extended Data Fig. 14</xref>).

Most importantly, a few key mTOR pathway activation genes were downregulated, mainly in principal neurons, e.g., RHEB and RRAGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Thus, although the current model of epileptogenesis in TSC proposes hyperactivation of mTOR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, our data show the existence of homeostatic molecular processes that can potentially counteract mTOR hyperactivation at transcriptomic level, such as extensive dampening of the expression of protein biogenesis components across most neuronal subtypes (<italic>RRAGA</italic> as amino acid sensor and <italic>EEF2</italic> as translation factor), and strong downregulation of key mTOR complex component <italic>RHEB</italic> in principal neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Neurodevelopmental and epigenetic transcription factor networks are enriched in TSC neurons</title><p id="P22">To gain insight into the transcription factor (TF) landscape underlying TSC pathogenesis we used CollecTRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, a curated database of transcriptional regulatory interactions which contain signed TF from multiple resources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Extended Table 7</xref>). The majority of TF networks were positively enriched across DE genes, with many networks deriving from neurodevelopmental TFs, including REST, ZNF331, GTF2IRD1, GLI3, ERF, CDX2, and SOX5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The highest score was attributed to the REST network, which was enriched in all principal neurons and most GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). REST is a major regulator of neuronal differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, which controls the epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.

Overall, since increased levels of REST were reported to contribute to epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, the REST TF network might be at the core of epileptogenesis by modulating epigenetic mechanisms that promote pro-epileptic gene expression in TSC neurons, potentially leading to partial aberrant neuronal differentiation.</p><p id="P23">Among the negatively enriched TF networks, only one had a high score across most neuronal subtypes − the MYC network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>).

While many unrelated pathways displayed low significance, low enrichment or both, there was a strong negative enrichment for cell growth pathway activity, including MAPK (across principal neurons, PVALB, and SST GABAergic neurons) and PI3K (in L5_6 principal neurons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). These findings corroborate other analyses reported above showing that, despite that mTOR is disinhibited and subsequently hyperactivated due to loss-of-function TSC2, it does not lead to enhanced cell growth activation: on the contrary, cell growth-associated pathways are downregulated likely due to homeostatic mechanisms.</p><p id="P25">To gain further insight into epileptogenic mechanisms in TSC, we integrated our snRNA-seq DE genes with the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) on epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. We collected GWAS summary data on generalized epilepsies and focal epilepsies and implemented the CELLECT/CELLEX workflow for summary statistics integration using MAGMA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. By integrating focal epilepsy GWAS into the data, we showed that GWAS-linked genes were enriched in TSC DE genes in GABAergic neuronal subtypes, although significance was reached only for the VIP_CRH subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Remarkably, this enrichment pattern was gone when integrating snRNA-seq with generalized epilepsy GWAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Thus, integration with genetics confirmed that the DE genes we identified by snRNA-seq are specifically related to focal epilepsy (TSC).</p><p id="P26">Finally, to leverage potential changes in neuronal connectivity in TSC, we performed differential cell-cell interaction analysis in our snRNA-seq dataset using CellChat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Both the number of interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>) and interaction strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F22">Extended Data Fig. 16</xref>) showed a similar differential pattern, which included several key features: (1) stronger interaction between principal neurons, with 2 blocks (L3_CUX2 to L5_6_FEZF2_LRRK1 and L5_6_FEZF2_TLE4 to L5_6_THEMIS_NR4A2), (2) weaker interaction of VIP GABAergic neurons with other neurons, (3) stronger interaction between ID2 GABAergic neurons and principal neurons, and (4) stronger interaction of PVALB_LGR5 and weaker interaction of PVALB_MEPE basket neurons. While (1) is likely related to increased excitation in epileptic circuits, (2)-(4) seem to be homeostatic mechanisms directed towards increasing inhibition in epileptic circuits, such as the increase in basket neuron inhibition on bodies of principal neurons, increase in ID2 neuron inhibition on dendrites of principal neurons, and decrease in disinhibition provided by VIP neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The layer-specific molecular signature of principal neuron subtypes is preserved in cortical tubers</title><p id="P27">We showed before that cortical tubers preserve all neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>), and the changes in TSC arise due to perturbed gene expression that might underlie epileptogenesis, mainly metabolic and glutamate signaling pathways. However, another key question arises as to whether TSC subtypes also preserve at least some spatial position specificity, which is particularly important for translational perspectives and repair of epileptic circuits. Although a vast amount of previous data on the pathology of TSC shows disorganized cortical layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, these data are based mainly on labeling neuronal bodies with NeuN antibody. Thus, we performed cross-labeling to determine the molecular signatures for multiple principal neuron subtypes, to detect their spatial position relative to each other, and to reveal whether they preserve at least partial organization into layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). We selected CUX2, RORB, and FEZF2 mRNAs in order to identify multiple subtypes of principal neurons based on single mRNA presence or overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). We performed smFISH to identify these mRNA markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c, d</xref>) and quantified the distribution of single- and double-labeled cells across the whole cortical column from the pia to white matter, separated in 7 equal bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e-h</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Our most striking finding was that the overall spatial distribution of subtypes of principal neurons based on their molecular signatures was largely preserved in TSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e-h</xref>). This was true for all the molecular signatures we used: CUX2, CUX2/RORB, RORB, RORB/FEZF2, CUX2/FEZF2, and FEZF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g,h</xref>). Nevertheless, there were several local changes, including an increase in lower layers for CUX2 principal neurons in TSC (bin 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>) and a concomitant increase in FEZF2 principal neurons in the upper bins (bins 6-7 in controls vs 5-7 in TSC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>). For mixed marker subtypes, there was an increase in CUX2/FEZF2 colabeling in TSC, which was rather rare in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6h</xref>), and RORB/FEZF2 subtype neurons were present in upper layers in TSC, which were absent in the corresponding layers of control cortex (bin 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6h</xref>). Thus, it appears that the cortical structure in TSC is largely preserved, while some specific populations are displaced from upper to lower layers or vice versa. The major changes pertain to metabolism reorganization and glutamate signaling, which might lead to changes in connectivity that contribute to the formation of epileptogenic networks in TSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6i</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">TSC is a developmental epilepsy whose etiology is based on mutations in the <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. However, in spite of the clear association with mutated genes, it has been challenging to generate treatments specifically targeting TSC and ameliorating epileptogenesis. Thus, novel approaches are required to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of seizures in cortical tubers in TSC for diagnostics and drug target discovery. Here, we implemented snRNA-seq on a set of frontal TSC samples, all with <italic>TSC2</italic> loss-of-function mutations, and compared them with high-quality, low PMI control samples from the same cortical area. Our data revealed that, in spite of the fact that virtually no layer-wise structure could be identified by classical pathological assessments, cortical tubers contain all neuronal subtypes that preserve their subtype-specific molecular signatures, as in their counterparts in normal tissue. Moreover, we demonstrated that subtypes of principal neurons largely preserve their spatial layer-specific distribution based on molecular signatures and that the major shift was observed in L2_3_CUX2 neurons being misplaced towards L5-L6 and vice versa − L5_6_FEZF2 in L2-3. The largest gene expression changes exhibited principal neurons and L1_2_ID2 GABAergic neurons. Thus, together with misplacement of L2-3 neurons, it indicates potential impairment of upper cortical layer circuits that are evolutionary novel circuits in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Mechanistically, we demonstrated a switch to fatty acid metabolism and proexcitation glutamate signaling in principal neurons, which could be important for developing therapeutic strategies.</p><p id="P30">As one of the key findings, we demonstrated that cortical tubers do preserve all subtypes of neurons, even very rare ones. Thus, although TSC1/2 proteins have a significant role in proliferation, differentiation, and cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, they do not induce radical changes in cell-type composition in cortical tubers. Furthermore, using smFISH, we revealed that cortical tubers preserve the layer-specific molecular signatures for principal neuron subtypes. This indicates that, although by classical histology cortical tubers do not show any layering, according to the transcriptional profiles, the layers are largely preserved, with a population of neurons being displaced.</p><p id="P31">Accordingly, important conclusions can be drawn for the field. First of all, our findings suggest that the etiology of TSC is based on specific postmitotic changes for several distinct types of neurons that might have increased vulnerability to TSC mutations, whereas large proliferation and differentiation changes reported as a potential mechanism in TSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> might be partially balanced by homeostatic processes in human developing brain. The vulnerable neuronal populations include L2_3_CUX2, which are late-born principal neurons during the inside-out generation of human cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Interestingly, our data suggest that late-born neurons and late cortical developmental processes might be the most affected and thus most relevant to TSC disease etiology. Hence, the increase in abundance of early-born L5_6_FEZF2/THEMIS neurons can be due to a delayed switch from early to late born cortical principal neurons. Likewise, increased abundance of L2_3_CUX2 neurons in lower layers and L5_6_FEZF2/THEMIS in upper layer can arise by impairment of neuroblast migration during late cortical development. This modulation of migration and differentiation is likely limited to the embryonic period, when both processes are particularly sensitive to neurodevelopmental risk factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, including the impact of TSC1/2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, active epileptogenesis might modulate terminal differentiation/maturation in neurons in childhood and adolescence since we found positively enriched TF networks controlling neuronal differentiation (e.g., REST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>) in TSC.</p><p id="P32">Another prominent finding was that protein biogenesis and mitochondrial respiration genes were highly downregulated in TSC cells accompanied by a switch to fatty acid-dependent energy metabolism due to upregulation of corresponding gene expression pathways. Interestingly, the metabolic shift was specific to neurons and not glial cells. The switch to fatty acid-dependent energy metabolism together with downregulation of mitochondrial respiration might indicate that, due to epileptogenesis, neuronal networks may experience energy shortages and neurons try to adjust their energy demands by turning to fatty acids. Interestingly, this downregulation of protein biogenesis and mitochondrial metabolism contradicts the expected outcome of mTOR overactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. This suggests that the effect of TSC2 loss-of-function might be more complex than mTOR simply being overactivated, where brain homeostatic processes are likely to modulate the loss-of-function impact. It is likely that homeostatic processes are modulating the mTOR pathway and influence cellular metabolism as we detected a decrease in expression in the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway members RRAGA and EEF2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> as well as in the major, direct mTOR activator RHEB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, there might be not enough energy to produce amino acids, as the genes of upstream sensor of amino acids <italic>RRAGA</italic> and downstream translation activation <italic>EEF2</italic> are downregulated. This might consequently lead to protein biogenesis becoming greatly downregulated across all neuronal subtypes in TSC. Concomitantly, homeostatic processes counteract mTOR hyperactivation and decrease <italic>RHEB</italic> gene expression.</p><p id="P33">It was peculiar to see the largest effect of the metabolic switch in principal neurons, as well as in PVALB and VIP GABAergic neurons, since we previously found similar neuron types to be the most affected in another focal epilepsy - the dysplastic cortex associated with TLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, GWAS genes linked to focal, but not generalized, epilepsy were also enriched in PVALB and VIP subtypes. Thus, increased excitation of principal neurons, with reduced inhibition of PVALB neurons and enhanced disinhibition by VIP neurons, might constitute a common seizure-generating circuit in cortical focal epilepsies.</p><p id="P34">The largest magnitude of gene expression changes was found in subtypes of principal neurons and the ID2 family of GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). While it was expected for principal neurons, the discovery that ID2 family neurons, primarily residing in layer 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, are associated with epilepsy, was unexpected and novel, as they have not previously been reported play a role in epileptogenesis. Interestingly, ID2 neurons are the last to mature in the human cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup> and they originate from the caudal ganglionic eminence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, which was recently proposed as the major lineage expanded in TSC during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>, again indicating particular vulnerability of late cortical development in TSC.</p><p id="P35">Strikingly, another common feature of both focal epilepsy in TSC (this study) and in TLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> was the strong upregulation of glutamate signaling in principal neurons and, in particular, AMPA receptor auxiliary subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>, CKAMP44 (gene <italic>SHISA9</italic>), CKAMP52 (<italic>SHISA6</italic>), GSG1L (<italic>GSG1L</italic>), TARPg2 (<italic>CACNG2</italic>), and TARPg3 (<italic>CACNG3</italic>). As in TLE cortex, several members among the CKAMP AMPA receptor auxiliary proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup> were upregulated. Thus, CKAMP44 was upregulated across all layers of principal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Increases in AMPA receptor-bound CKAMP44 might decrease the deactivation rate for AMPA receptors, increase synaptic strength, and modulate short-term synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>.

Interestingly, we mostly detected an increased abundance in the TSC lesions, which included GABAergic neurons representing PVALB_MEPE and PVALB_LGR5 neurons as well as a rare SST_TH subtype. PVALB_MEPE and PVALB_LGR5 are basket cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and project onto the somas of excitatory principal neurons, providing a strong inhibitory tone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, these neurons might be particularly sensitive to metabolic impairments in TSC due to high energy demands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. SST_TH neurons were previously reported as deep-layer GABAergic neurons that are present in human cortex while absent in great apes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. In human cortex, these neurons express TH protein and might release dopamine, whereas SST was detected at the RNA but not at the protein level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, which also might be due to very low levels of protein expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. Changes both in basket and in SST_TH neurons can lead to functional modulation of local circuits, where the former might be a homeostatic mechanism to increase inhibition within the epileptic focus and the latter might lead to higher levels of dopamine within cortical tubers.</p><p id="P37">All three major types of glial cells exhibited significant changes in TSC lesions.

Interestingly, prior studies reported hypomyelination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> and oligodendrocyte loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup> in TSC. Our data show that metabolism and protein biogenesis are impaired in TSC oligodendrocytes, thus indicating that a subpopulation of the TSC-elevated oligodendrocytes we identified might represent dysfunctional oligodendrocytes that do not contribute to myelination. Finally, we observed an overall reduction in astrocytes in TSC, which might be either a trait that was overlooked by classical histology methods or could be due to size exclusion during nuclear sorting (see Methods) and disruption of large cytomegalic cells that represent TSC astroglia.</p><p id="P38">Overall, our study demonstrates that, despite the highly disorganized structure of TSC, all neuronal identities present in the neurotypical cortex are also present in TSC, although the compositional and transcriptomic landscape is altered. This, in turn, opens tremendous potential translational opportunities, whereby local modulation of circuit reorganization can potentially restore circuit structure and ultimately recover function and ameliorate seizures. Additionally, therapeutic opportunities might involve modulating AMPA signaling and, in particular, AMPA auxiliary subunits, as well as offer the perspective of a ketogenic diet that takes into account our findings for downregulation mitochondrial respiration and switching to fatty acid metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Sample information</title><p id="P39">The description of human brain samples is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>.</p><p id="P40">Cortical tubers were obtained from tuberectomy of frontal lesions of patients with <italic>TSC2</italic> loss-of-function variant tuberous sclerosis undergoing surgery at the Department of Neuropathology at Amsterdam UMC (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), the UMC Utrecht (Utrecht, The Netherlands), and Queensland Children’s Hospital, Australia.

After staining, nuclei were washed in 0.5% BSA in 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with RNAse inhibitor (Takara, 2313B, final concentration 0.4 U/μl) and spun down at 1000<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 C°; subsequently, the pellet was resuspended in 100 μL 0.5% BSA/PBS with RNAse inhibitor. Samples were filtered through a 35-μM strainer (Falcon) and 400 μL of 0.5 BSA/PBS with RNAse inhibitor was used to wash the filter to end up with a final volume of 500 μL nuclei suspension. Nuclei were stained with 0.75 μL nucleic acid fluorophore 7-aminoactinomycin (7-AAD) (Sigma, A9400-1MG, 1 mg/mL) into 500 μL of nuclei suspension and incubated on ice until sorting. Prior to sorting, 1.5 mL Lo bind Eppendorf for sorting were coated for at least 24 h with 1.5 mL 0.5% BSA in 1X PBS and aspirated just before initiating the sorting. Sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria III (70-μM nozzle) with cooling set to 4 °C. Nuclei were sorted into two fractions, a NeuN+ for neurons and a NeuN- for glia and other non-neuronal cells. Nucleus suspensions were placed on ice immediately after sorting, nuclei were counted using a hemocytometer, and quality was evaluated. To avoid overrepresentation of oligodendrocytes and thus a corresponding reduction in the number of neurons that are recovered, which is typical for snRNA-seq analyses of the human brain, sorted fractions were pooled together with 20% NeuN- and 80% NeuN+ ratio. A strategy to enrich neurons to 80% of the total cell input was chosen due to limited availability of the rare, resected pediatric brain tissue. In order to identify and characterize the most subtypes of neurons, including rare ones, a relatively high number of neurons is required to gain the resolution and granularity to capture neuronal populations that are low in abundance.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>10x Chromium library preparation</title><p id="P43">Chromium Single cell 3’ Reagent Kits v3.1 (10x Genomics, PN-1000121) were used to prepare the library in accordance with the standard protocol.
