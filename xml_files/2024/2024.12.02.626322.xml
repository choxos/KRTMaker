Doses were selected based on previous studies in pig models. Animals were pre-treated with aspirin (75mg) and simvastatin (1mg/kg/day) in food (Accord, Barnstaple, UK) for 5 days prior to surgery and then daily until termination. Treatment with ramipril (2.5mg/day) and clopidogrel (75mg/day) in food was begun on the day after surgery and then daily until termination. On day 2 after MI, following MRI (as below), pigs were randomized according to a blind pre-defined sequence to receive either AZD8329 or vehicle daily until study termination. The drug vehicle was prepared by dissolving 11g of kleptulose powder (Roquette, France) in 110ml of working stock (90% apple juice and 10% water), pH=8, then mixed with 30g of oats to make a porridge. For drug treatment AZD8329 was dissolved at 50mg/kg of animal weight in the kleptulose solution at pH=10. Once the drug was dissolved, the pH was set to the original pH=8, prior to mixture with oats. Animals were trained daily to eat the porridge formulation without drug during the pre-surgery acclimatisation period. The formulation/ oats mixture was given to the animals on an empty stomach and entire feed consumption was monitored and recorded by the dedicated senior veterinary technician. The animals were not fed with their routine feed until 1 hour after the mixture had been consumed to ensure no interference with uptake of the drug. The dose of AZD8329 (50mg/kg/day) and formulation for delivery was selected following previous pharmacokinetic studies and modelling, with the aim of maintaining a plasma concentration at least 3 times the <italic>in vitro</italic> IC<sub>50</sub> (0.03x10<sup>-6</sup>M) at steady state.

Mechanical ventilation consisted of fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.21-1; tidal volume, 10 ml/kg; respiratory rate, 20 breaths per min; positive end-expiratory pressure, 0-3 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. Following IV heparinisation to keep activated coagulation time (ACT) &gt;250sec, animals were subjected to closed chest MI procedure of the antero-apical LV territory under fluoroscopic guidance (Artis Zee, Siemens, Germany). Central vascular access was achieved with a two-way catheter sited in the left jugular vein and an introducer in the left carotid artery. Ringer’s lactate (4 ml/kg/h, B.Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) was used IV to maintain euvolemia. Continuous invasive blood pressure and routine 12 leads ECG were implemented throughout the MI procedure along with peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) that was monitored by a pulse oximeter sited on the tail, with data capture integrated into the Datex-Aisys anaesthetic machine. Following instrumentation, the animals were allowed to stabilise for a minimum of 30 minutes. Animals were then taken to the adjacent interventional theatre. To minimise the risk of ventricular fibrillation (VF), during/after the MI procedure infusions of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=2566">amiodarone</ext-link> (150 mg) and magnesium sulphate (4 mmol) were administered over 90min via the jugular venous line, commencing soon after access was gained.</p><p id="P14">Following left coronary angiography, a 0.014-inch interventional guide wire (Runthrough floppy, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was steered to the distal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, and an appropriately sized balloon (2.5-3.0 mm Emerge, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) was positioned beyond the LAD first diagonal branch. The balloon was then inflated to stop blood flow to induce ischemia and then kept up for 60min to induce acute MI. Blood pressure was kept within reference intervals using small increment of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=7229">metaraminol</ext-link> (0.5mg) IV and/or volume replacement while SpO<sub>2</sub> levels were kept &gt;94%. ON completion of 60min of ischemia, the balloon was deflated to start reperfusion and animals closely monitored for a period of 45-60min till fully awake and deemed suitable for transfer to the maintenance area according to predefined standard operating procedure by senior expert veterinary anaesthetists. Amiodarone infusion (150mg over 90min) was started before coronary occlusion to prevent ventricular fibrillation (VF) with additional bolus (100mg) and direct current (DC) cardioversion used in case of VF occurrence during ischemia. In case of VF or haemodynamic compromise during the ischaemic period, resuscitation through direct current (DC) cardioversion, manual chest compression and/or inotropic support was provided, as required according to a predefined protocol. If pre-defined resuscitation cycles were unsuccessful, the experiment was terminated.

Images were acquired on a Magnetom Prisma® 3T system, (Siemens Healthcare limited, Erlangen, Germany). Cardiac MRI scans were performed in supine recumbence with the surface coil positioned centrally on the sternum. Images were acquired on a Magnetom Prisma® 3T system, (Siemens Healthcare limited, Erlangen, Germany) using the integrated spine coil posteriorly, and the Siemens ‘Body 13’coil anteriorly. Cardiac gating was achieved using a surface ECG or, in cases where there was poor triggering, a peripheral pulse monitor placed on the tail. Due to the importance of a stable ECG, the animals were shaved, and the skin prepared with Nuprep® (Weaver and Company, Aurora, CO, USA) to improve skin contact. After acquisition of localiser images, True–FISP functional cinematic images were acquired in the three long axis planes (2, 3- and 4- chamber orientation) of the left ventricle, and in a contiguous stack of short axis slices from base (at the level of the mitral valve) to the apex. The acquisition of parameters was in keeping the established protocols allowing visual assessment of the 17 American Heart Association (AHA) myocardial segments. After cine imaging, a dose of 0.2 mmol kg<sup>-1</sup> body weight of Gadobutrol (Gadovist™, Bayer, Newbury, Berks, UK) contrast agent was administered, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images were acquired after 8-10 minutes in line with established guidelines (Kramer, Barkhausen, Flamm, Kim, Nagel &amp; Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Board of Trustees Task Force on Standardized, 2013) to measure scar size. Images were acquired in the long axis and short axis using a 2D FLASH PSIR pulse sequence: slice thickness, 8 mm; base resolution, 256; phase resolution, 64%; TE, 1.55 ms; TR, 750 ms; TI, 300-350 ms. On completion, all animals were recovered for 45-60min and then sent back to their maintenance pen. Imaging was performed by a blinded expert radiographer (CJ). On completion of the 4-week study period, animals underwent a repeat cardiac MRI as above, followed by controlled termination, as below. Subsequent blinded analysis of cine and LGE images was performed at the Edinburgh Clinical Research Imaging Centre using commercial clinical analysis software cvi42 (Circle Cardiovascular Imaging).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><label>2.4</label><title>Blood sampling, troponin and LC-MS/MS for steroids and drug concentrations</title><p id="P16">Blood was collected under GA or during recovery from jugular or peripheral vein line at baseline, end of ischemia and at 1min, 1h, 24h, 48 and 28d post-MI. 10 mL of blood was collected into EDTA vacutainers, then centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C, plasma was collected and stored at -80°C. Serum was collected at baseline, 24h, 48h and 28d post-MI by inverting 10 mL of blood 5 times, leaving at RT for 39 min to allow clot formation and removing clot by 1500g centrifugation for 10 minutes at 4°C before storing serum at -80°C. Only 7 serum samples from each group were suitable for troponin analysis due to evidence of haemolysis in some samples. All subsequent analysis was carried out in a blinded manner. Troponin I was assessed at the TBRC in plasma samples by commercial ELISA assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Diagnostics, UK).

The glucocorticoid (cortisol and cortisone) concentrations were calculated using linear regression of the calibration curve, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Denham et al., 2024</xref>). To measure the circulating concentration of the drug AZD8329, plasma samples were pre-diluted 1000 x in water (LC-MS grade, VWR, 83645.320) and 100 μL of these diluted samples were extracted alongside calibration standards covering range 2.5-1000 ng/mL of AZD8329, spiked into 100 μL of water (LC-MS grade). Samples and calibration standards including blanks, were pipetted into 2 mL deep 96-well collection plate (Biotage, 121-5203), sealed using 96-well plate sealing film (VWR, 391-1250) and shaken for 10 min at 600 rpm on a 3005 Plate Shaker (GFL) to allow mixing. The collection plate and PPT+ plate were both loaded into an Extrahera liquid handling robot (Biotage, Sweden), which loaded 400 μL acetonitrile + 0.1% v/v formic acid (VWR, 83640.320 and Fisher, 10596814, respectively) followed by transfer of the samples (100 μL) into the PPT+ plate. After a 10 min incubation at RT, positive pressure was applied to the PPT+ plate to elute samples into a 96-well collection plate. The collection plate was transferred to a TurboVap 96 Dual Evaporator (Biotage, Sweden) with an oxygen free nitrogen gas flow of 30 L/min and the samples reduced to dryness at 40°C. Once dry, the samples and standards were dissolved in 10% v/v acetonitrile (100 μL). The plate was sealed and shaken for 10 min at 600 rpm to ensure all analytes resolubilised. The reconstituted samples were subject to LC-MS/MS analysis, beginning with separation on a Waters Acquity I-Class ultra-performance liquid chromatography system (Waters, UK). The separation was carried out on a Kinetex C18 column (50 x 2.1 mm; 1.7 μm), (00B-4475-AN; Phenomenex, UK), maintained at 50°C with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min and a mobile phase A (MPA) –water with 0.1% v/v formic acid; mobile phase B (MPB)— acetonitrile with 0.1% v/v formic acid. Starting at 5% MPB for 1 min, increasing to 100% MPB at 3.5 min, held for 2 min before re-equilibrating to 5% MPB over 2 mins, giving total run time of 7.5 mins per sample. Detection of analyte (11βHSD1i, AZD8329) was performed using positive ion electrospray ionisation mode on a QTRAP 6500+mass spectrometer (Sciex, UK) operated by Analyst 1.7.1. The source was operated at 600°C with an lonSpray voltage of -4.5 kVcurtain gas of 40 psi, nitrogen nebuliser ion source gas 1 (GS1) of 60 psi, and heater ion source gas 2 (GS2) of 40 psi.

Collagen area was quantified in the infarct using the QuPath threshold function in 20 random 1.6 mm<sup>2</sup> boxes. To analyse collagen organisation, sections were imaged with polarised light using an Axiovert 200M microscope (Carl Zeiss Ltd) and 3-5 random fields in the infarct were imaged at magnification of 40x. Collagen has natural birefringence that is enhanced by PSR, causing its fibres to appear either red or green under polarised light. Thin, newly synthesised fibres tend to appear yellow-green (YG), while thick, established fibres appear red-orange (RO). The areas of YG and of RO collagen were determined using the Threshold Colour module in ImageJ. Based on optimisation in trial images, the hue threshold for RO was set between 0-35, while the hue threshold for YG was set between 36-110 (RGB hue). Brightness was consistently set at a range of 15-255 and saturation at 0-255.

Differential expression analysis in <italic>limma</italic> identified specific proteins in these 2 pathways that were regulated by 11BHSD1i at 28 days after MI (<italic>Figure 9a</italic> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 5-6</xref>). Interestingly, this analysis also highlighted a significant reduction in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a protein associated with increased wall stress, consistent with improved cardiac function following 11BHSD1i administration. Network analysis in the <italic>STRING</italic> database identified association between proteins regulated by 11BHSD1i treatment and again primarily highlights proteins involved in extracellular matrix organisation, and links of these to complement related proteins (<italic>Figure 9b</italic>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S25" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P34">The primary aim of this study was to determine the potential for repurposing of pharmacological inhibitors of 11ßHSD1 to prevent adverse structural and functional cardiac remodelling following MI. The findings show that intervention for 4 weeks from 2 days after MI with the 11ßHSD1i AZD8293, in a translational percutaneous balloon mini-pig MI/reperfusion model treated with guideline recommended clinical therapies, successfully prevented functional decline and ventricular dilatation relative to vehicle treatment. Novel application of mass spectrometry imaging identified the repairing infarct as a key target for 11ßHSD1i post-MI, and proteomics revealed altered regulation of extracellular matrix processing in 11ßHSD1i treated pigs.</p><p id="P35">In the early period post-MI, HPA activation in response to a myocardial insult results in an acute rise in plasma GCs. Thereafter GCs are removed from the circulation by the action of the 11ßHSD2 in the kidney, generating the metabolite cortisone that is a substrate for tissue specific regeneration of active cortisol in cells expressing 11ßHSD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chapman, Holmes &amp; Seckl, 2013</xref>). In the heart <italic>HSD11B1</italic> is expressed in cardiomyocytes, and particularly highly in fibroblasts, as well as in neutrophils and macrophages recruited to the heart after MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gray, White, Castellan, McSweeney &amp; Chapman, 2017</xref>). Cardiomyocyte damage in response to ischaemia quickly activates inflammatory cell recruitment to the heart after MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hilgendorf, Frantz &amp; Frangogiannis, 2024</xref>). While this is essential for repair, over-recruitment is detrimental and can lead to cardiac rupture. Previously we showed that GCs regenerated in cardiac fibroblasts by 11ßHSD1 have an important role post-MI in suppressing the early recruitment of inflammatory cells by CXCL2 and CXCL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Mylonas et al., 2017</xref>). Regeneration in cardiomyocytes may also contribute to the early known cardioprotective actions of GCs in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Libby, Maroko, Bloor, Sobel &amp; Braunwald, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Skyschally et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Tokudome et al., 2009</xref>). In the present study pharmacological intervention with 11ßHSD1i was therefore begun from 2 days after MI to preserve any initial protective influence of 11ßHSD1 activity. Delaying intervention did not however prevent the longer-term benefits of 11ßHSD1i in terms of preservation of cardiac function and prevention of ventricular dilatation. Ejection fraction was improved by more than a clinically significant 5% in 11ßHSD1i-treated pigs.</p><p id="P36">In our previous mouse studies, improved function in <italic>Hsd11b1</italic>KO post-MI followed promotion of alternative macrophage polarisation, neovascularisation, vessel maturation and prevention of infarct expansion during repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">McSweeney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">White et al., 2016</xref>). In the present study, in a more translational mini-pig model, there was clear evidence for ongoing infarct repair at study termination 28 days after MI, with the presence of FAP<sup>+ve</sup> activated fibroblasts and pro-repair CD163<sup>+ve</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Schnitter et al., 2024</xref>). Application of mass spectrometry imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Israr, Bernieh, Salzano, Cassambai, Yazaki &amp; Suzuki, 2020</xref>) to pig heart tissue sections collected after <italic>in vivo</italic> AZD8329 administration showed clear co-localisation of the 11ßHSD1i with the repairing tissue, supporting a role for 11ßHSD1 in this area. Identification by proteomics of modification in complement pathways in infarct tissue from 11ßHSDi treated pigs is consistent with an impact on the inflammatory response. However, neither macrophage density nor the extent of neovascularisation or infarct size were influenced by inhibition of 11ßHSD1. We cannot rule out an influence of the concurrent drug intervention in both groups that may have masked any effect here as both statins and ACE inhibitors can influence inflammation and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bryniarski, Nazimek &amp; Marcinkiewicz, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Li, Zhao, Zhou, Chen &amp; Li, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Martovytskyi, Shelest &amp; Kravchun, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Weis, Heeschen, Glassford &amp; Cooke, 2002</xref>). The timing of intervention, and the use of female pigs in a reperfusion model, rather than permanent coronary ligation in male mice, are also distinct from previous studies. Neovascularisation in the infarct border is less prominent in the pig heart repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gallet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Liao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Rios-Navarro et al., 2018</xref>), which, more akin to human, tends instead to show evidence of collateral vessel expansion between the infarct and healthy myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Schwartz et al., 1984</xref>). The mechanism underlying preserved structure and function in the translational pig model with 11ßHSD1i appears to be distinct from that previously reported in the mouse.</p><p id="P37">Change in scar structure can also impact on remote ventricular remodelling, and the reduction in the extent of BNP in the infarct border here is consistent with reduced wall stress after 11ßHSD1i. While there was no change in the amount of collagen or expression of collagen isoforms, birefringence imaging did support a potential change in collagen processing. This was accompanied by a reduction in expression of <italic>LOX</italic>, encoding the collagen cross linking enzyme lysyl oxidase, suppression of which has previously been linked to improved functional outcomes after MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gonzalez-Santamaria et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Ma et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Vukicevic et al., 2022</xref>). Proteomic analysis also pointed to extracellular matrix organisation as a major target of 11ßHSD1i, with reductions in fibronectin, procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer (PCOLCE) and prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 2 (P4HA2) proteins involved in collagen processing. Suppression of fibronectin was previously observed in mouse cardiac fibroblasts after <italic>Hsd11b1</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wang et al., 2022</xref>) and ejection fraction was improved post-MI by fibronectin inhibition and by fibroblast specific knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Valiente-Alandi et al., 2018</xref>). PCOLCE is also targeted by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists that improve cardiac function after MI in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kessler-Icekson, Schlesinger, Freimann &amp; Kessler, 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P38">In the heart GCs regenerated by 11ßHSD1 can activate both glucocorticoid receptors and mineralocorticoid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gray, White, Castellan, McSweeney &amp; Chapman, 2017</xref>), both implicated in repair after MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fraccarollo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Galuppo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Mihailidou, Loan Le, Mardini &amp; Funder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Mylonas et al., 2017</xref>). 11ßHSD1 additionally regulates tissue availability of biologically active oxysterols, through the interconversion of 7 keto and 7 beta hydroxycholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Mitic et al., 2013</xref>). The profile of 11ßHSD1i is therefore distinct from that of mineralocorticoid antagonists, currently recommended to prevent development of HF post-MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">McDonagh et al., 2021</xref>), and do not cause hyperkalaemia, that can limit the clinical use of this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Vizzardi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P39">11ßHSD1i are safe in humans and have beneficial metabolic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Anderson &amp; Walker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Villemagne et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Webster et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Wilton-Waddell et al., 2024</xref>). The present translational study shows that administration after MI results in a clinically significant improvement in ejection fraction, even with concurrent relevant therapy. Together with evidence that tissue expression of <italic>HSD11B1</italic> is increased in ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Tiganescu et al., 2013</xref>) when the risk of MI is higher, this study provides strong support for the repurposing of 11ßHSD1i in the post-MI setting to prevent the development of HF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS201743-supplement-Supplemental_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d47aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by a Translational Grant from the British Heart Foundation (BHF TG/18/1/33048), a Novel and Emerging Technologies Grant from Heart Research UK (RG2694), by a Wellcome Trust (One Health Models of Disease) studentship to SAD (218471/Z/19/Z) and by a Wellcome Trust Multiuser Equipment Grant, (208402/Z/17/Z).
