Several of the functionally known neutrophil GPCRs, are not part of the human neutrophil proteome. To identify GPCRs not earlier shown to be expressed in human neutrophils, we utilized a microfluidic flow cell technique in combination with subcellular granule fractionation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This approach added the hydroxy-carboxylic acid 3 receptor (HCA<sub>3</sub>R) to the human neutrophil proteome. The β-oxidation intermediate 3-hydroxy-octanoic acid (3-OH-C8) is the primary endogenous agonist for this receptor which is highly expressed in adipocytes where it has anti-lipolytic effects. Literature describing the role and function of HCA<sub>3</sub>R in human neutrophils is scarce. We now show that 3-OH-C8 as well the synthetic HCA<sub>3</sub>R agonist IBC 293 activate human neutrophils determined as an increase in the intracellular concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) and activation of the NADPH oxidase. However, in contrast to the rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> which could be triggered in naïve neutrophils, pre-treatment of neutrophils was required for HCA<sub>3</sub>Rs to activate the NADPH oxidase. That is, the HCA<sub>3</sub>R-mediated NADPH oxidase activation occurred only in neutrophils pre-treated with either an actin cytoskeleton disrupter or an allosteric modulator targeting the GPCR termed free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2R). Our findings demonstrate that HCA<sub>3</sub>R is not only a new member of the human neutrophil proteome, but also exhibits functional activity with complex signaling pathways when stimulated with endogenous and synthetic HCA<sub>3</sub>R agonists.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>GPR109B</kwd><kwd>receptor signaling</kwd><kwd>NADPH oxidase</kwd><kwd>actin cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>receptor transactivation</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Neutrophils, the most abundant leukocytes in human blood are of prime importance for our innate immune defense against invading microorganisms and for a proper initiation and resolution of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Neutrophils sense molecules that regulate the inflammatory activity in large part through expression of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. These GPCRs are exposed on the cell surface and/or localized in the membrane of mobilizable intracellular granules/vesicles in resting (naïve) peripheral blood neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. In response to different environmental changes, e.g., increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) the granule-/vesicle-localized receptors can be mobilized to the cell surface. Neutrophils in which the granule-/vesicle-stored receptors have been mobilized to the cell surface have an increased receptor repertoire that allow them to sense and respond to an increased number of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs, e.g., ATP that bind the GPCR termed P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor [P2Y<sub>2</sub>R]) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs, e.g., bacterial derived formyl peptides that bind the GPCRs termed formyl peptide receptors [FPR1 and FPR2]). In addition, these neutrophils are commonly transferred to a functional state characterized by an enhanced responsiveness to certain stimuli, e.g., an augmented (primed) production of superoxide anions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) generated by the NADPH oxidase in response to the FPR1 prototype agonist fMLF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P3">With &gt; 800 members, the GPCRs comprise the largest family of human membrane receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Functional studies using selective ligands targeting diverse GPCRs have shown that human neutrophils express several different GPCR family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Yet, in studies aiming to identify human neutrophil constituents using tool systems such as large-scale protein expression, many proteins (&gt; 1000) have indeed been identified. However, only a handful of these are GPCRs and several GPCRs shown to be functionally expressed in human neutrophils are not part of the in the proteome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The GPCRs that have been shown to be functionally active in neutrophil but remain to be identified at the protein level include for example FFA2R (Uniprot accession number [AC]: O15552), P2Y<sub>2</sub>R (Uniprot AC: P41231), HRH2 (Uniprot AC: P25021), CXCR4 (Uniprot AC: P61073), and ChemR23 (Uniprot AC: Q99788). It is, thus, obvious that the sample preparations technique used to proteolytically digest intact proteins in subcellular organelles to peptides for proteome profiling of neutrophils must be improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. It has been described that a microfluidic flow cell technique with which immobilized membranes, organelles or intact cells are used as substrate for the enzymatic digestion of proteins, which may improve handling, characterization and identification of plasma membrane and organelle expressed proteins that are difficult to process by other techniques that typically involve organic solvents or detergents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. More importantly, the flow cell technique allows isolated plasma membranes and organelles to be immobilized, and the stationary phase of membrane expressed proteins formed can then be used for proteolytic digestion of the parts of the proteins that are exposed on the surface of the plasma membrane or on the cytosolic side of organelle membranes.</p><p id="P4">In an attempt to improve the detection level of neutrophil GPCRs exposed on the plasma membrane and on intracellular organelle membranes, we isolated subcellular fractions using a two-step Percoll gradient as described by Niels Borregaard and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The isolated specific granules and the membranes in the light membrane fraction enriched in plasma membranes together with secretory vesicles were immobilized on the surface of a microfluidic flow cell chamber. Proteolytic cleavage was then performed on the immobilized plasma and granule membranes and the cleaved peptide fragments were analyzed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]). In addition to GPCRs already described to be expressed in neutrophils, we identified peptide sequences identical to parts of the cytosolic C-terminus of the hydroxy-carboxylic acid 3 receptor (HCA<sub>3</sub>R, also known as GPR109B, HM74, and Niacin receptor 2 [NIACR2]), suggesting that this receptor is expressed in neutrophils at the protein level. To characterize HCA<sub>3</sub>R further, we utilized two selective HCA<sub>3</sub>R agonists, the endogenous β-oxidation intermediate 3-hydroxy-octanoic acid (3-OH-C8; PubChem compound identifier [CID]: 26613) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and the synthetic molecule termed IBC 293 (1-(1-Methylethyl)-1H-benzotriazole-5-carboxylic acid; PubChem CID: 2736690) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] and investigated HCA<sub>3</sub>R mediated human neutrophil functions with focus on NADPH oxidase activity. Our results show that despite that both agonists triggered a rise in the intracellular concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) in neutrophils, they were poor activators of the NADPH oxidase when added to either naïve or TNF-primed neutrophils. Yet, when IBC 293 was added to neutrophils with either a disrupted actin cytoskeleton or pre-treated with an allosteric modulator selective for the GPCR termed free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2R), this synthetic HCA<sub>3</sub>R agonist was turned into a potent activator of the superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>)-generating NADPH oxidase. The latter route for IBC 293-induced NADPH oxidase activity relied on a receptor transactivation of allosterically modulated FFA2Rs and the response was functional selective (biased) towards O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>-production as presence of the allosteric FFA2R modulator lacked effect on the IBC 293 mediated increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>1</label><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Chemicals</title><p id="P5">Cytiva Ficoll-Paque™ Plus Medium was from Fischer Scientific (Gothenburg, Sweden), Dextran T500 was from Pharmacosmos (Holbæk, Denmark) whereas Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (AM) was from Invitrogen by Thermo Fischer Scientific (Gothenburg, Sweden).

As no HCA<sub>3</sub>R receptor antagonists have been described that could be used to determine the direct involvement of HCA<sub>3</sub>R in the IBC 293 and 3-OH-C8 mediated increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, we next performed receptor homologous desensitization experiments. Our data show that neutrophils first activated by IBC 293 were completely desensitized (non-responsive) to a second stimulation with 3-OH-C8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This result strongly implies that both agonists activate the same functionally expressed receptor in human neutrophils, namely HCA<sub>3</sub>R.</p><p id="P19">Most neutrophil GPCRs that activate the phospholipase C (PLC) dependent pathway that gives rise to increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> are coupled to a Gα<sub>i</sub> containing G protein, and PLC is activated by the G protein derived β<sub>γ</sub> subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].

Our results show that when it comes to untreated isolated human blood neutrophils (naïve neutrophils), the HCA<sub>3</sub>R agonist IBC 293 was a very poor activator of the NADPH oxidase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). This is also true for the P2Y<sub>2</sub>R agonist ATP, which has been demonstrated as a biased signaling agonist. That is, when ATP binds neutrophil expressed P2Y<sub>2</sub>Rs an activation of the PLC pathway is initiated that leads to a rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Yet, this increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is not accompanied by activation of the O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> producing NADPH oxidase. This biased signaling by ATP is not due to an inability of P2Y<sub>2</sub>R to activate the NADPH oxidase but to that this signaling pathway in naïve neutrophils is blocked by the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Accordingly, the NADPH oxidase was activated by ATP when the cytoskeleton first had been disrupted by the actin cytoskeleton disrupting agent latrunculin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Also, IBC 293 triggered a robust O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> production in neutrophils pre-treated with latrunculin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) and the response was concentration dependent with a half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of around 9 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>) for this synthetic HCA<sub>3</sub>R agonist.

In summary, these data show that IBC 293 not only triggers a rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, but also can activate neutrophil expressed HCA<sub>3</sub>Rs to produce NADPH oxidase derived O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>.

The FFA2R allosteric modulator, thus, functions as a master regulator that amplifies the NADPH oxidase activity induced by agonists specific for other neutrophil GPCRs such as P2Y<sub>2</sub>R, PAFR, BLT<sub>1</sub>R, FPR1 and FPR2. Furthermore, this receptor transactivation (receptor crosstalk) involving FFA2Rs and a GPCRs unrelated to FFA2R has been shown to be most pronounced in TNF primed neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>].

In addition, the CATPB also inhibited the IBC 293-induced NADPH oxidase activity in Cmp58 pre-treated neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A-B</xref>).

GPCRs are receptors with multiple transmembrane regions as well as small extracellular regions. This makes it difficult to digest these membrane proteins into peptides suitable for mass spectrometry analysis. In addition, since the expression level of certain GPCRs can be low in some samples, these GPCRs may be underrepresented in samples of high complexity. This means that in some samples and under certain conditions the GPCRs can become “masked” by highly abundant proteins. Therefore, sample preparation strategies are crucial for proteomic analysis. In this study, samples were prepared by subcellular fractionation of human neutrophils, as a “purification” step. These samples were then subjected to the lipid-based protein immobilization (LPI) methodology, which targets membrane proteins in their native state, prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, as an approach to increase the detection sensitivity of GPCRs expressed by human neutrophils. This combination of sample preparation/purification and LPI methodology resulted in the identification of eight GPCRs known to be present and/or functionally expressed in human neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. More importantly, to our knowledge, we also identified the protein expression of HCA<sub>3</sub>R in human neutrophils for the first time. That is, two specific peptide sequences corresponding to the sequence present in the cytosolic tail of HCA<sub>3</sub>R were detected (STSVELTGDPNK and STSVELTGDPNKTR).</p><p id="P28">HCA<sub>3</sub>R, together with HCA1R (GPR81) and HCA2R (GPR109A), belongs to a subfamily of GPCRs that are all activated by different energy metabolism intermediates called hydroxycarboxyl acid ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. The three HCARs share significant sequence homology, but while HCA1R binds lactic acid (the end product of glycolysis), HCA2R binds the ketone body 3-hydroxy-butyric acid (β-hydroxybutyrate [β-HB]), the HCA<sub>3</sub>R binds the β-oxidation intermediate 3-hydroxy-octanoic acid (3-OH-C8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. All described HCA<sub>3</sub>R-mediated effector functions in other cells are sensitive to pertussis toxin, strongly suggesting that the HCA<sub>3</sub>R couple to Gαi/o-containing heterotrimeric G proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. However, while all three HCARs are expressed in adipocytes, only HCA<sub>2</sub>R and HCA<sub>3</sub>R (which share &gt; 95% amino acid sequence similarity) are expressed by immune cells including neutrophils. While there are some studies on the function of neutrophil expressed HCA<sub>2</sub>Rs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], the literature regarding the function of neutrophil expressed HCA<sub>3</sub>Rs is scarce. It has however been implied that neutrophil expressed HCA<sub>3</sub>Rs might be involved in chemotaxis towards certain aromatic D-amino acids (D-phenylalanine and D-tryptophan) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. However, the physiological and pathophysiological relevance of this finding has been questioned based on the rare presence of D-amino acids in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. HCA<sub>3</sub>R was the first of the HCARs whose cDNA was cloned and analyzed. At this time point, almost 30 years ago, it was also reported that neutrophils expressed HCA<sub>3</sub>Rs at the mRNA level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Our current study now adds that neutrophils also express this receptor at the protein level and that it is functionally active in neutrophils when binding its endogenous agonist 3-OH-C8, produced during β-oxidation of fatty acids in various tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. While the plasma levels measured under healthy conditions appears too low to mediate HCA<sub>3</sub>R activation, the levels of 3-OH-C8 are elevated under conditions of high β-oxidation rates, such as fasting, and it remains to be determined if these elevated levels are sufficient to activate neutrophils in <italic>vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>].</p><p id="P29">In order to functionally characterize the neutrophil expressed HCA<sub>3</sub>R <italic>in vitro</italic> we used both the endogenous agonist 3-OH-C8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], and the synthetic agonist IBC 293 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].

This is similar to ATP which upon binding to neutrophil-expressed P2Y<sub>2</sub>Rs mediates a rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> but lacks capacity to activate the NADPH oxidase in both naïve and primed neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Hence, our results add to the growing evidence showing that activation of a neutrophil GPCR can mediate increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> without triggering an activation of the NADPH oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. That is, a GPCR mediated rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is not sufficient for NADPH oxidase activation. Moreover, when it comes to neutrophil expressed GPCRs it appears that the downstream signaling that regulates both the initiation and termination of GPCR-induced NADPH oxidase activity is controlled by the actin cytoskeleton rather than the cytoplasmic adaptor protein β-arrestin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. This was evident also in the current study where we show that in a similar manner as ATP also IBC 293 could activate the NADPH oxidase provided that the actin cytoskeleton disrupting agent latrunculin A was present during activation. This implies that the signal transduction downstream of IBC 293 occupied HCA<sub>3</sub>Rs is regulated by the actin cytoskeleton. A pre-requisite for the IBC 293-induced O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> production was, thus, that the HCA<sub>3</sub>Rs had been uncoupled from the actin cytoskeleton prior to the addition of IBC 293. This suggests that like the downstream signaling of ATP occupied P2Y<sub>2</sub>Rs, the signal transduction downstream of IBC 293 occupied HCA<sub>3</sub>Rs appears to be determined by the actin cytoskeleton. That is, upon actin cytoskeleton disruption, the otherwise blocked signaling route that results in NADPH oxidase activation becomes available. No NADPH oxidase activity was induced when latrunculin A was added to agonist occupied (desensitized) HCA<sub>3</sub>Rs. This lack of re-activation of the agonist occupied HCA<sub>3</sub>Rs by latrunculin A is a character shared with the neutrophil P2Y<sub>2</sub>Rs and the medium chain fatty acid receptor GPR84, but contrasting the effects of latrunculin A on the reactivation of desensitized FPRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. This implies that in contrast to the FPRs, the P2Y<sub>2</sub>Rs, GPR84 and HCA<sub>3</sub>Rs uses a mechanism for termination of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity that is independent of the actin cytoskeleton.</p><p id="P31">The resemblance of the IBC 293 mediated NADPH oxidase activity with that induced by ATP was also evident when neutrophils were stimulated with either of these two agonists in the presence of the FFA2R allosteric modulator Cmp58. We have previously shown that activation of the ATP receptor P2Y<sub>2</sub>R triggers the generation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> only in neutrophils in which their FFA2Rs are allosterically modulated by the presence of Cmp58. The suggested model for this receptor transactivation implies that the signals generated downstream of the activated P2Y<sub>2</sub>R activate the allosterically modulated FFA2Rs from the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. We now show that a similar receptor transactivation mechanism is used by HCA<sub>3</sub>Rs to activate the NADPH oxidase neutrophils triggered with IBC 293 in the presence of Cmp58. These data not only violate the receptor restriction characteristics generally defining the selectivity of allosteric GPCR modulators but also violate the universal accepted allosteric modulation perception “that a positive (amplifying) as well as a negative (inhibiting) allosteric receptor modulator shall solely affect the response induced by orthosteric agonists specifically recognized by the same receptor as the allosteric modulator” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. As such the definition for allosteric modulators should, when it comes to neutrophils, be re-evaluated. In addition, the basic function of a positive allosteric modulator also includes that the effect should be reciprocal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. This means that, with regards to the modulator Cmp58, the amplifying effect should be present irrespective of the sequence in which the allosteric modulator and the orthosteric agonist is added to the cells. This is indeed what characterizes the relationship between Cmp58 and propionate in terms of NADPH oxidase activity (evidenced in this study and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]). However, in contrast the amplifying effect that Cmp58 has on the IBC 293-induced NADPH oxidase is not reciprocal. This activation pattern in shared with the other neutrophil GPCRs that transactivate the allosterically modulated FFA2Rs and strengthen that the activity of both HCA<sub>3</sub>R and FFA2R are required to obtain an activation of the oxidase. The final proof for the involvement of two different receptors would be to include receptor specific antagonists; this approach has been used in earlier receptor transactivation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], but to our knowledge, no specific HCA<sub>3</sub>R antagonist that can be used is available. However, the inhibitory effect of the specific FFA2R antagonist CATPB (complete inhibition of the transactivation) and the lack of reciprocity of the IBC 293 induced response, together suggest that signals generated both by HCA<sub>3</sub>R and FFA2R are required for the NADPH oxidase activity.</p><p id="P32">Compared to IBC 293, 3-OH-C8 was a rather poor neutrophil activating agonist and the concentration required for activation was very high.

Both HCA<sub>3</sub>R agonists tested, the β-oxidation intermediate 3-OH-C8 and the synthetic agonist IBC 293, could mediate increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and activation of the NADPH oxidase.
