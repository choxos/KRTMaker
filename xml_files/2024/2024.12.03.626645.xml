PROTACs are heterobifunctional molecules that connect a POI-binding and an E3-ligase (E3) binding motif with a linker. The simultaneous binding and formation of a ternary POI::PROTAC::E3 complex (TC) induces proximity between the POI and the E3, allowing for POI-ubiquitination and subsequent induction of proteasomal degradation. Despite the availability of many three-dimensional structures of TCs, unveiling the structure-function relationships for the design of PROTACs remains a challenge. This is because the TCs can be dynamic with a complex conformational landscape that individual crystal structures may not capture. In this work, we used SMARCA2 as the POI and VHL as the E3-ligase and solved the X-ray crystal structures of the respective ternary complexes with four different PROTACs. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to show that the SMARCA2-VHL interface is flexible with multiple energy minima. The protein-protein (POI-E3) interactions are largely formed by residues located in structurally disordered loops in both VHL and SMARCA2. The residue pairs in the SMARCA2-VHL interface are ‘frustrated’, i.e., adopt a suboptimal energetic state. The number of frustrated residue pairs averaged over the MD ensemble shows a positive correlation with the experimentally determined cooperativity of the PROTACs. This indicates that protein-protein interface frustration can play an important role in PROTAC function. The TC ensembles of VHL, SMARCA2 and 11 different PROTACs were modeled by comparative modeling followed by MD. The frustration was subsequently calculated from the MD trajectories and correlated with the cooperativity. We found that identification of the dynamic protein-protein contacts and frustrated residue pairs in the interface can provide a rational framework for the structure-based design of PROTACs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><bold>Pro</bold>teolysis <bold>Ta</bold>rgeting <bold>C</bold>himeras</kwd><kwd>MD simulations</kwd><kwd>Protein Frustration</kwd><kwd>SMARCA</kwd><kwd>VHL</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Abbreviations</title><glossary><def-list><def-item><term>PROTAC</term><def><p id="P5"><bold>Pro</bold>teolysis <bold>Ta</bold>rgeting <bold>C</bold>himeras</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>POI</term><def><p id="P6">Protein of interest</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>E3</term><def><p id="P7">E3 ubiquitin ligase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MD</term><def><p id="P8">Molecular Dynamics</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RMSD</term><def><p id="P9">root mean square deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PC</term><def><p id="P10">Principal Component</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCA</term><def><p id="P11">Principal Component Analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>a</term><def><p id="P12">Cooperativity; TCternary complex (formed by POI, E3 and PROTAC)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VHL</term><def><p id="P13">von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor suppressor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BD</term><def><p id="P14">bromo domain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMARCA</term><def><p id="P15">SWI/SNF related BAF chromatin remodeling complex subunit ATPase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPI</term><def><p id="P16">protein-protein interface</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VCB</term><def><p id="P17">VHL-Elongin BC-CUL2</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P18">Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are an emerging class of therapeutics that have opened opportunities for targeting a wider range of proteins, as they enable an alternative mode of action when compared to conventional small molecule drugs, e.g. inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. PROTACs are heterobifunctional molecules consisting of two binding motifs each of which binds to the POI and an E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3) and are joined by a linker. Upon formation of a ternary complex (TC) composed of the POI, the PROTAC and the E3 ligase (POI::PROTAC::E3), the E3 catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 ubiquitin conjugating ligase to the POI. The ubiquitinylated POI is then subjected to the ubiquitin–proteasomal degradation machinery, leading to the removal of the POI from the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Unlike conventional protein inhibitors that rely on an occupancy-driven mode of action, PROTACs operate through a different mechanism where only a brief interaction is needed to trigger the target protein’s degradation, essentially acting as a “catalytic” event rather than relying on constant occupancy. Very often, the ternary complex formation by a PROTAC is mediated through proximity-induced formation of <italic>de novo</italic> interactions within the complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The tendency of a PROTAC to stabilize such a ternary complex can be quantified using the cooperativity value a, i.e., the binding affinity ratio of a PROTAC in the binary complex (PROTAC::POI, PROTAC::E3) versus the ternary complex. The cooperativity is positive (α &gt; 1) when the binding affinity to the ternary complex is greater than the affinities to the binary complexes, thus stabilizing the ternary complex. The cooperativity is negative (α &lt; 1) when the binding affinity of the PROTAC to the ternary complex is lower than to the binary complexes, hence destabilizing the ternary complex. A non-cooperative cooperativity (α = 1) means no change in the binding affinity for the ternary complex when compared to the binary complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">Although the three-dimensional structures of TCs inform us about the nature of the POI-E3 interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, structure-based design of PROTACs still remains challenging. This is in part because some ternary complexes are highly dynamic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and the crystal structure of an individual ternary complex represents only one of, in some cases, many energy minima in the energy landscape of the TC conformational ensemble. There has been a lack of computational metrics to assess cooperativity of PROTACs prior to synthesis due to the highly dynamic energy landscape of the TCs.</p><p id="P20">Computational methods play a critical role in understanding the behavior of the PROTAC-mediated TCs. Multiple methods for the modelling or prediction of ternary complex structures have been published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, many of which are based on protein-protein docking. A recent study used weighted ensemble molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model the formation of the ternary complex ensembles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, no descriptors derived from the PROTAC ternary complex ensembles have yet been discovered that correlate with the cooperativity, even when the 3D-structures of the ternary complexes are known. Often, the protein-protein interface (PPI) residues of the POI and the E3 ligase are in unstructured or disordered regions, and hence are highly dynamic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, PROTAC mediated PPIs are not driven through coevolution of interface residues which, in naturally occurring PPIs, is often the basis of the PPI stabilization. Given the lack of correlation between calculated binding affinities of PROTACS and cooperativity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, we looked for structural descriptors that characterize the PPIs in unstructured regions and their role in regulating the protein activity. Previous studies have shown that distinct residue positions which play a critical functional role are often in a suboptimal energetic state before being involved in intramolecular or intermolecular protein interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The presence of such locally perturbed thermodynamic states in proteins is referred to as ‘frustration’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">Frustration was developed as a concept to quantify the conformational variations and heterogeneity often seen in dynamic PPIs formed through disordered regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Since the TCs are highly dynamic, we hypothesized that the frustration of the interactions at the POI-E3 ligase interface could be a relevant factor in determining the cooperativity of the ternary complex.</p><p id="P22">We investigated a series of PROTACs that mediate the degradation of SMARCA2 as the POI through recruitment of the E3-ligase VHL, to assess whether frustration could predict ternary complex stability. The helicases SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 are close paralogs and crucial components of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex. Based on a synthetic lethality concept, SMARCA2 has been proposed as a drug target for certain tumors exhibiting SMARCA4-deficiency (e.g. non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase in which small molecule binders with suitable exit vectors for PROTAC design have been described before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Farnaby, Koegl et al. utilized a SMARCA bromodomain (BD) binder reported by Genentech (GEN-1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> to synthesize the first VHL-based SMARCA2/4-degrading PROTACs and solved three ternary complex crystal structures to guide PROTAC design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Later, Kofink, Trainor, Mair et al. discovered alternative SMARCA<sup>BD</sup> binders with improved physicochemical properties. Guided by a further three TC crystal structures, SMARCA2-selective PROTACs with oral bioavailability could be designed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">In this study, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of SMARCA2-VHL complexes with four different PROTACs to a resolution ranging from 2.2 Å to 3.74 Å. Starting from the crystal structures of five TCs with SMARCA2 as the POI and VHL as the E3 ligase, we performed allatom MD simulations to study the TC dynamics. We calculated the frustration of all residue pairs in the POI:E3 interface and demonstrated that frustration correlates with the cooperativity. We further modelled the TCs of 11 GEN-1 based PROTACs using comparative modeling and calculated the frustration in the modelled SMARCA2-VHL PPIs. We found that the average number of frustrated residue pairs in the SMARCA2-VHL interface is higher for PROTACs with high cooperativity than those with low cooperativity. Thus, we speculate that the frustration can be used as a measure for cooperativity for prioritization of PROTACS prior to synthesis, for cases where the POI-E3 pairing supports cooperativity as a relevant optimization parameter.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S4"><title>Synthesis of PROTACs for SMARCA2-VHL complexes and measurement of cooperativity</title><p id="P24">We investigated 16 PROTACs (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) in this work and measured their cooperativity (a).

The loss of the proximity signal, after addition of a concentration series of each PROTAC in the presence or absence of saturating concentrations of VCB (a pre-formed complex of VHL, Elongin-C, and Elongin-B), yielded the ternary and binary IC<sub>50</sub>, respectively. The cooperativity (a) was defined as the ratio: IC<sub>50</sub>(binary) / IC<sub>50</sub>(ternary), so that the affinity gains of a PROTAC to SMARCA2 after addition of VCB, i.e., a lower ternary IC<sub>50</sub>, lead to higher a values.

Structural alignment of the five TC crystal structures onto the VHL domain shows the high flexibility of the ternary complexes: SMARCA2 and VHL adopt very different conformations relative to each other with different PROTACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). These differences can stem both from the differences in the SMARCA2 binding motif and/or the linker lengths of the PROTACs. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) in the coordinates of the backbone atoms of the SMARCA2 domain ranges from 2.8 Å to 15.6 Å when aligned by the VHL domain of the P1 ternary complex crystal structure.

To analyze and visualize the dominant motions, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on the combined trajectories of all five complexes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref> for details). The top three weighted principal components capture nearly 80% of the variance (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref> of the Supporting Information). Principal component 1 (PC1) represents a rotation of the SMARCA2 domain with respect to the VHL domain, while PC2 represents a swinging motion of the SMARCA2 with respect to VHL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, movies 1 and 2 in the Supporting Information).

The PROTACs with high and medium cooperativity: P1, P2 and P3 show fewer conformational clusters when compared to the PROTACs with low and negative cooperativity: P4 and P5, where the ensemble population is distributed over a larger number of clusters.

As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, PROTAC P1 with high cooperativity showed closely related PROTAC conformations, in contrast to PROTAC P5 with low cooperativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), which showed multiple disparate conformations. The higher flexibility of the PROTACs with low cooperativity could be due to the linker structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>), which in turn could lead to increased flexibility in the PPI. To characterize the PROTAC flexibility further, we identified the VHL and SMARCA2 residues that are in contact with the PROTACs in the crystal structures. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, the number of PROTAC-protein contacts gleaned from the crystal structures are similar for all five PROTACs and do not distinguish between low and high cooperativity PROTACs. On the other hand, the contact frequency heatmap between the PROTAC and VHL or SMARCA2, as derived from MD simulation trajectories (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4C and 4D</xref>), shows that the high and medium cooperativity PROTACs (P1 to P3) have a higher number of persistent PROTAC:protein contacts (P1:21, P2:23, P3:24) when compared to the low cooperativity PROTACs (P4:15, P5:19). In addition, the PROTAC contacts with SMARCA2 are varied for the different PROTACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). These frequency heatmaps reflect the dynamic PPI mediated by the PROTACs. The interaction fingerprints derived from MD simulations are therefore more indicative of PROTAC cooperativity when compared to fingerprints derived from crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Residue contacts in the SMARCA2-VHL interface in PROTAC ternary complexes are dynamic and located in unstructured regions</title><p id="P31">Previous structural and biophysical studies have shown that the contact surface area between the POI and E3 ligase is critical to the cooperativity and can impact degradation properties of PROTACs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We analyzed the pairwise residue interactions in the VHL-SMARCA2 interface, both in the crystal structures and in the MD trajectories of the five PROTACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Comparison of the contact heatmaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, shows that most of the protein-protein interface contacts are mediated by the PROTAC, but also a few direct protein-protein contacts exist. The number of such direct contacts in the crystal structures does not allow discrimination between the high cooperativity PROTAC P1 from the low cooperativity PROTAC P4, although the negatively cooperative PROTAC P5 shows a negligible number of SMARCA2-VHL contacts. Interestingly, during the MD simulations, additional contacts were formed and many of the contacts observed in the crystal structures were weakened. The frequency heatmap calculated from the MD simulation trajectories shows that the high and medium cooperativity PROTACs exhibit more direct PPI contacts than the low cooperativity PROTACs P4 and P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This loss of initial residue contacts in the SMARCA2-VHL interface can be attributed to the high flexibility of the ternary complexes. In contrast, the PROTAC-mediated SMARCA2-VHL contacts are maintained in the MD simulations demonstrating the critical role of the PROTAC in stabilizing the ternary complex. Other MD simulation studies on PROTAC ternary complexes have also shown this behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We also observed that the SMARCA2-VHL interface contacts are assembled from unstructured loop regions in both VHL and SMARCA2 (POI), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5C and 5D</xref>. In summary, the number of PPI residue contacts in the crystal structures does not correlate with the cooperativity. Next, we investigated PPI properties with a focus on disordered regions, these are often in suboptimal, or ‘frustrated’, energy states. The SMARCA2-VHL interface is dynamic and is formed by residue contacts built from the unstructured loop regions as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5A, 5C and 5D</xref>. We calculated the frustration of these interface residues to examine whether or not frustration can distinguish between high and low cooperativity PROTACs.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>High cooperativity PROTACs show a greater number of frustrated residue contacts in the protein-protein interface of the ternary complex</title><p id="P32">As described in the previous section, part of the SMARCA2-VHL interface interactions involves disordered loops in SMARCA2, ranging from residues N1396 to F1431 and from L1465 to S1468. Residues in unstructured loops contribute to the SMARCA2-VHL interface contacts during MD simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). As discussed by Marton et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, disordered regions sample a wider range of conformations and thus play an important role in protein function. Chen et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> have shown that functionally critical structural regions in a protein often have patches of ‘frustrated’ residues that adopt suboptimal energetic states. Based on this concept, Gonzalo-Parra et al. developed the ‘Frustratometer’ toolkit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> to calculate the frustration of residue contacts within proteins or between interacting protein domains. The Frustratometer toolkit is based on the coarse-grained forcefield AWESEM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Briefly, in the Frustratometer procedure, each amino acid pair is mutated <italic>in silico</italic> to all other amino acids and the energy distribution for all the mutated pairs (decoy pairs) is calculated with respect to the energy of the wild type pair. The wildtype residue pair energy is then converted into a z-score (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the decoy energy distribution, respectively). The z-score is a measure of the wildtype contact energy relative to all other amino acid substitutions at these residue positions, and hence an estimation as to whether a residue is in an energetic optimal or suboptimal state. Each residue pair was classified as highly frustrated, neutral, or minimally frustrated based on the criteria employed in Frustratometer V2 (a z-score of mutational frustration &gt; 0.78 is minimally frustrated, &lt; -1 is highly frustrated and between 0.78 and -1 is neutral). More details on the calculation of frustration are given in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref> section.</p><p id="P33">For each PROTAC ternary complex shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, we used the Frustratometer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> on the MD trajectories and calculated the number of frustrated residue pairs in the SMARCA2-VHL interface for each MD snapshot. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, the ratio of the average number of frustrated residue pairs to the total number of contacts (between SMARCA2-VHL and between VHL or SMARCA2-PROTAC) in the interface, for each PROTAC TC correlates with measured cooperativity. Since frustrated residue pairs are often located at active sites and protein interfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, we speculate that the frustrated interface residues could, could show a high energy transient state that is indicative of catalytically active conformations and hence PROTAC cooperativity.</p><p id="P34">Most frustrated residues are in the loop regions of either VHL or SMARCA2 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6B</xref> for high (P1) and low (P5) cooperativity PROTACs. This is also shown in the frustration heat map for the SMARCA2-VHL interface residue pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Movies S3 and S4 showing the three-dimensional view of this region are given in the Supporting Information. Using double mutant cycles, Jemth et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> have shown that the interactions in a protein complex involving unstructured domains, especially in promiscuous protein complexes, are likely to be energetically suboptimal and exhibit some strain due to unfavorable interactions. This is what we observe here in the PROTAC ternary complexes. In most MD simulation runs, the number of frustrated residues in the SMARCA2 protein, is higher than in VHL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Interestingly, Proline is present in 23% of highly frustrated pairs in all five simulations. Both glutamine and glutamic acid are present in 21% of highly frustrated pairs, and asparagine in 11% of the frustrated residue pairs in the interface. These frequently occurring residues imply that the chemical nature of amino acid may also play a role in regulating the frustration level of PPIs, and it has been shown in literature that certain residues may be more critical in forming a catalytically effective interface <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. In summary, we show that, for the SMARCA2/VHL system under study, the frustrated residue pairs in the PPI of PROTAC ternary complexes can successfully distinguish high from low cooperativity PROTACs, and we will use the same high/low terminology in future discussion. It is the focus of future research to establish as to whether this can be utilized for all POI-E3 pairings in which cooperativity is a relevant optimization parameter.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Frustration involving the POI-E3 interface residues can be used to assess the cooperativity of PROTACs prior to synthesis</title><p id="P35">One goal of this work was to assess the utility of the frustration in the PPI for predicting the cooperativity of PROTACs, and ideally to assist synthesis prioritization. As a further validation of the frustration measure, we studied 11 GEN-1 based PROTACs (shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) that have no crystal structures except P13 (pdb ID: 6HAY). Using the methods detailed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref> section, we generated ternary complex structural models using a now publicly available PROTAC (P2) ternary complex template structure (pdb ID: 6HAX)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. We speculated that TC conformations, present in high-cooperativity PROTACs such as the one in 6HAX structure,would lead to more pronounced differences in the number of frustrated residue pairs. The 11 PROTACs feature the same VHL binder as the PROTACs P1, P2, P4 and P5, except for P19 and P20, which contain a non-binding distomer of VH101. The SMARCA2 binder in these PROTACs, GEN-1, binds into the same pocket and provides a similar exit vector.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> Starting from the structural models of the 11 PROTAC TCs, we performed MD simulations using the same protocol as applied to the crystal structures (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>). Using the MD simulation trajectories for each TC model, we calculated the average number of frustrated residue pairs located at the interface between SMARCA2 and VHL. To strengthen the error estimation, we increased the MD simulation sample size by generating 10 different conformation ensembles using bootstrapping methods (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref> for more details). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, the average number of frustrated residue pairs shows the same trend as the cooperativity, with the higher cooperativity PROTACs being more likely to show higher frustration than weak cooperativity PROTACs. Although there are outliers, the trend from the docked models concurs with the frustration pattern observed among the high, medium and low cooperativity PROTACs in the MD simulations starting from the crystal structures. This indicates that frustration can be used to predict cooperativity and hence to prioritize PROTACs for synthesis and experimental testing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P36">Despite some notable successes, the design of PROTACs can be challenging, since conventional structure-based drug design principles using single crystal structures do not represent the highly dynamic nature of some ternary complexes formed with PROTACs. PROTAC properties are governed by the conformational ensemble and the interacting interfaces in the ternary complexes. Comparison of the five SMARCA2::PROTAC::VHL crystal structures of these TCs reveals large domain motions. We derived the free energy surfaces of these from MD simulations, and identified multiple free energy minima, representing distinct TC conformations. We also observed that the TCs formed with low-cooperativity PROTACs are more flexible than those with high-cooperativity PROTACs. The spread of the relative orientations in the SMARCA2 domain is wider in the MD simulations than observed when comparing crystal structures only. The orientation of the E3 ligase domains relative to the POI have been shown to play a critical role in substrate selectivity by PROTACs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Such dynamic behavior of TCs with other POIs or E3 ligases, such as cereblon, have been shown by other MD simulation studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. We observed that the number of residue contacts formed during MD simulations in the protein-protein interacting interface is larger in high-cooperativity PROTACs when compared to low-cooperativity PROTACs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>). Such differences have also been seen in cereblon-based PROTACs paired with other POIs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P37">Four new crystal structures along with the MD simulations also showed that, for different PROTACs, the SMARCA2-VHL interface is formed by residues that are mostly located in the unstructured regions of the two proteins. Frustration is a measure of the degree of suboptimal energy states of protein residues, which are often found in the unstructured regions of a protein. Frustration in protein-protein interfaces arises when residues at the interface cannot adopt optimal conformations or achieve dense packing due to conflicting interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. While it is generally understood that frustration decreases the stability of a protein, the relationship between frustration and the functional activity of a protein remains vague. It is known that in some enzymes, frustration in the active site can promote catalysis by destabilizing the reactants, products and also facilitate the transition state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Here we observe that the number of highly frustrated residue pairs in the SMARCA2-VHL interface of the ternary complex is higher for high-cooperativity than for low-cooperativity PROTACs. The frustrated residue pairs have a higher occurrence of prolines, glutamine and glutamic acid residues compared to other amino acid residues. This is consistent with the finding that these residues are also more frequently found in intrinsically disordered regions of proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesize that frustration in the POI-E3 interface can be utilized for characterizing the nature of the TCs and for describing cooperativity. We have provided initial evidence that the number of frustrated residue pairs can be used as a measure to distinguish high from low cooperativity PROTACs, based on the TC models that were generated by comparative modelling in combination with MD simulations. In the future, we aim to use the specific frustrated residue pairs in the PPI of TCs for rational design of PROTACs..</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>MD simulation protocol</title><p id="P38">The VHL::P2::SMARCA2BD ternary complex crystal structure has previously been published and is available in the protein databank (PDB ID: 7Z77)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.

For the P4 (BI01701345) ternary complex: SMARCA2BD, VCB complex and P4 were mixed in a 1:1:1 molar ratio, concentrated to 10 mg/mL in a buffer containing 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM TCEP, 2% DMSO, incubated at room temperature. Drops were prepared by mixing 1 μL of the ternary complex with 1 μL of well solution and crystallized at 18 °C using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals were obtained in 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0, 8% ethylene glycol, 14% PEG 8K. Harvested crystals were flash cooled in liquid nitrogen following gradual equilibration into cryoprotectant solution consisting of 20% PEG 8K, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0, 20% ethylene glycol. Diffraction data were collected at Diamond Light Source beamline I24 (λ = 0.9686 A□) using a Pilatus3 6 M detector and processed using XDS. The crystals belonged to space group P21 with unit cell parameters a = 48.7, b = 89.8, c = 64.2 A□ and α = 90.0°, β = 96.9 °, γ = 90.0° and contained one copy of the ternary complex per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using PHASER with VCB coordinates derived from the VCB: MZ1: Brd4<sup>BD2</sup> complex (PDB: 5T35)and SMARCA2BD (PDB: 4QY4) as search models. Subsequent iterative model building, and refinement, was done according to standard protocols using CCP4, COOT, and autoBUSTER (Global Phasing Ltd).</p><p id="P48">For the VCB:P5(BI01702722):SMARCA2BD ternary complex: VCB, P5 and SMARCA2BD were mixed in a 1:1:1 stoichiometric ratio in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM TCEP, 2% DMSO, incubated at room temperature and concentrated to a final concentration of approximately 16 mg/ml.
