Clinically, NTS infection presents with inflammatory diarrhea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), characterized by localized gastrointestinal inflammation and neutrophil influx in the intestinal mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). In healthy individuals, NTS infection remains localized to the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). However, approximately 5% of patients infected with NTS develop bacteremia, a serious and potentially fatal complication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Children and the elderly are at risk for developing bacteremia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), and additional risk factors include leukemia, chemotherapy, and HIV infection prior to the advent of antiretroviral therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). In recent years, invasive non-typhoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> (iNTS) strains have emerged as a prominent cause of bloodstream infection in sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), with serovars Typhimurium (STm) and Enteritidis implicated in 91% of iNTS cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Important risk factors for iNTS disease in Africa are HIV infection, malaria, and malnutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Furthermore, complicated iNTS infections present a challenge for antibiotic treatment due to increased multidrug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). It is thus imperative to elucidate mechanisms by which STm can evade host immune defenses to cause bacteremia.</p><p id="P3">Neutrophils are thought to play a crucial role in preventing NTS bacteremia through limiting dissemination of the pathogen from the mucosa to systemic sites. Neutropenia in patients with HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) or cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), as well as defective production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), heightens the risk of NTS bacteremia. Experiments in mice, largely conducted with STm, corroborate these clinical observations, as neutrophil depletion leads to increased pathogen dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Even with a fully functional immune system, macrophages are less effective at killing STm due to the pathogen’s numerous strategies for survival and replication within these cells. Within the macrophage phagosome, STm uses the two-component regulatory system PhoPQ to sense acidification, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-limiting conditions, and cationic antimicrobial peptides, which together induce the expression of <italic>Salmonella</italic> Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) effector genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). The SPI2-encoded type-3 secretion system delivers a plethora of effector proteins that prevent the fusion of the phagosome with lysosomes, allowing STm to persist in <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuoles (SCVs) within macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Protected inside the macrophage compartment, STm can spread to the liver, spleen, and blood while evading extracellular host defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). In the extracellular environment, <italic>Salmonella</italic> is more vulnerable to complement opsonization, which contributes to host protection during bacteremia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) by mechanisms that are not completely elucidated. Long O-antigen chains of lipopolysaccharide on <italic>Salmonella</italic> play a crucial role in steric inhibition of complement, reducing effective membrane attack complex (MAC) formation. Consequently, STm lacking O-antigen (rough mutants) are susceptible to serum complement killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) and are avirulent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Resistance to complement is also mediated by the outer membrane proteins TraT and Rck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). A third outer membrane protein, PgtE, is a promiscuous protease described to cleave a dozen different substrates <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), including complement-associated proteins. Increased expression of <italic>pgtE</italic> has also been proposed to promote survival and dissemination of iNTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Nevertheless, it is unknown whether the cleavage of complement proteins promotes STm virulence <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P5">All previous studies investigating PgtE function <italic>in vitro</italic> used rough mutants, because the long O-antigen in wild-type strains sterically inhibits PgtE function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). We thus sought to unravel the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of PgtE in wild-type, virulent strains with an intact O-antigen (smooth strains). Here we show that an STm <italic>pgtE</italic> mutant is attenuated in wild-type mice, but is rescued in complement-deficient mice. Mechanistically, we found that wild-type STm cleaves complement C3 in a PgtE-dependent manner when inside macrophages or cultured in media mimicking the SCV, environments where STm expresses a shorter O-antigen. Unexpectedly, however, PgtE-mediated disruption of complement did not promote STm survival in macrophages, but rather enhanced serum resistance and evasion of neutrophil killing, thereby contributing to bacteremia.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p id="P6">Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.

By contrast, although the shorter O-antigen detected in smooth STm strains cultured in InSPI2 LowMg<sup>2+</sup> media likely enabled PgtE’s ability to function at all, the intermediary PgtE activity observed is likely the consequence of lingering steric hindrance conferred by the still present, albeit shorter, O-antigen. Nevertheless, these results are consistent with the idea that the shorter O-antigen induced by growth in InSPI2 LowMg<sup>2+</sup> media enables complement C3 cleavage by PgtE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, E</xref>).</p><p id="P43">The absence of PgtE activity when wild-type STm is cultured in LB could be due to a lack of PgtE expression or it could be solely explained by the steric hindrance caused by the long O-antigen.

We recovered a similar number of each STm strain at each of the time points analyzed, from 30 minutes post-infection (when <italic>pgtE</italic> is not highly expressed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>) to 8 hours (high <italic>pgtE</italic> induction) and even 24 hours post-infection, in both the non-opsonized and the opsonized groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G-I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 J-L</xref>). As such, PgtE did not enhance STm survival in BMDMs in these conditions, even though it is highly produced and cleaves C3 in these cells.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>PgtE increases STm serum resistance</title><p id="P45">To determine whether PgtE promotes STm resistance to serum killing, we cultured STm WT, the Δ<italic>pgtE</italic> mutant, and the complemented Δ<italic>pgtE</italic> mutant in either LB or InSPI2 LowMg<sup>2+</sup> media and exposed them to 20% normal human serum (NHS). When STm was cultured overnight in LB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), all strains showed similar survival.

To test whether the differences in serum resistance were dependent on PgtE-mediated C3 cleavage, the strains were incubated with C3-depleted human serum after overnight culture in InSPI2 LowMg<sup>2+</sup> media. In the absence of C3, serum survival of the PgtE mutant was fully restored, and no difference in survival was detected between the three strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Thus, PgtE enhanced STm serum survival by inhibiting the function of complement.</p><p id="P46">Many iNTS isolates display increased expression of <italic>pgtE</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).

Similar to what we observed with the ATCC 14028s strain IR715 (sequence type ST19), no significant difference in serum survival was seen between the ST313 strain D23580 wild-type and an isogenic Δ<italic>pgtE</italic> mutant when the strains were cultured overnight in LB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). However, when cultured overnight in InSPI2 LowMg<sup>2+</sup> media, D23580 WT survived significantly better than the isogenic Δ<italic>pgtE</italic> mutant in normal human serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) but not in C3-depleted human serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).

Here, we show that PgtE is a virulence factor that helps STm to overcome complement-mediated host defenses, survive in serum, and evade ROS-dependent neutrophil killing.</p><p id="P51">PgtE is an outer membrane protease that has been hypothesized to promote STm virulence through multiple mechanisms. For instance, PgtE expressed in rough strains of bacteria has previously been shown to promote adhesion to matrigel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), suggesting a role for PgtE in enhancing invasion. PgtE also inactivates α2-antiplasmin while activating plasmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) and mammalian matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Macrophages use plasmin and MMP-9 to migrate through tissues, and therefore PgtE was hypothesized to promote the dissemination of STm within infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Furthermore, STm can cleave cationic antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), and multiple components of immune complement in a PgtE-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Using immortalized human macrophage-like cells, a recent study showed increased localization of human bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein to SCVs containing PgtE-deficient STm, suggesting that PgtE promotes STm persistence in SCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>).</p><p id="P52">Collectively, studies with data generated mostly <italic>in vitro</italic> have proposed that PgtE enables STm to evade antimicrobial peptides and immune complement while promoting an intracellular lifestyle within macrophages. However, to our knowledge, no prior studies have linked these observations to <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes and specific components of host immunity, which requires the use of knock-out mice. Our results show that a STm Δ<italic>pgtE</italic> mutant is attenuated in the blood of wild-type mice, but fully rescued in <italic>C3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), in mice treated with CVF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), and in <italic>Cybb</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), thus demonstrating that PgtE promotes STm evasion of complement component C3 and ROS <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P53">Identifying where and how PgtE plays a role <italic>in vivo</italic> was not trivial, as virulent STm has multiple virulence factors that modulate resistance to immune complement. For instance, long O-antigen chains confer serum resistance, but also sterically inhibit PgtE function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Therefore, prior studies used rough STm and rough <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants when studying PgtE <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Additional mechanisms of STm serum resistance include Rck and TraT, outer membrane proteins that confer serum resistance <italic>in vitro</italic> to either smooth or rough <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>) by disrupting the complement membrane attack complex (MAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). The many proposed functions of PgtE, by contrast, were observed in rough, avirulent strains.</p><p id="P54">Our study indicates that PgtE in fact does function <italic>in vitro and in vivo</italic> with fully virulent, smooth strains, albeit only after the physiologic O-antigen shortening that follows growth inside the SCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). A long O-antigen is a primary defense against an array of environmental insults, including immune complement activity. In environments where STm has a shortened O-antigen, such as in the SCV or having recently exited a phagocytic cell, PgtE likely represents a secondary line of defense to assist in protecting the more susceptible outer membrane.</p><p id="P55">Expression of <italic>pgtE</italic> and PgtE’s proteolytic function are enhanced in macrophages as well as in media that mimic the SCV lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, PgtE did not enhance STm survival in primary murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), but did protect STm from C3-dependent serum killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). We obtained comparable results with the iNTS strain D23580 (clade ST313). When cultured in InSPI2 LowMg<sup>2+</sup> media (mimicking the SCV lumen), strain D23580 exhibited reduced O-antigen length, cleaved C3 in a PgtE-dependent manner, and survived better in human serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). These results are in agreement with a prior study that hypothesized that the increased expression of <italic>pgtE</italic>, due to a SNP in its promoter region, could enhance iNTS survival and dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).</p><p id="P56">A different study showed that, in response to serum exposure, multiple ST313 strains (including D23580), when cultured in LB, increased the expression of long O-antigen regulators but not of <italic>pgtE</italic>, <italic>rck</italic>, and <italic>traT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). This suggests that when long O-antigen is present, STm continues to rely on the long O-antigen to resist complement killing. However, when the O-antigen is shortened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), we demonstrate that PgtE defends against complement killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and reduces neutrophil ROS production and killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), thereby promoting bacteremia.
