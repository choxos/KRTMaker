Here, by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence at 77K after specific light treatments, we show that Bryopsidales algae also lack state transitions, another ubiquitous photoprotection mechanism present in other green algae. Certain Sacoglossa sea slugs can feed on Ulvophyceae algae, including some Bryopsidales, and steal chloroplasts –kleptoplasts– that remain functional inside the animal cells for months without the support of the algal nucleus. Our data reveal that the state transition capacity is not retained in the kleptoplasts of the sea slugs, and we provide evidence that the loss is caused by structural changes during their incorporation by the animals. This enforced chloroplast sphericity was observed in all studied kleptoplastic associations, and we propose that it is a fundamental property supporting long-term retention of kleptoplasts in photosynthetic sea slugs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Kleptoplastic sea slugs are not content with simply eating their prey macroalgae.

The peculiar kleptoplastic association between sea slugs and their algal prey has intrigued scientists for over a century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">de Negri and de Negri 1876</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cruz and Cartaxana 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Christa 2023</xref>). Despite the interest, one of the main questions related to kleptoplasty remains open to this day: how are the kleptoplasts retained functional for months inside an animal cell when being isolated from the gene products of the algal nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bhattacharya et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Maeda et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Eastman et al. 2023</xref>)?</p><p id="P3">In the light, the photosynthetic apparatus inside chloroplasts is constantly being damaged. This is largely due to the involvement of strong photosynthetic redox chemistry that can lead to excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly under bright light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Foyer 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Khorobrykh et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Mattila et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Tiwari et al. 2024</xref>). The repair and maintenance of the photosynthetic protein complexes, like the vulnerable Photosystem II (PSII), is thought to require tight coordination with the algal nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Järvi et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Theis and Schroda 2016</xref>). Furthermore, most of the thousands of proteins inside a chloroplast are in fact nucleus encoded to begin with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">de Vries and Archibald 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Ponce-Toledo et al. 2019</xref>). Most kleptoplastic sea slug species eat and steal chloroplasts from siphonaceous green macroalgae belonging to the clade Ulvophyceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Jensen 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">de Vries et al. 2013</xref>), divided here to Bryopsidales and Ulvophyceae <italic>sensu stricto</italic> (or true ulvophytes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) following the classification by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hou et al. (2022)</xref>. So far, sequencing the chloroplast genomes of these green macroalgae has not provided evidence to mark them as being particularly extraordinary when it comes to their gene content, although retained genes encoding a chloroplast maintenance protease (<italic>ftsH</italic>) and a translation elongation factor (<italic>tufA</italic>) might imbue them with more autonomy than their contemporary plant or green algal chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Rumpho et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">de Vries et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Havurinne et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Maeda et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Other venues of investigation have focused on the common photoprotection mechanisms known to exist in green algae to explain why only chloroplasts from specific algal species are selected by the slugs for kleptoplasty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cruz et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Christa et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cartaxana et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Morelli et al. 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Morelli et al. 2024b</xref>). Chloroplasts from some Bryopsidales algae, like <italic>Codium</italic> sp. or <italic>Bryopsis</italic> sp., can remain functional inside the sea slugs for over a month, making their association with the sea slugs a functionally kleptoplastic one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Vieira et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cartaxana et al. 2023</xref>). The selection of these algae for long-term kleptoplasty cannot be simply explained by an enhancement in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of excitation energy, a traditional photoprotective mechanism of green algae, quite the opposite. The majority of Bryopsidales algae have been shown to lack qE, the energy-dependent quenching process induced by the protonation of the thylakoid lumen, and the xanthophyll cycle that modulates NPQ, while these mechanisms have been shown to function in most other green algae, including the true ulvophyte macroalgae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Franklin et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Christa et al. 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Furthermore, even if the xanthophyll cycle and qE are present in the prey algae, they do not necessarily remain fully operational in the kleptoplasts. For example, in the generalist feeder sea slugs <italic>Elysia viridis</italic> and <italic>Elysia crispata</italic> feeding on <italic>Chaetomorpha</italic> sp. and <italic>Acetabularia acetabulum,</italic> respectively, the xanthophyll cycle switches on in high light, but it does not relax during subsequent darkness, like in the algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Morelli et al. 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Morelli et al. 2024b</xref>). In the specialist feeder species <italic>Elysia timida</italic>, on the other hand, these photoprotective mechanisms of <italic>A. acetabulum</italic> remain fully operational inside the sea slug host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Morelli et al. 2024b</xref>). The possible advantage of having kleptoplasts capable of qE and xanthophyll cycle over kleptoplasts originating from Bryopsidales in terms of their longevity has been difficult to assess, and comparisons between kleptoplasts deriving from different algae made in different sea slug species have led to differing views on their importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Christa et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cartaxana et al. 2019</xref>). However, a recent study comparing the longevity of kleptoplasts originating from different algae in one sea slug species, <italic>E. crispata,</italic> showed that having <italic>A. acetabulum</italic> kleptoplasts with innate qE and xanthohyll cycle is associated with an almost doubled kleptoplast lifetime, as compared to kleptoplasts derived from the Bryopsidales alga <italic>Bryopsis plumosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cartaxana et al. 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The innate photoprotective mechanisms of different algae are likely not the only reason for long-lasting kleptoplasts. Nevertheless, the study of these mechanisms is important, as it may also give clues on the types of changes the sea slugs impose on the kleptoplasts to maintain them functional outside the algal cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Havurinne and Tyystjärvi, 2020</xref>). One photoprotection or light acclimation mechanism that has not been studied in ulvophyte algae or kleptoplastic sea slugs is state transitions, a common mechanism found in almost all green algae and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Müller et al. 2001</xref>). In the model green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> state transitions appear to have a protective role against strong light, while in plants they balance light-energy between PSII and photosystem I (PSI) in low to moderate light conditions during spectral changes of incident light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Allorent et al. 2013</xref>). The induction and relaxation of state transitions takes minutes to tens of minutes, and they are linked to the redox state of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool, a reserve of thylakoidal electron carriers. Light conditions that preferentially excite PSII over PSI lead to a reduced PQ pool, increasing plastoquinol (reduced form of PQ) binding to the Q<sub>o</sub> site of the cytochrome <italic>b6f</italic> complex. This activates the Stt7 (plant ortholog STN7) kinase that phosphorylates the mobile light harvesting complex of PSII (LHCII), leading to its dissociation from PSII. The dissociated LHCII then moves to serve PSI in light harvesting (state 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Zito et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Depège et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bellafiore et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Longoni et al. 2015</xref>). Conversely, preferential excitation of PSI oxidizes the PQ pool and allows the PPH1/TAP38 phosphatase to dephosphorylate LHCII, causing its migration back to serve PSII (state 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Pribil et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cariti et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Mattila et al. 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Here we show that all the tested macroalgae in the class Ulvophyceae possess state transitions, except for the Bryopsidales. In accordance, our results also indicate that functionally kleptoplastic sea slugs <italic>E. viridis</italic> and <italic>E. crispata</italic> feeding on Bryopsidales algae are also incapable of state transitions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> for all algae and sea slugs used in the study). What was surprising, however, was the finding that the strong state transition capacity of the chloroplasts of the alga <italic>A. acetabulum</italic> does not survive incorporation by <italic>E. crispata</italic> or <italic>E. timida</italic>. We show that the intake of the chloroplasts by the sea slugs causes immediate reversal of state 2 to state 1 and imposes a highly spherical structure in the acquired kleptoplasts. Similar loss of state transitions was also noted in <italic>A. acetabulum</italic> itself when exposed to salinity treatments that altered the structure of the chloroplasts, which provides a plausible mechanistic framework for the loss of state transitions in the sea slugs. Lastly, we demonstrate that the enforced sphericity of the kleptoplasts is a conserved trait shared by all tested long-term and short-term kleptoplastic sacoglossan sea slugs, but only long-term kleptoplastic species maintain the spherical shape and gain the photosynthetic benefits.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Bryopsidales algae and kleptoplastic sea slugs are deficient in state transitions</title><p id="P8">State transitions were evaluated with low temperature chlorophyll fluorescence measurements in several ulvophyte algae and kleptoplastic sea slugs.

After the light treatments, the samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder and diluted with quartz powder to prevent self-absorption. Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured at 77K temperature using 450 nm blue light for excitation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> for the spectrum) to evaluate if the light treatments caused changes in the maximum fluorescence emission of PSI (~710-730 nm), normalized to maximum PSII fluorescence emission (680-690 nm).</p><p id="P9">The shapes of the fluorescence emission spectra at 77K differed considerably among the tested algae, but most of the algae had clear emission maxima that fell in line with the above-mentioned known fluorescence emission ranges of PSII and PSI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The only alga with spectral shapes deviating considerably from this norm was the Bryopsidales alga <italic>B. plumosa</italic>, which was seemingly missing any clear PSI fluorescence peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The true ulvophyte alga <italic>Ulva</italic> sp. was also noteworthy, as it had up to 6 times more PSI fluorescence than PSII fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>).

In the sea slugs <italic>E. crispata</italic> and <italic>E. timida</italic> fed with <italic>A. acetabulum</italic> there were no signs of state transitions; regardless of the illumination, the fluorescence spectra in the sea slugs had the same characteristics as the spectra in the algae in state 1 (after the far-red light treatment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2k-l</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Responses of true ulvophytes to PSII or PSI excitation are more variable than in Bryopsidales and sea slugs</title><p id="P11">To gain insights on the relationship between PQ pool redox state and state transitions in our samples, all ulvophyte algae and sea slugs were subjected to a light treatment sequence where the moderate intensity (PPFD 50 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) light switched from red PSII specific light to PSI specific far-red light and back, all in 15 min intervals. The chlorophyll fluorescence parameter qL is an indicator of the fraction of PSII reaction centers in the open state, where the first stable electron acceptor in PSII, the plastoquinone Q<sub>A</sub>, is oxidized, with correlation to the PQ pool redox state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kramer et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Steccanella et al. 2015</xref>). Both qL and NPQ were analyzed from the samples by saturating light pulse analyses with a pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometer during the light treatment sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The first red PSII light caused qL to drop below 0.5 in all Bryopsidales, suggesting a reduction of Q<sub>A</sub> (qL values 1 and 0 indicate a highly oxidized and reduced Q<sub>A</sub>, respectively), and there was only a slight increase in qL back to approximately 0.5 in <italic>B. plumosa</italic> and <italic>C. tomentosum</italic> during the rest of the first red light phase. Far-red illumination increased qL in all Bryopsidales, although slowly in <italic>C. tomentosum</italic> and <italic>Caulerpa</italic> sp., and not back to fully oxidized Q<sub>A</sub>, whereas the final PSII specific light treatment once again seemed to reduce Q<sub>A</sub> in a very similar way as during the first one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Apart from the last red light treatment, the qL kinetics in the sea slug <italic>E. viridis</italic> containing <italic>C. tomentosum</italic> kleptoplasts were similar to the alga itself; after the first fast reduction of Q<sub>A</sub> at the onset of red light, qL showed a slow, continuous oxidation of Q<sub>A</sub> in both red and far-red light. However, qL was consistently at a higher level than in <italic>C. tomentosum</italic>, possibly suggesting a more oxidized Q<sub>A</sub> in the kleptoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In <italic>E. crispata</italic> hosting <italic>B. plumosa</italic> kleptoplasts the qL parameter was relatively stable during the red light treatments and stayed at roughly similar levels as in <italic>B. plumosa</italic>, but Q<sub>A</sub> oxidation was slower in the sea slug in far-red light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).

The qL of <italic>A. acetabulum</italic> was also by far the slowest to increase in far-red light compared to any other alga or sea slug. Contrary to <italic>A. acetabulum, Ulva</italic> sp. showed only very transient reduction of Q<sub>A</sub>, if any, during the red-light treatments.

In these cases, the selected <italic>E. crispata</italic> individuals were allowed to feed exclusively on <italic>A. acetabulum</italic> for a minimum of 10 days prior to the experiments, as this has been shown to be a sufficient period for an almost total switch in the chloroplast content of this sea slug species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cartaxana et a. 2023</xref>; Morelli et al. 2024).</p><p id="P36">Other sea slug and algae species used were collected from the wild and only transiently cultured in the laboratory for the experiments. In these cases, the specimens were allowed to acclimate to the laboratory conditions for a minimum of one week before the experiments. The details of all the sea slug and algae species used in the study, their original locality and their growth conditions are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Bleaching of <italic>E. timida</italic></title><p id="P37">A subset of 100 adult <italic>E. timida</italic> individuals were selected and put under high light (PPFD 1500 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>; 50 W cold white LED flood light, ExtraStar Electrical Ltd, Salford, England) in a 12/12h day/night cycle for 11 days without any algae to feed on. The 500 mL glass flasks containing the sea slugs were sealed with parafilm and constantly sparged with air during the 11-day period. An increase in salinity caused by the small amount of ASW evaporation from the flasks was counteracted every two days by adding an equivalent amount of distilled H<sub>2</sub>O, and the flasks and ASW were completely changed every 4 days. After 11 days, the sea slugs were visually inspected and 54 palest individuals were selected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) for a re-feeding experiment (see below).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Induction of state transitions</title><p id="P38">Two custom built LED systems (Shenzhen LED Color Co., LTD, Shenzhen, China) were used to induce state transitions in the sea slugs and the algae: a 660 nm red light that preferentially excites PSII (PSII light), and a 740 nm far-red light for preferential PSI excitation (PSI light) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> for the spectra). The absolute irradiance of both types of light was measured using a calibrated FLAME-T-VIS-NIR miniature spectrometer equipped with a cosine corrected QP400-1-VIS-NIR light guide (Ocean Insight, Orlando, FL, USA), converted to PFD and set to 50 μmol photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> unless otherwise mentioned. The main protocol for the induction of state transitions consisted of placing the samples in the dark for 15 min, and then exposing them for 15 min to either PSII or PSI light, but different combinations of darkness, PSII and PSI treatments were also applied as described in the text. All light treatments were done at ambient room temperature. Depending on the size of the sea slug species, different numbers of individuals were placed in a well of a transparent 6- or 24-well plate filled with ASW to ensure sufficient biomass for downstream analyses of the samples. With <italic>E. crispata</italic>, a large sea slug with an approximate adult body length of &gt;20 mm, only one animal was placed in a well, whereas three to five individuals of the smaller sea slugs <italic>E. timida</italic> (adult body length ≤10 mm) and <italic>E. viridis</italic> (≤15mm) were placed in a well. After the desired light treatment, all sea slugs from a single well were immediately frozen and ground to a fine, homogenous powder in liquid nitrogen and collected to a pre-cooled cryotube that was thereafter never allowed to thaw and kept as close to 77K temperature as possible. The pulverized animals originating from a single well were treated as a single biological replicate in the downstream analyses of state transitions. The protocol was essentially the same for the algae, although special consideration had to be paid to not cause substantial self-shading of the algal filaments.</p><p id="P39">In some of the experiments the samples were exposed to 5 mM concentration of the phosphatase inhibitor NaF (CAS#: 7681-49-4; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) that prevents the dephosphorylation of LHCII and therefore also the reversal of light acclimation from state 2 to state 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Rintamäki et al. 1997</xref>). In these cases, the <italic>A. acetabulum</italic> algae were always first treated with 15 min darkness and 10 min of red PSII light prior to pipetting NaF from a 1 M stock solution (in H<sub>2</sub>O) to the ASW and gently mixing by swirling the experimental vial. After the addition of NaF, <italic>A. acetabulum</italic> were allowed to stay under the red light for 5 min, after which bleached <italic>E. timida</italic> were added to feed on the algae, still under the red light, for the desired amount of time, as specified in the text.</p><p id="P40">The effect of salinity on state transitions in <italic>A. acetabulum</italic> was tested by first placing dark acclimated algae under the red PSII light for 15 min in ASW with a salinity of 35 PPT (same as their growth conditions), after which the algae were transferred to ASW with either 25, 30, 40 or 45 PPT salinity and maintained under the PSII light for an additional 5 min. The samples were then frozen and ground in liquid nitrogen as usual. The salinities were measured with a HI96822 digital refractometer (Hanna Instruments, Woonsocket, RI, USA).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Chlorophyll fluorescence spectra at 77K</title><p id="P41">Because the chlorophyll concentration of the pulverized samples from the state transition induction experiments was unknown, all samples had to be serially diluted to ensure as little self-absorption of chlorophyll fluorescence as possible during the subsequent fluorescence measurements at liquid nitrogen (77K) temperature. For this, the samples were diluted with optically neutral quartz sand (SiO<sub>2</sub>; CAS#: 14808-60-7, Merck). For most samples the dilution series consisted of 100% (pure sample powder taken straight from the grinding), 50% (a rough 50/50 mixture of sample and SiO<sub>2</sub>; v/v) and 25% (a rough 25/75 mixture of sample and SiO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations, but heavily concentrated samples had to be diluted even further. The total volume of the sample and SiO<sub>2</sub> varied from approximately 50 to 200 μL. The SiO<sub>2</sub> was pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen before adding it to the sample powder inside a 2 mL cryotube, and all samples were vortexed in short bursts before the fluorescence measurements to thoroughly mix the sample powder with the SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="P42">One screw-on cap of a 2 mL cryotube was punctured and the probe end of a bifurcated R600-7-VIS-125F light guide (Ocean Insight) was fitted to the hole so that the cap surrounded the probe end at a desired height. The samples in the cryotubes were then fastened to the cap on the probe so that the sample powder at the bottom of the tube was in contact with the probe. The sample tube and the probe were then submerged in liquid nitrogen inside a box that was lined and covered with black cloth. The blue excitation light for all measurements was obtained by filtering the light from a 50 W white LED flood light (ExtraStar Electrical Ltd) with 500 nm low-pass (500FL07-50S; Andover Corporation, Salem, NH, USA) and 450 nm band-pass (450FS20-12.5, Andover Corporation) filters (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> for the excitation light spectrum). The excitation light was guided to the sample through the probe by placing another end of the R600-7-VIS-125F light guide perpendicular to the 450 nm band-pass filter. The third end of the light guide was connected to a FLAME-T-VIS-NIR spectrometer equipped with a 100 μm aperture assembly-slit. Chlorophyll fluorescence was recorded using the OceanView software with the following settings: integration time 10 s, boxcar width 3, scans to average 1, and the non-linearity correction was on. Before recording, the fluorescence signal was allowed to stabilize for approximately 2 min or until visible changes in the shape of the spectrum were no longer noticeable.</p><p id="P43">The data from the dilution series of a single biological replicate were inspected to estimate the effect of self-shading on chlorophyll fluorescence. In an ideal situation the data from the 50% and 25% sample concentrations showed the same shape of the chlorophyll fluorescence spectrum, validating the use of the less noisy 50% data. However, sometimes the spectrum did still show slight differences in shape between 50% and 25% sample concentrations, especially in the 710-730 nm region, indicating self-absorption of chlorophyll fluorescence and making the 50% sample concentration data unusable. In such cases the most dilute sample concentration that still exhibited noticeable chlorophyll fluorescence was selected for downstream analyses. The fluorescence data were then processed in MS Excel v.16.0 (MS Office 365; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) by applying smoothing with a 4 nm running average, setting the zero-level signal by subtracting the signal at 800 nm from the entire spectrum, and normalizing the data to the PSII fluorescence peak between 680-690 nm.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Photosynthesis measurements</title><p id="P44">Different parameters related to photosynthesis were obtained using routine saturating pulse analyses with PAM fluorometers that record variable chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> fluorescence from photosynthetic material. Briefly, the core parameters of the saturating light pulse analyses were the PSII activity parameters F<sub>V</sub>/F<sub>M</sub>, i.e. (F<sub>M</sub>-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>M</sub>, where F<sub>M</sub> and F<sub>0</sub> are the maximum and minimum fluorescence from dark acclimated samples, and (F<sub>M</sub>’-F)/F<sub>M</sub>’, where F<sub>M</sub>’ and F are the maximum and transient fluorescence during continuous illumination. NPQ was calculated as F<sub>M</sub>/F<sub>M</sub>’-1. The fraction of PSII reaction centers in the open state was estimated using the qL parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kramer et al. 2004</xref>), defined as ((F<sub>M</sub>’-F)/(F<sub>M</sub>’-F<sub>0</sub>’)) x (F<sub>0</sub>’/F), where F<sub>0</sub>’ is a theoretical estimation of the true minimum fluorescence of a light acclimated sample, calculated as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Oxborough and Baker (1997)</xref>.</p><p id="P45">Variable chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> fluorescence during illumination with the external PSII and PSI lights was measured using Junior-PAM (Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany) from samples that were kept in low light (PPFD ~10 μmol m—<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) for a minimum of 15 min prior to the measurements. Rapid light curves were measured from samples taken from their growth conditions without dark acclimation using Imaging-PAM (Mini version; Heinz Walz GmbH). The duration of the light steps for each actinic light intensity was 60 s, after which a saturating light pulse was fired to estimate rETR of PSII, calculated as 0.42 x ((F<sub>M</sub>’-F)/F<sub>M</sub>’) x PPFD, where 0.42 is a plant-based estimation of the fraction of incident photons absorbed by PSII. Rapid light curves were also measured from <italic>A. acetabulum</italic> exposed to either 25, 30, 40 or 45 PPT salinity ASW. Here, the algae were put to the salinity treatment in their growth conditions for 5 min and then exposed to the rapid light curve protocol. The algae were kept in ASW with the desired salinity until the end of the protocol. The fluorescence kinetics during and after a high light (PPFD 500 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) treatment were measured from <italic>Chaetomorpha</italic> sp. using Imaging-PAM in the absence and presence of the uncoupler nigericin (60 μM; CAS#: 28643-80-3, Merck) and the reducing agent 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT, 10 mM; CAS#: 3483-12-3, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Basel, Switzerland). The algae were incubated in ASW in the absence or presence of either one of the reagents for 30 min in the dark prior to the high light treatment.</p><p id="P46">The measuring beam lights of both Junior-PAM and Imaging-PAM were blue, as well as the actinic light of Imaging-PAM. The immobilization of the sea slugs during the fluorescence measurements was achieved by placing them on a black cloth on top of tissue paper. The tissue paper sucked out most of the moisture through the cloth, rendering the animals sufficiently immobile for the duration of the measurements.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Confocal microscopy and image analysis</title><p id="P47">The algae samples were prepared for microscopy by placing one to three live algal filaments or pieces on a regular rectangular microscope glass slide, adding a drop of ASW on the samples and then placing a cover glass on top. When the effect of salinity on chloroplast characteristics was inspected in <italic>A. acetabulum,</italic> the algae were put to ASW with the desired salinity for at least 10 min before the filamentous cells were prepared on the slides. Here, the salinity of the ASW that was added to the slide was always the same as in the salinity treatment in question. With the small sea slugs <italic>E. timida</italic>, <italic>E. viridis</italic> and <italic>P. dendritica,</italic> the samples were prepared simply by decapitating the animal with a razor blade and then pinning the rest of the body between the microscope slide and the cover glass. After decapitating the larger sea slug <italic>E. crispata</italic>, pieces of their left and right parapodia were cut out and placed on the slides for microscopy.</p><p id="P48">Images of the chloroplasts from different organisms were taken with a confocal microscope of a Mica Microhub (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The objective was HC PL APO 63x/1.20 W CS2 motCORR and the refractive index of water (1.33) was used for all samples. The acquisition software was Leica Application Suite X (LASX, version 6.2.2.28360) that provides automated image capture optimization in combination with Mica. The sample characteristics were described as “dynamic” and “living” by turning on the corresponding settings from LASX. Chloroplasts were detected via chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> fluorescence by allowing LASX to determine the excitation laser wavelength (405 nm) and the appropriate emission detection range from the uploaded chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> absorption and emission spectra (downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fpbase.org/spectra/;">https://www.fpbase.org/spectra/;</ext-link> checked on 26.04.2024). After manual focusing, LASX was allowed to optimize all settings, including the laser intensity, using the” OneTouch” feature of Mica/LASX. The optimization was done for each sample individually. Images were always captured with the LIGHTNING computational clearing feature on.</p><p id="P49">A minimum of three images from each biological replicate were analyzed using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Schindelin et al. 2012</xref>) to determine the area and circularity of the chloroplasts. Each image was inspected for regions where the chloroplasts were in focus, and these sections were cropped for further analysis. The recognition and segmentation of chloroplasts from the images was done using the StarDist plugin, originally designed for the recognition of fluorescent nuclei from microscope images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Schmidt et al. 2018</xref>). The “Versatile (fluorescent nuclei)” model of StarDist with the default settings was deemed sufficiently accurate in recognizing the chloroplasts, but brightness and contrast adjustments were applied to the entire images in some cases to assist StarDist in identifying the chloroplasts. The hundreds to thousands of identified and segmented chloroplasts were then analyzed for area and circularity with Fiji. The circularity was defined as (4π x Chloroplast Area)/Chloroplast Perimeter<sup>2</sup>, with the values ranging between 0 (no resemblance to a circle) and 1 (a perfect circle).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Statistical analysis and figure preparation</title><p id="P50">All statistical analyses were done using R (v.4.2.3) in RStudio (2023.06.0+421).

The sea slugs <italic>Elysia timida</italic>, <italic>Elysia crispata</italic> and <italic>Elysia viridis</italic> are capable of long-term kleptoplasty. <italic>E. timida</italic> only feeds on and incorporates chloroplasts from <italic>Acetabularia acetabulum</italic> as kleptoplasts, but <italic>E. crispata</italic> and <italic>E. viridis</italic> are known to obtain kleptoplasts from multiple sources, including algae belonging to the group Bryopsidales. Here, only the algae-sea slug associations tested in this study are shown. Like <italic>E. viridis, Placida dendritica</italic> also feeds on <italic>Codium tomentosum</italic>, but it only stores the kleptoplasts very transiently and they are non-functional. The exclusion of Bryopsidales from the core set of ulvophytes (Ulvophyceae <italic>sensu stricto</italic>) is based on the classification by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hou et al. (2022)</xref>.

The occurrence of state transitions is indicated by the differently colored diamonds and relies solely on the data from the present study. Question marks indicate untested properties. The thickness of a node connecting an alga and a sea slug approximates the strength of the prey-predator relationship of the species in our laboratory conditions. The division of Ulvophyceae macroalgae to the core set of ulvophytes (Ulvophyceae <italic>sensu stricto</italic>) and to Bryopsidales is based on the classification by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hou et al.
