Many real-life situations call for asymmetrical activation of extremity muscles leading to unilateral manifestations of muscle fatigue. Repeated unilateral handgrip contractions at submaximal force have been shown to be associated with neural dynamics in both contralateral and ipsilateral cortical motor areas and improved response times of the contralateral, unfatigued homologue in a button-press task. However, it remains unclear whether the observed improvement in contralateral response latency translates into higher-level benefits in movement quality.</p><p id="P2">To investigate this, 30 healthy participants underwent unilateral handgrip fatiguing tasks at 5%, 50%, and 75% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force. Subsequently, bimanual movement quality was assessed in an object-hit task using a Kinarm robot.</p><p id="P3">The protocol at 50% and 75% of MVC elicited clear signs of muscle fatigue compared to the control condition (5%) measured by a decline in force, post-exercise deterioration in MVC, characteristic changes in surface electromyography magnitudes, and increases in ratings of perceived exertion. No change was observed on kinematic measures in the object-hit task for both arms indicating that unilateral handgrip fatigue did not elicit measurable effects on higher-level movement quality on the ipsilateral or contralateral homologue. Previously reported improvements on contralateral response latency were not found to translate into advanced movement quality benefits.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The human body’s inherent adaptability in the face of muscle fatigue is vitally important for a wide range of daily activities. In healthy individuals, the ability to make effective adjustments allowing accurate movements to continue even during muscle fatigue is highly advantageous for a range of activities, including athletic performance and professions that require strenuous manual labour. Further, in patients with motor impairments, maintaining quality movements despite increased fatiguability is critical for retaining independence in daily activities and avoiding the need for external care.</p><p id="P5">Muscle fatigue is a complex and often rather vaguely defined physical state, which can arise through a number of peripheral and central processes. While it can sometimes be broadly defined as a ‘transient decrease in the capacity to perform physical actions’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> it is often characterised in a more focused way as an ‘exercised-induced decrease in the ability to produce force’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> Muscle fatigue can be quantified by various physiological markers, among them a decline in force output and distinctive electromyographical alterations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> Muscle fatigue generally develops gradually, and fatigue-induced changes in physiological markers are commonly at least partly task-dependent.</p><p id="P6">While muscle fatigue can occur symmetrically, many real-life situations lack perfect symmetry, meaning that even healthy individuals regularly face asymmetric stresses on their motor system. For example, on a crowded bus, a person might choose to tightly grip a passenger handle with one hand for the entire duration of the bus ride. After descending the bus, the same individual might then choose to perform a more complex movement using their contralateral, unfatigued arm (e.g., inserting a key into the door of their house) or even engage in bimanual compound movements of both arms (e.g., taking off their coat and untying their shoes). To predict how the individual’s preceding unimanual fatigue will now impact the movement quality of such contralateral or bilateral movements is complex and involves changes in underlying neural dynamics which might have been triggered by the unimanual fatigue, and have the potential to not only influence the fatigued limb itself but also the contralateral, unfatigued homologue.</p><p id="P7">Recent evidence from our research group suggests that repeated unilateral handgrip contractions at 50% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), resulting in a decrease in volitional force output, are associated with an improvement in motor response latency in the contralateral, unfatigued homologous limb with a button-press task compared to a control condition of 5% of MVC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> Further, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) revealed that the degree of change in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) and the bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMA) after the contractions at 50% of MVC were in relation to the contralateral response time improvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup></p><p id="P8">However, it is still incompletely understood which range of fatigue intensities (i.e. percentages of MVC) can trigger such neural responses, given that previous experiments have been conducted using only one fatigue intensity (e.g., 50% of MVC vs. 5% of MVC as a control). Furthermore, even though we have shown that the degree of decline in GABA following unilateral handgrip contractions is related to improvements in contralateral limb response time, it is unclear whether this effect translates into quantifiable benefits in higher-level movement quality, as opposed to only in response time. This is particularly relevant when considering movement accuracy. While the disinhibitory effects of decreased GABA may benefit performance in terms of reducing movement response time, it is less certain whether this effect will also translate to benefit finer motor skills, which may not only require speed but also accuracy. Indeed, Branscheidt et al. have suggested that muscle fatigue may even be responsible for a longer-term effect of ‘target overshoot’ as a result of excessive force production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In light of the principles of disinhibition, one might reason that these seemingly contradictory movement effects of muscle fatigue could in fact represent two sides of the same coin. Downregulation of GABA could theoretically account for both effects, which would create an interesting trade-off: beneficial effects on response time and overall force production at the expense of movement accuracy and possible target overshoot.</p><p id="P9">Previous research has also indicated that there are potentially conflicting effects transpiring in the supraspinal realm as a response to unilateral muscle fatigue. Previous protocols of unilateral fatigue in the right dorsal interosseus muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and the knee extensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> have been reported to induce various degrees of cross-over effects of increasing fatigue on the contralateral homologue, while a protocol of right unimanual fatigue found no evidence for a cross-over effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> A TMS study of unilateral handgrip contraction exercise on the left hand reported decreased short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in the primary motor cortex (M1) on the ipsilateral side and suggested diminished excitability of the ipsilateral M1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, contrasted by other results suggesting that forceful left abductor pollicis brevis (APB) exercise at intensities of more than 50% of MVC might be associated with anti-inhibitory effects on the contralateral homologue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>
</p><p id="P10">One probable reason for the inconsistent evidence is the heterogenous nature of employed experimental protocols.</p><p id="P11">When considering real-world implications, it is also difficult to infer predictions about the movement quality of bilateral compound movements from purely unilateral measurements. As Swinnen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> has accurately noted in 2002, ‘principles of interlimb coordination are unique and cannot be inferred from the laws of single-limb movements’. Feeney et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> meanwhile noted the importance of those coordinated interlimb movements for the fatigued state, reasoning that ‘switching to bimanual tasks when one hand becomes fatigued could be beneficial regarding preserving the high level of both the manipulation performance and force coordination’.</p><p id="P12">Therefore, in this study we aimed to elicit varying intensities of unilateral handgrip fatigue and measure how these influence movement quality as assessed by advanced kinematic parameters of both arms during bilateral movements. We deliberately designed our experiments to require not only speed but also fine motor accuracy, creating experimental leverage in identifying problems of overshoot and rapid bimanual coordination.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p id="P13">We recruited 30 right-handed participants, between 19 and 41 years of age (median: 25, IQR: 10.75), of which 18 (60%) were female.

Participants underwent 1 min of training to familiarise themselves with the Assessment Task (AT).</p><p id="P15">To individualise the force levels for the Fatiguing Task (FT), each participant’s maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was quantified. Participants performed 3 cued contractions at MVC, each of 3 sec duration with 30 sec of rest in between contractions (MVC 3×). Verbal encouragement was given during MVC attempts to facilitate maximum efforts and force output. By employing the 2×2 Achievement Goals Questionnaire for Sport (AGQ-S) by Elliot and McGregor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> directly before the MVC calibration, we aimed to further encourage participants and to quantify their performance motivation.</p><p id="P16">After quantifying individual MVC (via MVC 3×), participants completed a number of questionnaires: Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, World Health Organization Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and BORG-CR-10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.

The only difference between the three rounds was the level of force intensity (5%, 50% or 75% of MVC) during the FT.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Fatiguing task (FT)</title><p id="P18">We employed a visually prompted handgrip FT of 9 min duration, consisting of 1 sec handgrip contractions followed by 1 sec relaxation periods for a total of 270 contractions. Participants were instructed to adjust their applied handgrip force to match a target line displayed on a computer screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). Participants were shown their handgrip force output in real time. The horizontal target line was kept consistently in the centre of the screen to maintain a consistent visual task presentation across the three conditions, regardless of the force intensity required (i.e., force intensity of 5%, 50%, or 75% of baseline MVC. Six protocols were created to balance the order of the three experimental conditions across participants. Participants were allocated to a protocol using covariate-adaptive allocation, employing a variance minimisation procedure developed by Sella et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. This allowed us to assign equal numbers of participants to each group and actively minimise the variance of MVC values across the protocols.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Assessment task (AT)</title><p id="P19">To assess the effect of different force intensities of unimanual fatigue on the movement quality of both arms, participants completed a bimanual object-hit task for a duration of 4min. The task was adapted and distinctly modified from the original object-hit task by Tyryshkin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. To complete the task, participants needed to perform arm reaches with robotic handles (displayed to the participant as virtual green paddles of 1.5 cm width and 0.5 cm height) to deflect virtual red balls (0.75 cm diameter) away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Balls were continuously released from 16 evenly distributed bins at the rear/top side of the display (30 objects per bin), falling toward the participant’s side of the display at different velocities (15-30 cm/s) with two balls per second. The bin and speed of the falling virtual objects were kept continuously pseudorandom and unpredictable to the participant. The comparably small width of the paddles was chosen to increase the accuracy of movements required to hit a ball. When the participant hit a ball with the paddle, the direction of the ball movement changed, providing real-time feedback to the participant.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Recovery period</title><p id="P20">The recovery period between task rounds was 20 minutes, which has been shown to be adequate to allow for good restitution of most elements of voluntary muscle force activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.

We showed that the higher force levels for our FT, which were designed to induce fatigue, did indeed induce a decline in real-time force output during the task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, characteristic changes in the magnitude of EMG activity during the task, with some increases in magnitude seen at lower force intensities and progressive magnitude decline at higher force intensities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, a decline in post-exercise MVC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, and an increase in the self-reported perceived rate of exertion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Collectively, significant changes were observed across all four metrics with increasing force levels, indicating that muscle fatigue occurred with the FT protocol.</p><p id="P43">In addition, while force performance data showed significant differences between all force levels, EMG activity did not significantly differ between 5% MVC and 50% MVC force level, only decreasing significantly at 75% MVC. This may reflect a physiological attempt at compensation in response to emergent handgrip fatigue at a moderate force level, a mechanism likely mediated by increased muscle fibre recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In the 75% MVC condition, this compensation then seemed to fail most drastically in the ECR, when compared to the FCR. Interestingly, when comparing post-exercise MVC measures, there is a comparable decline from control for both 50% and 75% MVC force levels with no significant difference between the two fatigue conditions. When contrasting this finding with the real-time force performance data, this might indicate that higher force level exercise seems to affect repeated submaximal contraction performance more dramatically than maximum post-exercise contraction performance. This finding might be in part driven by motivation, as participants might have felt a greater sense of achievement or relief after having completed the 75% MVC task versus after the 50% MVC task, possibly influencing their subsequent resolve to make maximal contraction efforts on the post-FT MVC test. The self-reported measures, on the other hand, showed a more linear trend of increasing perceived level of exertion with increasing force level.</p><p id="P44">In summary, these findings indicate that in our experimental setting, muscle fatigue was achieved in both experimental conditions compared to the control condition with some degree of scaling between 50% and 75% of MVC detectable in three of the four available measures (force output, magnitude of EMG activity, and subjective exertion).</p></sec><sec id="S33"><label>4.2</label><title>Handgrip FT elicits sustained ipsilateral electromyographical effect throughout AT</title><p id="P45">Through analysis of simultaneously recorded EMG signal magnitude from the right arm during the AT, we conclude that the FT at both experimental force levels (50% and 75% of MVC) results in an ipsilateral reduction of EMG activity on the subsequent AT compared to the control condition (5% of MVC). This indicates that the implemented fatigue protocol shows a sustained fatiguing effect throughout the AT. Interestingly, the difference between the ECR and the FCR muscle seen during the FT at 75% MVC force level appears to largely disappear in the subsequent AT. One must consider, however, that 1) the continuous method of measuring EMG activity on AT in contrast to the discrete, contraction-based EMG measurements on FT might render these outcomes difficult to compare and 2) the comparison of EMG activity between FT and AT is a non-specific comparison given the movement type differences in the two tasks.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><label>4.3</label><title>Ipsilateral movement quality in an object-hit task remains unimpeded by dominant handgrip fatigue</title><p id="P46">Even though participants continued to show signs of fatigue in their right arm as quantified by EMG during the AT, this did not significantly influence hits, space covered, velocity or acceleration of the fatigued (ipsilateral) arm. Therefore, contrary to our expectations, it can be concluded that sustained unilateral handgrip fatigue does not impair ipsilateral arm movement quality in a bilateral object-hit task performed on the Kinarm endpoint robot. One possible explanation for this finding is that the employed handgrip FT is not kinematically specific to the following AT. Although handgrip exercises tend to elicit activity in most muscles of the upper extremity, the proportion of muscle involvement is different when compared to the muscles involved in the movements necessary to hit balls on an object-hit task. The lack of performance deterioration of the fatigued ipsilateral (right) arm despite handgrip fatigue could, in turn, also explain why no significant spillover of activity from the left arm to the right area of the canvas could be observed - there was simply no need for the unfatigued (left) arm to support the tasking of the fatigued homologue.</p></sec><sec id="S35"><label>4.4</label><title>Contralateral higher-level movement quality is unchanged following dominant handgrip fatigue</title><p id="P47">Based on past experiments by our group showing that unilateral handgrip contractions at 50% of MVC were associated with improved motor response latency in the contraleral, unfatigued homologue and related changes in cortical GABA-ergic activity, we aimed to test whether these effects translate into measurable effects in higher-level movement quality measures. Neither the primary outcome (number of balls hit), nor secondary outcomes (space covered, velocity and acceleration during object-hit task) showed any significant change on the side of the contralateral, unfatigued arm. Therefore, we can conclude from the data presented in this study that there is no measurable effect of unilateral handgrip fatigue on higher-level movement quality on the contralateral homologue. The significant effects seen in our previously employed button-press task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> did not translate into advanced movement quality benefits.</p></sec><sec id="S36"><label>4.5</label><title>Clinical implications and outlook</title><p id="P48">Fatigue is very common in patients with pathological unilateral motor impairment, e.g., after surviving a stroke; indeed it is among the most regularly recorded symptoms of stroke survivors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> Although post-stroke fatigue is currently believed to be caused mainly by impaired corticomotor excitability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> rendering it mechanistically different from physiological muscle fatigue, some characteristics of post-stroke fatigue overlap with physiological fatigue. In post-stroke fatigue, a decrease in corticomotor neural drive after surviving a stroke creates a scenario of disuse or limited use of the affected muscles, leading to atrophy (especially with regards to type II muscle fibres), diminished ability to voluntarily contract muscles and less synchronization of motor units<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, effects which, to a certain degree, can also be observed in healthy people, e.g. after physical inactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. In any case, gaining a better understanding of how neural dynamics shape the adaption response to unilateral fatigue is not only of fundamental scientific interest but also of clinical relevance.</p><p id="P49">Interestingly, while our findings did not demonstrate a measurable improvement in high-level movement quality in the contralateral limb, the lack of negative impact on performance in the unfatigued arm could have positive clinical implications. For instance, our results suggest that unilateral handgrip fatigue training does not impair contralateral movement quality, highlighting a potential strategy for strength training and neuromodulatory benefits in rehabilitation settings. Research has shown that high-intensity interval exercise can promote systemic physiological benefits, including increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and other neurotrophic factors that support neuroplasticity and functional recovery. While it needs to be noted that our study was conducted in healthy volunteers and only measured movement quality on the same day as the fatiguing task intervention, the finding of a lack of negative impact still opens up the possibility of incorporating handgrip exercises or similar unilateral fatigue-inducing tasks on the unimpaired limb before or alongside targeted rehabilitation exercises for the impaired limb. By doing so, patients might gain neurophysiological benefits that enhance the neural state without compromising the quality of rehabilitation in the affected limb. This point highlights the potential clinical efficacy of ‘cross-education’, whereby single limb strength and/or skilled motor training confers a positive training affect to the contralateral homologous muscle group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> This approach could potentially maximize the benefits of the paretic limb,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> but also boost systemic neuroplastic adaptations, setting a stronger foundation for motor recovery in the affected limb, while leaving high-level motor function intact in the unfatigued, contralateral limb. Further studies could explore this hypothesis, examining how such protocols might be refined and applied in clinical rehabilitation settings to support motor recovery and neuroplastic gains.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S37"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Prof. Huiling Tan and Dr. Alek Pogosyan for sharing their EMG equipment.</p><sec id="S38"><title>Funding</title><p>The study was supported by a Senior Research Fellowship awarded to CJS, funded by the Wellcome Trust (224430/Z/21/Z).
