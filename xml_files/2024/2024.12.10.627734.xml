Using chronically implanted Neuropixels probes, we recorded local field potentials (LFP) alongside action potentials from hundreds of neurons spanning infralimbic, prelimbic and cingulate subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex of freely-behaving adult rats. Psilocybin (0.3mg/kg or 1mg/kg i.p.) unmasked 100Hz high frequency oscillations that were most pronounced within the infralimbic cortex, persisted for approximately 1h post-injection and were accompanied by decreased net pyramidal cell firing rates and reduced signal complexity. These acute effects were more prominent during resting behaviour than during a sustained attention task. LFP 1-, 2- and 6-days post-psilocybin showed gradually-emerging increases in beta and low-gamma (20-60Hz) power, specific to the infralimbic cortex. These findings reveal features of psychedelic action not readily detectable in human brain imaging, implicating infralimbic network oscillations as potential biomarkers of psychedelic-induced network plasticity over multi-day timescales.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>psychedelic</kwd><kwd>neural networks</kwd><kwd>oscillations</kwd><kwd>energy landscape</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>prelimbic</kwd><kwd>infralimbic</kwd><kwd>Neuropixels</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Increasing evidence suggests that psychedelic-induced ‘reconfiguration’ of brain connectivity patterns can culminate in lasting psychological changes, sparking substantial interest in psychedelic-based or -derived treatment of mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Carhart-Harris &amp; Goodwin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kočárová et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Siegel et al., 2021</xref>). For example, in a recent phase IIb double blind trial, a single dose of synthesized crystalline polymorph COMP360 psilocybin was shown to significantly reduce depression scores over a period of 3 weeks in people with treatment-resistant depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Goodwin et al., 2022</xref>). However, directly assessing cellular and circuit-level neural mechanisms remains challenging in human studies, particularly over multi-day timescales. Defining the molecular, cellular and circuit mechanisms driving psychedelic actions by translating between human brain imaging and animal neurophysiology therefore remains essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Smausz et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Psychedelics like psilocybin directly modulate the serotonergic (5-HT) system. Psilocybin’s active metabolite, psilocin, is a partial agonist of 5-HT receptors (5HTRs), notably acting on 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Erkizia-Santamaría et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Tylš et al., 2023</xref>). 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which, on activation, increase cell excitation through the phospholipase C signalling pathway. In contrast, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs are G<sub>i</sub>-GPCRs which inhibit the activity of adenylate cyclase, leading to decreased cell excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Andrade, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Smausz et al., 2022</xref>). Both subtypes are widely expressed throughout the rodent, primate and human brain, including in the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Froudist-Walsh et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Santana et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Zilles &amp; Palomero-Gallagher, 2017</xref>), which is reciprocally connected to serotonergic nuclei in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hajós et al., 1998</xref>). Immunohistochemical studies in rat have shown both 1A and 2A Rs are expressed in cortical pyramidal cells (1A: 60% of cells, 2A: ~60-90% of cells in PFC) and GABAergic interneurons (1A: 25% of cells, 2A: 25% of cells in PFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Santana et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, while the psychedelic effects of drugs including psilocybin are generally thought to involve activation of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Halberstadt &amp; Geyer, 2011</xref>), other 5HTR subtypes may contribute to therapeutic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Conn et al., 2024</xref>). Certainly, widespread 5HTR expression, bidirectional effects on cell excitation, and modulation of both glutamatergic and GABAergic cells makes pinpointing the actions of psilocybin a complex challenge.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Acute effects of psychedelics on neural activity</title><p id="P4">Human fMRI and MEG analyses suggest that psychedelics increase neocortical neural signal diversity, an effect associated with desynchronisation within local network populations and desegregation of distributed brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Carhart-Harris et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lord et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Schartner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Shinozuka et al., 2024</xref>). Invasive recordings of local field potentials (LFP) can be used to back-translate these analyses into animals, in which a concomitant decrease in distributed oscillatory power would be expected following systemic psychedelics. Indeed, psilocybin/psilocin has been shown to decrease low-frequency power in both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kometer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Tyls et al., 2016</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Golden &amp; Chadderton, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Vejmola et al., 2021</xref>). To date, very few studies have investigated the effects of psilocybin on the activity of individual neocortical neurons and their circuit interactions, though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Golden &amp; Chadderton (2022)</xref> showed that systemic injection of 2mg/kg psilocybin led to a net increase in population (mixed pyramidal and interneuron) firing rates in the cingulate cortex of head-fixed mice. Here, we used large-scale, high-density electrophysiology in freely-behaving rats to quantify how psilocybin affects the activities of different cells types at different doses across PFC subregions, and how synchrony between cells is affected.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Lasting changes to network activity</title><p id="P5">Few studies have investigated the long-term effects of psilocybin on underlying brain activity. Skosnik et al. found preliminary evidence for a sustained increase in auditory stimulus train-evoked scalp EEG theta power 2 weeks after a single dose of psilocybin in people diagnosed with major depressive disorder. This increase in evoked theta was interpreted as a metric of synaptic plasticity and was also found to correlate with improved depression scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Skosnik et al., 2023</xref>). Others have shown psilocybin can lead to lasting increases or decreases in human resting state functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Barrett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">McCulloch et al., 2022</xref>). On a cellular level, both rodent cell culture and in vivo studies have shown prolonged, psilocybin-induced increases in neuritogenesis and spinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Ly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Shao et al., 2021</xref>). Identifying the lasting effects of psilocybin on neural network dynamics could bridge between these human and animal findings, linking sustained restructuring of connectivity patterns with potential translational markers of therapeutic effects.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we therefore quantified the effects of individual systemic injections of therapeutically relevant doses of psilocybin on cellular and network activity recorded from the prefrontal cortex of freely behaving rats. We hypothesised that systemic psilocybin would have heterogenous effects on cell firing rates and alter coordinated activity between neural and interneuronal populations, modulating network state transitions, the complexity of the prefrontal dynamics and attenuating lower-frequency oscillations. In humans, psilocybin’s most pronounced acute and chronic effects on functional connectivity impact the default mode network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Siegel et al., 2024</xref>). We therefore hypothesised that psilocybin’s effects would be more prominent during resting than task-engaged behaviour and include lasting changes in network activity over the 1-week recording period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S5"><title>Psilocybin did not significantly alter movement or behaviour</title><p id="P7">In this study we chronically implanted Neuropixels 1.0 probes and recorded neural activity across the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of freely behaving rats. Rats performed an operant task in which nose-pokes were reinforced according to a random variable interval schedule in 15-minute blocks (task blocks) interleaved with 15-minute blocks of free behaviour (rest blocks) where no reinforcements were available, before and after administration of either 0.3mg/kg psilocybin, 1mg/kg psilocybin, or saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). A comparison of video-recorded movement pre- to post-injection revealed similar activity levels after injection of either saline, 0.3mg/kg psilocybin, or 1mg/kg psilocybin during either task or rest blocks (ANOVA1: Rest blocks: F(5,18)=2.1, p=0.113; Task blocks: F(5,18)=2.53, p=0.067; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), though the low frame-rate of video recordings meant head-twitch responses could not be reliably measured. On post-injection days 1, 2 and 6, performance of the operant task remained similar following 0.3mg/kg psilocybin and saline injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), whether quantified using number of trials completed (RM-ANOVA: drug: F(1,6)=0.00, p=0.971, time: F(8,48)=0.46, p=0.880, drug x time: F(8,48)=0.20, p=0.990), number of nose pokes (RM-ANOVA: drug: F(1,6)=1.48, p=0.270, time: F(8,48)=3.15, p=0.006, drug x time: F(8,48)=1.69, p=0.125), or gross activity (RM-ANOVA: Rest blocks: drug: F(1,6)=0.00, p=0.957, time: F(9,54)=0.58, p=0.807, drug x time: F(9,54)=1.49, p=0.176; Task blocks: drug: F(1,6)=0.04, p=0.850, time: F(8,48)=1.40, p=0.222, drug x time: F(8,48)=0.91, p=0.518). Consistent performance on the task following vehicle and psilocybin injections therefore enabled analyses of drug effects during both task-focused and resting states.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Psilocybin leads to acute emergence of a HFO within the infralimbic cortex</title><p id="P8">Local field potentials (LFP) within the infralimbic cortex revealed a sustained ~100Hz high frequency oscillation (HFO) after 0.3mg/kg injection of psilocybin, evident during both task and rest periods (individual examples: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). HFO power peaked during the second 15-minute rest block, lasting until at least 60 minutes post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>; RM-ANOVA: drug: F(1,6)=5.74, p=0.054, time: F(104,624)=5.26, p&lt;0.001, drug x time: F(104,624)=2.63, p&lt;0.001). Power spectra across 0-200Hz revealed a broadband decrease in power after 0.3mg/kg psilocybin, except at ~100Hz. This effect was most discernible during rest blocks, compared to task blocks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>; ANOVA2: Rest blocks, time [pre vs post]: F(1,6408)=21.64, p&lt;0.001, frequency: F(800,6408)=7.66, p&lt;0.001, time x frequency: F(800,6408)=1.59, p&lt;0.001; Task blocks, time [pre vs post]: F(1,6408)=19.24, p&lt;0.001, frequency: F(800,6408)=15.67, p&lt;0.001, time x frequency: F(800,6408)=0.93, p=0.925). Comparing spectral changes between psilocybin and saline revealed a significantly greater decrease post-injection of 0.3mg/kg psilocybin for frequencies between 20-80Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>; ANOVA2: drug: F(2,8010)=67.04, p&lt;0.001, frequency: F(800,8010)=7.94, p&lt;0.001; drug x frequency: F(1600,8010)=0.77, p=1.000). Similar results were identified at 1mg/kg psilocybin albeit with a significant reduction in power between 3.5-4.5Hz and a shift in the peak of the HFO to a slower frequency of ~93Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Psilocybin-induced HFO center on the infralimbic cortex</title><p id="P9">To determine how the ~100Hz HFO was anatomically distributed across the mPFC, spectral power was calculated during post-psilocybin injection rest blocks across all LFP channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). For each of these outputs, a 1/f power difference was calculated by removing the signal between 80-110Hz and interpolating this gap to enable a calculation of the relative increase in ~100Hz power (by taking the difference in power between the original signal and the interpolated signal at the peak frequency between 80-110Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Mapping this result to the histological verification of the Neuropixels placement revealed a continuum of HFO power that was maximal within the infralimbic cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). The HFO 1/f power difference rapidly dissipated along the probe moving dorsally from the infralimbic cortex to the prelimbic and cingulate cortex, at which point it was no longer discernible. In one rat (rat 1), the Neuropixels probe was not placed in the infralimbic cortex and there was also no increase in the HFO 1/f power difference identified in this rat. While it was not possible to verify precisely which layers of the cortex each probe was placed into, the strongest increase in HFO power was clearly identified in the rats in which the probe was placed into the deeper layers of the cortex (rats 3, 4, 6 with the probe in layers III, V, VI). To quantify differences in HFO power across the probe, and across drug conditions, a generalised linear model was computed using a log-linked inverse gaussian distribution. In addition to main effects of distance along the probe (β=0.01, SE=0.01, t=2.53, p=0.011) and drug (β=0.20, SE=0.01, t=32.07, p&lt;0.001), a significant interaction was also identified between distance and drug condition on HFO 1/f power difference (β=-0.05, SE=0.01, t=-20.95, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Psilocybin leads to an overall decrease in cell firing rates</title><p id="P10">Spike sorting analysis identified a median of 280 (range from 66-669) stable single units per animal during a single ~2 hour recording session. There were no differences in the number of single units detected between each drug condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3A</xref>). An assessment across time revealed that 0.3mg/kg of psilocybin led to a significant decrease in firing rates of pyramidal cells within the prelimbic cortex compared to saline. This effect was specific to the rest blocks and not apparent when the animal was actively engaged in the operant task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). No differences were identified between 0.3mg/kg psilocybin and saline within the cingulate or infralimbic cortex. In contrast, 1mg/kg psilocybin led to a significant decrease in firing rates in all three brain areas and was most apparent during the task blocks (Infralimbic: SRH: Drug: H(2,47460)=245.81, p&lt;0.001, Time: H(104,47460)=553.96, p&lt;0.001, Drug x Time: H(208,47460)=425.11, p&lt;0.001; Wilcoxon: p&lt;0.05 (at 1mg/kg only); Prelimbic: SRH: Drug: H(2,174510)=779.20, p&lt;0.001, Time: H(104,174510)=954.46, p&lt;0.001, Drug x Time: H(208,174510)=583.07, p&lt;0.001; Wilcoxon: p&lt;0.05 (at 0.3m/kg and 1mg/kg); Cingulate: SRH: Drug: H(2,22575)=452.03, p&lt;0.001, Time: H(104,22575)=99.65, p=0.603, Drug x Time: H(208,22575)=309.08, p&lt;0.001; Wilcoxon: p&lt;0.05 (at 1mg/kg only)).

No difference in firing rates was identified between task and rest blocks within the cingulate cortex, and there were no baseline differences in any brain region across drug conditions (SRH: Cingulate: Task: H(1,430)=0.33, p=0.568; Drug: H(2,430)=0, p=1.00; Task x Drug: H(2,430)=0.41, p=0.815; Prelimbic: Task: H(1,3324)=75.80, p&lt;0.001; Drug: H(2,3324)=0, p=1.00; Task x Drug: H(2,3324)=13.04, p=0.002; Infralimbic: Task: H(1,904)=21.68, p&lt;0.001; Drug: H(2,904)=0, p=1.00; Task x Drug: H(2,904)=2.94, p=0.230; Wilcoxon: p&lt;0.05).

This suggests the diminished separation in firing rates between rest and task blocks after 0.3mg/kg psilocybin is driven by the greater decrease in firing rates during rest blocks. Again, all three brain regions showed a significant main effect of drug condition (SRH: Cingulate: Task: H(1,430)=0. 30, p=0.87; Drug: H(2,430)=32.91, p&lt;0.001; Task x Drug: H(2,430)=1.97, p=0.373; Prelimbic: Task: H(1,3324)=2.32, p=0.128; Drug: H(2,3324)=40.91, p&lt;0.001; Task x Drug: H(2,3324)=18.54, p&lt;0.001; Infralimbic: Task: H(1,904)=0.02, p=0.890; Drug: H(2,904)=27.56, p&lt;0.001; Task x Drug: H(2,904)=1.04, p=0.594; Wilcoxon: p&lt;0.05).

Certainly, the biophysical basis of psilocybin-induced HFO remains enigmatic. 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>-R agonists and antagonists can induce increases and decreases in HFO power respectively, prompting a suggestion that HFOs may be modulated by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Goda et al., 2013</xref>).

Preferential effects of psilocybin on the infralimbic cortex may therefore reflect proportionally greater activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs at low doses. Indeed, the mPFC region investigated in this study corresponds to the region of highest 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R expression across the whole cortex in rats, macaque monkeys and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Froudist-Walsh et al., 2023</xref>).

Whilst net suppression of PFC output is consistent with the broadband decrease in LFP power, we also identified an increase in the correlated activity between pairs of cells.

This may lead to increased synaptic activity in the higher associative cortical areas, causing increase in the fMRI and MEG/EEG signal diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Schartner et al., 2017</xref>). However, decreased mPFC neural spiking may also support the REBUS hypothesis, as the top-down input to lower cortical areas would be significantly reduced. This suggests that the locally observed decrease in mPFC network state transitions and LZ complexity play a significant role in flattening of the global cortical hierarchy.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Delayed emergence of elevated gamma rhythms</title><p id="P28">Several studies have supported the notion that psychedelics like psilocybin may act as “psychoplastogens”, with their acute effects initiating circuit plasticity and enduring brain and behavioural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Heifets &amp; Olson, 2024</xref>). The most prominent finding from our longitudinal data was a gradual increase in beta and slow gamma-frequency activity, that was highest on day 6 post-injection of 0.3mg/kg psilocybin. Gamma oscillations are generated by rhythmic activity in interconnected inhibitory-inhibitory or excitatory-inhibitory loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Buzśaki &amp; Wang, 2012</xref>), particularly involving fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons and their rhythmic entrainment of pyramidal neurons with feedback inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Smausz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Wang, 2010</xref>). The gradual increase in gamma shown in our study may therefore reflect psilocybin-induced plasticity in these microcircuits, ultimately leading to an alteration to E/I balance. Within the limited existing data on long-term effects of psilocybin, a change in gamma activity has not been investigated. In a study of resting state functional connectivity in 10 psychedelic naïve volunteers, McCulloch et al identified decreased connectivity within the prefrontal cortex 1 week (but not 3 months) after a ~0.3mg/kg dose of psilocybin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">McCulloch et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, we found long-term decreases in broadband coherence across the CG/PL/IL cortices. This, combined with the finding of increased gamma power, corroborate previous findings of psychedelics inducing cortical desynchronisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Smausz et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Limitations and conclusions</title><p id="P29">One challenge with analysing this data arose from changes in mPFC neurophysiology following saline vehicle injections, most likely reflecting effects of stress from the injection procedure. Since the injection procedure was consistent across drug and vehicle conditions and the order was randomised across animals, our analyses control for these effects. Nevertheless, lower-stress injection methods without restraint of the animal would be useful for future studies (Dearnley et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Stuart &amp; Robinson, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P30">We have identified that a systemic injection of psilocybin leads to localised, state-dependent changes to the medial prefrontal cortex of rats. Our findings of decreased spectral power at low frequencies, increased power above 80Hz, decreased cell firing rates and signal complexity, local slowing of neural dynamics, and increased intra-regional cell pair correlations add subregional and cellular resolution to previous findings of psilocybin inducing desynchronisation across the brain. Several of these effects were most prominent during disengaged rest periods, consistent with clinical trial practice in which psilocybin is administered in low-stimuli environments. In addition, the localised infralimbic HFO could represent a novel biomarker of psychedelic action. Optogenetic modulation of infralimbic activity can recapitulate the enduring effects of ketamine on structural plasticity and behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fuchikami et al., 2015</xref>) and, in humans, Brodmann area 25 (the closest homolog to infralimbic cortex in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Nett &amp; LaLumiere, 2021</xref>) has been associated with hyperactivity in treatment-resistant depression. A decrease in activity in this area has also been associated with clinical response to both antidepressant medication and deep brain stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mayberg et al., 2005</xref>). Our results complement these findings provoking further investigation into the infralimbic cortex and its circuitry as therapeutic targets preferentially modulated by psilocybin or more selective derivatives.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S19"><title>Animals and surgery</title><p id="P31">All procedures were performed in accordance with the UK Animals Scientific Procedures Act (1986) and were approved by the University of Bristol Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board. Rats were housed individually in transparent, high-roofed cages (37x31x40cm lwh) to avoid damage to cranial implants; cages were enriched with wooden blocks and flowerpots. Water was provided <italic>ad libitum</italic> throughout, with food controlled to maintain body weight at no less than 85% of free-feeding values after recovery from surgery. Rooms were temperature-and humidity-controlled, with lights on at 08:15 and off at 20:15.</p><p id="P32">2 weeks after delivery to the unit, six adult male Lister Hooded rats (340-400g, 12-16 weeks of age, Charles River UK) underwent stereotaxic surgery under isoflurane recovery anaesthesia (4% induction, 1-2% maintenance), for implantation of Neuropixels 1.0 probes (IMEC, Belgium) into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Rats were each implanted with a Neuropixels probe into the mPFC (AP: +3.25-3.6mm; ML: 0.7-0.72mm; DV: -5.5mm) spanning the infralimbic cortex (IL), prelimbic cortex (PL) and cingulate cortex (CG). An i.p. injection of the anti-inflammatory dexamethasone (1mg/kg) and a local s.c. injection of the anesthetic Xylocaine 2% with adrenaline into the scalp was given prior to incision. Stainless steel screws (1.1mm diameter) were placed in the skull contralateral to the probe target location and across the skull for support. A further screw was placed overlying the cerebellum for a ground/reference site and Metabond (Sun Medical, Japan) was applied over all screws. Next, a ~1.5 x 1.5mm craniotomy window was drilled into the skull for probe implantation. For a subset of animals (n=4) an automatic micromanipulator (IVM Mini Single, Scientifica, UK) was used to lower the probe into the brain at a speed of 0.2μm/s with manual lowering at a similar speed in the remaining animals. Once implanted, Vaseline was applied to cover the craniotomy and the remaining exposed shank of the probe. Dental acrylic with gentamycin antibiotic (DePuy Synthes, USA) was applied in a first layer over the surface of the skull, with further dental acrylic (Simplex rapid, Kemdent, UK) used for the remainder of the implant construction. A copper mesh cone encircling the implant was cemented around the surface of the skull with a ~3cm end of a falcon tube cemented on top to contain and protect the electrodes and headstage. The cerebellar skull screw was connected to the shorted reference/ground on the Neuropixels probe and to the copper mesh cone via silver wires. A Neuropixels headstage was then connected to the probe and cemented to the side of the falcon tube before the lid was screwed on to protect the implant. An i.p. injection of the analgesic buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) was given post-surgery.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Task protocol</title><p id="P33">An average of 13±4 days after surgery, rats were trained on an operant task. Training lasted for 6-7 days, outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>. After rats were trained, they received an injection of either COMP360 (Compass Pathways’ investigational formulation of synthesized crystalline polymorph psilocybin) or vehicle (saline) counterbalanced across animals, with a 14-day washout period prior to receiving the alternative injection. Psilocybin was dissolved in saline at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. The drug and vehicle were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered at a volume of 1 ml/kg in counterbalanced order across rats. The 0.3mg/kg dose was the focus of this study. It was chosen because it approximates the therapeutic dose used in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Goodwin et al., 2022</xref>) and has been shown to be effective at long-term modulation of affective memory in a rat translational model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hinchcliffe et al., 2024</xref>).

In all cases two rats were run through the protocol within the same day (one morning, one afternoon) with recordings starting at approximately the same time for each rat across days. All recordings were performed between 08:00-18:00, with drug injections between 09:00-10:00 for rats recorded in the morning, and 14:00-15:00 for rats recorded in the afternoon.

A single LFP channel from each brain region was selected for further analyses (except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, where all LFP channels were assessed). The infralimbic LFP channel was selected as the channel with the highest peak in 100Hz power within the infralimbic cortex (364±317μm [mean ± std] from the ventral boundary). Since recorded channels within the prelimbic cortex covered its entire dorsal-ventral boundary for all animals, the prelimbic LFP channel was selected from the approximate centre of the region (808±85μm from the ventral boundary). Since recorded channels within the cingulate cortex did not cover the entire dorsal-ventral boundary for all animals, the cingulate LFP channel was selected as the highest channel above the ventral boundary which was in an equivalent location across all animals (284±38μm from the ventral boundary).</p><p id="P38">For the spike data, a common average reference was applied across all channels.

To examine how psilocybin impacts network MSD during rest and task blocks, we pairwise averaged the MSD values across the two post-injection blocks into one common post-drug MSD distribution. This was performed separately for rest and task blocks. Next, to account for the variability in baseline MSD distributions across rats, we z-scored the pre-drug distribution for each rat to have zero mean and unit variance. We also transformed the post-drug distribution for each rat, by subtracting the mean of the corresponding original pre-drug distribution from the post-drug distribution, which is further scaled by the standard deviation of the original pre-drug distribution. We then pooled the respective MSD values across rats into a single MSD distribution.

Boxplots show mean, median, 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles. LFP data is shown as an average across animals, single unit data is shown as an average across units. Changes in comparison to baseline were obtained by dividing the average post-injection values by the average baseline values for both drug and saline, conducted separately for rest and task conditions. The change after psilocybin was then divided by the change after saline to calculate percent differences between conditions. Depending on the data type, distributions, and variance, comparisons between saline and psilocybin were assessed using either parametric or non-parametric tests, including all three drug conditions (saline, 0.3mg/kg, and 1mg/kg psilocybin) where possible. Differences in behaviour, power density, and coherence were assessed with either a one-way anova (ANOVA1), two-way anova (ANOVA2), a repeated measures anova (RM-ANOVA), or a generalised linear model (GLM). Differences in single unit data were assessed with either a Scheirer-Ray-Hare test (SRH), a Kruskal-Wallis test (KW), a permutation test (PT), or a Chi-squared test (chisq). In all cases, if the test was significant, this was followed by a post-hoc pairwise comparison test (paired and unpaired T-test or Wilcoxon signed rank and rank sum test) followed by a Bonferroni correction (BC) for multiple comparisons. Since analyses of LFP data including power density and coherence analyses involves testing a substantial number of frequency variables (from 0 to 200Hz at 0.25Hz resolution), BC was not applied. Instead, a partial Bonferroni correction was used. For this, a principal component analysis was applied to the variable of interest and the number of output principal components that explained over 95% of the variance in the data was used as an the alpha correction factor, as previously described (i.e. α=0.05/number of principle components explaining &gt;95% variance; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Scholtens et al., 2014</xref>)). Since the MSD and LZ complexity analyses were comprised of a large number of replicates with widespread significance, Cohens d was additionally calculated to gain insight into the strength of the statistical significance. Data from four rats were used in all analyses with data from the additional two rats used wherever possible (N=4 for all figures, unless otherwise stated).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures 1-8 and Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS202050-supplement-Supplemental_Figures_1_8_and_Table_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d107aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a Wellcome Senior Research Fellowship in Basic Biomedical Science (202810/Z/16/Z), a BBSRC ‘Cognitive computational neuroscience’ award (BB/X013243/1) and by Compass Pathways.

probe into the medial prefrontal cortex (N=6 rats). Initial training sessions lasted for 1h: two 15min task blocks with the house light on and nose poke holes open, interleaved with two 15min rest blocks with the house light off and nose poke holes closed. On the first training day (day -7), ~0.2ml of 30% sucrose solution liquid reward was dispensed automatically every 60s during the task block. On days -6/-5 a fixed ratio of one nose poke for one reward was applied. On days -4 to -1 animals performed the full operant task with the reward released upon nose poke after a random interval between 7-53s. The order of rest/task blocks was also switched. Rats were tethered from day -5 onwards to acclimatise to the electrophysiological recoding setup. <bold>(B)</bold> On the first injection day (Day 0) rats completed a 30min baseline session comprised of a 15min rest and 15min operant task block. Rats were then injected i.p. with either 0.3mg/kg psilocybin or saline vehicle (counterbalanced across animals), and again completed another operant task session with one initial 15min rest block (to account for initial drug effects) followed by a further four 15min blocks of alternating rest and task epochs (total 1hour 15min). Recordings were repeated on days 1, 2 and 6 with a 1h block of the operant task. 14 days after the first injection, rats received the alternative psilocybin/saline injection, and the protocol was repeated. A further 14 days after this, rats received a 1mg/kg injection of psilocybin, and the protocol was repeated. <bold>(C)</bold> Behavioural activity during day of injection.

The possible 3-bit binary states, where 0 (light-orange) represents no spikes in the time bin, and 1 (dark-orange) represents spiking. The axes represent the binary values of the individual neurons. The system of neural network (dark-grey ball) transitions from one state to another with time. (i, right) The MSD is a Euclidean jump distance between any two network states over a discrete time-step Δt. It is the squared difference between the network states at time t and t + Δt, averaged 〈.〉 over the number of neurons. (ii) The temporal dynamics of network is shown as consecutive 3-bit states at discrete time points, t<sub>1</sub> to t<sub>n</sub>, derived from the time-binning (Δt) of the units’ spike activities. At every time point, an average MSD of the network transitions over next 1 second is computed. This provides a distribution of MSDs as the statistical characteristics of network transitions across the entire time duration. MSD distributions centred on lower values reflect restricted state transitions, while higher values indicate relatively free network state transitions. (iii) Schematic descriptions of the potential energy landscapes, E<sub>p</sub>, for the low and high MSD distributions are shown. Shallower landscapes (left) require less activation energy leading to more frequent state transitions (light grey arrow) and a high MSD distribution. The network activity (dark-grey ball) that is sitting in a deep basin of attraction (right) requires large activation energy, E<sub>a</sub>, to jump to neighbouring states, causing less-frequent transitions (dark grey arrow) and low MSD distribution. <bold>(B)</bold> MSD from all single units across pre- and post-injection rest blocks for each drug condition, indicating a decrease in MSD (more restricted transitions) under psilocybin. <bold>(C)</bold> Change in MSD from pre- to post-injection rest blocks (left) and task blocks (right), across drug conditions, indicating a dose-dependent decrease in MSD with psilocybin. <bold>(D)</bold> LZ complexity from all single units across pre- and post-injection rest blocks for each drug condition. <bold>(E)</bold> Change in LZ complexity from pre- to post-injection rest blocks (left) and task blocks (right), across drug conditions, indicating a decrease in LZ complexity with psilocybin (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) in both rest and task contexts.
