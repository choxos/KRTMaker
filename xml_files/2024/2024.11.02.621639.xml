These functions are closely linked to their precise gene expression regulation. Somatic stem cells exhibit a unique signature marked by high ribosome biogenesis and low protein synthesis rates, a feature that is implicated in driving their stemness independently of cellular proliferation, cell cycle or total mRNA content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> The low translation rates of stem cells are largely governed by suppressing mTOR activity, which directly phosphorylates and inactivates the translational repressor eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> Lower mTOR signaling and protein synthesis rates are associated with enhanced longevity, indicating a protective role of low protein turnover in aging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup></p><p id="P3">As stem cells become activated, mTOR signaling acts as an important nexus to coordinate the differentiation program, with subsequent increases in overall protein synthesis rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> A tight regulation of the protein synthesis machinery is thereby essential for stem cell function, as demonstrated in hematopoietic stem cells, where both reduced or elevated protein synthesis rates impair engraftment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> However, how exactly the cellular processes during aging shape the translational landscape of stem cells and how these changes impact their regenerative capacity remains poorly understood.</p><p id="P4">Ribosome profiling enables the monitoring of translational landscapes and has transformed our understanding of post-transcriptional control across diverse cellular contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> The technique is based on the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected fragments and provides a global snapshot of actively translating ribosomes at single-codon resolution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> Nevertheless, a major drawback of ribosome profiling remained until recently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> its need for large numbers of cells, limiting its application to study cellular heterogeneity or rare cell types like stem cells in their native environment. The systematic exploration of the translational landscape of stem cells requires an efficient <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue isolation strategy that rapidly blocks ribosomal elongation, coupled with a scalable single-cell ribosome profiling strategy to monitor tissue-wide translation.</p><p id="P5">Here, we present an <italic>in vivo</italic> single-cell ribosome profiling strategy for the mouse epidermis to comprehensively monitor tissue-wide alterations in the translational landscape during aging. Building on the elegant, recently reported single-cell ribosome profiling protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, we introduced several critical modifications. Importantly, we implemented a rapid cell isolation process under conditions of ribosomal elongation inhibition and switched to the conventional RNase I-based ribonuclease for generating ribosomal footprints, as commonly utilized in bulk ribosome profiling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> Compared to the <italic>Micrococcal Nuclease</italic> (MNase) used in the original protocol, which cleaves following guanine bases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, the standard RNase I lacks any nucleotide bias, resulting in true ribosome-protected fragments of 29-30 nucleotides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> RNase I-based ribosome profiling therefore facilitates a straightforward evaluation of triplet periodicity, a hallmark feature of high-quality data, as it reflects the ribosome’s movement codon by codon. Consequently, using RNase I eliminates the need for complex machine learning approaches to correct for MNase’s sequence bias, circumventing the risk of overfitting the data. Our study substantially broadens the applicability of single-cell ribosome profiling, offers a scalable strategy for tissue-wide <italic>in vivo</italic> monitoring of translational landscapes at single-cell resolution and uncovers cell-type-specific translational programs in aging.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>An RNase I-based <italic>in vivo</italic> single-cell ribosome profiling strategy</title><p id="P6">To develop an <italic>in vivo</italic> single-cell ribosome profiling strategy for the mouse epidermis, we built upon the previously reported single-cell protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, which leverages a miniature one-pot reaction facilitated by a low-volume liquid handler system. We modified two key aspects. First, to enable efficient <italic>in vivo</italic> translation elongation inhibition, we injected high-dose cycloheximide (CHX) into the mouse tail vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The rapid translation elongation inhibition of mouse organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> enables us to prepare epidermal cells by accelerated enzymatic and mechanical isolation and generate single-cell suspensions under continuous submersion in cycloheximide. We then sorted viable epidermal single cells into 384-well plates pre-filled with polysome buffer, where cells are immediately lyzed.</p><p id="P7">Second, we considered the advantages of conventional RNase I-based ribonuclease treatment for generating ribosomal footprints, as typically utilized in bulk ribosome profiling. To establish an RNase I-based single-cell ribosome profiling protocol, we first adjusted the ribonuclease digestion stop reaction of the original protocol (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>) and tested the classic RNase I concentrations used to generate bulk ribosome profiling libraries (0.5-2 U/μg RNA). We then generated single-cell ribosome profiling libraries and evaluated the corresponding metagene plots. Surprisingly, neither conventional RNase I nor T1 ribonuclease concentrations, occasionally also used in bulk ribosome profiling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, resulted in triplet periodicity or start peak accumulation and instead showed substantial reads in the 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-C</xref>), a feature of incomplete ribonuclease digestion. We subsequently increased the RNase I and T1 concentrations. Increasing the concentration of ribonucleases up to 10x did not noticeably resolve the reads in the 3’UTR. However, while increasing the RNase I to 100x (50 U/μg RNA) began to decrease the proportion of 3’UTR reads, using 1000x (500 U/μg RNA) of the standard RNase I concentration generated a start codon peak and remarkably clean 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). Surprised by the necessity for such high RNase I concentrations, we evaluated the 1000x concentration by comparing it to the standard units per RNA input (U/μg RNA) and the unit concentration in the lysate (U/μl). We found that the ribonuclease concentration used in bulk ribosome profiling closely aligns with the 1000x conditions (0.2 U/μl vs. 0.05-0.1 U/μl used in bulk) applied in our 50 nl one-pot reaction. These results indicate that low-input ribosome profiling samples should prioritize overall enzyme concentration as opposed to relying on enzyme units per RNA input.</p><p id="P8">Using our optimized RNase I-based <italic>in vivo</italic> ribosome profiling strategy, we then set out to systematically monitor the translational landscape of the mouse epidermis. Several lines of evidence indicate that our single-cell ribosome profiling data represent <italic>bona fide</italic> translation. First, similar to bulk ribosome profiling, we observed clearly reduced fractions of 5’UTR and 3’UTR reads compared to total RNA sequencing, reflecting translation across the coding sequence, with varying levels of upstream and downstream open reading frames<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-C</xref>). Second, employing RNase I, we found a fragment length distribution comparable to bulk ribosome profiling, with a distinct peak at 29 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). The main ribosome-protected fragment lengths of 28-30 nucleotides showed the classic P site offset (distance from 5’ end to P site) of 12 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1D</xref>). Third, our data showed a strong start peak, reflecting the efficient inhibition of translation elongation by cycloheximide but not 40S scanning and translation initiation during the single-cell suspension preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2D</xref>). Fourth, by examining the hallmark feature indicative of true translation, we observed an excellent triplet periodicity throughout the entire coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-F</xref>). This was also evident when evaluating diverse cell types, including stem cell populations or skin-resident immune cells such as T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C, S3C</xref>). Importantly, when zooming into single cells, detected strong triplet periodicity within single epidermal cells, considering the footprint lengths ranging from 26-34 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G-H</xref>).</p><p id="P9">As expected, we observed the most defined triplet periodicity when considering only the classic footprint lengths of 28-31 nucleotides, which yielded more sparse but even cleaner periodicity patterns in the heatmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A</xref>). Furthermore, we also found excellent periodicity in single cells upstream of the stop codon, underscoring <italic>bona fide</italic> translation across the complete coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A, S2D</xref>). Collectively, the assessment of the ribosome profiling quality suggests that our RNase I-based <italic>in vivo</italic> approach is ready to investigate tissue-wide <italic>in vivo</italic> translational landscapes (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cell-type-specific translational landscapes of the young epidermis</title><p id="P10">To determine translational changes in aging, we next sought to monitor the translational landscapes of young (2 months) and old (22-26 months) mouse epidermis, following the distinct morphological changes that occur in the skin during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-E</xref>). After rRNA removal and filtering out cells with low unique molecular identifier (UMI, cutoff of 100) counts, we retained 1068 young and 939 old epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and cell-type specific marker genes, we could identify the main cell types present in the epidermis, including epidermal stem cells, suprabasal cells, bulge stem cells, upper hair follicle cells, T cells, melanocytes as well as macrophages and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, F-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A-B</xref>). We first focused on the young epidermis. To showcase the coverage and cells uniquely translating marker genes, we selected 9 single cells, which exhibited excellent coverage across the whole coding sequence of cluster-defining marker genes. Cells 1 and 2 predominantly translated <italic>Krt14,</italic> an EpSC marker, clearly distinct from the differentiated suprabasal cells 5 and 6, translating <italic>Krt10.</italic> Cells 3 and 4 expressed <italic>Krt14</italic> and G2/M markers such as <italic>Top2a</italic>. Furthermore, cells 7 and 8 translated the upper hair follicle marker <italic>Krt79</italic>, one residing in the basal layer (<italic>Krt14</italic>-positive) and the other in the suprabasal layer (<italic>Krt10</italic>-positive). The macrophage in track 9 specifically exhibited footprints in <italic>Cd74.</italic> The housekeeping gene <italic>Actb</italic> was ubiquitously translated across these 9 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>). Collectively, these results highlight the sensitivity and specificity of our established <italic>in vivo</italic> single-cell ribosome profiling approach.</p><p id="P11">Overall, after genome alignment, we observed a duplicate-corrected UMI distribution with a median of 22,252 unique reads per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). However, rRNA and tRNA filtering, which constitute 75-80% of total reads, reduced the median UMI to 4,653 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). Due to the one-pot reaction used in the single-cell ribosome profiling protocol, which omits the footprint excision step, the footprint length distribution was broader than in bulk ribosome profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, as expected, applying the stringent footprint cutoff of 26-34 nucleotides to ensure accurate translation quantification, the median decreased further to 684 unique reads in young cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). Generally, we observed cell-type-specific differences in the distribution of unique reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2K</xref>). The stem cell population, such as epidermal stem cells (cluster 0, median of 500 unique reads) and bulge stem cells (cluster 4, median of 349 unique reads), exhibited low read counts compared to for example differentiated suprabasal cells (cluster 1, median of 810 unique reads). These differences were also evident when assessing the cell-type-specific differences in the triplet periodicity heatmaps, with a sparse signal in single epidermal stem cells of cluster 0, despite the clear triplet periodicity when aggregating all epidermal stem cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2C, 1F</xref>). Interestingly, a subpopulation of epidermal stem cells (cluster 3, median unique reads of 2583) and epidermal stem cells in the G2/M cell cycle phases (cluster 5, median unique reads of 1834) exhibited high read counts. This difference was not due to higher sequencing saturation in clusters 3 and 5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D</xref>). The relative contribution of cluster 3 within epidermal stem cells was diminished in aged skin (0.31 in young vs. 0.067 in old).</p><p id="P12">We reasoned that, beyond potential technical factors, unique read counts on the same plate capture the differences in translation rates across different cell types. Somatic stem cells, such as epidermal stem cells or bulge stem cells, are known to exhibit low overall protein synthesis rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> Our read count observations thus suggested that the stem cell populations in the epidermis exhibit lower translation rates than differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2K</xref>). Using O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) incorporation and immunofluorescence of the mouse skin, we confirmed that suprabasal cells overall exhibited 1.75 times higher protein synthesis rates compared to epidermal stem cells (matching the median UMI difference of 810 vs. 500 in suprabasal vs. epidermal stem cells), in line with low unique read counts representing low translation rates of epidermal stem cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The epidermal stem cell compartment is known to encompass a heterogeneous subpopulation, with <italic>Krt10</italic> as one of the earliest markers for differentiation-committed stem cells, preceding delamination and downregulation of epidermal stemness genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> Delaminating cells therefore transition through a <italic>Krt10</italic>-positive state, retaining a limited capacity for cell division.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> We therefore examined the potential stem cell commitment within the epidermal stem cell population in more detail. In line with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, we found that 32.9% of cluster 3 and 16.0% of cluster 0 epidermal stem cells were <italic>Krt10</italic>-positive, indicating that they not only store <italic>Krt10</italic> mRNA but actively synthesize KRT10 protein in epidermal stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L-M</xref>). A small fraction of <italic>Krt10</italic>-positive epidermal stem cells remained actively proliferating, with 18.2% of the G2/M epidermal stem cell cluster translating <italic>Krt10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2M</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that a subset of epidermal stem cells is committed to differentiation, with active KRT10 translation, while retaining a capacity for cell division.</p><p id="P14">Previous studies in the hair follicle have shown that increasing translation rates correlated with stem cell commitment and differentiation rather than proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> We then asked whether <italic>Krt10</italic>-positive differentiation-committed epidermal stem cells exhibited altered unique read count distribution compared to <italic>Krt10</italic>-negative cells. While <italic>Krt10</italic>-positive cells in epidermal stem cell cluster 3 did not exhibit a significant difference in read counts, <italic>Krt10</italic>-positive cells in clusters 0 and 5 (G2M) showed significantly increased unique read counts as well as a higher number of detected genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2O</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4F</xref>). We observed no concomitant increase in <italic>Krt5</italic> or <italic>Krt14</italic> marker gene reads in <italic>Krt10</italic>-positive cells, indicating that <italic>Krt10</italic> detection is not due to a general increase in read counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4G</xref>). These observations suggest that stem cell commitment at least partly correlates with increased unique read counts, in line with a boost in translation rates during differentiation commitment. Collectively, our findings reveal heterogeneity in the epidermal stem cell population, with subpopulations exhibiting differences in both differentiation commitment and translation rates.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> translational efficiencies during differentiation</title><p id="P15">Next, we examined cell-type-specific translational efficiencies (TE, defined by ribosome profiling reads/ RNA sequencing reads). Similar to the single-cell ribosome profiling experiments, we collected the epidermis of young (2 months) and aged mice (22-26 months) and generated integrated parallel single-cell RNA sequencing libraries. After stringent filtering, we identified a total of 15,873 cells representing the major cell types of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B-D</xref>). We then explored the translational efficiencies of each cell type by determining the reads in the coding sequence in single-cell ribosome profiling divided by the transcript reads in single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Zooming into the top TE genes in the young epidermis, we observed that the mitochondrial chain complex I and IV genes were enriched among the most efficiently translated genes in epidermal stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-E</xref>). This was in contrast to suprabasal cells, which exhibited high TE of focal adhesion and lysosomal lumen genes. Furthermore, T cells showed high TE in T cell receptor genes and macrophages in granule and lysosomal membrane genes such as <italic>Cd74</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D-E</xref>).

The strong enrichment of AP-1 subunits was also reflected in the enriched gene ontology terms of the TE-high genes, which were dominated by the sequence-specific DNA binding of AP-1 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F-G</xref>). Of note, AP-1 subunits were among the most translationally repressed genes in young epidermal stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting a partial derepression in aging.
