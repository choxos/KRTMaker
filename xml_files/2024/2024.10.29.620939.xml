However, apart from the most commonly studied PTMs, large-scale analysis is still very challenging, limiting our understanding of various cellular processes. PTM-bearing peptides often enriched by antibodies, followed by unbiased mass spectrometry (MS)-based readout of hundreds or thousands of sites. To extend the reach of this powerful technology to in vivo and ex vivo studies with small protein starting amounts, we here developed EasyAb, a streamlined and high throughput MS workflow for antibody-based PTM profiling. Using epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell systems, we demonstrate that EasyAb increases sensitivity and enables multiple large-scale systems-level studies. Furthermore, EasyAb resolves in vivo brain G protein-coupled receptor-mediated tyrosine kinase activation and reveals the long elusive hypothalamic neuron-specific leptin signaling architecture.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F5" position="anchor"><label>Graphical Abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS199825-f005"/></fig>

PTM of proteins lead to rapid changes in their activity, interaction, and localization. This is especially important for the control of cellular functions that needs to respond to abrupt fluctuations of nutrient levels on a seconds-scale to daily basis. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Humphrey et al., 2015</xref>). Despite their crucial function, there are relatively few comprehensive PTM profiling studies available from tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bennett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hoffman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Labots et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Lundby et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Sathe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Yi et al., 2018</xref>), which is mainly due to limited amounts of sample and lack of sensitive sample preparation workflows. Improving on these limitations would have major implication in our basic understanding of disease such as cancer, diabetes, obesity etc. that are driven by complex PTM network changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Fan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Humphrey <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). As a prominent example of interest to our groups, the landscape of leptin regulated phosphotyrosine changes at the hypothalamic arcuate nuclei is central in obesity but is still not defined due to technological challenges. Identification of leptin regulated novel targets at the hypothalamus could shed light on key players in energy metabolism in the brain, potentially contributing to new therapeutically relevant approaches. More generally, insights into the dysregulated complex PTM networks of disease such as diabetes, obesity, cancer and drug abuse from animals and human samples are invaluable to understand the underlying cellular processes involved.</p><p id="P4">Advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics can now quantify PTMs at increasing depth and speed, enabling unprecedented systems-level views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bekker-Jensen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hogrebe et al., 2018</xref>). We previously described EasyPhos, a high-throughput TiO2 based phosphopeptide enrichment method, which allowed elucidation of systems-wide and temporally resolved <italic>in vivo</italic> action of insulin in liver tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hoffman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Humphrey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Humphrey et al., 2018</xref>). However, the liver is a relatively large organ and advances such as µPhos workflow can now enable to assess phosphoproteome of small organs or tissues invitro and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Oliinyk et al., 2024</xref>). Furthermore, phospho-serine and phosphothreonine can be efficiently captured by chemical matrices such as TiO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Humphrey <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Larsen et al., 2005</xref>), but most other proteomic PTM workflows typically require complex and cumbersome antibody (Ab) enrichment of the PTM-containing peptides prior to MS analysis. This often demands high protein input (generally 10-20 mg) especially for label free quantification approaches, requires multiple buffer exchanges, takes several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abe et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Rikova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">van der Mijn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Xu et al., 2010</xref>), and often results in significant amount of peptide loss and inconsistent data quantification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S 1A-C</xref>). This constitutes a barrier to the application of Ab-based PTM proteomics, especially to animal or clinical studies for signaling pathway elucidation, targeted drug development, novel biomarkers identification, and drug response monitoring.</p><p id="P5">The workflows used so far applied conventional cell lysis and digestion protocols with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), urea, or guanidinium hydrochloride (Gdmcl) buffers which tend to be laborious and preclude direct coupling of digestion to enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Lundby et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Scholz et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, the incompatibility of lysis (irrespective of label free or chemical labelling approaches), digestion and enrichment buffers currently necessitate multiple buffer exchanges that introduce sample loss, variation in quantitation and extra handling steps. To overcome these challenges, we here develop EasyAb, an approach that permits rapid (one-day), cost-effective, and in-depth quantification of PTM bearing peptides in a high-throughput manner. Our one-step digestion-to-enrichment workflow circumvents multiple buffer exchange, time consuming and expensive strategies involving peptide fractionation or multiplexing the samples by chemical labelling to boost peptide identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gajadhar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Lamoliatte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Rose et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Udeshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Our strategy collapses many steps of earlier workflows, limiting sample loss and enabling high-throughput <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> applications in order to gain insights into biological processes that were previously inaccessible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In proof-of-principle experiments we show EasyAb applications with antibodies targeting acetylation, monomethyl arginine, and tyrosine phosphorylated peptides. We benchmark EasyAb sensitivity using the well-characterized EFG stimulated EGFR receptor signaling in mammalian cells and demonstrate the superiority of EasyAb in comparison to existing workflows. We display the utility of the higher throughput of EasyAb in diverse biological areas such as time resolved analysis of EGFR activated targets and in the elucidation of phosphotyrosine signatures in patient derived AML cells lines for identification of rewired kinases, drug targets, and pathway dependencies. Furthermore, to validate the <italic>ex vivo</italic> application of EasyAb we explore the landscape of FLT3 receptor signaling in AML patient samples. Using limiting amount of mouse brain samples, we resolve <italic>in vivo</italic> brain G protein-coupled receptor (KOR)-mediated tyrosine kinase activation upon treatment with aversion and non-aversion agonists. Finally, and most importantly, we elucidate the hypothalamic neuron-specific leptin signaling architecture, by producing the first <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphotyrosine leptin signaling map.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Development and benchmarking of the EasyAb workflow</title><p id="P7">Conventional Urea buffer and SDS buffer-based lysis demands protein precipitation and desalting prior to enrichment of PTM peptides, which contributes to 30-40% loss of sample amounts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplement figure 1A-C</xref>). Sodium deoxycholate (SDC) based buffers are compatible with both lysis and protease digestion conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Yu et al., 2003</xref>). It enhances the activity of trypsin, increases the number of protein identification and facilitates the recovery of hydrophobic peptides compared to other digestion buffers such as SDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Masuda et al., 2008</xref>). Thus they eliminate the need for protein precipitation or desalting chromatography, one of the major steps of protein loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Humphrey <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kulak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>). Conventional immunoprecipitation buffers such as RIPA contains SDC; however, the buffer composition is not compatible with efficient protease digestion (due presence of NP40 and Triton X) and requires buffer exchanges and several washing steps to remove detergents prior to MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Scheerlinck et al., 2015</xref>). Further significant loss of protein amount occurs, we questioned whether with adjustment of SDC concentration and the pH of the lysate post protease enzymatic digestion, the same buffer would be amenable to Ab-enrichment as well, thus eliminating the need for desalting and buffer exchanges (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D-G</xref>, for development and optimization. Of note, the PTM antibodies binds to modified sites by recognizing motifs on protein and peptide). Furthermore, we wanted to establish a simplified protocol that can be easily adapted to a high throughput 96 well format (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). Here we optimized a one-step digestion-to-enrichment workflow and named it EasyAb. Using this simplified protocol dramatically reduces the required starting material, the time required for sample processing to less than one day, and is highly cost effective. With antibodies conjugated to magnetic beads EasyAb is adaptable to a 96-well plate format for parallel processing and reduction of experimental error.</p><p id="P8">As proof-of-principle experiments, we benchmarked our developed EasyAb workflow against the conventional ones using 4%SDS or 6M Urea buffer for sample amounts and sensitivity. We preformed enrichment with well validated PTM antibodies targeting acetylation (AcK), monomethyl arginine (mem-R), and tyrosine phosphorylated (pY1000) in unperturbed Hela cell lysates prepared by either EasyAb or SDS workflow, and analyzed the modified peptides (at a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 1% in this study, Method section) by single run LC-MS/MS. We consistently found increased identification of post-translationally modified peptides in samples prepared by EasyAb when compared to samples prepared with SDS buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably this was detected using four-times less sample input amount (1mg vs 4mg). Thus, EasyAb should be generally applied to antibody based PTM workflows.</p><p id="P9">We next benchmarked EasyAb to Urea buffer workflow by comparing the tyrosine peptide enrichment depth using various amounts of EGF stimulated Hela cell lysates. Here again we detected many fold increase in phosphotyrosine peptides using EasyAb compared to Urea workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D-E</xref>). Moreover, similar depth and sensitivity was achieved with fivefold less starting material compared to the conventional Urea method, which requires 10 mg for similar results. We highlighted the EGF receptor phosphorylation as an example of the sensitivity of EasyAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). This gain in the depth of coverage does not attribute to the impact of new series of Q-Exactive platforms since the MS samples prepared by conventional protocol were measured with the same setting and were still out performed by the sample prepared using the EasyAb workflow. Thus, the EasyAb protocol produces uncompromised depth of modified peptide coverage with several-fold reduced starting material and higher reproducibility between replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1H-I</xref>; R<sup>2</sup>= 0.87-0.98) compared to published protocols, suggesting that EasyAb should greatly improve performance of antibody-based enrichment (for details on the further optimization see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref>) prior to MS measurement.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>EasyAb enables in-depth tyrosine phosphoproteome analysis</title><p id="P10">Tyrosine phosphorylation comprises only 0.5-1% of total phosphorylation events in cells but plays a disproportionally important regulatory role in signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hunter, 2014</xref>). Antibody-based enrichment of tyrosine phosphopeptides from large amounts of cell or tissue samples has to almost universally employed to examine the tyrosine phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Lundby <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">van der Mijn <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). We applied our Easy-Ab workflow using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to diverse biological systems to examine its versatility <italic>in vitro, in vivo</italic> and ex <italic>vivo</italic> experiments and to gain insights into biological systems that were previously inaccessible.</p><p id="P11">First, we performed label free quantification in the AML cell lines Molm13 and MV4-11 harboring receptor FLT3 kinase internal tandem duplication mutation (FLT3-ITD). From just 2 mg starting material, we identified 4,416 phosphosites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A-B</xref>; for details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref>) with high reproducibility (FDR of less than 1%, Pearson correlation R<sup>2</sup> between 0.78-0.92) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F</xref>). In comparison to EasyAb, the protocol from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Abe et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Labots <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Tong et al., 2017</xref>) and our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>), took 4-5 days instead of one day; and in the latter case- at four or more times the material - only achieved half the phosphopeptide coverage. Other protocols in the literature required even larger amounts of materials and employed strategies like multiplexing sample materials through chemical labeling, pre or post-fractionation to achieve less than half of these numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Abe <italic>et al</italic>., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Batth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Boersema et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Tong <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">van Alphen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">van der Mijn <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Our deep coverage illuminates some previously less noticed aspects of this well studied system. For example, characterization of membrane protein PTMs has been more challenging due to issues in solubilization and enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Orsburn et al., 2011</xref>). Using EasyAb, over 40% of the quantified proteins were membrane or transmembrane proteins, with 30% of the sites previously unreported (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2H</xref>). We identified seven and quantified five phosphotyrosine sites in the FLT3 receptor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2I</xref>), including a novel pY401 site. Together, the FLT3 mutated cell presents phosphorylation of 31 tyrosine kinases and 14 phosphatases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2J</xref>), of which many of them (Btk, Syk, Abl, Src, and Ptpn11) were known target of FLT3-ITD signaling.</p><p id="P12">To illustrate the utility of EasyAb in quickly uncovering biological and drug related insights, we studied the Quizartinib-mediated response of mutant FLT3-ITD kinase receptor, a proven AML drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Daver et al., 2019</xref>). Quizartinib (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2K</xref>), a potent and highly specific mutant FLT3 kinase inhibitor, is promising in treating adults relapsed/refractory AML with the FLT3-ITD mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cortes et al., 2019</xref>) and we therefore examined Quizartinib induced global phosphotyrosine changes in the corresponding cell lines. In line with previous observations Quizartinib treatment significantly (t-test analysis, permutation based FDR &lt;0.05) decreased phosphorylation levels of FLT3-ITD kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Zarrinkar et al., 2009</xref>) and its downstream targets Stat5 and Mapk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hou et al., 2017</xref>). The inhibitor also dramatically downregulated phosphorylation on well-characterized targets of FLT3-ITD such as Syk, Btk, Gab2, Grb2, Ptpn11 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2L</xref>) thus attenuating FLT3-ITD kinase signaling. Pathway analysis of significantly regulated phosphoproteins reveals enrichment of “metabolism”, “apoptosis”, “response to stress”, and “cell cycle” highlighting the major cellular pathways rewired by FLT3-ITD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2M</xref>). At the site level we observed dynamically decreased phosphorylation of Gsk3A (Y279) and Lair1 (Y281), revealing critical inhibitory mechanisms of apoptosis hijacked by FLT3-ITD kinase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2L</xref>). The deep phosphoproteome also revealed novel links to TNK2 and STAT6 signaling (additional details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>) and uncovered new Quizartinib-responsive phosphosites that underlie pathway rewiring.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>EasyAb facilitates time-resolved EGFR signaling</title><p id="P13">We next assessed whether EasyAb is suitable for time-resolved analysis with reduced sample amounts. To demonstrate this on an extensively studied system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Blagoev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fang <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">van der Mijn <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), we stimulated Hela cells from a single petri dish (&lt;2 mg protein) with EGF (50ng/ml) for 0, 15 or 60 minutes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>).

In total, this resulted in the identification of 10,013 phospho-S/T/Ysites (including singly, doubly, and greater phosphopeptides species), ~80% of which were phosphotyrosine sites (all class-I sites, localization probability &gt;0.70). This is, the largest number of phosphotyrosine sites identified in a single cell type of myeloid origin under native condition so far (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Remarkably, about 1770 tyrosine sites were novel and about 18% lack known sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5 C,D</xref>).

Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a clear separation of cell lines and patient samples based on their phosphotyrosine profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This supports the notion that cell lines which are frequently used as in vitro models, do not entirely reflect the biology of primary patient samples, emphasizing the need for investigation of actionable drug targets directly on clinical samples. To this end, our AML patient sample cohort consisted of two prognostic genotypes FLT3WT (n=9) and FLT3ITD (n=5). As expected, greater number of phosphosites were quantified in mutant FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase samples (constitutively active state) compared to wild type receptor (endogenous inactive, unstimulated state; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5F</xref>). Two sample t-test analysis (FLT3WT vs FLT3ITD, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>) revealed regulation of &gt;500 sites (permutation-based FDR&lt;5%), including FLT3 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Several known signaling molecules among these includes STAT5, Syk, Btk, Gab2, Grb2, Ptpn11 as identified in the above FLT3-ITD cells lines. In addition, we identified differential tyrosine phosphorylation of 8 autophagy (e.g. ATG2B), 24 apoptosis, 30 cell cycle, 54 cell surface proteins (e.g. CD97, CD99L2), 13 DNA damage &amp; repair proteins, and 36 kinases (e.g. PTK2B, TYK2) in FLT3-ITD patients. Perhaps most interestingly, one of the key enriched pathways was ‘mRNA processing &amp; splicing’ in this dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). In many cancers including hematological malignancies splicing factors are commonly mutated leading to aberrant splicing that contributes to disease development and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lee and Abdel-Wahab, 2016</xref>). Here we discover differential phosphotyrosine regulation of mRNA splicing proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F,G</xref>) driven by an oncokinase. The functional significance of this novel regulatory mechanism in driving the cancer would be an interesting window into novel signaling mechanisms to explore.</p><p id="P16">The AML cell lines fell into three main clusters, indicating common footprints of phosphotyrosine signatures between them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A-C</xref>). Fisher’s exact test on kinase substrate motifs revealed strongest enrichment for Src kinase substrate motifs in cluster III followed by cluster II and cluster I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6D</xref>). Enriched Src kinase motifs were independent of Src tyrosine kinase expression levels suggesting that the activity of Src kinases is crucial. To validate this hypothesis, we treated the different clusters of cell lines with the Src kinase inhibitor Bosutinib, which confirmed that the cluster-III cell line MM6 was most sensitive to the Src kinase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6E</xref>). Conversely, the profiled cell lines harbor specific mutations, which could potentially drive novel tyrosine signaling. Mutation-specific changes included several known and novel key signaling molecules such as PDGFR (Y894), BTK (Y551), INNP5D (Y1022), and TAOK3 (Y429) tyrosine phosphorylated specific to cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>, for additional details and further characterization of the cell lines see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>In vivo brain GPCR phosphotyrosine signaling</title><p id="P17">To demonstrate <italic>in vivo</italic> applications, we next explored phosphotyrosine signaling in the brain. G protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) signaling, such as kappa opioid receptor (KOR) mediate neurotransmitter metabotropic signaling is essential in neuronal plasticity and functions. Activation of KOR by “G-protein-biased” agonists alleviates pain without eliciting unwanted aversion or hallucination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">White et al., 2015</xref>). We recently dissected this signaling system is a large-scale study resulting in the temporal and spatial distribution of tens of thousands of phosphosites. However, only about a hundred of these were pY sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Here, we applied EasyAb to tissues obtained from cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and medulla oblongata of a single animal (number of experimental animals, n=3 per group), which was sacrificed 5 minutes after administration of the saline control, U50,488H the aversive agonist, or 6’GNTI - the non-aversive agonist. Cortex had the most tyrosine phosphorylation sites and other regions progressively less in the order of cortex &gt; medulla oblongata &gt; hippocampus &gt; striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). PCA of each brain region revealed their own unique tyrosine phosphoproteomic signatures, much like their counterparts in the general phosphoproteome and proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>). Although brain region-specific tyrosine kinase expression level showed similar trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B,C</xref>), the expression levels of these kinases no longer correlated with the linear motifs of the most abundant tyrosine phosphopeptides in each region, further demonstrating that tyrosine kinases are more closely regulated than serine and threonine kinases in tissues. In addition, we observed region-specific perturbation of the tyrosine phosphoproteome by the aversive agonist U50, 488H that paralleled those of the general phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). In the cortex, the aversive agent U50, 488H and non-aversive one 6’GNTI each induced unique perturbations (ANOVA-significant) of the tyrosine phosphoproteome from the saline-treatment mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Linear kinase motifs of Jak2 and Src were both enriched in the ANOVA-significant sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>) with phosphopeptides containing Src motifs contributing to more than 40% of the total. This agrees with our previous observation that Src is dephosphorylated by U50, 488H but not 6’GNTI treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Fischer’s exact test of Src kinase substrates reveals categorical enrichment of both ‘ionotropic glutamate receptor activity’ and ‘coated vesicle’, indicating that the aversive KOR-mediated inactivation of Src influences glutamate signaling and neurotransmitter release through pY based mechanisms. To further validate this finding, we inhibited Src in vivo using PP2, a selective Src family kinases inhibitor (n=3 mice per group, 5mg/kg, 30 mins before saline or 6’GNTI). This confirmed that the non-aversive agonist 6’GNTI elicits Src kinase activity which is prevented upon PP2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p id="P18">In addition to Src substrates, we also found changes of phosphorylation states of the kinases Gsk3a/b (Y279/Y216), Dyrk2 (Y380) and Dyrk3 (Y368) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8A</xref>). Gsk3b is particularly interesting because it is involved in regulation of mTOR signaling a key finding in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>).

Obesity involves impaired leptin hormone signaling, which is central in effectively regulating food intake and body weight. Leptin acts on the hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons of the central nervous system, however, despite its key roles the targets of activated leptin receptor signaling are still ill defined at the systems level. Leptin mediated signaling in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus is even more challenging to elucidate, so that to our knowledge no systems-level signaling studies have been reported to date. Leptin activates the long form of the leptin receptor (LepRb), which is highly expressed in this major center governing food intake, body weight and energy metabolism. Activated LepRb signaling involves a cascade of known phosphotyrosine targets such as JAK2 tyrosine kinase and STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Banks et al., 2000</xref>). Here, we applied EasyAb to the hypothalamus of chow-fed C57Bl/6J mice that had received an intraperitoneal injection of vehicle or leptin (3 mg/kg body weight, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8C,D</xref>). Subsequent phosphotyrosine and proteome profiling identified 639 pY sites on 173 proteins (overall identified phosphosites 1104 on 247 proteins); in total 271 phosphosites containing pS/T/Y were quantified and 65 pY sites were significantly regulated (permutation-based FDR &lt;0.05. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>).</p><p id="P20">We directly observed LEPRb-Jak2 activation by quantitative changes in known leptin target sites such as the autophosphorylation site Y570 of Jak2 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gong et al., 2007</xref>) and Y699 of STAT5b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). We further quantified pY546 on Ptpn11, a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) involved in the regulation of LepR-Jak2 signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Li and Friedman, 1999</xref>). In addition to these known PTPs, we discovered regulation of the receptor Ptprf at the Jak2 substrate-binding site on Y1381, suggesting that Ptprf may act as a negative regulator of LepR-Jak2 signaling. Furthermore, we quantified non-canonical members of leptin signaling such as Jnk1 (Y185) and Jnk3 (Y223), whose involvement in response to high glucose levels has been reported in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">De Nigris et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Our phosphotyrosine signaling network revealed several novel connections between leptin signaling and other major signaling networks. Activation of the non-receptor tyrosine protein kinase Fyn promotes Jak2 independent of STAT3 signaling upon leptin stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Jiang et al., 2008</xref>). It is required in multiple cellular processes including brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Serpente et al., 1996</xref>) and axonal guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Morse et al., 1998</xref>), and is activated upon leptin stimulation at its autophosphorylation sites Y185 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Ferrando et al., 2012</xref>) and Y213 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kaspar and Jaiswal, 2011</xref>). In line with this, we found regulation of Fyn at Y214 and Catenin beta-1 (Ctnnb1) at Y489, a component of canonical Wnt signaling and a known Fyn kinase target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Piedra et al., 2003</xref>). As the deletion of ß-catenin improves glucose tolerance and resistance to high fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Elghazi et al., 2012</xref>), our data thus suggest an interplay between leptin-induced Fyn activation and beta-catenin Wnt signaling.</p><p id="P22">PSD95 was another interesting scaffold protein affected by leptin, phosphorylated on Y240 and Y580. We further observed leptin-simulated phosphorylation on PSD95 interacting partners Dlgap1 (Y75) and Dlgap3 (Y142 &amp; Y723). PSD95 contains a PDZ domain along with SH3 and guanylate kinase domains that are often found in anchoring proteins, and act as a signal integrator. PSD95 is known to interact with NMDA glutamate receptors and GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, PSD95 levels are known to be regulated by leptin and are implicated in neuronal signal transduction and brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Ramos-Lobo et al., 2019</xref>). We also observed leptin-induced phosphorylation of glutamate receptors Grin2b (Y1039) and Gpr37l1 (Y464) which are potential interacting partners of PSD95. Overall, these data suggest a trajectory of LEPRb-Jak2-driven phosphorylation events involving PSD95.</p><p id="P23">Another interesting connection is that of leptin with insulin and growth factor signaling. The membrane docking protein Sirpa is highly expressed in the brain and regulates growth factor as well as insulin tyrosine kinase receptor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Shen et al., 2009</xref>). Sirpa is a constitutive scaffolding protein for Jak2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Galbaugh et al., 2010</xref>) and upon tyrosine phosphorylation binds to multiple proteins including protein tyrosine kinase Ptk2b, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) and the PTPs Ptpn6 and Ptpn11(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Shen et al., 2010</xref>). We found Sirpa to be significantly regulated at pY505 following leptin stimulation, likely due to Jak2 activation. Phosphorylated Sirpa recruits Ptpn11 in complex with Jak2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Stofega et al., 2000</xref>) to induce phosphorylation of Ptpn11 at Y546, which could serve as a negative feedback mechanism through a gatekeeping role in the recruitment of Ptpn11 to the plasma membrane. Sirpa furthermore scaffolds with insulin like growth factor-1 to mediate Grb2-Pdk1 docking and Akt activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Shen <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Sirpa could thus serve as a potential link for an interaction of leptin and insulin signaling. Leptin-induced tensin 1 (Tns1) phosphorylation at Y954 and Tensin 2 (Tns2) phosphorylation at Y483 is another potential point of interplay between hypothalamic insulin and leptin action that emerges from our data. Functional tensin enzyme activity was shown to be regulated by Jak2, and is a prerequisite for the activation of Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Jung et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P24">We also found increased phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor 1 receptor (Fgfr1), a major regulator of metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Suh et al., 2014</xref>), at Y653. In rodents, the activation of hypothalamic FGF1R by a single intracerebroventricular injection of FGF1 was able to induce the sustained remission of diabetic hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Brown et al., 2019</xref>).
