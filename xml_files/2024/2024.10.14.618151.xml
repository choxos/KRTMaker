Here we identify two independently active tripeptide pharmacophores within PEPITEM and engineered peptidomimetics with enhanced pharmacodynamic properties. These peptidomimetics regulate T-cell trafficking <italic>in vitro</italic> and reduce T-cell, neutrophil and macrophage numbers in the inflamed peritoneal cavity in <italic>vivo.</italic> In a plaque psoriasis model, topical administration reduced disease severity, inflammation and immune cell infiltration, while regulating cytokine release in macrophages and fibroblasts, as well as keratinocyte proliferation. Th1 and Th17 cell abundance, along with their cytokines, was reduced in secondary lymphoid organs. This expanded functional repertoire of PEPITEM and its derivatives provides innovative tools for countering immune and stromal cell-induced pathology in IMIDs, paving the way for a novel class of anti-inflammatory agents.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Despite substantial therapeutic innovation over the past two decades, immune mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) represent an area of inadequately controlled morbidity and mortality. These disorders, which include common autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), lupus and psoriasis (and many others) require a range of immunomodulatory agents from chemical drugs through to synthetic biologic agents as standard of care therapies across the disease spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Although this results in polypharmacy for many patients, there remains significant unmet need. Biologics, and many of the first line therapies used for less severe disease are disadvantaged by serious side effects (e.g. serious infections, and malignancies), often associated with systemic immune suppression, which is a major drawback of targeting pro-inflammatory mediators and their downstream pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Moreover, there is no curative treatment to restore full control of the immune system, and currently, there are no therapeutics which rebuild, or reverse tissue damage caused by inflammation. Response rates to therapy are not durable. For example, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy in RA is effective in approximately 60% of patients and this is reduced to 20% after 2 years due to primary nonresponse, secondary non-response or intolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Moreover, few therapies achieve disease remission, which has an impact on patient adherence to prescribed treatments. This also means that current therapeutic approaches universally fail to impose control over homeostatic processes required for tissue regeneration and subsequent resolution of the inflammatory insult.</p><p id="P5">Chronic inflammation is an underlying causative factor in the pathology of all IMIDs. However, inflammation is ordinarily an acute, tightly regulated physiological response to injury, trauma or infection that is necessary to heal damaged tissues. The desired outcomes of the inflammatory response are thus sterilisation (if required), removal of the initiating trigger and repair of the affected tissues and organs, with ideally, their return to homeostatic function. As part of this process, we now know that there are specific pro-resolution pathways that have evolved to achieve this, for example specialised pro-resolving lipid mediators such as the protectins and resolvins and the induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>’<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, we now appreciate that chronic inflammation does not only represent a prolonged over activity of pro-inflammatory mediators at the site of disease, it also encompasses loss of function of pro-resolution pathways. An example of just such a scenario is the PEPITEM (PEPtide Inhibitor of Trans-Endothelial Migration) pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. PEPITEM is a 14 amino acid (AA) peptide (SVTEQGAELSNEER), proteolytically excised from 14.3.3. zeta/delta (14.3.3. ζδ) protein and secreted by B-lymphocytes during an inflammatory response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. PEPITEM has powerful regulatory functions in the inflammatory response, where it operates to limit the number of pro-inflammatory effector T-cells and macrophages that traffic to tissues under inflammatory conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The PEPITEM pathway undergoes a process of functional decline during human ageing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, possibly associated with lifestyle choices such as obesity 7, and this is strongly association with the acquisition of chronic diseases (IMIDs) such as type-1 diabetes and RA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Studies in animal models of disease show that provision of exogenous peptide by injection can reduce inflammation and disease scores in Sjogren’s Syndrome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, uveitis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, ischaemic disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>; bacterial infectious disease [salmonella infection] <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> kidney disease associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, obesity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and ageing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Thus, it is possible that the loss of PEPITEM function and its homeostatic activity in the inflammatory response is common to many IMIDs, and its replacement at an early stage of the disease process could alter the progression and severity of symptoms across a wide range of diseases with differing aetiologies.</p><p id="P6">The use of peptides such as PEPITEM for therapeutic intervention in disease can be problematic. The cut off for renal clearance of plasma borne molecules is in the order of 50kDa, resulting in rapid clearance of small peptides (e.g., PEPITEM -MW 1.549kDa) from the blood by the kidneys <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, many peptides are subject to enzymatic degradation by circulating peptidases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. To overcome such barriers, peptides can be modified to increase molecular weight or alter resistance to peptidase attack. These changes are part of a wider strategy to improve the characteristics of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) to optimise the pharmacokinetics of the peptide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Here we undertook an optimisation programme to improve the pharmacokinetics of PEPITEM and we tested new pharmacophores and peptidomimetics using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models of inflammation. To model efficacy in an IMID we have used topical application of PEPITEM to the skin to intervene in a model of plaque psoriasis. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease of the skin in which environmental triggers initiate hyperplastic proliferation of cells in the epidermis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. These cells release powerful inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, with the IL-23/IL-17 axis thought to play a dominant role in disease progression and severity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Disease can be managed using topical and/or systemic treatments that are anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative or immune suppressive, with the limitations due to side effects already outlined above <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Here we show that topical application of PEPITEM, its pharmacophores and the peptidomimetics derived from the parent sequences have powerful disease modifying actions in psoriatic disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Design and synthesis of peptides and peptide mimetics</title><p id="P7">Peptides sequences identified in house, or peptidomimetics designed by Medsyndesign Ltd, Loughborough, UK) were synthesised using standard solid peptide synthesis chemistry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and purified &gt;95% by HPLC by Biosynth Laboratories Ltd.

The synthesis of peptides and their mimetics for optimising ADME characteristics is expensive and time consuming and working with the smallest sequence that retains all relevant biological functions is desirable. An alanine sweep can be used to identify such motifs. In this strategy each amino acid in the sequence is substituted sequentially with alanine, and the resulting peptides screened for activity in a relevant assay to identify those that are functionally redundant. As AA7 is an alanine in the native PEPITEM sequence, we used this is a positive control for regulation of lymphocyte transmigration across TNF-α/IFN-γ-stimulated endothelial cells. Surprisingly all the peptides inhibited lymphocyte migration across cytokine stimulated endothelial cells to a similar degree, when compared to native PEPITEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P27">A logical hypothesis for these observations is an inbuilt functional redundancy within PEPITEM, in other words more than one active peptide sequence within PEPITEM was operating to regulate T-cell trafficking. Cutting the molecule in half delivered a heptapeptide sequence (SVTEQGA) with full activity, i.e. could significantly reduce lymphocyte trafficking <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). This demonstrated that the active sequences resided within the heptapeptide SVTEQGA. Thus, we truncated SVTEQGA from either end by sequentially removing amino acids. This revealed the minimum active sequences within the heptapeptide capable of significantly reducing lymphocyte migration were the tripeptides SVT and QGA (synthesised as SVT-acid and ac-QGA-acid for technical reasons but referred to as SVT and QGA going forward) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Despite dissimilar structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), SVT and QGA significantly reduced lymphocyte migration <italic>in vitro</italic> to a similar degree as PEPITEM, with equivalent IC50’s in the range of 40-50 pM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-E</xref>). To validate the <italic>in vitro</italic> dose response data, we utilised zymosan induced peritonitis to model acute inflammation. The trafficking dynamics of various leukocyte populations was established at 48 h after administration of zymosan using flow cytometry of labelled leukocytes collected by peritoneal lavage. We found PEPITEM reduced total leukocyte counts (CD45+) at the two highest doses, and significantly at 64.6 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Strikingly, SVT caused a significant reduction of CD45+ leukocytes across all doses, whilst QGA only showed effects at the highest dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G and H</xref>). Consistently with previous publications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> all three peptides reduced CD3+ T cells at the highest dose, with SVT and PEPITEM also showing significant inhibitory effects at lower dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I-K</xref>).

This can be readily assessed by adding peptides to human or murine plasma and assaying the rate of decline of the native sequence by mass spectrometry. We found that PEPITEM was remarkably stable showing no discernible enzymatic degradation over 180 min, however, the tripeptides were less stable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). In addition, molecules of less than 50kDa in MW are cleared rapidly from the circulation by renal filtration (PEPITEM has a MW of approx. 1.5kDa). For example, upon intravenous (IV) injection of a tritiated version of PEPITEM (SVTEQGAE-[4,5-<sup>3</sup>H -Leu]-SNEER -acid) and scintillation counting of collected blood, we observed a rapid loss (within 2 min) to approximately 5% of the original signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). PEPITEM showed longer residence times in other organs when a fluorescently labelled version (Alexa Fluor-680; AF680) was used to track peptide residence in different tissues after IV injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6B</xref>). There were small but significant depots of labelled peptide resident in the heart, lungs and spleen.

Visual and histological assessment of skin showed a clear reduction in disease in the presence of PEPITEM and SVT[NH-ethyl] when compared to untreated psoriasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). Disease was formally assessed using PASI score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), where erythema (redness; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), desquamation (scaling; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>) and induration (thickening; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>) were each assessed on a scale of 0-4, to give a combined maximal score of 12. PEPITEM and SVT[NH-ethyl] significantly reduced the PASI score by ~50% when compared to untreated psoriasis group (which is a clinically significant intervention). To assess the effect of the peptides on immune infiltration at day 7, skin was digested and analysed by flow cytometry. As expected, disease onset significantly increased neutrophil and monocyte infiltration into the skin compared to untreated control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G and H</xref>).

The wide-ranging reduction in chemokines, cytokines and growth factors released into the inflamed skin implies that PEPITEM and its mimetics have powerful regulatory control of the synthesis and secretion of these agents, and thus can dramatically influence inflammatory processes.</p><p id="P32">Next, we investigated the expression of the key up stream mediators responsible for regulating cytokine production, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).

We then showed that that LPS induced significant release of both TNF-α and IL-6 in J774A.1 macrophages and NIH-3T3 fibroblast cell lines, which was significantly inhibited by addition of PEPITEM or SVT[NH-ethyl] but not [pGlu]-GA-amide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C-F</xref>). Of note, the native tripeptide sequences (SVT, QGA) had no significant effects on cytokine release compared to the untreated LPS. Using a human epidermal keratinocyte line (HaCaT), we tested the ability of peptides to inhibit cellular proliferation in response to the gold standard stimulation with M5 cytokine mix (IL-17A, IL-22, Oncostatin-M, IL-1α, TNF-α). M5 mix induced significant proliferation in cell cultures over 72 h, which was significantly reduced when cultures were pretreated with either PEPITEM, SVT[NH-ethyl], QGA or [pGlu]-GA-amide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>). Thus, PEPITEM and its derivatives regulates inflammation by multiple mechanisms, including effects on endothelial cells and leukocyte trafficking, as well as regulation of the induction and release of inflammatory cytokines in the stroma of the affected tissue.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S27" sec-type="discussion"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P36">Here we have identified smaller functional pharmacophores within the 14AA PEPITEM sequence. Two independently active tripeptides could retard leukocyte trafficking in an <italic>in vitro</italic> T-cell trafficking assay, as well as an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of acute peritonitis. A peptide optimisation programme showed that peptidomimetics could be engineered that retained the biological function of PEPITEM and the tripeptides, with some molecules having superior efficacy when compared to the parent tripeptide sequences. Importantly, PEPITEM, tripeptides and mimetics were capable of significantly reducing inflammation and disease scores in a model of plaque psoriasis when they were delivered topically to the skin in an emollient cream. Agents achieved this by regulating the synthesis and release of cytokines and chemokines from skin stromal cells (fibroblasts and macrophages), as well as limiting keratinocyte proliferation. In addition, topical application of agents also significantly reduced Th1 and Th17 cytokines and T-cell numbers in the draining lymph nodes and spleens of treated animals. Thus, PEPITEM, its pharmacophores and peptidomimetics show powerful disease moderating capabilities which are achieved by regulating a spectrum of cellular and molecular pathways in the immune system and local tissue stroma.</p><p id="P37">Previous studies have demonstrated that the PEPITEM pathway can regulate the trafficking of inflammatory CD4 and CD8 central memory T-lymphocytes using <italic>in vitro, ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The paradigm supporting this is predicated on the interaction of PEPITEM with a receptor, CDH15 (M-cadherin), on vascular endothelial cells, engagement of which results in localised release of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Signalling via T-cell S1PR1 and S1PR4 then down regulates the LAF-1 (CD11a/CD11b) mediated transmigration of lymphocytes across the vascular barrier and into tissue 6. In the current studies, control of leukocyte trafficking was also evident from within the stromal environment of the tissues, where PEPITEM could regulate the localised transcription and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Cytokines are responsible for upregulating endothelial adhesion receptors for leukocyte capture from blood, and chemokines activate and direct migration of adherent leukocytes into inflamed tissues. Such observations extend the PEPITEM mediated regulation of leukocyte trafficking from the endothelial cells of the intravascular environment to cells of the tissue parenchyma. This has important implications for our understanding of the pharmacokinetics of these peptides. In order to achieve their regulatory effects on resident cells, peptides must achieve efficient penetration of the stromal environment. The existence of tissue depots of active peptide (as demonstrated in this study) may thus abrogate the idea that all circulating PEPITEM (and its pharmacophores) are rapidly cleared by renal excretion or peptidase degradation and indicates that peptide pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may be more complex than originally anticipated.</p><p id="P38">When looking for the minimal functional sequence within PEPITEM, we were surprised to identify two independently functioning tripeptides. Analysis <italic>in vitro</italic> showed that these had similar IC50’s to PEPITEM when tested in a T-cell trafficking assay (although efficacy in vivo was variable). The reason for this inbuilt redundancy is not clear, but we speculate this may be an evolutionary mechanism for ensuring that point mutations in the PEPITEM sequence do not remove complete control of aspects of the inflammatory response regulated by PEPITEM. The importance of the conservation of active motifs within PEPITEM and of the PEPITEM motif within 14.3.3.ζ is exemplified by their stability across the phylogeny. Comparison on UniProt shows there is 100% concordance between rodent and human PEPITEM sequences, and even at the level of drosophila the sequence shows 85% homology with complete conservation of the SVT motif. There is also strong concordance in the sequence of 14.3.3.ζ across the phylogenetic divide, with 98.8% homology between human and mouse proteins and 78.4% homology between human and fly. Clearly evolution does not tolerate significant mutagenesis of this protein or its biologically active peptide pharmacophores.</p><p id="P39">Although SVT and QGA were equipotent <italic>in vitro,</italic> this was not the case <italic>in vivo.</italic> Generally, SVT was as effective as PEPITEM at reducing leukocyte trafficking, expression of inflammatory mediators and reducing disease scores in a preclinical model of psoriasis. QGA, on the other hand, although having a limited ability to reduce some inflammatory parameters, was certainly not as potent as an anti-inflammatory agent. Moreover, there was evidence of some differentiation of function between the two tripeptides. In an attempt to optimise the efficacy of the tripeptide pharmacophores we generated a series of peptidomimetics based on the sequence of each. The agents taken forward for further testing had superior IC50 to PEPITEM in T-cell trafficking assays <italic>in vitro.</italic> However, efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic> largely mirrored that of the parent tripeptides, with SVT derived agents proving superior in a range of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays to those derived from QGA. Importantly, we did identify one peptidomimetic that performed consistently better than PEPITEM and the parent tripeptide, SVT[NH-Ethyl]. Thus, these experiments provide strong proof of principle that the tripeptide pharmacophores of PEPITEM and their chemically altered derivatives can be used to intervene therapeutically in inflammatory diseases and moreover, raises the possibility that anti-inflammatory agents with some degree of targeted activity could be developed from the distinct pharmacophores.</p><p id="P40">In these studies, we chose to trial PEPITEM, its pharmacophores and their peptidomimetics in a model of plaque psoriasis. This allowed us to use a mode of delivery so far untested for these agents, i.e. direct and topical application to the inflamed tissue (skin). The agents tested could penetrate the dermis and showed efficacy in the epidermal stroma, causing a clinically significant reduction in disease of ≈50% (PASI-50). In addition, topical delivery also had some effects on systemic inflammatory process, e.g. reducing disease associated splenomegaly and limiting the expansion of the CD4, CD8, Th1 and Th17 T-cells within the spleen. Moreover, the function of T-cells in skin draining lymph nodes was also altered, with reductions in the agonist induced production of effector T-cell cytokines. As these systemic aspects of the inflammatory response typify chronic inflammation in IMIDs, this aspect of their activity is likely to be advantageous therapeutically. These observations also raise the question whether other IMIDs, e.g. arthritis, could be effectively treated by application of these agents to the skin, which may be a preferable route of dosing than injection for patients. Standard of care treatments for psoriasis already utilise several topical therapies across the disease spectrum, including corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, retinoids and calcineurin inhibitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. In the current study we show that PEPITEM has actions that are similar to steroids, e.g. reduced leukocyte trafficking and down regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines. This raises the possibility of utilising these peptides in combination with licensed agents to maximise the efficacy of such treatments if synergistic activity were evident. This approach could also be steroid sparing, thereby reducing the serious side effects associate with these agents or allowing lower dosing for prolonged durations without loss of efficacy.</p><p id="P41">In summary; here we show that PEPITEM, its tripeptide pharmacophores, and tripeptide peptidomimetics regulate the inflammatory response by a number of mechanisms. These include effects on cells of the stromal environment, (in addition to those already reported in bone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>), including regulation of the NF-kB pathway that leads to significant reduction on the synthesis and release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines into the inflammatory site, as well as inhibition of systemic inflammatory process associated with chronicity in disease. Together, regulation of these inflammatory checkpoints leads to dampening (but not ablation) of the inflammatory response, which can have benefit when applied to immune mediated inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Tables and Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS199479-supplement-Supplementary_Tables_and_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d11aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S28"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>BA was supported by Ph.D. studentship funded by BBSRC (1090384); LP was funded by a Connect Immune &amp; Chernajovsky Foundation Grant (22937); MC was supported by a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship (DH16044).
