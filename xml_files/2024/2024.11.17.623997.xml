the Cas nuclease-CRISPR (cr)RNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Here, we show that AcrVIB1, the only known Acr against Cas13b, principally acts upstream of RNP complex formation by promoting unproductive crRNA binding followed by crRNA degradation. AcrVIB1 tightly binds to Cas13b but not to the Cas13b-crRNA complex, resulting in enhanced rather than blocked crRNA binding. However, the more tightly-bound crRNA does not undergo processing and exhibits altered target RNA binding that fails to activate collateral RNA cleavage. The bound crRNA is also accessible to RNases, leading to crRNA turnover <italic>in vivo</italic> even in the presence of Cas13b. Finally, cryo-EM structures revealed that AcrVIB1 binds a helical domain of Cas13b responsible for securing the crRNA, keeping the domain in an untethered state. These findings reveal an Acr that converts an effector nuclease into a crRNA sink to suppress CRISPR-Cas defense.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>AcrVIB1</kwd><kwd>anti-CRISPR protein</kwd><kwd>Cas13b</kwd><kwd>phage</kwd><kwd>immune defense</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The ancient yet ongoing arms race between bacteria and (bacterio-)phages has led to the evolution of numerous anti-phage defense systems as well as phage-encoded counter-defenses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. One prevalent pairing comprises CRISPR-Cas systems and anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs). CRISPR-Cas systems confer adaptive immunity by storing fragments of foreign genetic material expressed as CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that guide anti-phage defense by the system’s effector nuclease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. These systems possess a diverse range of molecular mechanisms that confer immune defense, with the current classification scheme dividing CRISPR-Cas systems into two classes, seven types, and over 33 subtypes and variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Acrs are smaller (52 - 528 amino-acids) proteins typically encoded by phages that inhibit different steps of CRISPR-based immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. These protein inhibitors have proven as diverse as CRISPR-Cas systems, with five CRISPR-Cas types and 13 subtypes associated with at least one inhibiting Acr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> as well as a wide range of inhibitory mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Within the diversity of inhibitory mechanisms exhibited by Acrs, the vast majority directly act on the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) effector complex formed between a Cas effector nuclease and its crRNA. In one of the most common modes across CRISPR-Cas types, the Acr binds directly to the effector complex to block target recognition or binding. As examples of this mode, AcrIF1 attaches to the hexameric Cas7f backbone within the Type I-F effector complex to block hybridization of the crRNA guide to target DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, AcrIIA4 occupies the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM)-interacting site of the Type II effector nuclease Cas9 to prevent DNA interrogation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, and AcrVIA1 binds the guide-exposed portion of the Type VI-A effector nuclease Cas13a to block hybridization of the crRNA guide to a complementary target RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Acrs can also cause the effector complex to non-specifically bind DNA as exemplified by AcrIF9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> or acetylate the effector complex or the nuclease to block recognition of the PAM flanking the crRNA target as exemplified by AcrVA5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Other Acrs exert their effects on the RNP complex after the complex has bound the target. For instance, AcrIIC4 acts on the Cas9 effector complex after PAM binding but before R-loop formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Separately, AcrIIA5 acts on the Cas9 effector complex after R-loop formation by blocking the RuvC endonuclease domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Thus, a wide range of inhibitory mechanisms have been elucidated in which an Acr acts on the pre-formed RNP complex.</p><p id="P5">In contrast, only two mechanisms have emerged that solely act before RNP complex formation. In one mechanism represented by AcrIIC2 and AcrIIA17, the Acr binds to Cas9, occluding crRNA binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In the other mechanism represented by AcrVA2, the Acr interacts with the N-terminus of the Type V-A effector nuclease Cas12a during translation, resulting in degradation of the template mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. While these two examples illustrate that mechanistic steps upstream of RNP effector complex formation can be inhibitory targets of Acrs, the other steps upstream of RNP formation and the many possible mechanisms-of-inhibition suggest that more paradigms await to be discovered.</p><p id="P6">In this work, we show that AcrVIB1, the only reported Acr acting against the Type VI-B effector nuclease Cas13b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, also acts upstream of RNP complex formation but with a unique mechanism of action: promoting rather than inhibiting binding of the crRNA to Cas13b. Binding is unproductive though, preventing processing of the precursor crRNA (pre-crRNA), reducing hybridization to a target RNA, and blocking induction of collateral RNA cleavage that normally drives cellular dormancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The bound crRNA is also susceptible to RNase attack, leading to extensive degradation in cells despite being more tightly bound by Cas13b. Finally, cryo-EM structures reveal that the Acr locks Cas13b in a flexible state accessible to partial binding of the crRNA. These findings provide molecular insights into how phages can overcome defense by Type VI-B CRISPR-Cas systems and establish a unique anti-CRISPR defense through the conversion of a Cas nuclease from an immune effector into a crRNA sink representing a dead end for the crRNA.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>AcrVIB1 inhibits collateral RNA cleavage of Cas13b upstream of RNP formation <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="P7">Our prior experiments using cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL) suggested that AcrVIB1 inhibits RNA collateral cleavage activity of PbuCas13b most strongly when acting prior to RNP complex formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. To explore this observation under fully controlled conditions, we performed collateral RNA cleavage assays <italic>in vitro</italic> using purified components. As part of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), PbuCas13b was combined with either AcrVIB1 or an <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed crRNA. After 15 minutes, the remaining component (AcrVIB1 or crRNA) was added along with target RNA and a collateral RNA substrate linking a fluorophore and a quencher. Fluorescence stemming from separating the fluorophore and quencher through collateral RNA cleavage was then measured over time. As part of the assay, crRNAs with a processed or unprocessed terminal repeat were tested in case the processing state of the crRNAs impacts inhibition by AcrVIB1.</p><p id="P8">In line with our prior TXTL results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, AcrVIB1 exerted a stronger inhibitory effect when added before rather than after the crRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Specifically, AcrVIB1 reduced PbuCas13b’s collateral RNA cleavage activity by 97% when added before or 88% when added after a processed crRNA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). A similar trend was observed with two other processed crRNAs, with AcrVIB1 reducing collateral RNA cleavage activity by 94% or 70% (crRNA-2) and by 97% or 23% (crRNA-3) when added before or after the crRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-C</xref>). These reductions in collateral activities could not be attributed to the 15-minute difference in adding the crRNA, as collateral cleavage was similar or even slightly stronger with the delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). When comparing processed and unprocessed crRNAs, adding the crRNA before rather than after adding AcrVIB1 resulted in stronger inhibition for the processed versus unprocessed crRNA (12% vs. 64% for crRNA-1, 30% vs. 41% for crRNA-2, 77% vs. 105% for crRNA-3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), possibly due to the processed crRNA more readily binding PbuCas13b. Overall, AcrVIB1 predominantly exerts its inhibitory activity before the formation of the RNP complex.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>AcrVIB1 destabilizes the crRNA but not Cas13b <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P9">After confirming that AcrVIB1 principally inhibits collateral RNA cleavage by PbuCas13b upstream of RNP complex formation, we began exploring the molecular mechanism of inhibition. Prior work on the three Acrs similarly acting upstream of RNP complex formation (AcrIIC2, AcrIIA17 and AcrVA2) served as reference points, with AcrIIC2 and AcrIIA17 leading to crRNA degradation through occlusion from binding Cas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and AcrVA2 leading to Cas12a degradation through translational inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. As the Acrs led to degradation of the crRNA or the Cas nuclease <italic>in vivo</italic>, we measured crRNA and PbuCas13b abundance when the unprocessed crRNA-1 and PbuCas13b were heterologously expressed along with AcrVIB1 in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We first performed western blotting analysis to measure PbuCas13b levels. Co-expressing AcrVIB1 and PbuCas13b led to no difference in the expression or stability of PbuCas13b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), ruling out a mechanism paralleling that of AcrVA2. We therefore turned to northern blotting analysis to measure crRNA levels. Here, both unprocessed and processed crRNA-1 were detectable in the presence of PbuCas13b and in the absence of AcrVIB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In contrast, both crRNA products were undetectable in the absence of PbuCas13b as well as in the presence of both PbuCas13b and AcrVIB1. Therefore, PbuCas13b protects the crRNA from turnover, which is reversed in the presence of AcrVIB1.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>AcrVIB1 binds to Cas13b and not to the crRNA</title><p id="P11">While AcrVIB1 led to destabilization of the crRNA in <italic>E. coli</italic>, AcrVIB1 could be interacting with either PbuCas13b or the crRNA. We therefore measured the extent of binding between AcrVIB1 and either PbuCas13b or the crRNA using microscale thermophoresis (MST) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S3</xref>). As part of the measurements, AcrVIB1 was tracked through its His-tag using a fluorescently tagged-Tris-NTA moiety. MST measurements showed tight binding between AcrVIB1 and PbuCas13b, with a calculated dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of ~44 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). In contrast, MST did not detect any binding between AcrVIB1 and the processed crRNA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Binding between AcrVIB1 and PbuCas13b was verified by co-immunoprecipitation and mass photometry when both were incubated <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figs. S2 and S4A-B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">If AcrVIB1 tightly binds and thereby inhibits PbuCas13b while the presence of the crRNA reduces inhibition, then binding of the crRNA to PbuCas13b could negatively affect subsequent interactions with AcrVIB1. To evaluate this possibility directly, we performed MST to measure binding between AcrVIB1 and PbuCas13b already complexed with a crRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). In this case, we tracked a crRNA labeled on its 5′ end with a fluorophore, which would not be removed through processing by PbuCas13b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The crRNA rather than AcrVIB1 or PbuCas13b was labeled, as a binding interaction would be registered only if PbuCas13b bound both the crRNA and AcrVIB1. While no binding of AcrVIB1 was detected under this setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), mass photometry analysis indicated some interaction between AcrVIB1 and the PbuCas13b:crRNA complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4A</xref>). This interaction was less stable than that formed when AcrVIB1 is added first based on melting curve determination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4B</xref>). Finally, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that pre-incubating PbuCas13b with a crRNA reduces binding by labeled AcrVIB1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4C-D</xref>). Thus, we can conclude that AcrVIB1 preferentially binds to PbuCas13b rather than the PbuCas13b:crRNA complex, in line with AcrVIB1 inhibiting collateral RNA cleavage by PbuCas13b principally before RNP formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>AcrVIB1 promotes crRNA binding to PbuCas13b</title><p id="P13">After establishing that AcrVIB1 tightly binds PbuCas13b, we next asked how subsequent binding of the crRNA is affected. Following the precedent set by AcrIIC2 and AcrIIA17<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that AcrVIB1 occludes crRNA binding, which would explain inhibition prior to RNP formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) as well as AcrVIB1 yielding crRNA destabilization <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we again applied MST to measure the extent to which the labeled crRNA-1 binds PbuCas13b already complexed with AcrVIB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3A-B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S3</xref>). Surprisingly, the crRNA bound significantly tighter in the presence rather than in the absence of AcrVIB1, with respective K<sub>D</sub> values of ~160 nM and ~1 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D-E</xref>) (p = 0.032). We obtained similar results by EMSA, where crRNA binding to PbuCas13b required a high (200 nM) concentration of the nuclease and was enhanced when PbuCas13b was pre-incubated with AcrVIB1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4E</xref>). While these binding affinities were low compared to the picomolar affinities measured between guide RNAs and the <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> Cas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, such affinities have been rarely measured and could vary widely across Cas single effector nucleases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Overall, in stark contrast to AcrIIC2 and AcrIIA17, AcrVIB1 enhances rather than occludes crRNA binding.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The bound crRNA is not processed and yields altered target RNA binding</title><p id="P14">While AcrVIB1 promotes crRNA binding to PbuCas13b, the resulting complex exhibits greatly reduced target-dependent collateral RNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We therefore evaluated the impact of AcrVIB1 binding on two intermediate steps between crRNA binding and collateral RNA cleavage: crRNA processing and target RNA binding. Beginning with crRNA processing, we incubated a 3′-labeled crRNA-1 with a full-length terminal repeat and downstream truncated spacer with PbuCas13b alone or already in complex with AcrVIB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). While PbuCas13b alone fully processed the crRNA, PbuCas13b complexed with AcrVIB1 could no longer process the crRNA, especially at higher concentrations of AcrVIB1. The crRNA also remained intact in the presence of AcrVIB1, ruling out any degradation directly mediated by the Acr or the AcrVIB1-bound Cas13b. Thus, AcrVIB1’s interaction with Cas13b prevents crRNA processing.</p><p id="P15">While inhibition of crRNA processing suggests disruption of other downstream steps, crRNA processing in itself is not necessary for Cas13b to recognize its target RNAs and activate collateral RNA cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. We therefore evaluated the second intermediate step, target RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-C</xref>). We again used MST, where we tracked the target RNA using a 5′-label. We also used a buffer that chelates free magnesium ions to allow target RNA binding without the confounding effect of collateral RNA cleavage, paralleling prior work on Cas13b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Under these conditions, pre-incubating PbuCas13b with AcrVIB1 resulted in modestly but significantly reduced target RNA binding by the PbuCas13b:crRNA-1 RNP complex from a K<sub>D</sub> of 85 nM to 153 nM (p = 0.047). The K<sub>D</sub> value in the absence of AcrVIB1 paralleled those reported previously (27 - 42 nM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Performing a similar assay via EMSA revealed a distinct banding pattern for bound target RNA, suggesting that the interaction between PbuCas13b:crRNA and the target RNA is altered in the presence of AcrVIB1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5A</xref>). Similar changes in banding patterns for the bound target RNA as well as reduced target RNA binding in the presence of AcrVIB1 were observed via EMSA using crRNA-2 and crRNA-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S5B-C</xref>). These results indicate that AcrVIB1 affects target RNA recognition by the PbuCas13b:crRNA RNP complex, helping explain the lack of collateral RNA cleavage even in the presence of the target RNA. Between disruption of crRNA processing and altered target RNA recognition, the enhanced binding of crRNA to the PbuCas13b:AcrVIB1 can be considered unproductive.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The presence of AcrVIB1 exposes the Cas13b-bound crRNA to RNase attack</title><p id="P16">We showed that AcrVIB1’s interaction with PbuCa13b leads to unproductive crRNA binding that prevents crRNA processing, alters target RNA binding, and stymies target-dependent collateral RNA cleavage. What remains unclear though is how these mechanisms would reduce crRNA stability <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), as enhanced crRNA binding to PbuCas13b in the presence of AcrVIB1 would be expected to lead to greater protection of the crRNA against host RNases. We therefore hypothesized that unproductive crRNA binding renders the bound crRNA accessible to RNases, leading to crRNA turnover <italic>in vivo</italic> even in the presence of Cas13b.</p><p id="P17">To test this hypothesis, we exposed crRNA-1 to RNase T1, an endoribonuclease responsible for cleaving guanine nucleotides in single-stranded RNA, in the presence or absence of PbuCas13b and AcrVIB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). The crRNA alone was completely degraded by RNase T1 under our testing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E-F</xref>). The presence of PbuCas13b significantly protected the crRNA from RNase T1, with ~16% more intact crRNA than in the absence of RNase T1 (p = 0.021). We attribute incomplete protection to the poor binding affinity between PbuCas13b and the crRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>) that would lead to regular crRNA release. In the presence of PbuCas13b and AcrVIB1, protection significantly dropped to ~6% compared to no RNase T1 (p = 0.021) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E-F</xref>), even though more crRNA would be bound to PbuCas13b. We therefore conclude that the crRNA is more prone to RNase degradation in the presence of AcrVIB1, explaining crRNA destabilization <italic>in vivo</italic> despite the Acr enhancing binding of the crRNA to PbuCas13b.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>AcrVIB1 prevents Cas13b from closing around the crRNA</title><p id="P18">To gain structural insights into the mechanism by which AcrVIB1 inhibits PbuCas13b, we determined cryo-EM structures of PbuCas13b bound to a crRNA in the absence or presence of AcrVIB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). When Acr was omitted, we observed a single compact structure that could be refined to 3.1 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>) and that paralleled the previously published crystallized PubCas13b:crRNA complex (PDB entry 6DTD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Briefly, PbuCas13b adopts a heart-shaped conformation in which two HEPN domains (HEPN-1 and HEPN-2), located at the N- and C-terminus of the protein, form the apex containing the Cas13b nuclease active site, whereas two helical domains (Helical-1 and Helical-2) together with a lid-structure establish a solvent-accessible chamber that binds the 3′ stem-loop and leaves room for the unpaired 5′-stretch of the crRNA as well as for parts of the target RNA. Importantly, in this complex, the stem-loop of the crRNA is clamped tightly between the Helical-1 and Helical-2 domains, which sit on top of the HEPN-2 and HEPN-1 domains, respectively, and also contacts the lid. Consequently, the crRNA cannot leave the complex without structural rearrangements of the protein, implying that PbuCas13b adopts a more open conformation to load the crRNA. Building on prior observations garnered from the crystal structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, parts of the crRNA repeat become visible in the cryo-EM structure, supporting the prior hypothesis that this stretch leaves the chamber through the large opening located at the face opposite to the active site of PbuCas13b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Including AcrVIB1 with PbuCas13b and the crRNA led to heterogeneous and less compact particles. The only trackable conformation in these samples could be refined to an overall resolution of 4.2 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). While the quality of the resulting map does not reveal individual secondary structure elements, it clearly shows that the Helical-2 domain has lost its contact to HEPN-1 and the lid domains, leading to a swing-out motion of ~60 Å at its tip. As a consequence, the crRNA is now fully solvent-exposed, and its 3′ end points away from the core of the Cas13b nuclease and into the direction of the swung-out Helical-2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>AcrVIB1 binds the Helical-2 domain of Cas13b that prevents the crRNA from being secured</title><p id="P20">Because this opening of the Cas13b:crRNA complex occurs in the presence of AcrVIB1, it is conceivable that the anti-CRISPR protein must be bound to the complex, thereby preventing its role as a clamp protecting and holding the crRNA in place. However, the exact position of AcrVIB1 was not obvious in the cryo-EM map because of its low resolution. While considering different possible locations, we noticed that the density around the shifted Helical-2 domain was less resolved than for the remainder of the protein. The lower resolution may be a consequence of local flexibility, capturing conformations with different degrees of opening in the map. Alternatively, the lower resolution could indicate binding of AcrVIB1 to the Helical-2 domain.</p><p id="P21">With the recent advent of AlphaFold3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, we explored whether AcrVIB1 interacts with the Helical-2 domain or elsewhere on PbuCas13b. As calculations with the complete nuclease and AcrVIB1 were inconclusive, we modeled a complex of AcrVIB1 only with the Helical-2 domain. In contrast to similar approaches with the predecessor software AlphaFold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, the new version resulted in a reproducible high-confidence model of a 1:1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). When this model is mapped to the open conformation of the Cas13b:crRNA complex, AcrVIB1 wedges between the lid and the Helical-2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>). Importantly, when the Helical-2:AcrVIB1 model is superimposed onto the closed conformation of PbuCas13b, AcrVIB1 would arrive at the inner RNA-binding cavity and lead to severe clashes with parts of the nuclease, explaining why AcrVIB1 does not bind to the pre-formed PbuCas13b:crRNA complex in our experiments. On the other hand, the open conformation is expected to allow the crRNA to more easily access its binding site in PbuCas13b, which could explain why AcrVIB1 strengthens crRNA binding. At the same time, the crRNA remains unprotected in this complex, making it prone to degradation by RNases as we observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D-F</xref>). The inability of the Helicase-II domain to close around the crRNA likely prevents further conformational changes previously hypothesized as necessary steps to activate collateral RNA cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">To validate the AlphaFold3 model experimentally, we produced the Helical-2 domain recombinantly and assessed complex formation with AcrVIB1 by SEC-MALS and Spectral Shift titration. This analysis revealed a 1:1 complex of the expected molecular mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>), with a dissociation constant of 251 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). While the recombinant complex was recalcitrant to crystallization, we could corroborate the overall shape and position of the predicted secondary structure elements with a low-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction of the 34-kDa Helical-2:AcrVIB1 particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D-E</xref>).</p><p id="P23">To probe the importance of residues in the predicted interface between PbuCas13b and AcrVIB1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6A</xref>), we tested associated amino-acid substitutions in both PbuCas13b and AcrVIB1 using our previously reported TXTL assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The assay reads out collateral activity through silencing of a targeted GFP transcript, which is reversed through inhibition by the expressed AcrVIB1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6B</xref>). Of the three tested substitutions in PbuCas13b (K627A, N634A, R662A) and AcrVIB1 (D37A/D38A, S56A, T70A), R662A in PbuCas13b as well as D37A/D38A and T70A in AcrVIB1 mediated a substantial reversal of inhibition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6C-D</xref>). The attenuated inhibition supports the predicted interactions between AcrVIB1 and the Helical-2 domain of PbuCas13b, while the lack of inhibition at the other tested residues could reflect multisite interactions that collectively contribute to binding and inhibition.</p><p id="P24">As an additional means to probe binding interactions, we evaluated the <italic>Riemerella anatipestifer</italic> (Ran)Cas13b, which shares 43.4% identity with PbuCas13b.

We hypothesized that the few amino-acid differences within the implicated portion of the Helical-2 domain prevents inhibition by AcrVIB1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6E</xref>). Substituting four residues in RanCas13b to match the aligned residue in PbuCas13b (K559N, Y609K, W627R, R630Q), we found that one substitution (R630Q) substantially enhanced inhibition by AcrVIB1 in the TXTL assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6F</xref>). Sequence divergences in this region of the Helical-2 domain thus appear to limit the host range of AcrVIB1. Overall, our mutational analyses help corroborate AcrVIB1 directly binding to the Helical-2 domain of PbuCas13b.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">Based on our collective results, we propose a detailed model governing the mechanism of action of AcrVIB1, the only known inhibitor of a Cas13b nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). In the absence of the Acr, Cas13b binds and processes the pre-crRNA, after which target RNA can be recognized to activate collateral RNA cleavage. In the presence of the Acr, AcrVIB1 tightly binds Cas13b through the Helical-2 domain, thereby locking Cas13b in an open conformation that more readily allows binding of a pre-crRNA. pre-crRNA binding is unproductive though, preventing pre-crRNA processing and leading to altered target RNA binding that does not activate collateral RNA cleavage even in the presence of the target RNA. Additionally, the crRNA bound to the Cas13b:AcrVIB1 complex is accessible to RNases, making it susceptible to at least partial degradation. If the degraded crRNA is released, the Cas13b:AcrVIB1 complex could subsequently bind but not protect additional crRNA molecules, effectively turning Cas13b into a crRNA sink. Alternatively, if the untouched portion of the crRNA remains bound to the Cas13b:AcrVIB1 complex, then release of AcrVIB1 could lead to formation of a closed Cas13b:crRNA complex, but without the guide region necessary for target recognition. In either case, AcrVIB1 blocks immune activation of Cas13b in the presence of a target RNA. If a crRNA is already bound to Cas13b, then AcrVIB1 loses its ability to inhibit immune activation because the binding surface on the Helical-2 domain is buried in the Cas13b:crRNA complex.</p><p id="P26">Apart from supporting the proposed inhibitory mechanism of AcrVIB1, the cryo-EM analyses shed light on the crRNA loading step of Cas13b. This step has previously remained obscure due to the fact that only two crystal structures of Cas13b:crRNA complexes are currently available, and these structures do not provide direct evidence for interdomain flexibility within Cas13b nucleases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Binding of AcrVIB1 revealed an alternative conformation in which the Helical-2 domain remains in a swung-out conformation. As this domain directly interacts with the crRNA in the Cas13b:crRNA structures, we propose that it opens to accommodate crRNA binding. It is conceivable that the same domain also moves to accommodate complete hybridization between the crRNA and target RNA, although the previously proposed lid domain could also serve this function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Thus, there are still many features of Cas13b activation that remain unclear, such as how target recognition leads to nuclease activation. Further studies with AcrVIB1 could help dissect these steps.</p><p id="P27">The elucidated mechanism of action represents a distinct entry into the short but diverse list of known Acrs acting upstream of RNP formation. Among already known mechanisms are the degradation of effector protein mRNA and the occlusion of crRNAs to prevent RNP complex formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Separate from Acrs, RNA-based anti-CRISPR elements called Racrs were recently shown to act upstream of RNP formation by mimicking crRNA repeats that form non-functional RNPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. AcrVIB1 introduces a distinct mechanism to this list by promoting rather than occluding crRNA binding, but in a way that blocks target-dependent activation and leads to crRNA degradation <italic>in vivo</italic>. At most, this mechanism resembles that of AcrVA1, which cleaves the guide region of a Cas12a crRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. However, AcrVA1 only cleaves the crRNA within the formed RNP, while AcrVIB1 promotes the formation of a non-functional RNP. Given the diverse mechanisms exhibited by AcrVIB1 and these few other Acrs and Racrs, additional Acrs likely await discovery. For instance, these hypothetical Acrs could act through similar mechanisms against other Cas nucleases besides Cas13b or act at other steps upstream of RNP formation, such as transcription of the Cas nuclease or pre-crRNA, crRNA processing by host factors such as RNase III or RNase E, or as part of spacer acquisition.</p><p id="P28">Given that AcrVIB1 and these other examples would not be effective after the RNP effector complex is formed, it raises the question: under which infection conditions do these examples help circumvent CRISPR-based immunity? Inhibition would be unlikely to benefit an initial infection by an Acr-encoding phage, as the expressed Acr (or Racr) would not inhibit pre-formed RNP complexes surveilling for the invading phage genome. Instead, these Acrs could assist with a follow-on wave of phage infections, an altruistic effect also associated with Acrs inhibiting some DNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. If the phage contains a mutated target site but the site could drive priming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, then Acrs acting upstream of RNP formation could inhibit CRISPR immunity before a new spacer can be acquired and produce a matching crRNA. As Acrs are often found together in anti-defense islands, multiple mechanisms of inhibition acting upstream of and on RNP complex formation could also yield more robust anti-defense under different infection conditions. Overall, more work exploring the ramifications of different inhibitory mechanisms of Acrs under different infection conditions could shed new light on the bacterial-phage arms race.</p><p id="P29">One notable observation while elucidating AcrVIB1’s mechanism of action is the poorer binding affinity between PbuCa13b and its crRNA, at least compared to that measured for SpyCas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We still observe collateral RNA cleavage activity, so the low binding affinity between PbuCas13b and crRNA does not compromise RNP activation. This observation raises the question of how variable binding affinities can be between Cas effector nucleases and their crRNAs and their potential consequences on CRISPR immunity. In the case of Cas13b and AcrVIB1, we speculate that the poor binding affinity grants AcrVIB1 an opportunity to inhibit Cas13b before a crRNA is bound; otherwise, AcrVIB1 would be rendered ineffective both to bind Cas13b and serve as a crRNA sink.</p><p id="P30">Beyond its relevance to bacterial-phage interactions, the identification and characterization of AcrVIB1 lays the foundation for its use for controlling Cas13-based functions. Indeed, Cas13 nucleases have been adapted for a number of RNA-centric applications, including post-transcriptional silencing, RNA editing, molecular diagnostics, and <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Currently, there are only a limited number of Acrs that inhibit Type VI CRISPR-Cas systems, and only one published application using the Acr for phage engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. In this context, the Cas13a inhibitor AcrVIA1 is introduced as a selection marker via homologous recombination, together with a gene-of-interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Only phages carrying the gene-of-interest and AcrVIA1 would survive Cas13a targeting due to the inhibitory activity of AcrVIA1 against Cas13a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. As AcrVIB1 acts prior to RNP complex formation, applications that rely on a pre-formed RNP complex would be less suitable, such as phage engineering or molecular diagnostics. However, there are other applications in which an RNP complex is not pre-formed. For instance, as part of post-transcriptional silencing, AcrVIB1 could be applied to reduce leaky expression prior to Cas13 induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, or it could restrict silencing to specific cell types through tissue-specific expression of the Acr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.

In brief, we pre-expressed the AcrVIB1 plasmid in TXTL for 16 h with a final concentration of 4 nM, before adding the pre-expressed protein to fresh TXTL mix together with the plasmids encoding the Cas13b nuclease, a crRNA, T7RNAP or deGFP with a final concentration of 1 nM for the nuclease, the crRNA and deGFP and 0.2 nM T7RNAP. The samples were then incubated at 29°C for 16 h in a plate reader (BioTek Synergy H1), and fluorescence was measured every three minutes (excitation, emission: 485 nm, 528 nm). All TXTL reactions were prepared using the Echo525 Liquid Handling system to distribute the plasmids. The TXTL mix was distributed manually beforehand. Herein, a set of plasmids containing single amino-acid substitutions in either PbuCas13b or AcrVIB1 were tested for the impact on targeting and inhibitory activity, respectively. Mutations of PbuCas13b included K627A, N634A, and R662A. AcrVIB1 was mutated at three different sites, D37/38A, S56A, T70A. Furthermore, we tested four amino-acid substitutions in RanCas13b to test if they confer sensitivity to AcrVIB1 to the previously unaffected RanCas13b nuclease, K559N, Y609K, W627R and R630Q.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P72">In this study, unpaired, one-sided t-tests, with the incorporation of Welch's correction, were employed to evaluate the statistical significance of observed differences between two independent groups.

Cas13b weakly binds to a crRNA to form an RNP complex followed by crRNA processing. The RNP complex can then recognize a target RNA that activates collateral RNA cleavage. AcrVIB1 binds to Cas13b, leading to stronger crRNA binding to the Cas13b:AcrVIB1 complex. The bound crRNA does not undergo processing and yields altered target RNA binding that prevents activation of target-dependent collateral RNA cleavage. The crRNA bound to the Cas13b is protected from RNases, while the crRNA bound to the Cas13b:AcrVIB1 complex is susceptible to RNase attack.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS200177-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
