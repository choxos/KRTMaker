While viruses infecting bacteria and eukaryotes have been extensively studied, the viruses roaming the archaeal domain remain largely unexplored. In recent years, a growing number of archaeal viruses have been described, revealing a stunningly diverse range of morphologies that appear unique to archaea. Detailed structural studies are paramount to fully understand how archaeal viruses infect their hosts. However, no complete atomic models of archaeal viruses are available to date. Using electron cryo-microscopy, we investigated the structure of the archaeal virus Haloferax tailed virus 1 (HFTV1), which infects the halophile Haloferax gibbonsii LR2-5 originating from the Senegalese salt lake Retba. Through single particle analysis, we achieved near-atomic resolution for the entire set of HFTV1’s structural proteins, enabling the building of a full atomic model of the virion. Comparing the structures of DNA filled and empty capsids, we visualise structural changes occurring upon DNA ejection. By investigating the double-stranded DNA inside the capsid, we elucidate how the genome is spooled upon loading. Furthermore, our structure reveals putative cell-surface receptor-binding and catalytic roles of capsid turret, baseplate, and tail fibre proteins. Together, our data provide new insights into the mechanisms of HFTV1 assembly and infection, unveiling new perspectives on general rules of host-virus interactions in archaea and their evolutionary links to bacterial and eukaryotic viruses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Viruses infecting microorganisms are abundant and diverse and those infecting archaea encompass an astonishing variety of morphotypes, such as spiral, bottle, and spindle-shaped viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Of all different morphotypes, viruses with a helical tail and an icosahedral head containing a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome are extremely successful. As such, they represent the predominant archetype of bacteria-infecting viruses and exist in abundance in almost all ecosystems of this planet. These tailed viruses (TVs) infect all major lineages of bacteria, drive cellular evolution, and have a major impact on ecosystems, such as the oceans, and are thus important for nutrient turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Archaea are also infected by a diverse group of TVs (arTVs), which are evolutionarily related to the bacteria-infecting TVs (baTVs) and have been grouped together with them in the class <italic>Caudoviricetes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], in which several new arTV-specific families have been established. Specifically, halophilic and methanogenic archaea belonging to the <italic>Euryarchaea</italic> are often infected by arTVs and encode arTV-like proviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. In addition, arTV-like proviruses are found in the genomes of other major classes of archaea, such as <italic>Thaumarchaea</italic>, <italic>Aigarchaea</italic>, and <italic>Thermoplasmata</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Comparison of arTV and baTV genomes suggests an ancient divergence, and arTVs represent an evolutionarily distinct group within the prokaryotic dsDNA virome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. The evolutionary link between the two groups is shown by their common virion architecture and conserved proteins, especially their major capsid proteins (MCPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Based on the broad distribution of TVs, they are hypothesised to be a part of the virome of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p><p id="P6">dsDNA TVs are the most successful prokaryotic viruses known to us. The structure and infection mechanism of these viruses have been studied predominantly for bacterial virus members of the <italic>Caudoviricetes</italic>. Like baTVs, arTVs also have different tail types, which group them into podo-, myo- and siphovirus morphotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P7">Generally, the tails are involved in host recognition, binding, penetration of the cell envelope, and genome delivery into the host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Some structural proteins of baTVs also have enzymatic activity, such as the peptidoglycan hydrolase activity of the tape measure proteins of mycobacteriophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. However, the lack of full atomic structures for tape measure proteins precludes a full understanding of their function.</p><p id="P8">After genome delivery, the transcriptional program of the virus is activated, the genome replicated, and progeny particles are assembled in the cytoplasm. Most capsids of baTVs are icosahedral, but some are elongated (prolate) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Usually, the capsid head is connected to the tail by a portal protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. During virus maturation, this is the site where assembly of the head is initiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Heads consist of the MCPs, which require scaffolding proteins to obtain the correct capsid geometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Maturation of the empty capsid occurs by proteins that degrade the scaffolding protein.</p><p id="P9">The viral genome is packaged into the empty head in an energy-dependent manner by a terminase complex transiently docked to the portal vertex. Previous electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of baTVs have shown that dsDNA typically forms coaxial spools within viral capsids, in which the strands of DNA form ordered shells around an axis aligned with the portal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. These shells display increasing disorder towards the centre, possibly due to the inner layers being further from the capsid and therefore less influenced by the icosahedral structure, which may act as a guide for the more ordered outer layers.</p><p id="P10">While other types of genome spooling, such as concentric and toroidal organisations have been suggested, the coaxial spooling model is the most widely accepted model for dsDNA inside icosahedral capsids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. However, molecular dynamics studies, which can reproduce physical properties and packaging forces of the capsid, have suggested a more disordered organisation of DNA, often with multiple configurations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. These models have also revealed that the organisation of the DNA depends on the size and shape of the capsid; elongated icosahedrons have been simulated to display toroidal packaging in comparison to isometric icosahedrons, which typically display coaxial spooling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].</p><p id="P11">After DNA packaging, the portal is plugged and connected to the tail. baTVs with short tails, such as podoviruses like phage T7, are assembled directly on the portal vertex, while the longer tails of myo- and siphoviruses are first assembled and connected later to the head [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].</p><p id="P12">The infection and assembly mechanisms of arTVs are less studied than those of baTVs. However, it was recently shown that the receptor for two arTVs is the S-layer protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], which is the main cell envelope component of archaea. We have shown that the siphovirus Haloferax tailed virus 1 (HFTV1) contacts its host <italic>Haloferax gibbonsii</italic> LR2-5 via its tail, but interestingly also with its head [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. HFTV1 is hypothesised to bind the cell first reversibly by its head and then irreversibly via its tail, before ejecting its DNA into the host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. The structural details behind this unusual binding mechanism remain elusive.</p><p id="P13">Comparative genomics have indicated that arTVs possess MCPs with the same Hong Kong 97 (HK97) fold as is conserved amongst baTVs and eukaryotic herpesviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Indeed, by electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) it was shown that the head of the arTV <italic>Haloarcula sinaiiensis</italic> tailed virus 1 (HSTV-1) consists of multiple MCPs with a HK97 fold, evolutionarily linking the arTVs with baTVs and herpesviruses (the realm <italic>Dublodnaviria</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. However, the complete structure of any arTV virion has not yet been resolved, and it is therefore unclear to what extent arTVs compare with baTVs of the class <italic>Caudoviricetes</italic>.</p><p id="P14">Here, we purified HFTV1 virions and studied their structure via cryo-EM. Through single particle analysis, we obtained near-atomic resolution maps of DNA-filled and empty virions, enabling us to assemble full atomic models of the virus pre and post DNA release - including all structural protein components. Comparing both structures enabled us to propose a model that describes the hitherto unknown host-cell adsorption and infection mechanism. Additionally, we were able to visualise the packaged dsDNA, revealing how the DNA is spooled inside the capsid.</p><p id="P15">Finally, our structure will aid in tracing the evolutionary history and structural diversity of the members of the class <italic>Caudoviricetes</italic> and to understand the common principles that underpin the global success of these widely distributed prokaryotic viruses.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Structures of the HFTV1 virion pre and post DNA ejection</title><p id="P16">To determine the structure of the full HFTV1 virion, we purified virus particles, plunge-froze them on holey carbon grids and imaged them using a Titan Krios TEM equipped with either a K3 Summit or Falcon 4i direct electron detector. The resulting movies were corrected for beam-induced drift and CTF and high-resolution maps of the virus were reconstructed using RELION-4.0 and 5.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>].</p><p id="P17">The sample of purified virions contained DNA-filled particles, but also those that had already ejected their DNA genomes. The latter were easily distinguishable from their infectious counterparts in raw micrographs and during 2D classification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1 &amp; 2</xref>), allowing for the two classes of particles to be processed separately and thus the viral structure pre and post ejection to be compared.</p><p id="P18">The final map of the whole infectious DNA-filled virion had a global resolution of 4.39 Å (Cryo-EM Flowchart 1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>). To obtain higher resolutions for its constituent parts, the head, turrets, portal, tail, baseplate and tail fibres were subjected to focused refinements employing symmetry operators pertaining to each sub-structure (Cryo-EM Flowchart 1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 11-13</xref>). This was a complex undertaking, due to symmetry mismatches that occurred across various protein-protein interfaces in the virus. Notwithstanding this, the combined data allowed for atomic model building of the entire virion, aided by ModelAngelo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] (Supplementary Movie 1). HFTV1’s full atomic structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>) revealed a virus with a length of 1,350 Å and an icosahedral head with a diameter of ˜600 Å. The head is decorated by up to 60 turrets, which project ˜90 Å above the surface of the capsid and thus increase its diameter to ˜780 Å. The tail has a length of 560 Å and terminates into a baseplate with three radiating tail fibres of ˜190 Å in length.</p><p id="P19">Comparing the structures of the DNA-filled and empty virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>) revealed that the latter lacked the baseplate and tail fibres, suggesting that these parts are jettisoned during DNA ejection. However, the length of the tail tube remains unaltered, demonstrating that it is rather stiff and does not contract during DNA ejection, as is typical for siphoviruses that infect bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Moreover, the heads of filled and empty viruses showed no significant differences, indicating that DNA release does not lead to any structural changes in the head.</p><p id="P20">Structural interpretation and atomic model building were informed by a proteomic analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Materials and Methods</xref>), as well as AlphaFold2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>] predictions (Supplementary Dataset 1). Mass spectrometry analysis of the infectious virions was performed, which led to the identification of several structural proteins (Supplementary Table 1). Only one protein band showed an exact match to the predicted amino acid sequence of the protein gp29 (GenBank accession QAS68862.1). gp21 and gp14 were not detected, but the hypothetical proteins gp20, gp17, and gp43 were identified, suggesting a potential role as structural proteins. Full peptide data are provided in in Supplementary Dataset 2.</p><p id="P21">AlphaFold2 was used to predict the structures of each of the 68 proteins encoded by the genome of HFTV1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], as monomers, and various multimers where hardware capacity allowed. This expedited the assignment and refinement of confidently annotated sequences and allowed candidate proteins with no identified proteomic counterpart to be shortlisted.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The head has right-handed <italic>T</italic> = 7 icosahedral symmetry and is studded with turrets</title><p id="P22">Icosahedral symmetric averaging of the viral capsid produced a 2.36 Å map (Cryo-EM Flowchart 1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>), which was used to build an atomic model. The capsid forms a right-handed (<italic>dextro</italic>) icosahedron of a triangulation number <italic>T</italic> = 7 (<italic>h</italic> = 2, <italic>k</italic> = 1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]), made up of 60 copies of the 7-protein asymmetric repeating unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). While <italic>T</italic> = 7 icosahedral quasi-symmetry is characteristic of several bacterial siphoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>], the handedness of HFTV1’s capsid is unusual, as most resolved structures of both tailed and untailed <italic>T</italic> = 7 icosahedral viral capsids display left-handed (<italic>laevo</italic>) symmetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. To date, only a handful of other viruses have been shown to form <italic>T</italic> = 7 <italic>dextro</italic> capsids via structural analysis, including three tailed bacteriophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>] and the untailed eukaryotic papovaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>].</p><p id="P23">The base layer of the capsid consists of gp19, which is the major capsid protein (MCP). The HFTV1 MCP forms alternating pentamers and hexamers, which interact through asymmetric MCP trimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In each trimer, the MCPs adopt three distinct conformations. Around the portal, the conformation of MCP is again different from those found in the asymmetric trimers, to accommodate the capsid-portal interface. Across the capsid, 13 different MCP conformations were found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3a</xref>, Supplementary Movie 2).</p><p id="P24">The DALI server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>] revealed that HFTV1 MCP is structurally homologous to MCPs of tailed bacteriophages. The top hits were MCPs of Mycobacterium phage Che8 (PDB-8E16; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]), Klebsiella phage Kp9 (PDB-7Y23), Mycobacterium phage Ogopogo (PDB-8ECN; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]), and bacteriophage HRP29 (PDB-8ELD). Interestingly, the MCP of HFTV1 is missing the N-terminal amino acids 1–100 compared to the protein sequence predicted from the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3b</xref>), suggesting that the protein is post-translationally processed, possibly during the maturation of the virus. Lacking the first 100 amino acids, HFTV1 MCP fits the classical HK97 fold. The interior-facing surfaces of the MCP are highly negatively charged, which has been suggested to prevent the packaged DNA from sticking to the capsid, thus facilitating rapid release upon infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>].</p><p id="P25">The trimeric MCP interfaces are bound by trimers of gp18, the capsid stabilisation protein (CSP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Across the icosahedral capsid, these CSP trimers are arranged in a series of hexagonal and pentagonal rings, which coincide with the faces and vertices of the icosahedron respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). HFTV1 CSP binds the outer surface of each MCP trimer, thus stabilising the capsid architecture.</p><p id="P26">According to DALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>], HFTV1 CSP is homologous to capsid proteins from tailed bacteriophages, such as the head fibre gp8.5 N base of bacteriophage phi29 (PDB-6QYY; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]), the capsid stabilising protein of the marine siphovirus TW1 (PDB-5WK1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]), and the Cyanophage Pam3 capsid protein (PDB-8HDT; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]).</p><p id="P27">In the MCP hexamer, each subunit contains two intermolecular Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Moreover, the interfaces between two MCPs within the hexamer coordinate two additional Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions each. Another Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion is coordinated at the MCP-CSP interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>). In the MCP pentamer, each subunit coordinates three intermolecular Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions instead of two. One Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion is located at each MCP-MCP interface and one Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion at the MCP-CSP interface. Additionally, each CSP trimer binds a potassium ion on a molecular three-fold axis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4b</xref>). The extensive intra- and intermolecular metal ion coordination suggests a stabilising role of these divalent ions.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The DNA packaging in the head is revealed</title><p id="P28">Aiming to understand how the dsDNA genome packs into the capsid of HFTV1, we first removed the capsid protein density from an unsymmetrised (C1) map of the capsid via particle subtraction and then refined the remaining DNA density using CryoSPARC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>] (Cryo-EM Flowchart 2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). To improve the resolution of the innermost layers, as well as the poorly resolved areas close to the portal and at the opposite pole of the capsid, we performed particle subtraction of these areas and refined them separately (Cryo-EM Flowchart 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). We found that the DNA is arranged in ten concentric shells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Two termini of the dsDNA were observed; one projecting through the portal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) and the other likely located in the outermost layer, tracing the circumference of the portal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P29">In maps of the capsid-tail interface where no symmetry was applied, the DNA surrounding the portal is better resolved than in other areas of the capsid. This indicates that the dsDNA is well ordered and aligned with the capsid, suggesting that it is perhaps anchored in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d–h</xref>). The twist and base pairs of the dsDNA can be clearly discerned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d–f</xref>) and modelling a dsDNA molecule into the density indicated that it has B-DNA conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>), as opposed to the A-conformation reported for Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus 2 (SIRV2) and several other viruses infecting hyperthermophilic archaea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>]. In other dsDNA viruses such as siphoviruses and herpesviruses, tightly packed layers of DNA are observed, with higher resolution in the outer layers, as well as around the portal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>] and B-form DNA is also commonly observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>].</p><p id="P30">Interestingly, the dsDNA is particularly well resolved at hexagonal capsid faces that coincide with the turrets proximal to the portal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e–h</xref>). Here, two adjacent DNA strands of the first layer align with the interior-facing side of the MCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e–h</xref>). It is conceivable that the hexagonal vertices act as anchoring points for the DNA and help coordinate the packing.</p><p id="P31">The very centre of the capsid shows greater density than the outermost DNA layers. To investigate whether this central density consisted of a specialised region, potentially housing cargo proteins, we attempted masked refinement of this area. The resulting map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, Layers 9 and 10) indicated that the central density mostly consists of DNA, namely the two central layers that are more densely packed than the ten outer layers surrounding them.</p><p id="P32">From the terminus near the portal, the DNA forms spooled layers with an incline of 17° relative to the base of the portal. The centre-centre distances between the DNA strands measure 25 Å within the same layer, as well as across layers 1–7. This agrees with previous observations of the spooled organisation of dsRNA, in which strands in the same layer are separated by 26 Å [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>]. However, the interstrand distance across dsRNA layers is 29 Å [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>], indicating that the dsDNA within HFTV1 displays tighter packing. The dsDNA also displays variations in the inclination across layers, with the outer six layers (1–6) displaying similar inclinations of 16°, 18°, 17°, 17°, 17°, and 16°. Layers 7–9 were not resolved well enough to accurately measure the incline of the DNA.</p><p id="P33">In the inner core, the distances between DNA strands are reduced to 23 Å and the incline is 11° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). This contrasts with previous observations of dsRNA, in which the inner layer does not follow the spooled organisation and instead forms a barrel-like structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>], whereas in the case of HFTV1, it appears that the dsDNA maintains the spooling organisation throughout. Furthermore, dsRNA structures display multiple points where the strands move between layers, corresponding to the capsid vertices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>]. In contrast, the dsDNA of HFTV1 forms depressions in these regions but does not seem to move between layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). It is currently unclear what causes these depressions, as no protein or other densities were observed that could be responsible.</p><p id="P34">Our data also did not conclusively reveal any protein densities that could facilitate this closer packing in the centre, so the mechanism for the observed packaging transition currently remains enigmatic. As we were not able to clearly resolve the very centre of the core, the presence of auxiliary packaging proteins remains a possibility. Analysing the genome of HFTV1 using InterPro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>], HHpred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>], and arCOG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>], we identified various gene products with predicted DNA-binding functions, including various Zn-finger proteins (Supplementary Datasets 3 and 4), however, the precise function of these proteins remains to be elucidated by further experimentation.</p><p id="P35">While the DNA could be traced for large areas, pockets of disorder remain. This particularly applies to the poles of the spooled dsDNA. Due to the incline of the spooled DNA, these regions do not coincide with the poles of the capsid, but instead with triangular faces near the poles. The top pole of the dsDNA also shows another degree of disorder, likely due to different paths of descent into the inner layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), which have been averaged together and could not be separated in classification.</p><p id="P36">Based on our data, we can describe the spooling path of the dsDNA in HFTV1. From the well-ordered terminus circling the portal at the bottom pole, the DNA winds up towards the top pole, forming the outer layer. At the pole opposite the portal, the DNA then descends into the second layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). From here, the DNA likely spools back down towards the pole at the portal, where the spooling direction is reversed again. This spooling path repeats nine times, until the DNA finally reaches the central core and protrudes back through the portal.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The turrets have a putative catalytic deacetylase domain</title><p id="P37">Each of the hexagonal MCP of HFTV1 forms the base of a turret. In icosahedral and unsymmetrised averages of the capsid, the turrets were poorly resolved – an indication for flexibility. To improve the resolution of the turret map, localised reconstruction techniques were employed to take advantage of both the symmetric distribution and local symmetry of the turrets (Cryo-EM Flowchart 1). Particles were symmetry-expanded around the five-fold-symmetric head-tail axis, sampling the five particularly well-defined turret complexes immediately adjacent to the portal. Three-fold rotational (C3) averaging focused on a single turret position produced a 2.36 Å resolution map (Cryo-EM Flowchart 1). Turrets were found to consist of two separate proteins; a base formed of a hexamer of gp30 (turret base protein, HFTV1 TBP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), and a trimeric turret head protein gp31 (HFTV1 THP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Extensive Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion coordination involving 12 ions per turret (2 per TBP subunit) stabilises the interaction between TBP and MCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>).</p><p id="P38">Both the TBP hexamer and THP trimer have mushroom-like architectures. TBP inserts into the MCP trimer with a short stalk-like protrusion formed by a 6-stranded β-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). The THP trimer then inserts into the TBP hexamer with a longer, 12-stranded barrel with a triangular cross-section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), elevating the THP above the TBP. Six phosphohistidine residues are found at the hexamer-trimer interface between the TBP and THP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). While all these modified histidines belong to the TBP, three of them directly interact with the N-termini of the THP trimer via salt bridges.

Particles recentred on the capsid-tail interface underwent 12-fold rotational averaging to produce a 2.34 Å resolution map of the portal protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>; Cryo-EM Flowchart 1). The portal consists of a dodecamer of gp13 (portal protein, PP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a,c</xref>), which spans the capsid through one pentagonal vertex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>), followed by a dodecamer of gp26 (head-tail connector, HTC) and a gp29 hexamer (tail completion protein, TCP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The symmetry mismatch between the MCP pentamer and the PP dodecamer is interfaced by the intermediary portal interface protein gp21 (PIP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). Modelling the PIP into the map showed that its annotated genome sequence was eight residues shorter than the modelled one, suggesting that the starting methionine is different from that originally annotated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). At the portal-capsid interface, one of the MCP-bound magnesium ions is replaced by an arginine of the PIP. In addition, the PIP also has a phosphohistidine residue at position 17, which forms an H-bond with neighbouring MCP monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f,g</xref>).</p><p id="P43">In the mature virion, the terminus of the dsDNA protrudes through the central vestibule of the PP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b,c</xref>), which is lined with a ring of phosphohistidine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d,e</xref>). These phosphohistidines add negative charge to the portal tunnel and likely disfavour any DNA binding to the portal, thus facilitating rapid DNA release during infection. Comparing the portal structures of the DNA-filled and empty capsid shows that the latter has a plug-like density, which is missing in the former (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b,c</xref>). The structure of the PP itself does not show any significant differences between the two states, indicating that conformational changes in this protein are not required to facilitate DNA release during infection.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>A complete structure of the tail and tape measure protein</title><p id="P44">Particles recentred on the tail underwent refinement applying C3 symmetry, which resolved the tail at 2.45 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). The tail region begins with dodecameric gp26 (head-tail connector, HFTV1 HTC), which interacts with the portal protein to maintain a conduit through which DNA can pass. This is followed by hexameric gp29 (tail completion protein, HFTV1 TCP), and subsequently, 11 copies of hexameric gp35 (tail tube protein, HFTV1 TTP) making up the bulk of the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a,b,d</xref>). Each hexameric segment of the tail is rotationally offset with respect to the next by 23.6° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>).</p><p id="P45">The tail forms a hollow tunnel of 36 Å in diameter. In the DNA-filled virus, this tunnel houses gp40 (the tape measure protein, HFTV1 TMP), a hexameric coiled-coil structure with alternating C-terminal conformations. The TMP reaches from the central vestibule of the first TTP near the portal to a central cavity in gp44 (baseplate hub, HFTV1 BPH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b,d</xref>). Based on our map, we could build the tape measure protein (TMP) as a full atomic model, with all side chains present. The C-terminus of TMP (residues 317–341) is well-defined in the density, with odd-numbered subunits forming α-helical structures docked into the baseplate hub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). The even-numbered subunits, on the other hand, form a β-sheet structure folding back toward the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Residues 2–316 fold into α-helical structures with three-fold symmetry, spanning most of the tail length. In the extended N-terminal part of the protein, the density remained ambiguous in various regions, and side chains were poorly resolved.</p><p id="P46">The density within the portal protein clearly corresponds to dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Additionally, we observe two densities between the DNA and the TMP, located within the TCP and HCP proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Using AlphaFold3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>], we predicted the structures of oligomers for all short HFTV1 and proteins of unknown function, resulting in a dimer of gp14 as the best match for this density. The gp14 dimer forms two globular domains, one at the N, and the other at the C-terminus, connected by short loop regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Due to the strong features of three-fold symmetry of the TMP, we were unable to align particles based on the weaker features of gp14 and the neighbouring DNA, leading to the averaging out of secondary structure details of this region. However, superimposing the dimer of gp14 as a rigid body resulted in a reasonable fit. Due to its location between the TMP and DNA, we name this protein the TMP-DNA spacer (HFTV1 TDS). In the empty virus, the TMP and TDS are absent, demonstrating that they are released during DNA ejection.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>The baseplate hub forms an asymmetric trimer carrying three tail fibres</title><p id="P47">The tail of 11 hexameric TTPs is followed by trimeric gp41 (baseplate-tail connector; BTC), which in turn interfaces with the trimeric BPH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). Notably, the BTC protein is a pseudo-hexameric trimer. Each subunit consists of two homologous domains, which have likely arisen through a gene duplication and fusion event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c,d</xref>). The BPH complex connects to the BTC via a triangular ring, from which three globular domains project (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e</xref>). The BPH coordinates Mg<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions that likely contribute to the stability of the complex. Curiously, these domains show an asymmetric configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e</xref>). While two of the domains are bound to each other, one remains unbound. As the binding interfaces of these three domains are equal, it can be assumed that they are free to interchange (Supplementary Movie 3). This suggests that the three BPH domains may undergo dynamic cycles of binding and unbinding, which in turn may be important for the ability of the virus to dock to or penetrate the S-layer.</p><p id="P48">The BPH is also the anchor point for three tail fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>). The tail fibres are anchored at the N-terminus of each BPH subunit and radiate away in a ˜45° angle with respect to the BPH. This interaction is stabilised by extensive hydrogen bonds and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion coordination. A DynaMight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>] analysis revealed that the tail fibres are highly flexible with respect to the BPH, likely aiding their ability to dock to the S-layer at the cell surface (Supplementary Movie 4).</p><p id="P49">Alphafold2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>] suggested that the tail fibres are formed as a homotrimer of gp42 (tail fibre protein, HFTV1 TFP) and this was in agreement with atomic model building via ModelAngelo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Three TFPs come together to form a base, followed by a β-helix, a stalk, and a head. The TFPs coordinate Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4c</xref>), which likely stabilise the trimer interface. According to DALI, the BPH shows some homology with xylanases and glycosaminidases (Supplementary Dataset 5). For the TFs, DALI suggests some homology with the CspB protease from <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> (PDB-4I0W; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>]), albeit the Z-score is very low. This may hint at the BPH and TFs playing a role in binding to the surface glycans of <italic>H. gibbonsii</italic> and even the degradation of the S-layer.

To investigate whether HFTV1 is indeed related to bacteriophages, we performed a homology analysis for each component protein of HFTV1 using the DALI server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. Probable homology (Z-scores between 8 and 20) with proteins of bacteriophages was determined for the majority of HFTV1 structural proteins.

Other proteins that convey specific adaptations to the archaeal host, such as the turret heads proteins, appear to have evolved high specificity for HFTV1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P55">Based on our structure of the HFTV1 virion, a comparative analysis of the HFTV1 structural proteins that showed the presence of glycan binding sites, and previous observations of particle attachment, a multistep adsorption mechanism of viral binding can be deduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). We propose that HFTV1 initially adheres reversibly to host glycans via the N-terminal carbohydrate-binding module of the turret head protein, which forms the outermost region of the turrets. Concurrently, the C-terminal region of turret head protein, which possesses putative glycoside deacetylase/hydrolase activity, starts degrading the glycan matrix of the host cell. This enzymatic activity weakens the protective Surface layer lattice of <italic>H. gibbonsii</italic>, which causes the rigid structure to loosen and expose the underlying membrane. The gradual degradation of the host glycans enables the viral particle to bring its tail apparatus closer to the cell membrane and may expose a new binding site, facilitating baseplate anchoring and viral reorientation. We suggest that this crucial step is mediated by the carbohydrate/galactose-binding domain on the C-terminal end of the baseplate hub. The baseplate, which serves as an anchor point on the cell membrane, secures the viral particle firmly to the host cell. This attachment by the baseplate, which is irreversible in many other viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>], reorients the virus so that the tail axis is aligned perpendicularly to the cell surface. The baseplate likely interacts with either remaining glycan residues on the S-layer or lipid-glycan carriers embedded in the membrane. It is conceivable that the potentially dynamic baseplate structure serves as a lock-and-key mechanism to open or disrupt the S-layer proteins, creating a pathway for virus genome entry. Trimeric baseplates with carbohydrate-binding domains have also been reported for bacteriophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>].</p><p id="P56">The tail has a length of 560 Å, which exceeds the distance between <italic>H. gibbonsii</italic> S-layer and membrane, which is ˜200 Å in <italic>H. volcanii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>] and likely similar in <italic>H. gibbonsii</italic>. This enables the virus to penetrate the S-layer and the membrane to create a conduit from the viral portal complex into the host cell, which is then used to inject the viral genome. Some phages have peptidoglycan hydrolysing activity in their tape measure proteins to degrade bacterial envelope components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>]. Proteolytic domains are not evident in the TMP of HFTV1, suggesting that the virus does not employ this proteolysis mechanism to overcome the S-layer of <italic>H. gibbonsii</italic>. Instead, the tail may penetrate the envelope mechanically, akin to a needle. Genome release is associated with structural changes in the distal tail region of HFTV1, including the detachment of the baseplate hub domain and dissociation of the tail fibres. These changes suggest that the baseplate and tail fibres are involved not only in anchoring the virus, but also in triggering the genome ejection process.</p><p id="P57">To our knowledge, this is the first example of archaeal virion containing structural proteins with carbohydrate-degrading domains. However, carbohydrate-binding and/or hydrolytic proteins have been abundantly reported as components of bacteriophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>]. Several of these proteins are involved in hydrolysis of the bacterial peptidoglycan layer, presumably to gain access to the cell membrane. In the large majority of cases, these carbohydrate binding/hydrolytic proteins form the tail spike, baseplate, or are part of the tail fibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>]. Interestingly, P22 podophage infecting <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> has a peptidoglycan/murein hydrolase (gp4) inserted in the head structure that degrades peptidoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>].

Thus, multistep adsorption processes are common among bacteriophages (i.e. phage λ, T5, SPP1). Usually, binding to cell envelope saccharides is the first reversible step that maintains and transitorily orients the phage before specific receptor recognition occurs in the second step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>].</p><p id="P58">In HFTV1, the carbohydrate binding domain in the turret head protein likely serves as a first anchoring point of the viruses to the cell surface. This reversible binding step increases the chances that a successful irreversible binding (via the base plate and tail fibres) will take place, which then triggers DNA ejection and hence infection. As no homologues of the turret head protein were found in other haloarchaeal viral genomes, the described strategy could be specific to HFTV1. Indeed, HFTV1 was shown to have adsorption rate that is several orders of magnitudes faster than those known for other haloarchaeal viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. However, since quite a number of baTVs contain glycan binding proteins, and the archaeal cell surface is highly glycosylated, we expect that structural analysis of other haloarchaeal viruses will disclose the presence of similar glycan binding proteins in a variety of other haloarchaeal viruses.</p><p id="P59">The spooling of the dsDNA within the virus capsid is reminiscent of that displayed in several other dsDNA viruses of eukaryotes and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>].

The tight packing and bending at high angles displayed in this structure should be energetically unfavourable, given the negative charge and relatively rigid structure of dsDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref>]. The curvature stress of the DNA may be enough to overcome the electrostatic repulsion, as demonstrated by continuum computations for the bacteriophage T7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">102</xref>].</p><p id="P62">During DNA packaging, as the internal pressure of the capsid increases, so do the durations of the burst and dwell phases of the packaging mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref>], resulting in an overall decrease of the packaging speed. Decreased packaging speed has been shown to increase disorder within the DNA layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">104</xref>]. This could suggest that disordered central layers may commonly be seen across other viruses with spooling conformations. However, in HFTV1 the central-most layers display a high degree of order, indicating the possible presence of histone-like proteins maintaining this structure. Future work aiming to increase the resolution of the packaged dsDNA may shed more light on the presence of such DNA-binding proteins in the capsids of archaeal viruses and beyond.</p><p id="P63">In summary, the structure of the tailed archaeal virus HFTV1 presented here provides structural evidence of the strong evolutionary relationship between tailed viruses of bacteria and archaea. As this is the first high-resolution structure of a tailed archaeal virus, it presents a major step forward in our understanding of archaeal viruses and opens up new research directions to answer fundamental questions in the field of virology.</p><p id="P64">Besides the overall structural similarity between bacterial and archaeal tailed viruses, HFTV1 shows unique features, such as the turrets that decorate the head and are likely responsible for glycan binding and degradation. Although the presence of a deacetylase on the capsid head is unique, a two-step binding mechanism relying on host glycan binding and degradation has also been observed for several baTVs and eukaryotic viruses. Thus, viruses from different domains of life seem to employ universal strategies for infection, relying on structurally distinct but functionally similar host-binding proteins on the viral capsid. The dsDNA spooling geometry revealed in the HFTV1 capsid exhibits previously unobserved characteristics, including a vertical spooling axis relative to the portal. We anticipate that future studies will uncover similar spooling arrangements as more high-resolution structures of DNA within capsids become available.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P65"><italic>H. gibbonsii</italic> LR2-5 cells and HFTV1 virions were cultured, and viruses were purified by precipitation and density ultracentrifugation in sucrose and CsCl as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>].
