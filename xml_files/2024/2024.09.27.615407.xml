In March 2024, H5N1 HPAIV was first detected in dairy cattle and goats in the United States. Since then, over 230 dairy farms across 14 states have tested positive, with zoonotic infections reported among dairy workers. This raises concerns about the virus undergoing evolutionary changes in cattle that could enhance its zoonotic potential. The Influenza glycoprotein haemagglutinin (HA) facilitates entry into host cells through receptor binding and pH-induced fusion with cellular membranes. Adaptive changes in HA modulate virus-host cell interactions. This study compared the HA genes of cattle and goat H5N1 viruses with the dominant avian-origin clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 in the United Kingdom, focusing on receptor binding, pH fusion, and thermostability. All the tested H5N1 viruses showed binding exclusively to avian-like receptors, with a pH fusion of 5.9, outside the pH range associated with efficient human airborne transmissibility (pH 5.0 to 5.5). We further investigated the impact of emerging HA substitutions seen in the ongoing cattle outbreaks, but saw little phenotypic difference, with continued exclusive binding to avian-like receptor analogues and pHs of fusion above 5.8. This suggests that the HA genes from the cattle and goat outbreaks do not pose an enhanced threat compared to circulating avian viruses. However, given the rapid evolution of H5 viruses, continuous monitoring and updated risk assessments remain essential to understanding virus zoonotic and pandemic risks.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>High pathogenicity avian influenza</kwd><kwd>Cattle and goat H5N1</kwd><kwd>Receptor binding</kwd><kwd>pH fusion</kwd><kwd>Zoonotic risk</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is a major global disease that continues to threaten wildlife, poultry production and human health. IAV is negative-sense, single stranded and segmented RNA virus. Wild aquatic birds act as the natural reservoirs of IAV, harbouring 16 HA and 11 NA subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The global poultry industry has been severely impacted by wild bird-driven spread of Avian influenza virus (AIV). Since the first detection of high pathogenicity avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5 subtype in 1996, its precursor A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (Gs/Gd/96) lineage has then rapidly evolved into more than 30 subclades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The current clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 has become dominant since 2021 with noticeable genotypic change from predominant H5N8 to H5N1, which then spread globally[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Panzootic H5N1 viruses have then caused numerous outbreaks in avian species worldwide with unprecedented infections. In addition to birds, the clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses have also caused several outbreaks in mammalian species, such as in minks, foxes, domestic cats, and semi-aquatic mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Human infection of HPAIV H5N1 remains sporadic. There have been 903 cases of human infections resulting in 464 deaths since 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], but only several dozen of these viruses have occurred in the recent panzootic.</p><p id="P3">However, with the increasing reports of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 infections in mammalian species, it is a concern that the virus could adapt to transmit efficiently by the airborne route which might facilitate infection of humans. While there were no reports of H5N1 virus infection in livestock like goats and cattle until March 2024, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health (MBAH) reported fatal infections of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus in newborn goats in February following the culling of HPAIV poultry housed on the same premises. The transmission may have been caused by shared husbandry and water source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. On 25<sup>th</sup> March, 2024 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus in milk samples collected from symptomatic dairy cattle in Kansas and Texas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. A dairy farm worker with conjunctivitis was also found to be infected by a clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. As of August 2024, the H5N1 virus has been further detected in cattle in thirteen states across the US. At present, the virus is thought to be predominantly transmitted through milking, and movement of infected animals or contaminated equipment between farms or states[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. The virus transmission route to cattle has been proposed as mechanical resulting in mammary gland infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. All these cases have been attributed to a single genotype B3.13 of clade 2.3.4.4b viruses, which so far has only been detected in the U.S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. In addition, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports, there have been a further 13 human cases, all with mild symptoms but either attributed to contact with infected dairy cattle (n=4) or to poultry (n=9) that had acquired infection from dairy cattle and therefore are also “bovine” origin viruses. The outbreaks in livestock and humans highlight the urgent and ongoing need for risk assessment of the virus for potential spillover to humans.</p><p id="P4">The binding of viral HA to host cell surface sialic acid (SA) containing glycans is a prerequisite for AIV entry into host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], as well as a determinant of host tropism. Influenza viruses from avian species generally have a preference towards α2,3- (SAα-2,3Gal)-linked SA, whereas human seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses have a preference towards α2,6-(SAα-2,6Gal) linked SA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], this preference reflects the predominant SA linkages found in the avian gastrointestinal and human upper respiratory tract, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. AIVs can switch receptor binding specificity to overcome host barriers and change host tropism by acquiring mutations in receptor binding site of HA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Upon the attachment of HA to SA, AIV particles are internalised into endosomes and undergo conformational changes triggered by low pH between 5 to 6 in the maturing endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. The acidity stability of HA plays a crucial role in virus transmission and host range. The HA of human transmissible viruses are generally more acid stable with a pH of ≤5.5 for membrane fusion, whereas many avian viruses have less stable HA proteins that fuse at pHs &gt;5.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. This is thought to be related to the predominant transmission routes of these viruses, human seasonal viruses transmit by the airborne route and require more stability to survive the harsh microenvironments of aerosol particles and mildly acidic respiratory secretions. In addition to pH stability, thermostability of HA has also been shown to be important for AIV transmission in mammals, and may act as a proxy for pH stability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].</p><p id="P5">The recent sustained outbreaks in dairy cattle farms raise credible concerns about the virus evolving to acquire mammalian adaptations and becoming zoonotic or potentially pandemic. HA protein is critical for receptor binding and its pH stability is crucial as an indicator of avian to mammalian host transmission. Therefore, we investigated the phenotype of the HAs of these viruses through receptor binding profiles, thermostability and pH stability comparing goat and dairy cattle H5N1 viruses compared with earlier H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses that circulated in Europe, as well as the emerging mutations in viruses associated with dairy cattle outbreaks. Our findings provide valuable insights into the ongoing evolution of H5N1 viruses in livestock and their potential veterinary and public health implications.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="P6">All the procedures involving embryonated eggs were undertaken in strict accordance with the guidance and regulations of the UK Home Office under project licence number PP6471846.

We found that all the mutant viruses exhibited detectable binding to 3SLN only, but not 6SLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-4H</xref>), suggesting the most prevalent mutations in the cattle viruses are not currently resulting in a switch towards human receptor binding. We further compared the fold change in 3SLN binding between mutant viruses to wild-type (WT) TX-Cattle, T143A, D171N, I178V and Q234R showed increased binding to 3SLN by 6-, 28-, 4- and 84-fold, respectively. Mutants with Q154, A172T and P174Q had decreased binding to 3SLN by 3-, 199- and 5-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>The emerging HA mutants retained a fusion pH above 5.8, and do not confer any change in thermostability</title><p id="P35">We tested the pH threshold of membrane fusion for the cattle mutant viruses. Apart from Q154L which did not fuse until pH dropped to pH 5.8, the fusion pH of all six other mutant viruses, T143A, D171N, A172T, P174Q, I178V and Q234R, remained unchanged at pH 5.9 compared to the WT TX-Cattle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). The thermostability of the mutant viruses was also tested following heat treatment. A172T, P174Q, and I178V showed lower HAU compared to WT at 50.7°C and 51.9°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting lower thermostability. All the other four mutations, T143A, Q154L, D171N and Q234R showed comparable stability to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P36">This study investigated HA properties known to be important in conferring avian to mammalian transmissibility of influenza A viruses including receptor binding, pH of fusion and thermostability in an effort to understand the propensity of the clade 2.3.4.4b virus to cross into cattle and the ongoing risk of zoonotic or pandemic infection in humans. Our BLI data showed the H5 HA of cattle H5N1 HPAIV from Texas virus had receptor binding to avian-receptor analogue 3SLN only. The finding aligns with several studies examining the receptor binding profiles of the human isolate from Texas dairy farm worker and cattle isolate from Ohio, which consistently showed virus binding to avian-type SA receptors only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Only one recent study showed that the New Mexico cattle H5N1 virus displayed dual receptor binding to both human and avian receptors by solid-phase ELISA assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. The only amino acid difference between the HA sequences of cattle Texas H5N1 virus and the New Mexico H5N1 virus was at S336N (S320N by H3 numbering or S323N by H5 numbering). This mutation seems unlikely to contribute to changes in receptor binding suggesting the discrepancy could be due to methodological differences. In addition, we also tested the receptor binding of the virus from the Minnesota goat outbreak and the virus also did not show receptor binding to human-receptor analogue 6SLN. Overall, these results indicate that the HA genes from the recent cattle and goat outbreak viruses retained binding to avian receptors.</p><p id="P37">The pH stability and thermostability of the viral HA protein are important for host range and virus transmission. Avian influenza viruses generally have a higher pH of membrane fusion (pH&gt;5.5) compared to human seasonal influenza viruses, which require a lower pH of membrane fusion (pH≤5.5) to transmit efficiently by the respiratory airborne route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. In this study, we tested the fusion of cattle and goat H5N1 viruses, our data demonstrated syncytium formation at a pH of 5.9, indicating the virus currently has limited potential for human-to-human transmission, an essential pre-requisite to raise the level of pandemic risk. This may also suggest that this virus is currently not spreading efficiently by airborne route between cattle. To support this, although ferrets directly inoculated with the cattle H5N1 virus exhibited noticeable clinical signs and the virus replicated efficiently in the respiratory tract, eyes, and brain. no aerosol transmission was observed from infected ferrets to naïve ferrets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], a surrogate for human respiratory droplet transmission.</p><p id="P38">It has been shown that both avian α-2,3-SA and human α-2,6-SA linkages are distributed in the mammary gland of cattle, suggesting cattle could potentially be a novel ‘mixing vessel’ for AIV or be an host in which adaptive mutations towards human receptor binding might be selected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. To further test HA adaptations that could potentially increase or switch receptor binding to human-like receptor analogues, we examined the receptor binding profiles of 7 emerging mutations, T143A, Q154L, D171N, A172T, P174Q, I178V and Q234R, that map close to, or within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of HA. Our data showed that H5 HA mutants bearing any of the 7 mutations still exclusively bound the avian-like receptor analogue. We further tested whether there was any change in the required pH for membrane fusion of the mutant viruses. Q154L showed only a slight change of membrane fusion at pH 5.8, while the other 6 mutations retained WT pH of fusion. Altogether, these findings indicate that despite the presence of α-2,6-SA linkages in cattle, no HA mutations in the cattle H5N1 viruses have yet acquired receptor binding affinity to the human receptor, and the mutant viruses are unlikely to have enhanced human-to-human airborne transmissibility due to retaining a high pH of fusion of 5.8-5.9.</p><p id="P39">In summary, we conducted a rapid risk profile of the receptor binding properties and fusion pH of ‘original’ dairy cattle, emerging HA mutants in dairy cattle, and goat H5N1 viruses. None of the tested viruses exhibited binding to the human receptor analogue 6SLN and they all retained a high membrane fusion pH ≥5.8, suggesting the currently circulating bovine H5N1 viruses are unlikely to be able to efficient transmit between humans. However, it remains to be determined whether further HA mutations will emerge if the virus continues to infect and spread amongst dairy cattle, with continuing opportunities to adapt to bovines. Addressing this question will contribute to a better understanding of the H5N1 virus and its adaptation in cattle. Continued surveillance and risk assessment of circulating clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses remain a top priority to mitigate their potential impact on public health and the agricultural sector.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Graphical Abstract</label><media xlink:href="EMS199058-supplement-Graphical_Abstract.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" id="d47aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS199058-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d47aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), Iowa State University, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital for sharing cattle virus sequences on Sequence Read Archive (SRA) on National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
