It is critical to ascertain how this virus has specifically adapted to bovine cells and the molecular determinants of this process. Here, we focused on the contribution of the viral “internal” genomic segments of H5N1 B3.13 to bovine cells adaptation. We generated 45 reassortant viruses harbouring the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 and internal gene constellations from several influenza A viruses (IAV) or carrying segment swaps between distinct H5N1 strains. The recombinant B3.13 viruses displayed faster replication kinetics in bovine cells compared to other IAV. Importantly, multiple genomic segments of B3.13 viruses contribute to their faster replicative fitness. Further, recombinants with the B3.13 internal genes were less susceptible than ancestral 2.3.4.4b strain to the bovine IFN response. However, bovine (and human) MX1, a key restriction factor for avian IAV, restricted both ancestral 2.3.4.4b and B3.13 recombinant viruses. Interestingly, the latter escape restriction from human BTN3A3. Finally, recombinant B3.13 was virulent in mice unlike the ancestor 2.3.4.4b recombinant virus. Our results highlight the polygenic nature of influenza host range as multiple internal genes of B3.13 contribute to bovine adaptation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Influenza A viruses (IAVs) represent a major threat to human and animal health. These viruses have caused four human influenza pandemics and regular seasonal epidemics since 1918, in addition to panzootics, epizootics and outbreaks in wildlife and domestic animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. IAV belong to the <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>, possess eight single-stranded negative sense RNA genome segments, and are classified in subtypes based on their two surface glycoproteins: the haemagglutinin (HA; 19 subtypes) and neuraminidase (NA; 11 subtypes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Wild aquatic birds are the main reservoirs of IAV and harbour most of the known virus subtypes. Wild birds are a continuous source of infection for domestic birds, such as chickens and turkeys, which also harbour a variety of IAV subtypes. Humans, pigs, and horses instead are hosts to a limited number of IAV subtypes, which circulate in an endemic cycle within each species (e.g. H1N1 and H3N2 in humans).</p><p id="P4">Certain avian IAV subtypes including H5Nx, H7N9, H9N2, H10N8 and others, occasionally spill over into other mammalian species including humans. These spillover events almost never lead to documented mammal-to-mammal transmission chains, but they nevertheless represent a potential pandemic risk. Indeed, each of the four influenza human pandemics that have occurred since the 1918 H1N1 great influenza pandemic were caused by viruses carrying at least some genomic segments from avian influenza viruses (AIV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Within this context, highly pathogenic H5N1 is of particular concern as it is the cause of major devastating outbreaks in domestic chickens, and it has spilled over repeatedly in humans and other mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Since 2021, H5Nx clade 2.3.4.4b has spread worldwide at unprecedented levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and spilled into a variety of mammalian species such as skunks, raccoons, cats, bears, foxes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and aquatic mammals such as harbour seals and sea lions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Unexpectedly, in March 2024, a reassortant between a European strain of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b and North American low pathogenic AIVs (classified as the B3.13 lineage) caused an outbreak of influenza in dairy cattle in the US<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Affected cows showed clinical signs such as fever, depression, drop in milk production and mastitis, but only rarely signs of mild respiratory infections. Indeed, high levels of infectious virus could be detected consistently in the milk of infected animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The B3.13 lineage arose after a European-origin 2.3.4.4b entered North America in 2021<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and subsequently acquired the PB2, PB1, NP and NS segments via sequential genetic reassortment events with low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAI) strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,25</sup>. Phylogenetic analysis supports the notion that a single introduction event from wild birds into cattle occurred in late 2023 or early 2024 and this has subsequently spread to dairy farms across numerous states in USA<sup>26</sup></p><p id="P7">Until this outbreak, cows had not been regarded as natural hosts of IAVs despite previous studies detecting anti-IAV antibodies in cattle sera, and experimental inoculations showing that cows are susceptible to both human and avian IAVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">27</xref></sup> (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">28</xref></sup>). Since its initial detection, H5N1 B3.13 has spread to 14 US states affecting over 400 dairy herds (as of November 2024)<sup>29</sup>. This virus has also spilled over to humans (25 confirmed human cases from contact with dairy cattle as of 9<sup>th</sup> November 2024<sup>29</sup>), in addition to cats and other small mammals in the vicinity of affected farms. Furthermore, a 2.3.4.4b virus but of a different genotype (B3.6) caused a limited outbreak in goats<sup>30</sup>.</p><p id="P8">There are several known barriers to AIV adaptation in mammalian cells (reviewed in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">31</xref></sup>). As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses must use the cellular machinery to replicate their genome, synthesise viral proteins, and assemble into particles that in turn will be released to infect other cells either in the same or a different individual. In addition, viruses must overcome the host antiviral defences that include both innate (e.g. IFN, natural killer cells, macrophages, etc) and adaptive (e.g. cytotoxic T cells and antibody-producing B cells) immune responses. Successful virus replication thus requires a myriad of interactions between virus and host proteins and as a result, molecular incompatibilities and/or host antiviral mechanisms can act as effective host barriers.</p><p id="P9">The virus glycoproteins, and HA in particular, are key determinants of IAV host tropism. Avian HA favours binding to α2,3-linked sialic acid, which are abundant in the gastroenteric tract of birds, while the upper respiratory tract of humans and other mammals express mainly α2,6-linked sialic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">36</xref></sup>. In addition, activation of HA of avian viruses after virus entry occurs at higher pH levels compared to mammalian viruses. This property can lead to premature activation of avian-adapted HA extracellularly in the acidic mammalian respiratory tract (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">37</xref></sup>). The length of the NA glycoprotein stalk has also been associated with species-tropism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">However, important molecular determinants of virus host range include also viral proteins encoded by “internal” genomic segments (i.e. those encoding PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS). For example, the virus polymerase complex of avian viruses utilise less efficiently mammalian ANP32 proteins, which are essential cofactors for IAV replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">44</xref></sup> and the nuclear import machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">45</xref></sup>. The nucleoprotein (NP) of avian viruses is the target of interferon stimulated genes MXA/ MX1 and BTN3A3, while human-adapted IAVs can escape these restriction factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">51</xref></sup>. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional protein, that counteracts the IFN response and is also associated with host-range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">53</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">Given the zoonotic nature of H5N1 IAVs, the size of the global cattle population (&gt;1 billion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">54</xref></sup>) and the high rate of contact between people and cattle (and cattle-derived products), it is essential to identify the viral determinants that facilitate bovine adaptation of H5N1. As determinants of host range are polygenic, reverse genetics approaches combined with quantitative assays are well suited to assess the contribution of individual genes to key fitness traits associated with host adaptation. These approaches constitute a biosafe, high throughput platform to develop predicting capabilities and to inform genomic surveillance systems about zoonotic risks.</p><p id="P12">Here, we sought to identify the virus genetic determinants that enabled H5N1 AIV to adapt to cows. Several other studies have concentrated on the H5N1 2.3.4.4b glycoproteins and their receptor preference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">60</xref></sup>. Here, we concentrated specifically on the internal genes of European strains of 2.3.4.4b and the North American strains isolated from cows, humans and goats, in addition to other mammalian viruses used for comparative purposes. We assessed a set of 45 reassortants carrying identical glycoproteins in a variety of <italic>in vitro, ex-vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays to assess replication kinetics, polymerase activity, sensitivity to type-I IFN and restriction factors, and virulence in animal models.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Reassortants generated in this study</title><p id="P13">To investigate the molecular determinants of H5N1 B3.13 adaptation to the bovine host, we derived by reverse genetics a set of 6:2 reassortants carrying the glycoproteins (HA and NA) of the laboratory-adapted H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) strain, and the internal genomic segments (i.e. those expressing PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) of phylogenetically distinct IAVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Using reassortant viruses carrying identical glycoproteins allowed us to focus specifically on the potential role of the other viral proteins in adaptation to bovine cells in biosafe conditions. Each reassortant used in this study is termed using the prefix “r” followed by an abbreviated name of the strain in question (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Reassortants from H5N1 include viruses involved in the North American outbreak. r-Cow(H5N1) possesses the internal genes from one of the early bovine influenza sequences (sample acquired from a dairy cow on 20<sup>th</sup> March 2024 in Texas). r-Texas/37(H5N1) is a similar, but distinct, B3.13 strain that infected a dairy farm worker and likely derives from a common ancestor of the lineage that has spread in cattle<sup>26</sup>. r-goat(H5N1) possesses the internal genes from the 2.3.4.4b virus isolated in goats (B3.6 genotype)<sup>30</sup>. We also generated a panel of reassortants with the internal genes of several other IAV from different hosts. These include the following: European-origin early H5N1 2.3.4.4.b avian viruses ancestral to the B3.13 strains [r-AIV07(H5N1), r-AIV09(H5N1), and r-AIV48(H5N1)], the pandemic human 2009 virus [r-pdm09(H1N1)], avian H7N9 isolated in a spillover event in humans [r-Anhui/13(H7N9)], a swine-origin virus isolated from a spillover event in humans [r-Eng/23(H1N2v)], equine IAV [r-Equine(H3N8)], and canine IAV [r-Canine(H3N8)] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We also generated 4:4 reassortants containing HA, NA, M and NS from PR8 and only the polymerase complex (PB2, PB1, PA and NP) from the viruses of interest. We derived these reassortants specifically to assess the activity of the polymerase complex and sensitivity to the restriction factor MX1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">51</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>); these include some of the viruses indicated above [r-Cow(H5N1), r-Texas/37(H5N1), r-Goat(H5N1), r-AIV07(H5N1), r-AIV09(H5N1), r-AIV48(H5N1), r-Eng/23(H1N2v), r-Anhui/13(H7N9)], and others of avian [r-Arg(H4N2), r-Chn/23(H3N8), r-Mld/99(H1N1), r-Nld(H7N7), r-Chn/13(H10N8)], or swine [r-Iowa/11(H2N2v), r-Ohio/16(H3N2v)] origin. Of note, with the exceptions of r-Arg(H4N2) and r-Mld/99(H1N1), all the other sequences of the segments used in these latter reverse genetic constructs were derived from viruses involved in spillover events in humans. It should, however, be noted that the virus from which the reverse genetics constructs were derived for Mld/99(H1N1) had been previously passaged in pig cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">61</xref></sup>. All reassortants were rescued in HEK-293T cells and propagated in MDCK to prepare viral stocks as described in Methods. Wild type PR8 was used as control.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>North American 2.3.4.4b reassortants display the fastest replication kinetics in bovine cells</title><p id="P15">We first assessed the replication kinetics of the reassortant viruses in MDCK cells, as this canine cell line is considered to be permissive to most IAVs. Indeed, most reassortants replicated efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>), apart from r-Anhui/13(H7N9) and r-Eng/23(H1N2v) which displayed slower replication kinetics at 24 hours post-infection (hpi). Next, to determine the replication fitness of the reassortant viruses in a bovine cellular context, we assessed their replication kinetics in bronchial explants, primary cells, and cell lines derived from cattle. All reassortants displayed minimal or no replication in bovine tracheal explants, mammary-tissue derived epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">62</xref></sup> and immortalised bovine endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">63</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>). However, both an IFN-competent cell line that we derived from bovine skin fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">63</xref></sup>, and primary nasal fibroblasts, were permissive to infection by all reassortants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b-c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>). These cells enabled us to observe differences in replication kinetics between the reassortant viruses. r-Tx/37(H5N1), r-Cow(H5N1) and r-goat(H5N1) displayed faster replication kinetics, reaching higher virus titres than their European-origin 2.3.4.4b counterparts [r-AIV07(H5N1), r-AIV09(H5N1), and r-AIV48(H5N1)], and diverse mammalian-origin IAVs at 24 hpi. All viruses reached similar titres by 48-hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>). A similar trend was observed in bovine primary nasal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b-c</xref>), regardless of whether subsequent virus production in the supernatant was measured in infectious units or by viral RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that the internal genomic segments of B3.13 IAVs provide a kinetic advantage <italic>in vitro</italic> relative to the 2.3.4.4b ancestral viruses circulating in avian hosts in Europe, and to IAVs from other mammalian hosts, suggesting that the B3.13 internal gene constellation provides a fitness advantage in bovine cells over the ancestral viruses. The closely-related, but distinct, goat-derived 2.3.4.4b virus also displayed virus replication kinetics similar to the B3.13 reassortant viruses, suggesting that more than one constellation of internal genomic segments increases replication fitness.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Polymerase activity of B3.13, related avian H5N1 and other IAV in mammalian cells</title><p id="P16">The polymerase complex (PB1, PB2, PA and NP) is one of the critical determinants of IAV host tropism. As the viruses we assessed above exhibited different replication kinetics, we next performed standard minireplicon assays to assess the contribution of the polymerase to the phenotype observed. We tested the polymerase complexes of the H5N1 B3.13 viruses, the North American H5N1 isolated from goats, the ancestral avian European H5N1 and a variety of other control viruses for comparative purposes. In addition to the polymerases from viruses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>, we used those from the Hong Kong 1968 human pandemic virus, swine viruses isolated from spillover events in humans, avian viruses also isolated from spillover events in humans and avian viruses never described to be transmitted into humans. This extensive set of polymerases allowed us to obtain a comprehensive and comparative overview of their activity in mammalian cells.</p><p id="P17">From the results of our assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>) we could arbitrarily divide the polymerases into the following 4 groups based of the levels of their activity: (i) very high, (ii) high, (ii) medium and (iv) low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>). The polymerases with the highest activity were those of the H3N2 Hong Kong 1968 pandemic virus, the H5N1 B3.13 Tx/37, and those of the zoonotic avian viruses H7N9, H7N7, and H10N8. With the exception of PR8, these polymerases were the only ones among those tested that contained the well-known PB2 E627K “mammalian” adaptive mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The group with high polymerase activity included PR8, the H1N1 2009 pandemic virus, and three swine viruses isolated from spillover events in humans (H1N2v and H3N2v). This group of polymerases instead uniquely possess the mammalian adaptive mutation PB2 T271A. Only PR8 contained both PB2 E627K and T271A. Polymerases of the ancestral 2.3.4.4b H5N1(AIV48) and the cow/H5N1 displayed medium polymerase activity. Interestingly, the sequence of PB2 derived from cow H5N1 did not possess any major known PB2 adaptive mutations, with the exception of M631L which has been reported to boost polymerase activity and has been shown to contribute to activity of a B3.13 polymerase in human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">65</xref></sup>. The viruses with the lowest polymerase activities among those tested were those from the avian viruses H1N1 (1999, Netherlands), 2.3.4.4b H5N1 AIV09 and AIV07, H4N2 (Argentina, 2011), and H3N8 (China, 2023). Interestingly, the 2.3.4.4b H5N1 isolated from goats also displayed relatively low polymerase activity (approximately 5-fold compared to the cow H5N1 and 100-fold against Tx/37).</p><p id="P19">Given the differences in polymerase activity noted between the polymerases of 2.3.4.4b (ancestral avian) and the North American B3.13 viruses, we assessed which genomic segment(s) of the latter conferred a higher polymerase activity in mammalian cells.

Individual substitution of cow H5N1 or Tx/37 H5N1 polymerase subunits with PB1, PA or NP subunits from AIV07 did not significantly reduce r-Cow or r-Tx/37 polymerase activity. However, substitution with AIV07 PB2 decreased both r-Cow and r-Tx/37 polymerase activity, although only significantly for r-Tx/37. These data were confirmed by the reciprocal swaps in the AIV07 polymerase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The AIV07 polymerase reached similar levels of activity to Tx/37 when the PB2 subunit of the latter was introduced, while neither PA nor NP derived from Tx/37 made a difference to AIV07 polymerase activity. Introduction of TX/37 PB1 increased AIV07 polymerase activity by approximately 10-fold, although this was not statistically significant. Similar results were obtained with the swap constructs between the polymerase subunits of cow H5N1 and AIV07 polymerases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The combination of the B3.13 polymerase genes confers a replication advantage in bovine cells</title><p id="P20">The data obtained above suggest that PB2 is a key determinant of 2.3.4.4b mammalian adaptation. The replicon assays, however, measure polymerase activity in transfected 293T cells but do not assess the whole viral replication cycle. In addition, as 293T are human cells they may fail to capture bovine-specific adaptive features. We therefore carried out virus replication assays in bovine fibroblasts using PR8-based reassortant viruses. In these experiments, we introduced the four internal genomic segments acquired by B3.13 viruses from a low pathogenic avian influenza virus from North America<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,25</sup>. Specifically, PB2, PB1, NP and NS were swapped between r-Tx/37(H5N1) or r-Cow(H5N1) and the ancestral r-AIV07(H5N1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a-b</xref>). We measured virus titres at 24hpi where the fastest replication kinetics of the B3.13 reassortants were most evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). Individually replacing the PB2, PB1, NP or NS segments in either of the B3.13 viruses [r-Cow(H5N1) or r-Tx/37(H5N1)] with those of the AIV07 ancestor did not reduce virus titres to the level of r-AIV07(H5N1) in bovine skin fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>). Of note, the r-Cow(H5N1) reassortant containing the AIV07 PB2, reached significantly lower titres than complete r-Cow(H5N1). However, the largest reduction in virus replication was observed when we simultaneously inserted PB2, PB1, NP and NS of r-AIV07(H5N1) into r-Cow(H5N1). This reassortant, referred to as r-Cow:AIV07 QUAD, displayed a 6:2 combination with only the PA and M segments from a B3.13 origin. Similar results were obtained with reassortants between r-Tx/37(H5N1) and AIV07(H5N1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>). Both r-Cow:AIV07 QUAD and r-Tx/37:AIV07 QUAD displayed the largest reduction in virus titres compared to the complete B3.13 reassortants, although neither reached the levels of the r-AIV07(H5N1) control. When the B3.13 segments were reciprocally introduced into the ancestral r-AIV07(H5N1), only the combination of all four segments could rescue viral replication to levels approaching the r-Cow and r-Tx/37 controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>). Therefore, in the context of a replicating virus, the increased polymerase activity in human cells provided by B3.13 PB2 is not sufficient for the increased kinetics in bovine cells, if not in combination with homologous PB1, NP and NS.</p><p id="P21">To further explore the role of the polymerase subunits in virus replication, we rescued 4:4 recombinant viruses in which the polymerases complexes (PB2, PB1, PA and NP) were paired with the HA, NA, M and NS from PR8, and compared these to the aforementioned 6:2 viruses. When bovine cells were infected with 4:4 or 6:2 viruses in parallel, it was firstly evident that each virus replicates more efficiently when its cognate M and NS segments were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c-d</xref>). Secondly, the 4:4 viruses of B3.13 origin replicated more efficiently than counterpart ancestral avian-derived H5N1 4:4 viruses, suggesting that the B3.13 polymerase complex confers an advantage in the absence of the M and NS segments. Interestingly, the r-Texas/37(H5N1) 4:4 virus had faster replication kinetics than the r-cow(H5N1) 4:4 equivalent, suggesting that the human-derived Texas/37 polymerase complex is fitter in bovine cells than the cow-derived counterpart, which is consistent with polymerase activity data described in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>). However, in the form of 6:2 viruses there was no distinction between these two strains when infected in parallel, suggesting that the presence of the cognate M and NS segments can overcome differences in replication efficiency. Furthermore, at 24 hpi, the differences in titres between B3.13 recombinant viruses and 2.3.4.4b avian-derived viruses appeared starker as 6:2 viruses than as 4:4 viruses, potentially further pointing to roles for M and NS and/or epistatic interactions.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Decreased sensitivity of B3.13 viruses to the bovine type-I IFN response</title><p id="P22">The host type-I IFN response is another important barrier to virus cross-species transmission.

First, we confirmed that stimulation of bovine fibroblasts with universal type-I IFN resulted in the activation of markers of a type-I IFN response.

However, r-AIV07(H5N1) displayed a greater susceptibility to the bovine IFN response than the B3.13 viruses, or PR8 used as control. For example, at 24 hpi, pre-stimulation of bovine fibroblasts with 40U/ml of IFN was sufficient to completely inhibit replication of AIV07 below the detection limit, while both r-Cow(H5N1) and r-Tx/37(H5N1) reached titres around 10<sup>4</sup>/ml in the same conditions. At 48 hpi, 1.6 U/ml of IFN had no effect on r-Cow(H5N1) titres, but reduced r-AIV07(H5N1) titres 150-fold on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>, right).</p><p id="P24">The key effectors of the type-I IFN response are ISGs, some of which can directly hamper virus replication, and therefore transmission and/or pathogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">68</xref></sup>.

After 72 hours we fixed and immunostained tissue sections for viral NP and MX1. Infection was very inefficient and only two slices, both infected with r-Tx/37(H5N1), showed abundant NP staining in the duct epithelium. Although this experiment was inconclusive with respect to infection with our virus panel, Mx1 expression was clearly detected in the infected cells of the duct epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5c-d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Bovine Mx1 inhibits B3.13-derived reassortants</title><p id="P25">Next, we aimed to determine whether MX1 restricts bovine influenza virus. The key IAV determinant of MX1 activity is the viral NP. As our 6:2 reassortants carry the NP of bovine influenza virus (and viruses of interest) they are a suitable system to evaluate the susceptibility of different IAVs to MX1 restriction. To this end, we constitutively expressed human, bovine or rat MX1 in bovine fibroblasts and human A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6a</xref>). In human A549 cells, both bovine and human MX1 displayed antiviral activity against a r-Tx/37(H5N1) reporter virus in a single-cycle infection relative to a chicken MX1 control gene (lacking antiviral activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">72</xref></sup>) by approximately 3-fold, while PR8 was affected by less than two-fold relative to the chicken MX1 control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6b</xref>). Neither MX1 proteins displayed the strength of antiviral activity exhibited by the rat MX1 control, a known potent antiviral gene against IAV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">73</xref></sup>. In a low MOI, multicycle assay, both human and bovine Mx1 exhibited antiviral activity against the B3.13 reassortants, although restriction of these viruses was not as pronounced as against avians r-AIV07(H5N1) or r-Mld/99(H1N1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5c</xref>).

All the reassortants based on 2.3.4.4b H5N1 were restricted by both bovine and human MX1. As expected, all the reassortants based on avian viruses, with the notable exception of H10N8, were restricted by bovine MX1. On the other hand, PR8 and reassortants derived from zoonotic events of swine viruses [r-Eng/23(H1N2v), r-Iowa/11(H3N2v) and r-Ohio/16(H3N2v)] were not significantly inhibited by bovine MX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6e</xref>).

However, this restriction factor is one of the important human host genetic barriers to avian IAV zoonotic transmission.

Furthermore, we showed that the polymerase complex of B3.13 was sufficient to provide a substantial change in replication phenotype.

Of note, both the cow- and human-derived B3.13 strain have acquired separate mammalian-adapted mutations in their polymerases not seen in ancestral B3.13 strains. A/Texas/37 (H5N1) acquired the well-described mammalian-adaptation mutation PB2-E627K, a relatively frequent avian-to-mammalian mutation that enhances cooperation with human ANP32 proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">85</xref></sup>, which is absent in the PB2 of H5N1 detected in cattle.
