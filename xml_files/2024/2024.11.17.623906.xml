To explore these scenarios we analyzed odor-evoked activity in telencephalic area pDp of juvenile and adult zebrafish, the homolog of piriform cortex. No obvious signatures of attractor dynamics were detected. Rather, olfactory discrimination training selectively enhanced the separation of neural manifolds representing task-relevant odors from other representations, consistent with predictions of autoassociative network models endowed with precise synaptic balance. Analytical approaches using the framework of <italic>manifold capacity</italic> revealed multiple geometrical modifications of representational manifolds that supported the classification of task-relevant sensory information. Manifold capacity predicted odor discrimination across individuals, indicating a close link between manifold geometry and behavior. Hence, pDp and possibly related recurrent networks store information in the geometry of representational manifolds, resulting in joint sensory and semantic maps that may support distributed learning processes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Learning generates organized representations of relevant information in the brain that generalize to novel inputs and serve as a basis for cognition. Representational learning is thought to depend on autoassociative memory networks that store information by activity-dependent modifications of recurrent synaptic connectivity. Classical models predict that learning enhances recurrent excitation among specific ensembles of neurons, resulting in convergent attractor dynamics that mediates pattern classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. A recurrent network can also give rise to a continuum of stable attractor states that may, for example, function as a cognitive map<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Alternatively, representational learning may be mediated by mechanisms that do not depend on attractor dynamics. Generally, networks may represent relevant information by mapping patterns of input activity to specific subspaces of neuronal state space according to semantic relationships between inputs. Hence, learning may cause geometrical state space modifications that define continuous <italic>neural manifolds</italic>, rather than distinct attractor states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> but the possible functions of such manifolds in autoassociative memory remain to be explored.</p><p id="P3">Autoassociative memory has been proposed to be a primary function of piriform cortex, a paleocortical brain area that receives non-topographic sensory input from the olfactory bulb. Within piriform cortex, excitatory neurons are recurrently connected through an extensive “association fiber system” that is plastic and under neuromodulatory control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. These observations gave rise to the long-standing hypothesis that learning results in the formation of neuronal assemblies in piriform cortex that represent odor objects and mediate pattern classification by convergent dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. However, recent analyses of neuronal activity in piriform cortex did not reveal obvious signatures of attractor states. For example, odor-evoked activity is not persistent but phasic and curtailed by inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, while convergent dynamics are expected to reduce variability, intra- and inter-trial variability of neuronal activity in piriform cortex appears high in comparison to inputs from the olfactory bulb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, passive odor exposure and active learning modify odor-evoked population activity in piriform cortex depending on stimulus statistics or task structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. For example, activity patterns evoked by different odors become more highly correlated after presentation of odors in a binary mixture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, or after association of multiple odors with a common reward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Hence, experience may reorganize odor representations in piriform cortex in a task-relevant fashion by mechanisms that do rely on discrete attractor dynamics.</p><p id="P4">Autoassociative memory has recently been explored in computational models of recurrent networks that were constrained by data from telencephalic area pDp of adult zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, the teleost homolog of the piriform cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. When information was stored in these models by enhancing connectivity among small assemblies of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, a transition from discrete attractor dynamics to continuous representational manifolds occurred when networks entered a regime of precise synaptic balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. This regime is characterized by strong and correlated excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in individual neurons and thought to be characteristic of cortical circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. As manifolds may be constrained primarily in specific state space dimensions the retrieval of information may depend on the selection of neuronal subsets for readout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">As neural manifolds in the brain may be geometrically complex and embedded in a high-dimensional state space it is not trivial to describe their geometry and to determine the impact of manifold geometry on neuronal computations. A prerequisite for the analysis of neural manifolds in biological datasets are simultaneous measurements of activity across large neuronal populations. Basic features of manifolds may be assessed using two distance measures, Euclidean and Mahalanobis distance, that together provide information about the relative separation and orientation of manifolds. Moreover, geometrical features of neural manifolds relevant for pattern classification can be analyzed using the mathematical framework of <italic>manifold capacity</italic>, a measure that quantifies the degree of separability - or untangleness - of manifolds as a function of geometrical parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Recently, this framework has been extended into GCMC (Geometric measures from Correlated Manifold Capacity) theory, which also considers the impact of multiple forms of neuronal co-variability on manifold capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Thus, manifold capacity quantifies the amount of linearly decodable information per neuron as a function of parameters describing manifold geometry and correlations. Recently, GCMC theory has been used successfully to quantify computationally relevant, interpretable features of neuronal population activity in different brain areas and tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Manifold capacity analysis can therefore be used to determine how learning modifies geometrical features of representational manifolds, and how these modifications collectively affect the classification of activity representing learned and novel inputs.</p><p id="P6">To explore how learning modifies representational manifolds we measured population activity in pDp after training juvenile or adult zebrafish in an odor discrimination task. Previous studies showed that odor-evoked activity in pDp is distributed, variable, modified by experience, and under strong inhibitory control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, consistent with observations in piriform cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Moreover, in both brain areas, synaptic currents are dominated by recurrent rather than afferent input during an odor response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, indicating that they function as autoassociative networks. In pDp, voltage clamp recordings demonstrated that excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in individual neurons are strong and co-tuned, providing direct evidence for precise synaptic balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. The analysis of neuronal population activity in pDp therefore allowed us to examine how learning modifies representational manifolds and to test predictions of computational models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Consistent with various previous observations we found no obvious signatures of fixed-point attractor dynamics in pDp. Behavioral odor discrimination training had only minor effects on the global amplitude and variability of odor responses in pDp. Nonetheless, training modified activity manifolds representing learned and related odors, with minimal effects on representations of dissimilar odors. Training modified multiple geometrical features that, in combination, enhanced the separability of manifolds representing task-relevant odors from each other and from manifolds representing novel odors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The separability of activity patterns was correlated with behavioral odor discrimination across trained individuals, indicating that representational manifolds directly contribute to learned behaviors. These results indicate that pDp stores task-relevant information not as discrete items but in continuous neural manifolds that improve classification of sensory information along relevant directions in coding space. Hence, representational learning in pDp, and possibly in other recurrent balanced-state networks, integrates sensory and semantic information into a continuous map, which may support distributed learning processes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Basic features of odor-evoked neural dynamics in pDp</title><p id="P8">We measured odor-evoked activity in an ex-vivo preparation of the juvenile and adult zebrafish brain by volumetric 2-photon calcium imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> in transgenic fish expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP6s (Tg[alphaTubulin:GCaMP6s]) throughout the telencephalon and other brain areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). 3D scanning was performed by remote focusing with a volume rate of 7.5 Hz and calcium signals (ΔF/F) were transformed into firing rate estimates using CASCADE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Activity across populations of neurons was represented by n-dimensional activity vectors, each representing the estimated firing rates of n neurons within a time bin. Most experiments were performed in juvenile fish (46 – 56 days post fertilization; 9.0 – 13.5 mm body length), which allowed us to measure activity across the majority of neurons in pDp. Consistent with previous results from adult zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, odor-evoked activity in juvenile pDp exhibited an initial phasic increase followed by a slowly decaying plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>), and responses of individual neurons were scattered throughout pDp without an obvious odor-related topography.</p><p id="P9">Previous results from pDp and piriform cortex failed to provide strong evidence for convergent attractor dynamics in response to novel or learned odors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. To confirm these observations, we examined two signatures of attractor states: (1) as a consequence of convergent dynamics, trial-to-trial variability is expected to be lower in output activity patterns than in input patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), and (2) because attractor states are stable, activity is expected to persist for some time when input is switched off abruptly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To test the first prediction, we measured activity evoked by a panel of odors in pDp and in the olfactory bulb of the same juvenile zebrafish. Trial-to-trial variability was quantified as the cosine distance between activity vectors evoked by the same odors in different trials, averaged over a 3 s time window starting 1 s after response onset. Consistent with previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, variability was high in pDp but low in the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), contradicting expectations for attractor networks.</p><p id="P11">To test the second prediction, we used Tg[dlx4/6:Chr2YFP] zebrafish, which express channelrhodopsin-2 fused to YFP (Chr2YFP) in superficial inhibitory interneurons of the olfactory bulb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. In these fish, olfactory bulb output could be silenced by targeted full-field illumination with blue light within 10-20 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). We then performed whole-cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings from individual pDp neurons to examine the evolution of network activity after rapid silencing of olfactory bulb output during an odor response. Consistent with previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, odor stimulation evoked a barrage of oscillatory excitatory synaptic currents and a depolarization that occasionally resulted in action potential firing of pDp neurons. Silencing of olfactory bulb output during an odor response resulted in a fast hyperpolarization of pDp neurons with a time constant of 65 ± 23 ms, as determined by exponential fits. Direct injection of a step current hyperpolarized the same pDp neurons with a time constant of 52 ± 16 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Excitatory synaptic currents measured by voltage clamp recordings decayed with a similar time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Hence, pDp did not exhibit obvious signs of persistent activity. Rather, network activity decayed after silencing of sensory input on a timescale similar to the intrinsic time constant of pDp neurons. Together, these observations support the notion that odor-evoked activity in pDp does not show obvious signs of fixed-point attractor dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Experience-dependent modification of neural dynamics in pDp</title><p id="P12">To explore how odor representations in pDp are modified by learning we trained juvenile zebrafish expressing GCaMP6s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> in the telencephalon in an odor discrimination task using procedures developed for adult fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> with minor modifications. During training, tanks were continuously perfused with fish water and two amino acid odors (CS<sup>+</sup>, CS<sup>-</sup>) were each added to the perfusion 9 times per day for 30 s. Presentation of the CS<sup>+</sup>, but not the CS<sup>-</sup>, was followed immediately by food delivery at a specific location. Fish were initially pre-trained as a group for 11 days before individual fish were further trained for 2 to 4 days in separate tanks (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Learning was monitored by quantifying appetitive behavior of individual fish during odor presentation as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. After training, appetitive behavior was significantly more pronounced in response to the CS<sup>+</sup> than to the CS<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), as observed in adult fish (Namekawa et al., 2018; Frank et al., 2019).</p><p id="P13">One group of juvenile fish (Arg<sup>+</sup>/Phe<sup>-</sup>; N = 9 fish) was trained using arginine (Arg) as CS<sup>+</sup> and phenylalanine (Phe) as CS<sup>-</sup> while a second group (Phe<sup>+</sup>/Arg<sup>-</sup>; N = 10 fish) was trained on the opposite association. A third group (Phe<sup>+</sup>/Trp<sup>-</sup>; N = 6 fish) was trained on Phe as CS<sup>+</sup> and tryptophan (Trp) as CS<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). After behavioral training, odor-evoked activity was measured in pDp of all fish and compared to odor responses in a control group of naïve fish (N = 6). The odor panel comprised three amino acids (Phe, Arg, Trp) and three bile acids (TDCA, TCA, GCA), representing two classes of natural odors for aquatic animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. In the olfactory bulb, activity patterns evoked by these odorants were modestly correlated within each chemical class but uncorrelated across classes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Each stimulus was applied three times for 5 s.</p><p id="P14">As observed in adult pDp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, mean odor responses in juvenile pDp followed a phasic-tonic time course, with tonic components being somewhat more pronounced in trained fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Mean odor responses to amino acids were slightly but significantly larger in each of the trained groups as compared to naïve fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>), which could be attributed in part to an overrepresentation of large odor responses in a subset of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). The cosine distance between time-averaged activity patterns evoked by the same odor in different trials was only slightly lower than the cosine distance between activity patterns evoked by different odors from the same odor category. In trained fish, cosine distances between activity patterns evoked by the CS<sup>+</sup> and the CS<sup>-</sup> were similar to the corresponding distances in naïve fish, while other cosine distances were slightly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g-j</xref>). Hence, training modified relationships between odor-evoked activity patterns but response variability remained high.</p><p id="P15">While high variability is atypical for fixed-point attractors it does not exclude chaotic attractor states. Modeling studies showed that chaotic attractor states tend to result in persistent pattern correlations, even when variability is high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. However, we found that correlations between activity patterns at different time points dropped rapidly after stimulus offset, without an obvious difference between naïve and trained animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3k,l</xref>). Hence, our observations are not consistent with the hypothesis that training establishes convergent attractor dynamics representing specific odors.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Basic analysis of manifold geometry in a computational model</title><p id="P16">We next analyzed odor-evoked population activity in pDp as neural manifolds. To characterize the geometry of representational manifolds we first analyzed two distance measures, Euclidean distance (dE) and Mahalanobis distance (dM), in neuronal state space (where each dimension represents activity of one neuron). dE was defined as the distance between the centers of two distributions (e.g., the mean of data points representing a manifold). Hence, dE quantifies the separation of prototypical odor representations in state space. dM further depends on the shape of distributions. dM measures the distance between a point (e.g., an individual activity vector) and a reference distribution (e.g., a neural manifold) in units that depend on the shape and extent (covariance pattern) of the reference distribution. dM between two manifolds is thus computed by averaging over the dM between each datapoint in one manifold and the distribution representing the other manifold. Assuming that manifolds have different shapes, dM in the direction from manifold A to manifold B (dM<sub>A→B</sub>) is usually different from dM in the opposite direction (dM<sub>B→A</sub>), providing information about manifold geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). For example, dM<sub>A→B</sub> &gt; dM<sub>B→A</sub> implies that A is more elongated than B along the A-B axis. Because dM is normalized by covariance it is closely related to the separability of two distributions.</p><p id="P17">We define a manifold representing a given odor as the distribution in state space of all activity vectors measured in response to the odor, pooled over trials. To determine dE between two manifolds, we averaged activity patterns evoked by the same odor at different time points during odor presentation and in different trials, resulting in a single point in state space (“manifold center”). dE between representations of different odors was then determined as the Euclidean distance between manifold centers. Hence, dE is symmetric for any given odor pair and depends both on the angular separation of manifold centers and their amplitudes (firing rates).</p><p id="P18">dM was determined between individual activity vectors x (activity evoked by an odor in an individual trial and time bin) and activity distributions Y (the set activity vectors evoked by another odor in multiple trials and time bins). dM is defined as <disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where μ<sub>Y</sub> and S<sub>Y</sub> are the mean and the covariance matrix, respectively, of distribution Y. Hence, dM is the effective distance between x and the mean of Y, taking into account the variability in Y. dM between manifolds representing odors X and Y in the direction X→Y (dM<sub>X→Y</sub>) was calculated by averaging over dM between each vector x in X and manifold Y. The same procedure was used to determine dM in the opposite direction (dM<sub>Y→X</sub>). Because dM<sub>X→Y</sub> is usually not equal to dM<sub>Y→X</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) matrices quantifying dM between multiple manifolds contain information about their separation and geometry along selected directions.</p><p id="P19">We then jointly quantified dE and dM for manifolds representing different odors to obtain basic insights into their separation and geometry. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4bi</xref>, all dE and dM are equal when manifolds are equidistant and spherical with equal variance. When manifolds are scaled uniformly, dE changes while dM remains constant because Euclidean distance and variance co-scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4bii</xref>). When only the geometry of one manifold is modified, dE is unaffected but dM changes between specific subsets of manifolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4biii</xref>). Modifying both Euclidean distance and geometry will thus result in specific patterns of changes in dE and dM. Matrices of dE and dM therefore contain basic information about distances between representational manifolds and about their geometry in a subset of state space dimensions (between manifold centers).</p><p id="P20">To predict effects of learning on dE and dM we simulated odor-evoked activity patterns using recurrently connected networks of spiking neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Previous models of adult pDp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> consisted of 4000 excitatory and 1000 inhibitory neurons. Learning was assumed to enhance connectivity between small assemblies of strongly activated neurons (100 excitatory and 25 inhibitory neurons), which resulted in the separation of manifolds representing learned and related odors from other manifolds. To adapt these computational models to juvenile fish we reduced network size by a factor of four while maintaining precise synaptic balance. We then simulated responses to six input patterns with response amplitudes and correlations matching those of activity patterns evoked by the experimental panel of amino acid and bile acid odors across mitral cells of the olfactory bulb. Virtual odors were thus separated into inputs corresponding to amino acids (odors A1, A2, A3) or bile acids (B1, B2, B3) based on their correlations. In networks without assemblies, dE was higher between representations of A-odors than between representations of B-odors, and highest across odor classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). dM was also higher between A-odor than between B-odor representations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Across odor classes, however, dM was higher in the direction from vectors representing A-odors to reference distributions (manifolds) representing B-odors (dM<sub>A→B</sub>) than in the opposite direction (dM<sub>B→A</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Introducing assemblies representing two A-odors increased dE between manifolds representing these “learned” and other odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>), which can be attributed to a modest increase in firing rates of neurons within but not outside an assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. This effect generalized partially to the third A-odor, but not to B-odors. dM was increased for learned odors specifically in the direction dM<sub>A→B</sub> (from A-odors to B-odors), indicating that manifold geometry changed non-uniformly (Fig. h,i). This asymmetric change in dM also generalized to the third A-odor, while no obvious effects were observed on distances between B-odors.

In particular, dM was higher in the direction from amino acids to bile acids (dM<sub>AA→BA</sub>) than in the opposite direction (dM<sub>BA→AA</sub>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>). In all groups of trained fish, dM was increased non-uniformly between different classes of odor pairs (amino acids versus amino acids [AA-AA], amino acids versus bile acids [AA-BA], bile acids versus bile acids [BA-BA]).

Second, manifold geometry changed non-uniformly. The finding that training increased dE<sub>AA-BA</sub> but not dM<sub>BA→AA</sub> implies that representational manifolds for amino acids expanded in the direction from amino acids to bile acids because the increase in dE must be accompanied by an increase in variability along the same direction. However, the increase in variability did not exceed the increase in dE and, therefore, did not compromise discriminability. In other directions, however, dM increased, indicating that variability increased less than dE, implying a non-uniform change in manifold geometry.

Manifold capacity is then defined as the maximum number of manifolds per dimension that can be embedded until linear classification fails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>).

These measures provide a statistical description of representational manifolds that is linked to manifold capacity through a mathematical characterization of how linear readout interacts with manifold structure. The relationship between manifold capacity and parameters (1) – (4) is monotonic: manifold capacity increases when effective radius decreases, effective dimension decreases, effective center alignment decreases and effective axes alignment increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>).

The increased manifold capacity was therefore due to decreases in effective manifold radius, dimensionality, and center alignment that outweighed opposite effects of changes in axes alignment on manifold capacity. A decrease in effective radius indicates that manifolds become more “compact”, thus enhancing their separability, while a decrease in effective dimensionality implies that manifolds become more constrained in specific state space dimensions.

This scenario is consistent with multiple experimental observations in pDp and piriform cortex: (1) Training of animals in olfactory memory tasks led to the emergence of task-specific responses but the continuous representation of odor space observed in naïve animals was not reorganized fundamentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.

Yellow and purple ellipsoids depict neural manifolds (sets of activity vectors evoked by an odor, pooled over trials and time points). The Mahalanobis distance from a sample point x in manifold X to the reference distribution computed from manifold Y is the distance from x to the center μ<sub>Y</sub> of Y, relative to the directional variability in Y. dM<sub>X→Y</sub> is the mean Mahalanobis distance from each point in manifold X to manifold Y.

E/I assemblies (“learning”) increased dM selectively in the direction from learned to other odors (dM<sub>A1→other</sub>; dM<sub>A2→other</sub>), and this effect also generalized to the related odor (dM<sub>A3→other</sub>). <bold>j</bold>, Intuitive illustration of the consequences of learning on manifold geometry. E/I assemblies for learned odors A1, A2 result in a directional displacement and extension of the corresponding manifolds that can be attributed, at least in part, to a modest amplification of activity within the assembly. This effect generalizes to the manifold representing a related odor (A3).

Left: P manifolds, whose geometries satisfy a given distribution, are embedded in an N-dimensional state space (representing the joint activity of N neurons) and randomly assigned binary labels (1 or -1). The manifold capacity <italic>α</italic> is the critical number of manifolds per dimension (P/N) above which the manifolds are no longer linearly separable according to their labels (right). <bold>b</bold>, Geometric measures affecting manifold capacity: schematic illustration. Radius measures how far the manifold extends from its center. A decrease in radius indicates a more compact manifold. Dimension measures the number of directions in which the manifold extends. A decrease in dimension indicates a “flatter” manifold. Alignment measures are defined for pairs of manifolds. Center alignment measures the correlation between manifold centers. Axes alignment measures the amount of directional similarity between manifolds. A decrease in axes alignment indicates that manifolds extend in more different directions. Note that these geometric measures are effective measures computed after reweighting manifold points based on their importance in classification, and thus can be different from the intrinsic geometric measures of the manifolds alone. Green and red arrows specify the relationships between each geometric measure and manifold capacity. Decreases in radius, dimension and center alignment all lead to an increase in the capacity (green arrows). Decrease in axes alignment leads to a decrease in capacity (red arrow).
