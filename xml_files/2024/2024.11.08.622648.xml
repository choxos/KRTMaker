The liverwort <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> propagates clonally through vegetative gemmae or via sexually generated spores, but our understanding of the genetic pathways underpinning reproductive decision-making is limited. GRAS transcriptional regulators are highly conserved proteins across land plants, with diverse functionality in stress and development. Here, we discover a central role for the SCLA-type transcription regulator Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> in both stress signalling and reproduction in Marchantia. Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> is highly expressed in gemma cups and gametangiophores and is activated in response to Far Red (FR) light and abscisic acid (ABA) environmental cues. Genetic dissection further suggests Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> is required to maintain gemma dormancy, gemma cup frequency, and FR-induced gametangiophore development. The sequence conservation and expression patterns of Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> orthologs in flowering plants hints towards the broader function of SCLA-type GRAS proteins in stress-regulated developmental transitions in plants.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Plants have a remarkable ability to adjust their growth, development, and reproductive strategies to a changing local environment. In angiosperms, control of flowering time in response to environmental cues is well studied in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. In the Arabidopsis Col-0 ecotype, long days, heat stress (in long days) and drought stress accelerate flowering; while short days, cold stress, and salt stress can delay flowering (Kazan &amp; Lyons, 2015). Some plants, such as the liverwort <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic>, have developed additional asexual (vegetative) reproduction strategies to increase the dissemination of genetic material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Ishizaki <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> reproduces vegetatively via clonal gemmae produced in gemma cups, and sexually via gametes produced in gametangia which develop on umbrella-shaped gametangiophores. <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> is dioecious, with male organs being known as antheridiophores, and female organs as archegoniophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Ishizaki et al., 2016</xref>), lending itself to the study of both vegetative and generative developmental processes. Recent ecological data has shown that <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> reproductive structures show a degree of seasonality, propagating mainly vegetatively through the winter, with sexual reproductive organs emerging in the spring and summer. Male organs tend to emerge first, and female organs tend to emerge later, persisting longer as the sporophyte stage develops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Duckett <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Little is known about molecular components that balance between sexual and asexual reproductive strategies.</p><p id="P3">Plants modulate their growth and development via transcriptional regulators such as the GRAS domain family named after the first well characterised proteins (GAI, RGA, SCR). GRAS transcription factors are a highly conserved family of plant proteins with diverse roles across land plants. In angiosperms, genetic studies have demonstrated key roles for GRAS domain proteins in processing environmental stimuli, for example in hormone signal transduction (e.g., gibberellic acid, GA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Silverstone <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). They also have diverse roles in stress and development, as well as in plant-microbe interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jaiswal <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Among the 19 sub-families of GRAS-domain proteins found in land plants, our understanding of the Scarecrow-Like A (SCLA) sub-family remains minimal. With a reduced set of transcriptional regulators, the liverwort <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> has been of particular interest to plant biologists as a tractable model system to investigate the role of transcriptional regulators in growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bowman <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). MpGRAS7 is the sole member of the SCLA group in <italic>M. polymorpha</italic>, making it an attractive target for functional genetics studies of this sub-family.</p><p id="P4">Genetic approaches have unravelled some of the regulators controlling reproduction in response to environmental cues in <italic>M. polymorpha</italic>. Like <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana, M. polymorpha</italic> requires long day conditions for the initiation of sexual reproduction. In short days, the plants produce more gemma cups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Benson-Evans, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kubota <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). The protein complex formed by Mp<italic>GIGANTEA</italic> (Mp<italic>GI</italic>) and Mp<italic>FLAVIN-BINDING KELCH REPEAT F-BOX1</italic> (Mp<italic>FKF1</italic>) are responsible for the integration of day length as a cue for gametangiophore initiation and are both essential for gametangiophore development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kubota <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Initiation of sexual reproduction in <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> requires not only long days but a period of continuous irradiation with Far-Red (FR) light. The FR-light responsiveness of gametangiophore initiation is dependent on PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR (Mp<italic>PIF</italic>) and is a part of the Far-Red High Irradiation Response (FR-HIR) (Inoue <italic>et al</italic>., 2019). In <italic>M. polymorpha</italic>, both the photoreceptor phytochrome (Mp<italic>PHY</italic>) and Mp<italic>PIF</italic> exist as single-copy genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bowman <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) and MpPIF activates the FR-HIR response, whereas angiosperm PIFs generally function as repressors (Inoue <italic>et</italic> al., 2019).</p><p id="P5">Several mutants display defects in the different stages of gametangiophore development. These include gametangia differentiation and gametangiophore initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Yamaoka <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>, Gutsche <italic>et al</italic>., 2023), and the folding of the gametangiophore stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Briginshaw <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). GA biosynthesis mutants are also impacted in gametangiophore initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Sun <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). The GRAS transcription factor Mp<italic>DELLA</italic> negatively regulates gametangiophore development in <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic>, as overexpression lines cannot produce gametangiophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hernández-García <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). The interaction of MpDELLA with MpPIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hernández-García <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Briones-Moreno <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>) provides a potential explanation for this phenotype.</p><p id="P6">Key regulators in gemma cup development and dormancy have also recently been identified. Mp<italic>GEMMA CUP ASSOCIATED MYB-1</italic> (Mp<italic>GCAM1</italic>) is critical for the formation of gemma cups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Yasui <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aki <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), and Mp<italic>KARAPPO</italic> is essential for the development of gemmae within the cup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hiwatashi <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Karrakin signalling negatively regulates the number of gemmae in a cup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Mizuno <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Komatsu <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Several hormone signalling pathways impact gemma cup dormancy in Marchantia. A key regulator of this is the drought-response hormone abscisic acid (ABA), analogous to seed dormancy in seed plants. Mutants in Mp<italic>ABI3a</italic>, a major regulator of ABA responses, germinate prematurely in the cup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Eklund <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). A single-copy cryptochrome in <italic>M. polymorpha</italic>, Mp<italic>CRY</italic>, is implicated in regulating gemma cup dormancy, also via ABA signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Liao <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). In addition, Auxin and ethylene are also associated with gemma dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Eklund <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kato <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kato <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Here, we identify MpGRAS7 as a key regulator of asexual and sexual reproductive structure development in liverworts. Through promoter-reporter fusions and mutant studies, we demonstrate that MpGRAS7 is necessary for appropriate gemma cup initiation, gemma dormancy, and FR-induced gametangiophore development. We further show that MpGRAS7 is a component of FR-light and ABA signalling pathways in <italic>M. polymorpha</italic>, where its expression is coordinated via its upstream promoter. We propose that MpGRAS7 contributes to a stress-induced shift from asexual reproduction to sexual reproduction in Marchantia coordinated via FR-light and ABA hormone cues. This study provides new insights into the function of SCLA-type GRAS transcriptional regulators. Future studies will address conserved roles and additional functions of SCLA-type GRAS proteins across land plants.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>SCLA genes are widely conserved across land plants with lineage-specific losses</title><p id="P8">First, we surveyed SCLA prevalence across all major land plant lineages and determined that they often exist as single-copy or two-copy genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Notable exceptions to this pattern were large proliferations in certain fern lineages (<italic>Actinostachys digitata, Alsophila spinulosa, Ophioglossum reticulatum</italic>) and absence from others (<italic>Azolla filiculoides, Salvinia cucullata, Ceratopteris richardii</italic>). SCLAs were absent from all Brassicaceae surveyed, but were present in the related species <italic>Carica papaya</italic>, a member of the Brassicales-Malvids. Likewise, SCLA is lost from all Pinaceae and Gnetaceae species surveyed, but present in the related gymnosperm <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Additional losses in angiosperms were observed in <italic>Cucumis sativus</italic> (Cucurbitaceae) and <italic>Liriodendron chinense</italic> (Magnoliaceae), indicating that SCLA has been repeatedly lost across land plants.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> is expressed in reproductive organs and responds to abiotic cues</title><p id="P9">To interrogate the role of SCLA in vegetative and sexual reproduction, we transformed <italic>Marchantia polymorpha Tak-1</italic> and <italic>Tak-2</italic> with a transcriptional reporter consisting of a 2.8 kb sequence upstream of the Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> gene start codon, fused to either a glucuronidase A (GUS) reporter (<italic>proMpGRAS7::GUS</italic>), or a fluorescent nuclei reporter (<italic>proMpGRAS7::tdTomato-NLS</italic>) gene. Plants carrying the promoter-reporter constructs showed prominent reporter activity in gemma cups and gametangiophores, organs linked to vegetative and sexual reproduction, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). This included gemmae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>), early developing cups, mature dormant gemma cups, but not germinated gemma cups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>), as well as antheridia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B-D</xref>) and archegonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>). <italic>In-situ</italic> hybridisation experiments showed a sectorised expression of Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> within antheridia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E-G</xref>). RT-qPCR confirmed transcript enrichment in gametangiophores, with a higher expression in antheridiophores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1H</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Since control of vegetative and sexual reproduction organ development has been previously linked to abiotic environmental cues such as FR light and ABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Eklund <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; Inoue <italic>et al</italic>., 2019), we quantified Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> transcripts via RT-qPCR and assessed the Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> promoter activity in thalli of <italic>pro</italic>Mp<italic>GRAS7::GUS</italic> reporter lines upon exposure to these reproduction-relevant abiotic cues. Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> upregulation was observed upon extended Far-Red light irradiation, but was absent in <italic>gras7-1<sup>Tak-1</sup></italic> and <italic>pif<sup>ko</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-C</xref>). Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> is also activated upon humidity-stress treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>) and application of abscisic acid (ABA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A-C</xref>). We found this activation to be dependent on the ABA receptor Mp<italic>PYL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> is a component of the Far-Red High Irradiance Response (FR-HIR) and of ABA-dependent stress signalling.</p><p id="P11">Consistent with its Mp<italic>PIF-</italic> and Mp<italic>PYL1</italic>-dependent induction, the Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> upstream regulatory region (URR) contains a predicted PIF binding motif alongside binding sites for ABI5, a transcription factor of the ABA signalling pathway. In addition, three ABI5 and one ABI3 binding sites were predicted in the Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> 5’-untranslated region (5’-UTR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). GUS reporters driven by the 5’-UTR only (Mp<italic>GRAS7-5’UTR::GUS</italic>) were sufficient for activation of GUS signal in antheridiophores, gemma cups, and during ABA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F-G</xref>) but did not show FR-induced GUS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>). The URR harbours the putative MpPIF binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>), which may explain the absence of a GUS signal in constructs lacking this region. We conclude that MpGRAS7 responsiveness to different abiotic cues are mediated by distinct regions of the MpGRAS7 promoter.</p><p id="P12">Looking beyond Marchantia, we find that the upstream regulatory regions of SCLA genes from bryophytes to angiosperms harbour putative transcription factor binding sites related to FR light and ABA signalling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A-C</xref>). Notably, <italic>pro</italic>Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> has an exceptional proliferation of ABI3/5 binding sites, possibly reflecting its water-dependent lifestyle. Tissue-specific expression data indicate that SCLAs are particularly enriched in seeds, anthers, and silks in monocots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4D-E</xref>), and the rice ortholog, <italic>OsSCLA</italic>, is responsive to ABA treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4F</xref>). A comprehensive understanding of SCLA roles across land plants requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>MpGRAS7 is required for an appropriate response to FR light and ABA-related stress</title><p id="P13">To further understand the role of Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> we generated three independent mutant alleles through CRISPR/Cas gene editing (<italic>gras7-1<sup>Tak-1</sup>, gras7-2<sup>Tak-2</sup>, gras7-3<sup>Tak-1</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A-D</xref>).

Members of this sub-family can be identified by the presence of a specific 29 AA stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cenci &amp; Rouard, 2017</xref>). Our work demonstrates that the <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> transcriptional regulator Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> contributes to signal transduction of the environmental cues (FR light and ABA) and controls the timing of both vegetative and sexual reproductive organ development. Given its role in balancing reproductive organ numbers and stress-responsive expression, we propose that MpGRAS7 functions as a stress-induced reproductive switch, possibly integrating environmental cues through FR light and ABA signalling. This distinguishes MpGRAS7 from other transcriptional regulators, such as MpTGA, which specifically influences gametangiophore development (Gutsche <italic>et al</italic>., 2023). To our knowledge, no single gene influencing both gametangiophore and gemma cup frequency in opposite ways has been identified previously.</p><p id="P20">Our Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> promoter-reporter fusions defined the developmental context specific expression of Mp<italic>GRAS7</italic> in gemma cups, emerging gametangiophores, and gametangia within gametangiophores aligning well with public expression data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Proost &amp; Mutwil, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Yasui <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kawamura <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) as well as an inducible expression upon FR light or ABA treatment. The promoter used to highlight these expression patterns was also sufficient to complement the <italic>gras7-1<sup>Tak-1</sup></italic> mutant, suggesting that it harbours the essential regulatory elements for MpGRAS7 functionality in both its responsiveness to the environment as well as its regulation of reproductive organ initiation.</p><p id="P21">MpGRAS7 likely links with other transcriptional regulators of gametangiophore development. In a yeast-two-hybrid study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Briones-Moreno <italic>et al</italic>.

MpDELLA is likely to be upstream of MpPIF and MpGRAS7, but no Marchantia <italic>della</italic> mutants could be obtained to test this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hernández-García <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Current knowledge of the seasonality of the reproductive strategies of <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> is consistent with the integration of the cues of day length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kubota <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) and high FR light irradiance (Inoue <italic>et al</italic>., 2019). FR light is often characterised as a canopy or shade signal, but in Marchantia end-of-day or intermittent FR irradiance is insufficient for gametangiophore induction, suggesting that <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> initiating sexual reproduction in response to FR light is not a shade avoidance response (Inoue <italic>et al</italic>., 2019). Our study indicates that <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> may also integrate drought stress signalling into coordinating the timing of sexual initiation. This notion is reminiscent of previous findings that drought stress accelerates reproduction from studies in other model plant species (Kazan &amp; Lyons, 2015).
