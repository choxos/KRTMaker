Humans excel at combining linguistic building blocks to infer the meanings of novel compositional words, such as “un-reject-able-ish”. How do we accomplish this? While recent research on compositional generalization in relational memory, action planning and vision strongly implicates a medial prefrontal-hippocampal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Baram et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Barron et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Schwartenbeck et al., 2023</xref>), it remains unclear whether the same network supports compositional inference in language. To this end, we trained participants on an artificial language in which the meanings of compositional words could be derived from known stems and unknown affixes, using abstract affixation rules (e.g., “good-kla” which means “bad”, where “-kla” reverses the meaning of the stem word “good”). According to these rules, word meaning depended on the sequential relation between the stem and the affix (i.e., pre- vs. post-stem). During fMRI, participants performed a semantic priming task, with novel compositional words as either sequential order congruent (e.g., “white-kla”) or incongruent primes (e.g., “kla-white”), and synonyms of the composed meaning as targets (“black”). Our results show that the compositional process engages a broad temporoparietal network, including the hippocampus, while the composed meanings are represented in left-lateralized language areas. Notably, newly composed meanings were decodable already at the time of the prime. Finally, we found that the composition process recruits abstract structure rule representations in a lateral frontoparietal network, rather than the predicted medial frontotemporal network, perhaps because abstract rules in language are more readily formatted as production rules rather than as relational map structures.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The ability to generalize previously acquired information to novel scenarios is essential for adaptive behavior in a changing world. While this hallmark of human cognition underpins learning and problem-solving across various cognitive domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Behrens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Dehaene et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Frankland &amp; Greene, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Gärdenfors, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Schwartenbeck et al., 2023</xref>), this capacity is particularly clearly illustrated by language. When encountering the novel word “un-reject-able-ish” for the first time, we can swiftly infer its meaning by generalizing from the known elements and integrating them according to abstract relational structure rules, such as the sequential arrangement of word parts. We excel at combining linguistic building blocks such as morphemes and words to form larger structures like phrases and sentences, thereby flexibly conveying an infinite array of thoughts and ideas. The generation of linguistic meaning relies not only on the constituent parts, but more importantly, also on the abstract relational structure rules based on which they are combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Fodor, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Fodor &amp; Pylyshyn, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Frege, 1892</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Martin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Partee, 2008</xref>). Consider the sentences “The cat chased the mouse” and “The mouse chased the cat”. Despite sharing identical linguistic building blocks, they convey distinct meanings. What neural mechanisms enable us to infer novel compositional meaning based on such rules? Does our brain represent abstract relational structure rules to facilitate meaning generalization, and if so, which circuits are recruited?</p><p id="P3">In cognitive neuroscience, extensive research has been dedicated to understanding how our brain organizes knowledge to guide flexible behavior. An influential line of inquiry has focused on how this organization is achieved through learning simplified and abstract representations of the world, formatted as cognitive maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Constantinescu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Moser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">O’Keefe &amp; Nadel, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Solomon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Tolman, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118">Zheng, Hebart, et al., 2024</xref>). These relational knowledge structures allow us to infer novel associations that have not been directly experienced, and to generalize those abstract structures to novel situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Bein &amp; Niv, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">H.

In a recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Schwartenbeck et al., (2023)</xref> investigated the neural representations and mechanisms that enable compositional generalization in the domain of vision. Participants solved compositional problems by inferring the relational positions of building blocks in a visual silhouette (e.g., a building block on top of vs. below another building block). Using fMRI, they found generalizable, relational configurations of visual building blocks to be represented in a medial prefrontal-hippocampal network. The same network has been shown to be recruited during various other forms of generalization, ranging from discovering a shortcut in spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Epstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Jacobs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Moser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">O’Keefe &amp; Nadel, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Tolman, 1948</xref>), to “joining the dots” between events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Barron et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Garvert et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Morton et al., 2020</xref>), and to inferring unknown relationships in social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Park et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">2021</xref>). It has been recently proposed that neural cognitive map-like representations in circuitry connecting the hippocampus with the medial frontal cortex can serve as a universal knowledge code for generalization and novel inference across multiple cognitive domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Behrens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Bellmund et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Stachenfeld et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">Whittington et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In the language sciences, the investigation of compositional generalization has however primarily implicated neural networks other than this medial prefrontal-hippocampal network.

This suggests that compositional inference in language might engage neural system distinct from those involved in compositional processes in relational memory, action planning and vision, challenging the notion that hippocampal-based representational codes are truly domain-general.</p><p id="P5">In the current pre-registered fMRI study, we aimed to test this hypothesis by investigating the neural mechanisms underlying the ability to infer novel compositional word meanings based on relational structure rules. Specifically, we aimed to assess whether relational structure-based composition in language recruits the medial prefrontal-hippocampal network that has also been implicated in action planning, visual composition and relational memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Baram et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Barron et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Schwartenbeck et al., 2023</xref>). To this end, we employed a recently developed artificial language learning paradigm where participants generalize abstract relational structure rules to infer novel compositional meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118">Zheng, Petukhova, et al., 2024</xref>). In this task, participants infer abstract affixation rules from linguistic exemplars, then use these rules to derive the meanings of novel compositional words. According to these rules, word meaning depends on the sequential relation between the stem and the affix (i.e., pre- vs. post-stem). The paradigm was designed to capture (i) the observation that sequential order plays a key role in compositionality in natural language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Beyersmann &amp; Grainger, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Crepaldi et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">2016</xref>), but furthermore, also (ii) the relational structure-dependent nature of compositional generalization in non-linguistic domains associated with hippocampal-medial frontal cortical circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Baram et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Barron et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Garvert et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Morton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Schwartenbeck et al., 2023</xref>).

Intriguingly, this generalization process recruits abstract rule representations in a lateral frontoparietal network that also represents abstract task representations for generative action selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">Vaidya &amp; Badre, 2022</xref>), rather than the predicted medial prefrontal-hippocampal network, often associated with relational structure coding.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Generalization of Abstract Rules for Novel Meaning Inference</title><p id="P6">To quantify participants’ ability to construct compositional word meaning by generalizing abstract structure rules to unknown context, we employed an experimental paradigm where participants learned an artificial language featuring various compositional rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118">Zheng, Petukhova, et al., 2024</xref>). During a pre-scanning training phase, 30 healthy participants were exposed to pairs of compositional pseudo-words along with their experimentally assigned meanings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each of these compositional pseudo-words comprises a known stem (e.g., “good” in “good-kla”) and an unknown affix (e.g., “kla”). We manipulated the mapping of the meaning to the affix based on their sequential position: e.g., “-kla” as a suffix means “the opposite”, whereas “kla-” as a prefix means “young version”. These position-dependent affixation rules allowed participants to compose unique meanings based on different sequential combinations of the affixes with the stems. Crucially, while the participants could infer the affixation rules from the exemplars, these rules were never made explicit to them. Participants learned the meanings of all pseudo-words in four training blocks, evidenced by ceiling level performance on a subsequent memory task where they were instructed to recall the meanings of these words (mean<sub>accuracy</sub> = 98.2 %, SD = 3.1%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To test participants’ knowledge of the abstract structure rules, we presented a new set of compositional pseudo-words that they had never encountered before (e.g. “white-kla” and “kla-white”) and asked them to imagine the meanings of the words, while recording fMRI. These novel words could be either congruent with the sequential order rule they had learned (e.g. for “white-kla”, “-kla” as suffix means “the opposite”, and the opposite of white is “black”), or incongruent (e.g. for “kla-white”, “kla-” as a prefix means “the young version of”, while it is much more difficult to infer the meaning of the young version of white). We presented the pseudo-words (“primes”) in pairs with their synonyms (“targets”), while the synonyms were always matched to the congruent condition (e.g., “black” was presented after “white-kla” and also after “kla-white”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). After 10% of the targets, participants were presented a probe question, asking whether the meaning of the target word was the same as that of the preceding, pseudo-word prime. Analysis of participants’ responses to these probe trials showed significantly higher probability of meaning-match responses in congruent (mean = 90.7%, SD = 16.5%) than incongruent trials (mean = 23.8%, SD = 32.3%; β = 4.52, SE = 0.78, z = 5.80, p &lt; .001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), evidencing their reliance on the relational structure rules for inference. These results were validated in a posttest administered outside the scanner, where participants explicitly indicated whether they considered the novel pseudo-words that they had seen during the preceding MRI scan to be meaningful or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E, 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials 1</xref>). We further included mismatched pseudo-words as a control condition, where the stems were combined with alternative affixes, so that the meaning of the compositional pseudo-words did not match the target synonyms regardless of the position of the affix (e.g., ran-white = the color of white ≠ black; white-ran = the extreme version of white ≠ black). Participants did not consider these pseudo-words to match the meaning of the synonym, and their responses in this mismatch condition did not differ from those in the incongruent condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials 1</xref>). For clarity, we will now focus on the contrast between congruent versus incongruent conditions.</p><p id="P8">Together, these behavioral results demonstrate that participants were able to efficiently compute novel compositional meaning by generalizing previously learned structure rules to novel situations. The setup was optimized for capturing neural adaptations in fMRI, and allowed us to assess activity in neural circuits commonly associated with novel inference and abstract rule-based generalization.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Compositional Meaning Representations in Language-Specific Frontal Regions</title><p id="P9">To explore the neural mechanisms associated with the compositional process, we compared fMRI BOLD responses during congruent versus incongruent primes, when participants first encountered the novel pseudo-words. The results showed greater activity for incongruent than congruent primes in multiple temporal and parietal areas, including the precuneus, the postcentral gyrus, and the lingual gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S3-1</xref>). To uncover the neural representations of the composed meanings, we exploited the phenomenon of fMRI adaptation (also termed as “repetition suppression”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Barron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Grill-spector et al., 2006</xref>). Because the repeated activation of the same population of neurons leads to a suppressed response, we reasoned that in areas representing word meanings the response of the population of neurons should be suppressed upon repeated exposure to the same word meaning. In our task, neural signals at the time of the target would be suppressed to a greater degree when that target was preceded by a congruent prime word that shared the same meaning, compared with an incongruent prime. Analysis of the contrast of interest (incongruent – congruent targets) revealed greater adaptation of fMRI activity in a broad network of brain regions, including the (pre)cuneus, the postcentral gyrus, the middle frontal gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S3-2</xref>), as well as the left inferior frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>; p<sub>FWE</sub> &lt; .001, K<sub>E</sub> = 1118, Z<sub>max</sub> = 4.47, MNI coordinates of the peak = [-50, 33, 10]), a region often associated with deriving new and complex meaning from the lexical building blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Hagoort, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Nevat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R110">Weber et al., 2016</xref>; W. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, the reverse contrast revealed greater activation during the congruent versus incongruent condition in the striatum, both at the time of the prime and the target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C, 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Based on previous work on nonlinguistic composition and generalization, particularly in the domain of relational memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Barron et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Garvert et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Jacobs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Morton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Schwartenbeck et al., 2023</xref>), we hypothesized that the process of composing novel meanings elicits activity in a circuit connecting the hippocampal formation with the medial prefrontal cortex. To test the engagement of this network, we performed additional analyses within small volumes of interest in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; defined functionally based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Schwartenbeck et al., 2023</xref>) and the hippocampal formation (defined anatomically, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Materials 5</xref>). This analysis revealed greater activity during incongruent than congruent primes in the hippocampal formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, p<sub>FWE</sub> = .045, K<sub>E</sub> = 26, Z<sub>max</sub> = 3.72, [17, -9, -20]), perhaps reflecting greater effort to resolve the generalization-based composition challenge during incongruent than congruent primes. There was no evidence for effects of prime type in the mPFC (no suprathreshold clusters found after small volume correction, SVC). In contrast to our hypothesis, during target words there was no evidence for differences in fMRI adaptation in the hippocampal formation after congruent versus incongruent primes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, p<sub>FWE</sub> = .203, K<sub>E</sub> = 6, Z<sub>max</sub> = 3.50, [29, -38, 4], SVC). Moreover, the activity in mPFC was actually greater during targets following congruent than incongruent primes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>; p<sub>FWE</sub> = &lt; .001, K<sub>E</sub> = 628, Z<sub>max</sub> = 4.26, [-12, 41, 20]). Thus, these results do not substantiate our hypothesis that novel word meanings are represented in the medial prefrontal-hippocampal network.</p><p id="P11">To probe the role of the language network in meaning inference, we performed additional SVC for the left anterior temporal lobe and the left inferior frontal gyrus (left IFG). Apart from the above-mentioned fMRI adaptation effect in left IFG for incongruent versus congruent targets, we found no further evidence for these regions in meaning composition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material 3B</xref>). Moreover, a supplementary analysis of contrasts between the congruent and mismatch conditions revealed qualitatively similar patterns of effects, thus substantiating these univariate analyses that focused on the congruent vs incongruent contrast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In sum, the process of composing meaning based on abstract structure rules, as measured in terms of prime-related BOLD signal, was associated with neural activity in a broad temporoparietal network, including the hippocampal formation. In addition, the representational outcome of this compositional process surfaced as fMRI adaptation of target-related neural activity in areas often associated with language processing, including the left inferior frontal cortex. Finally, successful meaning composition at target was accompanied by BOLD change in the striatum and the mPFC, perhaps reflecting intrinsic reward signaling.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Abstract Relational Rule Representations in Lateral Frontoparietal Network</title><p id="P13">The fMRI adaptation effect at the time of the congruent vs incongruent <italic>target</italic> likely occurred because participants already composed the newly inferred word meaning using the relational structure rules when they first encountered the primes. We tested this hypothesis directly by investigating the representations of both these relational structure rules and the newly inferred word meanings at the time of prime, using multivariate representational similarity analyses (RSA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Nili et al., 2014</xref>).

RSA allowed us to capture the relevant neural representations by computing the neural representational dissimilarity matrices (neural RDMs) based on prime-related fMRI activity for each pseudo-word, analyzed through a whole-brain searchlight. Next, we assessed whether these neural RDMs were explained by model RDMs that capture the similarities between these pseudo-words as a function of either their composed meaning or the rule that was used to compose them. Before exploring the two types of representations of interest, we first validated our RSA approach by constructing an RDM based on a model of the visual similarity of the target words to predict target-related neural activity. As anticipated, this RSA revealed significant shared representational geometry in the visual cortex, indicating that visual aspects of the word forms are represented in visual area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We then constructed a meaning model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) to capture the representations of the newly composed word meanings, in which word meanings are arranged by their semantic similarities (e.g., “black”, derived from “whitekla”, is more similar to “dark” - derived from “lightkla” - compared with “happy” - derived from “sadkla”; based on word embeddings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Mandera et al., 2017</xref>). We reasoned that the similarity of BOLD patterns in brain areas that represent the newly constructed word meanings (e.g., white-kla” means black) should reflect the semantic similarity of the composed words (e.g., “black”), as derived from this word meaning model. RSA using a whole-brain searchlight approach, showed that the newly constructed meanings were represented in left lateralized language-related areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), including the left inferior frontal cortex (p<sub>FWE</sub> = .001, K<sub>E</sub> = 98, Z<sub>max</sub> = 4.06, [-48, 17, 16]) and angular gyrus (p<sub>FWE</sub> &lt; .001, K<sub>E</sub> = 377, Z<sub>max</sub> = 4.09, [-42, -52, 48], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2-2</xref>). The pattern of these RSA effects, computed from prime-related activity, overlapped greatly with the pattern of RSA effects, computed from target-related neural activity (predicted by the same target-meaning model; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material 4B</xref>). It is also worth noting that this left inferior frontal area overlapped greatly with the left frontal cluster yielded by the univariate fMRI adaptation analysis, that is the comparison between congruent vs incongruent targets. Importantly, this prime-related meaning representation was not captured by an alternative meaning model which described the similarities between stem meanings (e.g., “white” in “whitekla” is more similar to “light” in “lightkla”, compared with “sad” in “sadkla”; Kendall’s τ<sub>stem-target</sub> = .13; all cluster-level ps &gt; .841; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material 4C</xref>). Together, this RSA analysis demonstrates that the representation of the novel meaning was already decodable at the time of pseudo-word primes.</p><p id="P15">Next, we constructed a rule model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) to capture the representation of the relational rules, in which all compositional pseudo-words ending with “-kla” are more similar to each other than the pseudo-words with a different affix (e.g., “kla-”, “-ran”, or “ran-”). We reasoned that for brain regions where the abstract relational structure rules are represented, their BOLD pattern should be best explained by the rule model (a 30*30 binary-coded distance matrix where the rules are either the same, or different). Whole-brain searchlight RSA revealed representations of the newly derived abstract rules in a bilateral frontoparietal network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p<sub>FWE</sub> &lt; .001, K<sub>E</sub> = 1639, Z<sub>max</sub> = 4.59, [59, 7, 14]), middle temporal gyrus (p<sub>FWE</sub> &lt; .001, K<sub>E</sub> = 4619, Z<sub>max</sub> = 5.48, [-54, -52, 0]), but also medial prefrontal cortex (p<sub>FWE</sub> &lt; .001, K<sub>E</sub> = 273, Z<sub>max</sub> = 5.01, [-6, 25, 38], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2-2</xref>).

Here, we investigated this flexibility of human cognition in composing novel word meaning based on previously learned abstract rules. Using fMRI adaptation, we demonstrated that newly inferred meanings are represented in the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC), a key region for constructing linguistic meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Nevat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R110">Weber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116">W. Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). While we interpret the reduced neural activity for congruent versus incongruent targets as neural adaptation, it is also possible that this difference reflects prediction error in response to incongruent targets (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R110">Weber et al., 2016</xref>). Although our current paradigm cannot distinguish prediction error from neural adaptation (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Todorovic &amp; de Lange, 2012</xref>), both interpretations support the conclusion that novel word meanings must have been composed “on the fly” and be represented at the time of the target. Furthermore, the RSA-derived finding that novel meaning representations were decodable from the IFC reinforces the conclusion that the IFC represents the composed meanings themselves rather than representing prediction error. It is remarkable that these newly constructed meanings were already represented at the time of the prime, and demonstrates that the current procedure provides a novel approach for quantifying the strength of the covert products of novel compositional inference.</p><p id="P19">While we observed hippocampal engagement during the composition <italic>–</italic> specifically when participants encountered incongruent words compared with congruent ones, potentially reflecting greater efforts to resolve generalization-based composition challenges – there was no clear evidence that the newly composed words themselves were represented in the hippocampus or the mPFC. This contrasts with our original prediction, given the critical role of medial prefrontal-hippocampal network in relational structure-based inference and generalization across domains such as vision, memory, and planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Baram et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Barron et al., 2013</xref>, 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Behrens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Bellmund et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Garvert et al., 2023</xref>). One possible explanation lies in the representational nature of the abstract affixation rules used in our task: The medial prefrontal-hippocampal network is thought to maintain task knowledge in a flexible cognitive map, with these map-like representations supporting novel shortcuts or connections that are never experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Barron et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Garvert et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Jacobs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Morton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Schuck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Schuck &amp; Niv, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Schwartenbeck et al., 2023</xref>). In hindsight, the abstract rules in our task seem unlikely to be formatted in terms of such a relational map; instead, they are more likely to be formatted as production rules (e.g., “if ‘kla’ is affixed at the end of a word, then it reverses the meaning of the word”).</p><p id="P20">To assess the neural locus of these abstract relational rule representations, we took an RSA approach. Results revealed rule representations in a lateral frontoparietal network, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and lateral parietal cortex. These regions have previously been associated with the learning and usage of abstract task representations during cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Badre et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Cole, Laurent, et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">A.

This finding concurs generally with recent findings from an imaging study in which participants generalized (value-based) information across contexts based on learned abstract relationships that could also be conceptualized as being formatted as production rules (“if in context A, then category A+ gives more rewards”, Vaidya et al., 2021). These abstract production rules were also found to be represented in a similar frontoparietal control network, with flexible switching between rules facilitating efficient cognitive control.</p><p id="P21">Notably, the brain region identified as representing newly composed meanings, the left IFC, is anatomically close to the DLPFC, a core area of the aforementioned cognitive control network associated with structure rule abstraction and novel inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Badre et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bartolo &amp; Averbeck, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Braver et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Monti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Morton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Ramawat et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">Wallis et al., 2001</xref>). This might suggest a shared system for linguistic and nonlinguistic generalization, with the left hemisphere playing a more prominent role in facilitating communication within the language network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Fiebach et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Hagoort, 2016</xref>). This interpretation is further supported by our findings of left-lateralized parietal involvement in abstract rule representations, such as the angular gyrus (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R116">W. Zhang et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P22">When comparing congruent versus incongruent meaning compositions, we observed increased neural activity in the striatum, a region often implicated in reward processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Knutson et al., 2000</xref>, 2001). This finding is surprising because we did not provide participants with reward feedback regarding the accuracy of their semantic judgments; they were not informed which words were congruent and therefore meaningful. While we must be cautious of reverse inference, this finding suggests that the process of generating meaning itself may provide an intrinsic reward. This aligns with the idea that internal rewards can facilitate the learning of grammar and new word meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bains et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Nevat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Ripollés et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">Ullman, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P23">In sum, we introduced an artificial language learning paradigm for investigating cognitive flexibility and novel inference involved in linguistic composition. We leveraged the fact that participants can infer novel, compositional meanings on the fly, based on previously learned structure rules, and demonstrated that we can capture this ability using our procedure, as we have shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R118">Zheng, Petukhova, et al., 2024</xref>). Using fMRI, we demonstrated that abstract rule generalization for composing novel meaning recruits the frontoparietal control network and that the covert mental products of the compositional process can be decoded from the frontal cortex at the time of composition. The obvious next question is whether this paradigm can be leveraged to unravel the temporal dynamics of meaning composition. Future studies could use MEG to explore, for example: (1) whether word meaning representation in the left IFC reflects the transition from the stem word to the composed target word; (2) whether the representation of the presented structure rule shifts to its reversed-order rule when the latter results in successful composition.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P24">The study was approved by the local ethics committee (METC Oost-Nederland, 2014/288) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

While we illustrate the design using English examples, the actual materials were in participants’ native language, Dutch. The affix altered the word meaning depending on its position and led to unique compositional meanings in different sequential combinations with the stems. We made sure that this sequential order rule could not be explained by the word class of the stems by misaligning the transitions (e.g., “-kla” turns an adjective to an adjective, whereas “kla-” turns a noun into a noun, however the same rule does not hold for affix “ran”, where both affix positions turn a noun into an adjective). In total, six affix meanings were selected, each with five exemplar words. These six affix meanings were assigned to three affix forms as prefix and suffix, respectively. The meaning-form assignment was counterbalanced across participants. In this way, we ensured the fMRI effects were not confounded by visual input. We also made sure that the compositional words do not resemble existing Dutch words.</p><p id="P27">For the testing phase in the scanner, a separate set of compositional pseudo-words (i.e., not presented in the learning) was created using another 30 stems. These pseudo-words were manipulated using the same affixation rules. Specifically, we manipulated the way in which the affixes are attached to the new stems, with each stem appearing in three different experimental conditions: (1) order-congruent: affixes are attached at the end, or at the beginning of the stem so that the novel compositional word is meaningful, given the position of the affix relative to the stem (e.g., white-kla = the opposite of white = black); (2) order-incongruent: affixes are attached at the end or beginning of the stem so that the novel compositional word is not meaningful, if participants had extracted the position-dependent rules from training (e.g., kla-white = the small version of white = meaningless). We made sure that, in this case, there was no possibility of inferring any meaning for the incongruent words using the sequential order rule; (3) mismatch: the stems are combined with alternative affixes, so that the novel compositional words are meaningless, regardless of the position of the affix (e.g., ran-white = “the color of” white = meaningless; white-ran = “the extreme version of” white = meaningless). Note that the items in the mismatch condition were twice as many as the congruent or the incongruent condition, due to the counterbalancing of the affix positions (e.g., white-kla is a congruent word, kla-white is an incongruent word, but both ran-white and white-ran are mismatch words). For all pseudo-words in the training phase and all order-congruent words in the testing phase, we made sure that there is an existing Dutch synonym which is not a complex word itself, to avoid a direct mapping of affix meanings. This synonym was paired with pseudo-words in all three conditions as the target word, during the scanning session. Given the uniquely powerful compositionality of language, it turned out to be impossible to ensure that all mismatch pseudo-words were meaningless. Instead, we ensured that in those rare cases, the meaning did not correspond to the target word.

Volume-based spatial normalization to one standard space (MNI152NLin2009cAsym) was performed through nonlinear registration with antsRegistration (ANTs 2.3.3), using brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template. The following template was selected for spatial normalization: ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Fonov et al., 2009</xref>, RRID:SCR_008796; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin2009cAsym).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Functional Data Preprocessing</title><p id="P44">For each of the 3 BOLD blocks per participant, the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated by aligning and averaging 1 single-band references (SBRefs). Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 6.0.5.1:57b01774, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Jenkinson et al., 2002</xref>). BOLD blocks were slice-time corrected to 0.696s (0.5 of slice acquisition range 0s-1.39s) using 3dTshift from AFNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Cox &amp; Hyde, 1997</xref>, RRID:SCR_005927). The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying the transforms to correct for head-motion. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as preprocessed BOLD in original space, or just preprocessed BOLD. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using bbregister (FreeSurfer) which implements boundary-based registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Greve &amp; Fischl, 2009</xref>). Co-registration was configured with six degrees of freedom. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the preprocessed BOLD: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and three region-wise global signals. FD was computed using two formulations following Power (absolute sum of relative motions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Power et al., 2014</xref>) and Jenkinson (relative root mean square displacement between affines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Jenkinson et al., 2002</xref>). FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional block, both using their implementations in Nipype (following the definitions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Power et al., 2014</xref>). The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction (CompCor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Behzadi et al., 2007</xref>). Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the preprocessed BOLD time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128s cut-off) for the two CompCor variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 2% variable voxels within the brain mask. For aCompCor, three probabilistic masks (CSF, WM and combined CSF+WM) are generated in anatomical space. The implementation differs from that of Behzadi et al. in that instead of eroding the masks by 2 pixels on BOLD space, the aCompCor masks are subtracted a mask of pixels that likely contain a volume fraction of GM. This mask is obtained by dilating a GM mask extracted from the FreeSurfer’s aseg segmentation, and it ensures components are not extracted from voxels containing a minimal fraction of GM. Finally, these masks are resampled into BOLD space and binarized by thresholding at 0.99 (as in the original implementation). Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the k components with the largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components’ time series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from consideration. The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file. The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and global signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Satterthwaite et al., 2013</xref>). Frames that exceeded a threshold of 0.5 mm FD or 1.5 standardised DVARS were annotated as motion outliers. The BOLD time-series were resampled into standard space, generating a preprocessed BOLD block in MNI152NLin2009cAsym space. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. All resamplings can be performed with a single interpolation step by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using antsApplyTransforms (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Lanczos, 1964</xref>). Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using mri_vol2surf (FreeSurfer).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Behavioral Analysis</title><sec id="S22"><title>Preprocessing</title><p id="P45">As a sanity check, we confirmed that all participants scored above chance-level (25%) in the memory test after the last block of learning, and recalled more than half of the learned words in the posttest.</p><p id="P46">Participants’ written responses to the pseudo-word meaning in the posttest were coded as (1) matching the synonym, (2) meaningless, (3) creative, unexpected answers (e.g., when one consider a mismatch pseudo-word “human-kla”, the opposite of human, to be “animal”), and (4) unexpected but incorrect answers (e.g., when one confused the meaning of different affix forms, mistook “warm-ran” as “warm-kla‘ and reported the meaning to be “cold”, the opposite of warm). We excluded the unexpected cases in the analysis, which concerns 4.8% of the trials. As a result of the paired presentations in the priming task (e.g., “white-kla” is always followed by “black”), when participants indicated the pseudo-word to be meaningful, they usually provided the target synonym to be the inferred meaning (Kendall’s τ = .98, p &lt; .001). Therefore, we used the second measure (i.e., the percentage of inferred meaning to match the synonym word) as an indicator for participants’ explicit inference, given that it provides more certainty than a binary choice. Based on the posttest, we excluded participants who failed to learn the structural affixation rules (N = 4, of which 2 were the same participants excluded due to MRI quality control). They were defined as those who consider more than half of the pseudo-words in the mismatch condition to be meaningful, or more than half of the pseudo-words in the congruent condition to be meaningless.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p id="P47">We performed the statistical analyses of behavioral data using generalized linear mixed models with the <italic>glmmTMB</italic> package (Version 1.9.11, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Brooks et al., 2017</xref>) in R (Version 4.1.0; R Core Team, 2017).

This phenomenon is often used as a tool to infer representational overlap by assessing the relative suppression/adaptation between two different stimuli. To test the univariate fMRI adaptation effects, we implemented an event-related generalized linear model (GLM) in SPM 12. The GLM modeled both events of the prime and the target, and contained separate onset regressors for each of the four experimental conditions (i.e., congruent, incongruent, and 2 times counterbalanced mismatch conditions to ensure the same amount of trials per type of affixes). Furthermore, the GLM contained an onset regressor for the probe trials and a button press regressor as a regressor of no interest. All regressors were convolved with a canonical haemodynamic response function. Because of the sensitivity of the blood oxygen level-dependent signal to motion and physiological noise, we included in the GLM the framewise displacement, six rigid-body motion parameters (three translations and three rotation), six anatomical component-based noise correction components (aCompCorr) and all the cosine regressors estimated by fmriprep as confound regressors for denoising. Each block was modeled separately within the GLM.</p><p id="P50">We compared congruent versus incongruent prime-related activities to assess the computational processes as a function of sequential order rules, and congruent versus incongruent target-related activities for the compositional outcome. In addition, we had included in our preregistration a contrast between congruent/incongruent versus mismatch conditions for successful inference. However, given that our participants did not distinguish incongruent and mismatch conditions in their behavioral responses, it makes little sense to investigate this contrast. Instead, we compared congruent versus mismatch prime- and target- related activities as a control regardless of sequential order rules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material 3</xref>). The contrast images of all participants were then analyzed as a second-level random effects analysis. Our a priori hypothesis suggests the engagement of a medial prefrontal-hippocampal network for compositional generalization. To test this, we performed SVC using an anatomically defined ROI combining the hippocampal formation (incl. hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, subiculum), as well as a functionally defined medial prefrontal (mPFC) ROI. The hippocampal mask is defined using the Juelich histological atlas with a probabilistic threshold of 50%. The mPFC mask is defined based on previous study on conjunctive representation of building blocks in specific relational positions (t<sub>29</sub> &gt; 2.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">Schwartenbeck et al., 2023</xref>). We considered our results significant if they survived family-wise error (FWE) correction at the cluster-level of P &lt; 0.05 within these masks. To explore the engagement of key language areas, we performed additional SVC using two anatomically defined masks: the left inferior gyrus, IFG, and the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL). Both masks are defined using the Harvard-Oxford cortical structural atlas with a probabilistic threshold of 30% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material 5</xref>). Activations in other brain regions were only considered if they survived whole-brain cluster-level FWE correction at P&lt;0.05. All statistical parametric maps visualized in the manuscript are thresholded at P&lt;0.001 uncorrected and unmasked for illustration.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Multivariate Representational Similarity Analysis</title><p id="P51">To decode the representations of both the relational rules and the newly inferred word meanings at the time of prime, we adopted a multivariate RSA approach. In brief, RSA allows for the comparison of representational geometry in computational models and neural response patterns in the brain elicited by our stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Nili et al., 2014</xref>). By comparing the representational dissimilarity matrix predicted by the computational models of interest to those measured in the brain, RSA can therefore uncover representations of interest, such as abstract relational rules in the brain.</p><p id="P52">To capture the multivariate representation of word meaning and affixation rules, we ran two additional GLMs. The first GLM modeled events of the prime and contained separate onset regressors for each of the 30 compositional pseudo-words regardless of whether they were congruent or incongruent (e.g., a single onset regressor was used for both “white-kla” and “kla-white”). The second GLM again modeled the prime, but separately for the congruent and the incongruent conditions (e.g., one onset regressor was used for “white-kla” and another one for “kla-white”). Both GLMs contained one regressor for all the prime trials in the mismatch condition, one regressor for all the target words, one regressor for the probe trials, and one regressor for the button presses as regressors of no interest. All regressors were convolved with a canonical haemodynamic response function. Both GLMs included the same confound regressors as in the univariate analysis. Each block was modeled separately within the GLMs.</p><p id="P53">Subsequently, we computed the neural representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) for the 30 items at prime from the parameter estimate maps derived from the GLMs described above. Pairwise correlation distance (one minus Pearson correlation coefficient) was used as distance metric. RSA was performed whole-brain using a searchlight approach with a spherical searchlight (radius = 7 mm, approx. 180 voxels).</p><p id="P54">We constructed two model RDMs of interest to probe for the representation of compositional word meaning and the representation of abstract task rules. First, we constructed a “meaning” model using the embedding vectors for the 30 target words (e.g., “black” in “whitekla-black”) from a word embedding model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Mandera et al., 2017</xref>). Word embedding provides learned representations in a vector space for text where words that have similar meanings have similar representations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Mandera et al. (2017)</xref> evaluated several prediction-based models on their performance on a large behavioral dataset on semantic priming. Here we used the model with the best fit to the behavioral data, namely, a Continuous Bag of Words model (CBOW) trained on SONAR-500 text corpus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Oostdijk et al., 2013</xref>) and a corpus of movie subtitles. We calculated the pairwise Pearson correlation distance between the embeddings of all target words, and constructed a 30 *30 distance matrix for target meaning representations. In addition to the target meaning model, we also constructed a stem meaning model based on the stems of the 30 prime words (e.g., “white” in “whitekla-black”). Second, we constructed a “rule” model, for which we considered a 30*30 binary-coded distance matrix where the rules are either the same (e.g., “good-kla” and “short-kla”), or different (“good-kla” and “kla-dog”).</p><p id="P55">Within each searchlight sphere in each participant, we compared the model RDMs and the neural RDMs using Kendall’s rank correlation. Both the searchlight of the neural RDMs and the comparison with the model RDMs were performed using the Matlab-based RSA toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Nili et al., 2014</xref>). The resulting correlation coefficients were then submitted to a one-sample t-test using SPM12 (i.e., contrasting the obtained correlation against zero). Effects were tested for statistical significance using cluster-inference with a cluster-defining threshold of p &lt; 0.001 and whole-brain cluster-level FWE correction at p &lt; 0.05.</p><p id="P56">We additionally explored two ROI-based RSA analyses, using the same hippocampal mask and the left IFG mask used in the univariate analysis. The same procedure was performed for each structural ROI instead of each searchlight sphere. First-level coefficients were then used in the group-level one-sample one-side t-test. Since the meaning model and the rule model are to some degree correlated (Kendall’s τ = .22, p &lt; .001), we additionally used partial correlation for calculating the participant-level correlation between the model RDMs and the neural RDMs, in order to evaluate their unique contribution to the neural representations. To estimate the non-noise variance in the neural data, and thereby upper bounds of any model in explaining the neural data, we computed the noise ceiling employ a leave-one-participant-out approach: For each participant we computed the correlation of the neural RDM with the average neural RDM of all other participants; we then took the average correlation as the estimate of the noise ceiling.</p><p id="P57">As a sanity check of the RSA procedure, we additionally computed two visual model RDMs for target word representations. The two RDMs both reflect the visual similarity of the target words participants see on the screen. They were computed as (1) the Levenshtein distance calculated using the “stringdist” library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">van der Loo, 2014</xref>) in R; and (2) the pixel-wise Euclidean distance between individual words presented on the screen. Expectedly, these two RDMs were highly correlated (Kendall’s τ = 0.57, p &lt; .001).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS199796-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d50aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by the Language in Interaction consortium (Gravitation Grant 024.001.006 funded by the Dutch Research Council).

These compositional pseudo-words consisted of a known stem and an unknown affix. The affix alters the word meaning depending on its position (pre- vs. post- stem). Importantly, the relational structure rules were never made explicit to the participants. (B) Box plots of participant’s choice performance in a memory task, where they recall the meaning of the learned pseudo-words. (C) We tested participants’ knowledge with novel, compositional pseudo-words using an fMRI adaptation paradigm, in which the prime pseudo-words were always followed by a target, real word. The prime pseudo-words were either congruent or incongruent in terms of the relational structure rules, or totally mismatched in meaning regardless of order. The target word was always a matched synonym to the congruent prime word. (D) Boxplots of participants’ responses in the fMRI task across three experimental conditions, on the 10% probe trials on which they indicated with a left or right button press whether the prime words did or did not match the target words in terms of their meaning. (E) After the fMRI session, we explicitly asked participants to evaluate the meaningfulness of the novel compositional words. (F) Boxplots of participants’ responses in the posttest across three experimental conditions, where they indicated whether the pseudo-words are meaningful or not. The actual stimuli used in the experiment were in participants’ native language, Dutch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material 2</xref>). For (B, D, F), the thick horizontal line inside the box indicates the group median, and the bottom and top of the box indicate the group-level first and third quartiles of each condition.
