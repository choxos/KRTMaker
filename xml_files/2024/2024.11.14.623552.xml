The FERM domain protein Expanded plays a crucial role in integrating polarity cues to activate the Hippo pathway. Previous work has shown that the apicobasal polarity protein Crumbs can limit Hippo activity by promoting the phosphorylation and degradation of Expanded. Here, we provide evidence that PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> can counteract the effects of Crumbs, by dephosphorylating and stabilising Expanded. Indeed, we demonstrate that the PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> holoenzyme can increase Hippo signalling activity, in contrast to the previously established Hippo pathway inhibitory role of the pp2A<sup>Cka</sup>-containing STRIPAK complex. We also uncover a role for PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> and PP2A<sup>Tws</sup> in the regulation of Expanded proteostasis. Remarkably, the upstream Hippo regulator, Kibra interacts with PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> and prevents Expanded degradation. However, Kibra is unable to antagonise Crumbs-mediated Expanded regulation, in agreement with the previously established role of Crumbs in inhibiting Kibra function. Overall, our work characterises a novel Hippo-activating role for PP2A in the stabilisation of Expanded and provides new insights into how PP2A tightly controls Hippo activity in response to polarity stimuli.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">In multicellular organisms, achieving the appropriate final organ size and development of proportionate adult organisms require precise orchestration of cell growth, division and death, that can be fine-tuned by intrinsic and extrinsic cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Yu, Zhao and Guan, 2015</xref>). The evolutionarily conserved Hippo (Hpo) pathway is a such key tissue growth regulator and plays a role in maintaining tissue architecture especially in epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Genevet and Tapon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Schroeder and Halder, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Karaman and Halder, 2018</xref>). At its core, the Hippo pathway is comprised of a kinase cascade that includes the <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinases Hpo and Warts (Wts) and their corresponding adaptor proteins, Salvador (Sav) and Mob as tumour suppressor (Mats) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fulford, Tapon and Ribeiro, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Ma <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Zheng and Pan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Fu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Activation of the Hpo kinase cascade culminates in the phosphorylation and subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration of the pro-growth transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (Yki), resulting in growth repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). When the pathway is inactive, Yki translocates to the nucleus and interacts with its cognate transcription factor Scalloped to promote expression of genes that broadly promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, such as <italic>cyclin E</italic> and <italic>diap1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2008). To prevent unrestricted Yki-mediated growth and maintain tissue homeostasis, a negative feedback loop is incorporated into the Hpo pathway, whereby the expression of upstream activators such as <italic>expanded</italic> (<italic>ex</italic>), <italic>kibra</italic> (<italic>kib</italic>) and <italic>merlin</italic> (<italic>mer</italic>) is controlled by Yki itself, thereby limiting Yki activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hamaratoglu <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Genevet <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Park and Hansen, 2021</xref>). Importantly, deregulation of Hpo pathway components is associated with disease development and progression, including multiple cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Yu, Zhao and Guan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Fu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Unlike conventional signalling pathways that depend on specific ligand/receptor complexes, Hpo signalling senses and responds to diverse upstream local and external signals that impact on epithelial cell structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fulford, Tapon and Ribeiro, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Fu <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). One key regulator is the Striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Glatter <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Goudreault <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bae <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2019), a large, multicomponent protein complex that includes the serine/threonine phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Jeong <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). PP2A is a trimeric holoenzyme comprising the catalytic subunit Microtubule star (Mts), the adaptor subunit PP2A-29B, and a variable regulatory B subunit that specifies substrate recruitment. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes six PP2A regulatory subunits, which are classified into four different families: B (Twins (Tws)), B’ (Well-rounded (Wrd), Widerborst (Wdb) and CG32568), B” (CG4733) and (Connector of kinase to AP-1 (Cka)). Cka, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of mammalian Striatins, is the PP2A regulatory subunit present in the STRIPAK complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Jeong <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). SLMAP, a component of the STRIPAK complex, recruits Hpo and promotes dephosphorylation of its activation loop, counteracting Hpo autophosphorylation and Tao-1 kinase-mediated Hpo phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting the activity of the Hpo kinase cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Genevet <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Boggiano, Vanderzalm and Fehon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>.,2017</xref>). RASSF, a known Hpo pathway antagonist that competes with Sav for Hpo binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Polesello <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), has been shown to associate with STRIPAK and mediate its interaction with Hpo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). It has also been reported that SAV1 (Sav mammalian orthologue) can inhibit STRIPAK-mediated dephosphorylation of MST2 (Hpo mammalian orthologue) by directly binding to components of the STRIPAK complex, including SLMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bae <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P7">STRIPAK has also been shown to relay hormonal and innate immunity cues to the Hpo pathway and is predicted to have an oncogenic role, since increased STRIPAK activity resulted in enhanced Yki/YAP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Shi, Jiao and Zhou, 2016</xref>; Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Another important Hpo pathway upstream regulator is the FERM domain-containing protein Ex, which integrates apicobasal polarity cues to regulate tissue architecture and growth via the Hpo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Genevet and Tapon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Fulford, Tapon and Ribeiro, 2018</xref>). Ex can promote Tao-1-mediated Hpo phosphorylation by regulating the localisation of Schwannomin interacting protein 1 (Schip1), which is essential for the recruitment of the Tao-1 kinase to Hpo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Boggiano, Vanderzalm and Fehon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Poon <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Chung, Augustine and Choi, 2016</xref>). Ex also acts as a scaffold to recruit Wts to Hpo, promoting Wts phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Sun, Reddy and Irvine, 2015</xref>). Additionally, the PPxY motifs of Ex can directly interact with the WW domains of Yki to tether Yki to the apical membrane and inhibit its activity in a Hpo-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Badouel <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Oh, Reddy and Irvine, 2009</xref>). The transmembrane apicobasal polarity determinant Crumbs (Crb) recruits Ex to the apical membrane by directly interacting with its FERM domain, thereby facilitating Hpo pathway activation by Ex (Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Grzeschik <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Ling <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Robinson <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hafezi, Bosch and Hariharan, 2012</xref>). Apically-localised Ex interacts with the upstream Hpo regulators, Kibra (Kib) and Merlin (Mer) to regulate the Hpo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">McCartney <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Baumgartner <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Genevet <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Yu <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, Crb also limits Ex activity by modulating Ex protein turnover. Crb promotes phosphorylation of the N-terminus of Ex by Casein Kinase 1 (CKI) family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Fulford <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), which then subsequently results in Ex ubiquitylation and degradation by the $cF<sup>slimb/β-TrCP</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Slmb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Slmb also promotes Ex degradation by interacting directly with its C-terminus (Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2015). In parallel, Crb mediates the interaction between the E3 ubiquitin ligase Plenty of SH3s (POSH) and the C-terminus region of Ex resulting in ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of Ex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ma <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). The E2 ubiquitin ligase, Bruce, has been shown to act synergistically with POSH to promote Ex degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Song and Ma, 2023</xref>). Thus, the Crb/Ex axis is a crucial regulatory node linking epithelial polarity inputs and Hpo signalling. However, whether Crb-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of Ex can be antagonised to activate and/or maintain Hpo pathway activity is currently unknown. Identifying this mechanism is vital for understanding how tissue homeostasis is maintained by the Crb/Ex nexus of the Hpo pathway.</p><p id="P9">Here, we demonstrate that PP2A has a dual role in Hpo signalling regulation. In addition to its previously described inhibitory role as part of the STRIPAK complex, PP2A can act as a Hpo pathway activator. PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> (PP2A holoenzyme with the Wrd regulatory subunit) dephosphorylates and stabilises Ex in the presence of Crb and, remarkably, Ex can be stabilised by either PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> or PP2A<sup>Tws</sup> in the absence of the Crb stimulus. Moreover, the CKI family of protein kinases can phosphorylate Ex in steady-state conditions, and this can be reversed by PP2A. We also demonstrate that Kib forms a complex with PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> and Ex and specifically regulates Ex proteostasis. This work provides insight into the crucial role of PP2A as a Hpo signalling regulator, interacting with various upstream components to tightly control the pathway and hence regulate the balance between tissue growth and tissue homeostasis in response to polarity stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> cell culture, expression constructs and chemical treatments</title><p id="P10"><italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (RRID:CVCL_Z992) were cultured in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Schneider’s medium (Gibco) containing 10% (v/v) FBS, 50 μg/mL penicillin, and 50 μg/mL streptomycin.

As the dynamic regulation of Ex is a crucial determinant of Hpo pathway activity, we hypothesised that the Ex degradation promoted by Crb would be balanced by a counteracting mechanism that can reverse Crb-mediated Ex phosphorylation, thereby stabilising Ex. To elucidate this mechanism, we tested a panel of serine/threonine protein phosphatases for their ability to dephosphorylate and stabilise Ex in the presence of Crb. Expression of either full-length (Crb<sup>FL</sup>) or the intracellular domain of Crb (Crb<sup>intra</sup>) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells promotes delayed electrophoretic mobility of Ex (indicative of Ex phosphorylation) and reduced Ex protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Moreover, Ex<sup>1-468</sup>, which comprises the N-terminal FERM domain and the consensus Slmb recognition site <sup>452</sup>TSGIVS<sup>457</sup>, is the minimal region required for Crb-mediated Ex phosphorylation and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). We co-expressed Ex<sup>1-468</sup> and the catalytic subunits of phosphatases PPI (Flapwing (Flw), PP1-13C and PP1-87B), PP4 (PP4-19C), PP6 (PpV) and PP2A (Microtubule star (Mts)), in the presence of Crb<sup>intra</sup> in S2 cells to test if any of the phosphatases could prevent Crb-mediated Ex phosphorylation and degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>). Strikingly, we observed that, contrary to the catalytic subunits of the other phosphatases, Mts prevented the Ex mobility shift induced by Crb<sup>intra</sup> and stabilised Ex. Since Mts shares 98.4% protein sequence similarity with its human counterpart (PPP2CA; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>), we generated a Mts catalytic mutant (Mts<sup>H118N</sup>) based on existing PPP2CA structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Evans <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>), to eliminate potential pleiotropic effects associated with Mts overexpression. We validated the mutant’s lack of catalytic activity by demonstrating that Mts<sup>H118N</sup>, unlike wild-type Mts (hereafter referred to as Mts<sup>WT</sup>), was unable to stabilise Armadillo (Arm, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> β-catenin orthologue), a previously characterised PP2A substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bajpai <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>).

Furthermore, Mts restricted Crb-mediated Ex degradation in a dose-dependent manner, which suggests a dynamic competition between Crb- and PP2A-dependent regulation of Ex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). Therefore, our results demonstrate that PP2A counteracts Ex phosphorylation and degradation promoted by Crb.</p><p id="P53">Next, we tested whether PP2A antagonises Crb-mediated Ex degradation <italic>in vivo.</italic> Since <italic>ex</italic> is a Yki target gene, we used an <italic>in vivo</italic> Ex protein stability reporter, <italic>ubi-Ex<sup>1-468</sup>::GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Fulford <italic>et al</italic>.,2019</xref>) to specifically study post-translational regulation of Ex <italic>in vivo.</italic> This reporter expresses GFP-tagged Ex<sup>1-468</sup> under the control of the <italic>ubiquitin 63E</italic> promoter rather than the endogenous ex promoter, thus decoupling the effect of transcriptional feedback from the Hpo pathway on Ex protein levels and mitigating any confounding effects associated with Ex-dependent regulation of the Hpo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Fulford <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Transgenes were expressed in the posterior compartment of the larval wing imaginal disc using <italic>hedhehog-Gal4</italic> (<italic>hh-Gal4</italic>). The ratio of mean apical Ex<sup>1-468</sup>::GFP intensity between the posterior and the anterior compartments was used as a measure of normalised Ex protein levels.

In contrast, Mts<sup>H118N</sup> was unable to stabilise Ex in the presence of Crb<sup>intra</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B,E,G</xref>). Together, our data suggest that PP2A dephosphorylates Ex and prevents its degradation in the presence of Crb.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>PP2A stabilises Ex independently of the STRIPAK complex</title><p id="P54">We and others have delineated a crucial role for the STRIPAK complex in the regulation of Hpo signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bae <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). The STRIPAK complex is a large multicomponent protein complex that contains PP2A and, within it, PP2A substrate specificity is conferred by the Striatin regulatory subunit, Cka, which leads to Hpo dephosphorylation and Hpo pathway inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Jeong <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Hence, we tested whether PP2A-mediated regulation of Ex involved the STRIPAK complex. RNAi-mediated depletion of <italic>cka</italic> in S2 cells did not hinder the ability of Mts to stabilise Ex<sup>1-468</sup> in presence of Crb<sup>intra</sup>, suggesting that the effect of PP2A is independent of the STRIPAK complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1H</xref>). To test whether Cka is part of the PP2A complex that antagonises Crb-mediated Ex degradation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we knocked down <italic>cka</italic> while simultaneously overexpressing Mts (<italic>UAS-mts<sup>BL</sup></italic>) and Crb<sup>intra</sup> in the posterior compartment of the larval wing disc using <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A-D</xref>). Since Cka is required for many developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">La Marca <italic>et al</italic>.,2019</xref>), crosses were raised at 18°C to avoid developmental defects in the posterior compartment of the larval wing disc, which were consistently observed at 25°C (data not shown). However, in these conditions, we were unable to observe significant Crb-mediated degradation of Ex<sup>1-468</sup>::GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S3E</xref>). Hence, using this approach we were unable to determine whether Cka is required for PP2A-mediated regulation of Ex protein levels <italic>in vivo.</italic></p><p id="P55">To overcome this limitation and dissect whether the STRIPAK complex is involved in Ex stabilisation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we identified and mutated a conserved residue in Mts (Mts<sup>L186A</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. SI</xref>) that was shown to affect binding of PPP2CA with STRN3, the mammalian orthologue of Cka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Jeong <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). We validated that Mts<sup>L186A</sup> displays impaired binding to Cka compared to Mts<sup>WT</sup> by performing co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3F,G</xref>). Additionally, using the Arm stabilisation assay described above, we determined that the L186A mutation does not hinder the catalytic activity of Mts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3H</xref>). In contrast to Mts<sup>H118N</sup>, expression of Mts<sup>L186A</sup> in S2 cells did not affect the ability of Mts to dephosphorylate and stabilise Ex in the presence of Crb<sup>intra</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>hh-Gal4</italic>-mediated co-expression of Mts<sup>L186A</sup> with Crb<sup>intra</sup> in the posterior compartment resulted in increased apical Ex protein levels when compared with those discs expressing only Crb<sup>intra</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B,C,F,l</xref>). Therefore, like Mts<sup>WT</sup>, Mts<sup>L186A</sup> can partially rescue Ex in the presence of Crb<sup>intra</sup>. These results suggest that the STRIPAK complex is not essential for limiting Crb-mediated Ex regulation.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>PP2A regulates steady-state Ex protein levels via a mechanism distinct from Crb-dependent control</title><p id="P56">While studying how PP2A regulates Ex in the context of Crb expression, we also observed that PP2A regulated Ex stability in the absence of ectopic Crb expression. Overexpression of Mts<sup>WT</sup> in the absence of the Crb<sup>intra</sup> stimulus resulted in increased Ex protein levels in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), while the expression of the Mts catalytic mutant, Mts<sup>H118N</sup>, did not have any effect on steady-state Ex protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Moreover, knocking down <italic>mts</italic> resulted in a decrease in Ex protein levels in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). In sharp contrast, overexpression of the catalytic subunits of PP1s, PP4 and PP6 did not affect Ex protein levels in the absence of Crb<sup>intra</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>). Given the extremely low expression in S2 cells, these results suggest that PP2A can also stabilise Ex in a manner independent of Crb function. We then extended our analysis to <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions, where expression of Mts<sup>WT</sup> in the posterior compartment of the wing disc using <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> driver resulted in increased levels of the <italic>ubi-Ex<sup>1-468</sup>::GFP</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B,C,E</xref>). In contrast, expression of Mts<sup>H118N</sup> had no effect on steady-state Ex levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B,D,E</xref>). These results suggest that PP2A is essential for maintenance of Ex protein levels, a process we refer to as regulation of Ex proteostasis. Since the catalytic activity of PP2A is essential to stabilise Ex, this suggests that Ex is phosphorylated even in the absence of Crb expression.</p><p id="P57">Given that previous studies have demonstrated that the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of Ex are differentially controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ma <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Fulford <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Song and Ma, 2023</xref>), we tested whether PP2A can regulate the stability of the Ex truncation mutants, Ex<sup>469-1030</sup> and Ex<sup>1031-1427</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).

Furthermore, as expected, we verified that PP2A was able to stabilise full-length Ex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4D</xref>).

Hence, we investigated whether this Slmb degron was also involved in regulation of Ex proteostasis in S2 cells. For this, we tested whether Mts<sup>WT</sup> can stabilise Ex<sup>1-450</sup>, a truncation lacking the Slmb degron and, therefore, refractory to Crb regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that Mts<sup>WT</sup> was able to stabilise Ex<sup>1-450</sup> and, more importantly, this PP2A-mediated stabilisation of Ex<sup>1-450</sup> required its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>).

This corroborates our <italic>in vitro</italic> observations, indicating that PP2A-mediated regulation of Ex proteostasis is independent of the S453 phosphodegron. These results suggest that Ex is likely phosphorylated at additional sites distinct from the S453 site that is implicated in Crb-mediated Ex regulation. However, whether the S453 site is also phosphorylated in these conditions and whether PP2A can regulate Ex via this site was unclear. Therefore, in addition to the previously characterised Crb-dependent regulation of Ex, a more intricate phosphorylation-dependent mechanism is involved in the maintenance of Ex protein levels.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>CKIs and Slmb regulate Ex proteostasis via the 452-457 Slmb consensus sequence</title><p id="P59">In the presence of Crb, the CKI family kinases Gish and Ck1α promote phosphorylation of Ex, which results in its Slmb-dependent protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Fulford <italic>et al</italic>.,2019</xref>). Since we observed that, in the absence of the Crb stimulus, PP2A-mediated regulation of Ex occurs at sites other than the Ex<sup>452-457</sup> Slmb recognition site, we sought to determine whether Gish and Ck1α were involved in this mechanism. The effects of Gish and Ck1α on Ex<sup>1-468</sup> phosphorylation require its membrane localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Fulford <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) and, hence, a C-terminal CAAX tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Sotillos <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) was added to target Ex to the membrane (Ex<sup>1-468 CAA×</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Fulford <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), allowing us to assess the effect of the kinases in the absence of Crb. Expression of either Gish or Ck1α was able to promote Ex<sup>1-468 CAAX</sup> phosphorylation and this was reversed by expression of Mts<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2K</xref>). Furthermore, RNAi-mediated depletion of <italic>gish</italic> in S2 cells resulted in an increase in Ex<sup>1-468</sup> levels in the absence of Crb<sup>intra</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L</xref>), suggesting that CKIs may also be involved in regulation of Ex protein levels independently of the action of Crb. Since Gish and Ck1α act via the 452-457 phosphodegron site in the presence of the Crb stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Fulford <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), we next assessed how CKIs regulate Ex proteostasis. We overexpressed either Gish or Ck1α and tested whether they phosphorylate Ex<sup>1-450 CAAX</sup>, a truncation lacking the 452-457 phosphodegron region. Interestingly, we observed that Ex<sup>1-450 CAA×</sup> was not phosphorylated by Gish or Ck1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2M,N</xref>). Additionally, knocking down <italic>gish</italic> did not alter Ex<sup>1-450</sup> protein levels, in contrast to the previously observed increased Ex<sup>1-468</sup> protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2O</xref>). Therefore, unlike PP2A, in the absence of Crb function, the regulation of Ex protein levels by Gish and Ck1α appears to be limited to the E<sub>x</sub><sup>452-457</sup> site.</p><p id="P60">Since phosphorylation of Ex mediated by Gish and Ck1α promotes Slmb-dependent ubiquitylation and degradation, we wanted to determine whether Crb-independent regulation of Ex protein stability is also controlled by Slmb. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Slmb resulted in an increase in Ex<sup>1-468</sup> protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2L</xref>), suggesting that Slmb is indeed involved in regulation of Ex proteostasis. However, we observed that knocking down Slmb did not affect Ex<sup>1-450</sup> protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2O</xref>). These results suggest that Slmb regulates the N-terminus of Ex specifically via the 452-457 phosphodegron site. Taken together, these results show that the machinery that facilitates Crb-mediated Ex phosphorylation and degradation is also partly involved in the Crb-independent regulation of Ex protein stability.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> antagonises Crb-mediated Ex degradation while both PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> and PP2A<sup>Tws</sup> regulate Ex at steady-state</title><p id="P61">As the substrate specificity of the PP2A holoenzyme is defined by its regulatory subunit, we aimed to identify the regulatory subunit(s) involved in the PP2A-mediated mechanism that counteracts Crb-mediated Ex degradation. We generated and validated dsRNAs for the B regulatory subunits, Wrd and Wdb, and the B’ regulatory subunit, Tws (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A,B</xref>). Given that the regulatory subunits CG32568 (B) and CG4733 (B”) are not expressed in S2 cells where PP2A can stabilise Ex in presence of Crb, this suggests that these subunits are not involved in Ex regulation and, therefore, they were not tested further. To identify the PP2A regulatory subunit(s) involved in Ex regulation, we depleted <italic>wrd, wdb</italic> or <italic>tws</italic> in conjunction with Mts<sup>WT</sup> and Crb<sup>intra</sup> expression in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). In these conditions, depletion of a PP2A regulatory subunit involved in this process would be expected to suppress the effect of Mts on Ex protein levels. We observed that when either <italic>wrd</italic> or <italic>wdb</italic> were knocked down, Mts was unable to dephosphorylate and stabilise Ex to the same extent as in control conditions. This suggests that PP2A holoenzymes comprised of either Wrd or Wdb as regulatory subunits antagonise Crb-mediated Ex phosphorylation and degradation.

In sharp contrast, knocking down either <italic>wdb</italic> or <italic>tws</italic> had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H-K</xref>), suggesting that PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> might play a more prominent role in regulating Ex levels <italic>in vivo.</italic></p><p id="P62">Since Wrd and Wdb can be functionally redundant, as they belong to the same PP2A regulatory subunit family (Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pinto and Orr-Weaver, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Jang <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), we performed an orthogonal approach to validate the involvement of Wrd in mediating Ex stability <italic>in vivo</italic>. We mutated a conserved residue in Mts (Mts<sup>R268A</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>), which was predicted to affect binding of mammalian PPP2CA with its corresponding B regulatory subunits, according to structural biology studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Cho and Xu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Using co-IP experiments, we tested whether the mutations indeed affect binding to Wrd and Wdb as predicted. Surprisingly, we found that Mts<sup>R268A</sup> specifically affected binding to Wrd, but not to Wdb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C-E</xref>). Furthermore, using the Arm stabilisation assay, we showed that Mts<sup>R268A</sup> retains its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2A</xref>). When Mts<sup>R268A</sup> was co-expressed with Crb<sup>intra</sup> in S2 cells, we found that Mts<sup>R268A</sup> was unable to dephosphorylate and stabilise Ex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).

Therefore, we conclude that Wrd is the essential regulatory subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme that antagonises Crb-mediated Ex phosphorylation and degradation.</p><p id="P63">Since the modulation of Ex<sup>1-468</sup> protein stability in conditions where ectopic Crb is absent appears to have additional layers of regulation, we also characterised the PP2A holoenzyme(s) that mediate this process. RNAi-mediated depletion of <italic>wrd</italic> suppressed the stabilisation of Ex protein levels induced by Mts expression (Mts<sup>BL</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-C,I</xref>) in the posterior compartment of the wing disc. Expression of Mts<sup>R268A</sup>, the Mts mutant that affects binding to Wrd, did not result in increased levels of the Ex reporter, which was indistinguishable from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A,F,G,J</xref>), therefore reiterating the role of Wrd in Crb-mediated regulation of Ex protein stability. Additionally, expression of <italic>tws</italic>-RNAi also suppressed Mts<sup>BL</sup>-mediated stabilisation of Ex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A,B,E,I</xref>), thereby suggesting that Tws is also involved in maintaining Ex protein levels. Furthermore, much like Mts<sup>WT</sup>, expression of Mts<sup>L186A</sup> in the posterior compartment resulted in an increase in Ex reporter levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A,F,H,J</xref>). This suggests that Cka and, by extension the STRIPAK complex, are not part of the PP2A holoenzyme that regulates Ex stability in conditions where Crb is absent. Together, these results demonstrate that although only Wrd is essential for PP2A-mediated stabilisation of Ex in the presence of Crb, both Wrd and Tws are involved in Crb-independent regulation of Ex proteostasis.</p><p id="P64">Next, we wanted to explore whether Mts and the identified PP2A holoenzymes physically interact with Ex and if this interaction is modulated by Crb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). Using co-IP analyses, we observed that Mts interacts with Ex, both in the presence and absence of Crb<sup>intra</sup>. Interestingly, in the absence of Crb<sup>intra</sup>, Ex primarily interacted with Tws. However, in the presence of Crb<sup>intra</sup>, Ex bound Tws and Wrd. The Ex:Tws interaction observed in the absence of Crb is consistent with the role played by Tws in regulating Ex protein levels <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additionally, since <italic>tws</italic> depletion did not affect the ability of PP2A to stabilise Ex in presence of Crb<sup>intra</sup>, the Ex:Tws interaction detected in the presence of Crb<sup>intra</sup> is likely to correspond to a potentially constitutively formed complex that is likely unaffected by Crb expression. Furthermore, Wrd associated with Ex only in the presence of Crb<sup>intra</sup>, indicating that the Crb-independent regulation of Ex levels by PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> might involve an indirect mechanism, in contrast to what was observed in the context of Crb<sup>intra</sup>. Moreover, these results suggest that, although Crb<sup>intra</sup> initiates the process leading to Ex phosphorylation and degradation, it simultaneously sets in motion a molecular mechanism that limits the extent to which Ex is degraded, by promoting the Ex:PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> interaction that blocks depletion of Ex protein levels.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Mer and Kib regulate Ex protein levels in a post-translational manner</title><p id="P65">Mer and Kib have been shown to interact and form complexes with Ex at the apical junction to activate the Hpo kinase cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Genevet <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Yu <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Genevet and Tapon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Sun, Reddy and Irvine, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Tokamov <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).

Interestingly, we observed that Kib specifically bound to Wrd, but not Tws, thereby suggesting that Kib may regulate Ex levels via PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup>. This result also reinforces the idea that although both PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> and PP2A<sup>Tws</sup> regulate Ex protein levels in a Crb-independent manner, the underlying mechanisms involved in this regulation may be distinct.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> activates Hpo signalling in the context of Crb expression</title><p id="P66">Overexpression of Crb<sup>intra</sup> has been associated with an increase in Yki activity reporter levels such as <italic>ex-lacZ</italic> and <italic>diap1-GFP</italic> in wing discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Sherrard and Fehon, 2015</xref>; Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2015), which is consistent with its role in inhibiting the Hpo pathway.

The apicobasal polarity protein Crb precisely regulates Ex function by both facilitating its recruitment to the apical membrane and limiting Ex activity by promoting its phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitin-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Fulford <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). However, the mechanisms that ensure this balance is precisely maintained remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> holoenzyme dephosphorylates and stabilises Ex in the presence of Crb. This role of PP2A occurs independently of Cka and, thus, of the STRIPAK complex. Furthermore, in contrast to the previously reported inhibitory role of PP2A<sup>Cka</sup>, we demonstrate that PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> activates the Hpo pathway, limiting Yki activity induced by Crb. These results elucidate a critical PP2A nexus that maintains Ex levels in a delicate equilibrium to precisely regulate Hpo signalling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P70">We observed that, in steady-state, the CKI kinases Ck1α and Gish promote phosphorylation of Ex, and this can be reversed by PP2A. Moreover, Slmb is also involved in Ex degradation in these conditions. Interestingly, in the absence of ectopic Crb, we observed that the regulation of Ex by Ck1α, Gish and Slmb is limited to the Slmb consensus site <sup>452</sup>TSGIVS<sup>457</sup>, which is similar to the previously characterised mechanism involved in Crb-dependent regulation of Ex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Ribeiro <italic>et al</italic>.,2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Fulford <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Remarkably, an Ex truncation lacking the <sup>452</sup>TSGIVS<sup>457</sup> site can be stabilised by PP2A despite being refractory to CKI kinase-dependent phosphorylation and Slmb-dependent degradation, thereby suggesting the involvement of other kinases and ubiquitin ligases in the regulation of Ex stability, at least in the absence of Crb. Furthermore, we observed that PP2A can promote stability of Ex<sup>FL</sup> and mapped this PP2A-mediated regulation of Ex to the N-terminus of Ex (Ex<sup>1-468</sup>). Although Ck1α and Gish phosphorylate Ex both in the context of a Crb-dependent and -independent mechanism, whether Ex is phosphorylated to a higher extent when associated with Crb is not currently known. CKIs prefer substrates that are primed by prior phosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cheong and Virshup, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Cruciat, 2014</xref>), hence the pghosphorylation events involved in the regulation of Ex proteostasis in the absence of Crb could prime CKI-mediated phosphorylation of Ex to rapidly adapt to dynamic polarity cues.</p><p id="P71">We showed that the PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> and PP2A<sup>Tws</sup> holoenzymes are essential for maintaining Ex steady-state protein levels. Since PP2A regulatory subunits typically recruit and dephosphorylate different substrates, the involvement of both regulatory subunits in PP2A-mediated stabilisation of Ex in conditions where Crb function is dispensable was unexpected. This observation parallels findings where both mammalian B56 (Wrd) and B55 (Tws) regulatory subunit families have been implicated in dephosphorylation of common targets, including Tau (Yu, Yoo and Ahn, 2014), the NF-κB pathway inhibitory kinase IκBα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Tsuchiya <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) and the protein kinase Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Rodgers, Vogel and Puigserver, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Ruvolo <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). In these cases, the B55 and B56 regulatory subunits employ distinct mechanisms to regulate the common substrates. Interestingly, we observed that in conditions where no ectopic Crb is present in cells, Ex binds only to Tws, suggesting that Wrd and Tws employ specific molecular mechanisms to regulate Ex.</p><p id="P72">In the presence of Crb, we observed a shift in the association of Ex from Tws to Wrd, which complements our observation that PPA<sup>Wrd</sup> functionally antagonises Crb-mediated Ex degradation. The differential binding of Wrd to Ex observed in the absence and presence of Crb, suggests that the PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> holoenzyme may stabilise Ex through different mechanisms in these conditions, even though a similar overall effect on Ex stability is achieved. For instance, in the absence of the Crb stimulus, PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> may regulate an unknown upstream kinase or a negative regulator of Ex, thereby influencing Ex stability without directly associating with it. These results demonstrate that multiple PP2A complexes regulate Ex stability in a context-dependent manner.</p><p id="P73">Kib, Ex and Mer have been shown to form a complex that acts upstream of the core Hpo components to activate the Hpo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Boggiano and Fehon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Enderle and McNeill, 2013</xref>). More recently, Kib and Mer have been shown to activate the Hpo pathway in a spatially distinct manner from Ex. Kib and Mer recruit Hpo and Wts to the non-junctional medial cortex, while Ex localises with Crb to the junctional cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Su <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Additionally, Crb represses the Hpo-and growth-regulating functions of Kib by sequestering Kib to the junctions, away from the medial apical cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Su <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that Mer regulated Ex protein levels both in the absence and in the presence of the Crb stimulus. However, Kib only regulated Ex protein levels when Crb was not present, which is in accordance with the role of Crb in repressing Kib function. Hence, these results reinforce the importance of the relationship between Mer, Kib and Ex. Although previous reports stated that Kib does not affect Ex levels <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Su <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>), these experiments relied on Ex antibody staining rather than assessing post-translational effects using the <italic>ubi-Exl<sup>-468</sup>::GFP</italic> stability reporter. Therefore, it would be interesting to determine the role of Kib in the regulation of Ex protein stability <italic>in vivo,</italic> using the approaches described in the current study. Remarkably, we observed that Kib binds to Mts and Wrd and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report an interaction between PP2A and Kib. Therefore, in conditions where Crb function is absent, Kib could regulate Ex stability by mediating the function of the PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> holoenzyme to stabilise Ex. Crb would disrupt the formation of this complex, thereby preventing the stabilisation of Ex by the Kib-PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> complex. This model suggests that Kib recruits PP2A<sup>Wrd</sup> to phosphorylated Ex to promote PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation and stabilisation of Ex. However, in the presence of Crb, this function of Kib would be repressed, thereby resulting in the phosphorylation and degradation of Ex.</p><p id="P74">Cell polarity is an essential determinant of epithelial architecture, and the Hpo pathway plays a key role in integrating polarity cues to mediate tissue growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Campbell, Knust and Skaer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Sherrard and Fehon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Campanale, Sun and Montell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Peglion and Goehring, 2019</xref>).
