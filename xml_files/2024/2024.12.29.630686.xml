Importantly, targeted elimination of senescent cells can delay the onset and improve many ageing-associated pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Despite extensive research into the pathological roles of senescence, its functional contributions to normal physiology remain poorly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.

Among these, the mammary gland undergoes dramatic remodeling during postpartum involution, a process that returns the gland to its pre-pregnant state after lactation (or directly after pregnancy if lactation does not occur)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. During this process, all the newly formed lobuloalveolar structures generated during pregnancy are removed via apoptosis and lysosomal-mediated cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Concurrently, the gland undergoes extensive remodeling of the extracellular matrix, blood vessels, and adipocytes refilling, companied by a strong inflammatory response and immune infiltration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, to restore mammary epithelium integrity. Of note, mammary involution resembles a scarless wound-healing process as the mammary epithelium after involution can respond properly to the subsequent pregnancy and lactation repetitively throughout female’s reproductive life span.</p><p id="P6">While involution is critical for mammary gland homeostasis and the successful establishment of future lactation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, it also create a transient pro-tumorigenic microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and is strongly implicated in postpartum breast cancer (PPBC), defined as breast cancer diagnosed within 5–10 years after childbirth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.

However, the mechanisms underlying the pro-tumorigenic features of involution remain not well understood.</p><p id="P7">Here, we provide evidence that certain alveolar luminal cells upregulate p16 to acquire senescence state during postpartum mammary gland involution. Loss-of-functions studies reveal that senescence is required for proper tissue remodelling during involution but, paradoxically, also promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis in a paracrine manner by enhancing tumour-initiating cells plasticity. Thus, our findings demonstrate that in a physiological context like mammary gland involution, senescence plays a dual role both mediating tissue remodeling and facilitating tumorigenesis and suggesting that senescence might serve as a common mechanism linking wound healing to cancer.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Result</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cellular senescence is transiently induced at the onset of the tissue remodeling phase of mammary gland (MG) involution</title><p id="P8">To investigate whether senescence occurs throughout MG postnatal development and the reproductive cycle, we performed senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-βGal) staining on murine MGs collected at various developmental stages, including puberty (6 weeks), mature virgin (10 weeks), pregnancy (p13.5 and p18.5), lactation (lac10), and involution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, robust SA-βGal staining was observed in involuting MGs, while SA-βGal+ cells were scarcely detectable at other stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The involution process in rodents consists two morphologically distinct phases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. During the first 48 hours, programmed cell death occurs, while the alveolar lumen remains intact. This is followed by a phase of extensive tissue remodeling between 60 and 72 hours, characterized by alveolar regression and adipocyte repopulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. To analyze the dynamics of SA-βGal+ cells during involution, we initiated synchronized involution by removing pups after 10 days of lactation and collected MGs at different time points: Inv1, Inv3, Inv7, Inv14, and Inv28 (representing the resting MG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, SA-βGal+ cells became apparent starting at Inv3, with staining intensity peaking at Inv7 and gradually diminishing thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, i-iv</xref>). No SA-βGal+ cells were detected in the resting MG following the completion of involution (Inv28, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, v</xref>). Most SA-βGal staining was spatially restricted to the alveolar region compared to the ductal epithelium.</p><p id="P9">To further validate our observations and characterize the senescence program associated with mammary gland involution, we conducted bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on MGs from Inv0, Inv3, and Inv7. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed clear clustering of Inv0, Inv3, and Inv7 samples, indicating distinct biological differences across these stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated significant enrichment of senescence-associated genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> in both Inv3 and Inv7 compared to Inv0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Heatmap depicting upregulated senescence-associated genes in Inv3 and Inv7 relative to Inv0 further highlighted this senescence signature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, we identified numerous genes crucial for the involution process, including extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling factors such as MMP2, MMP3, MMP14, and Serpine1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>; cytokines and chemokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> like CXCL12, CXCL10, CCL4, CXCL16, CCL3, CCL2, IL18, and CCL8; and growth factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, including GDF15, FGF2/7, and IGFBP4/5. Additionally, hallmark gene sets frequently associated with senescence, such as interferon responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, NF-κB signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, and the complement system, were significantly enriched in Inv3 and Inv7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that senescence is transiently induced during mammary gland involution, coinciding with the onset of tissue remodeling.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Involution-associated senescence does not accumulate with age</title><p id="P10">Senescent cells accumulate during aging in various tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. A recent study has reported that aged mammary stem/progenitor cells acquire a gene signature associated with cellular senescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. We questioned whether senescent cells might accumulate in the mammary gland upon multiple pregnancies (multiparity). To address this question, we compared SA-βGal<sup>+</sup> cells across several groups, including involuting MGs following the first pregnancy (1P-Inv5, ~3 months), resting mammary glands after one round of involution (1P-RS ~4 months), involuting MGs following multiparous glands (MP-Inv5, ~11 months, corresponding to approximately 35 years in humans), resting mammary glands post-MP (MP-RS ~12 months, corresponding to approximately 40 years in humans), and glands from nulliparous mice (O-virgin ~12 months) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). We observed a minor, non-significant increase in SA-βGal<sup>+</sup> cells in involuting multiparous MGs (MP-Inv5) compared to 1P MGs (IP-Inv5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, we detected negligible SA-βGal<sup>+</sup> cells in mammary glands from one-year-old females, regardless of parity status. These findings suggest that the senescence program associated with involution does not accumulate or amplify with multiple pregnancies during reproductive aging.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Alveolar luminal cells are the major senescent cell type</title><p id="P11">To identify which cell types undergo senescence during MG involution, we employed C<sub>12</sub>FDG, a fluorogenic substrate for β-galactosidase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, alongside cell-specific markers. Stromal cells were identified as CD31<sup>-</sup>, CD45<sup>-</sup>, CD24<sup>-</sup>, α6<sup>-</sup>; basal cells as CD31<sup>-</sup>, CD45<sup>-</sup>, CD24<sup>low</sup>, α6<sup>high</sup>; and luminal cells as CD31<sup>-</sup>, CD45<sup>-</sup>, CD24<sup>high</sup>, α6<sup>low</sup>. Using flow cytometry, we found that approximately 6% of stromal cells, 15% of basal cells, and 52% of luminal cells were C<sub>12</sub>FDG<sup>+</sup> at Inv5 compared to Inv0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). Although our antibody panel could not distinguish alveolar epithelial cells from ductal epithelial cells, histological staining indicated that most SA-βGal<sup>+</sup> cells are alveolar epithelial cells. Next, we conducted co-staining of SA-βGal with the basal cell marker Keratin 5 (Krt5) and the luminal cell marker Keratin 8 (Krt8) at Inv3. Consistently, we found that the majority of SA-βGal<sup>+</sup> cells were Krt8<sup>+</sup> alveolar luminal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), which are negative for both the apoptotic marker cleaved Caspase-3 (CC3) and the proliferation marker Ki67 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2C &amp; 2D</xref>). Together, our findings indicate that alveolar luminal cells are the primary senescent cell type during mammary gland involution.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>p16 upregulation, but not p21, is associated with mammary involution-induced senescence</title><p id="P12">Interestingly, our bulk RNAseq analysis revealed upregulation of <italic>Cdkn2a, Rb1, Trp53</italic>, and various Trp53 target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, but not <italic>Cdkn1a</italic>, at Inv3 and Inv7 compared to Inv0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2E &amp; 2F</xref>).

We further investigated p16INK4a expression using a sensitive reporter mouse model, INKBRITE, where the p16<sup>INK4a</sup> promoter drives expression of multiple copies of H2B-GFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. At Inv0, few GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were observed within alveolar structure marked by Krt5 or in the stromal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure.2C</xref>, upper panel). Importantly, at Inv7, a significantly higher proportion of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells was detected, predominantly within the alveolar structures facing the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, lower panel). Next, we examined whether involution-induced senescence was triggered by DNA damage. While we observed γH2AX+ cells at Inv3, predominantly in alveolar luminal cells, GFP<sup>+</sup> and γH<sub>2</sub>AX<sup>+</sup> cells were mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). These findings suggest that involution-induced senescence is linked to p16 upregulation, independent of p21, and occurs most likely independently of DNA damage.</p><p id="P13">We recently established a mammary organoid system that models mammary postnatal developmental stages including pregnancy, lactation, and involution <italic>ex vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. To test whether senescence is also induced during involution-like process in this organoid model, we performed whole-mount SAβGal staining on organoids cultured in either lactation-like medium (LM, Lac) or involution-like medium (BOM, Inv) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Histological analysis revealed that involution-organoids were notably smaller than lactation-organoids, with significantly more SA-βGal<sup>+</sup> cells in the involution-organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2,G</xref>).

Thus, the organoid model supports the <italic>in vivo</italic> finding that p16, but not p21, is associated with senescence during involution, and organoid system can serve as a simplified <italic>ex vivo</italic> model to study involution-associated senescence.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Systemic lactogenic hormones prevent senescence induction during involution</title><p id="P14">Next, we investigated upstream signals regulating senescence induction during involution.

It is known that involution-associated programmed cell death (PCD) is triggered locally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, and consistent with previous findings, we observed distinct morphological differences between involuting and sealed MGs at the onset of irreversible involution (day 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3C &amp; 3D</xref>). The sealed MGs displayed intact alveolar structures without tissue remodeling, unlike the involuting MGs.

These results suggest that systemic lactogenic hormones withdrawal upon weaning is required for senescence induction during involution.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>p16-dependent senescence induction ensures involution dynamic</title><p id="P15">To determine the functional relevance of senescence in mammary involution, we used both genetic and pharmaceutical approaches to perturb the senescence program.

We identify that alveolar luminal cells are the primary cell type undergoing p16-dependent senescence, which is likely driven by systemic hormone withdrawal. Loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that senescence facilitates tissue remodeling processes to ensure proper involution. Unexpectedly, we also find that involution-associated senescence promotes PPBC progression by enhancing tumor-initiating cell plasticity through paracrine signaling. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated dual role for senescence in tissue repair and tumorigenesis, demonstrating how physiological senescence can be exploited by oncogenic events. This highlights the potential for targeting involution-associated senescence as a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate postpartum breast cancer progression.</p><p id="P27">Involution-associated senescence shares notable parallels with senescence in decidual stromal cells of the cycling human endometrium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>, which is required for successful implantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. Both processes are triggered by fluctuation in female sex hormones, mediated by p53 and p16 upregulation, and play important roles in scarless tissue remodeling. However, their hormonal regulation differs. Brighton et al. showed that progesterone induces differentiation and senescence in human primary endometrial stromal cells during decidualization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>, while in mammary gland, prolactin withdraw is required for senescence induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F, 2G and 3B</xref>).
