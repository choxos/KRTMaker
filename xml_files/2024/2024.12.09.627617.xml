H3K27M inhibits the deposition of the histone mark H3K27me3, which affects the maintenance of transcriptional programs and cell identity. Cells expressing H3K27M are also characterized by defects in genome integrity, but the mechanisms linking expression of the oncohistone to DNA damage remain mostly unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of H3.1K27M in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> interferes with post-replicative chromatin maturation mediated by the H3.1K27 methyltransferases ATXR5 and ATXR6. As a result, H3.1 variants on nascent chromatin remain unmethylated at K27 (H3.1K27me0), leading to ectopic activity of TONSOKU (TSK), which induces DNA damage and genomic alterations. Elimination of TSK activity suppresses the genome stability defects associated with H3.1K27M expression, while inactivation of specific DNA repair pathways prevents survival of H3.1K27M-expressing plants. Overall, our results suggest that H3.1K27M disrupts the chromatin-based mechanisms regulating TSK/TONSL activity, which causes genomic instability and may contribute to the etiology of DMG-H3K27a.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">DMG-H3K27a, a type of brain cancer that mostly affects children, is characterized by a very poor prognosis with fewer than 10% of patients surviving more than two years after diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Approximately 80% of DMG patients are carriers of a somatic K27M mutation in one of the histone H3 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The H3K27M mutation can occur in genes encoding different histone H3 variants: replication-dependent H3.1 or H3.2 (H3.1/H3.2 variants hereafter referred to as H3.1), and replication-independent H3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Initial work has shown that expression of H3.1K27M or H3.3K27M leads to a decrease of histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) by inhibiting the activity of the H3K27 methyltransferase POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2 (PRC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). In cancer cells, H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M are both expressed amid a much larger contingent of wild-type H3.1 and H3.3 proteins, but the mutated histones inhibit PRC2 in a dominant-negative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), which accounts for the drastic loss of H3K27me3 observed in DMG-H3K27a cells.</p><p id="P4">A large majority of the work on oncogenic H3K27M mutations has centered on the consequences of decreased H3K27me3 levels and the subsequent effects on transcriptional regulation. However, the disruption of other cellular activities by H3K27M may have been overlooked, as PRC2 activity in mammals and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is responsible for all levels of methylation at H3K27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Mono- and di-methylation at H3K27 (H3K27me1/2), which are together much more abundant than H3K27me3 in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), have cellular functions that are independent of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). In line with this, it has been confirmed that levels of H3K27me1/2 at specific loci are also reduced by the H3K27M oncomutation in H3K27M-expressing cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Consequently, there is a major increase in unmethylated histone H3 at K27 (H3K27me0), to the point where it can become the most dominant form of H3K27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Importantly, PRC2 inhibition by H3K27M leads to a large increase of K27me0 on both H3.1 and H3.3 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Lysine 27 of newly synthesized H3.1 proteins is unmethylated prior to incorporation of H3.1 into chromatin during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Recently, it was shown in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis) that H3.1K27me0 is specifically required for the recruitment of the conserved DNA repair protein TONSOKU (TSK; known as TONSL in animals) to replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). In mammals, TONSL has been shown to initiates homologous recombination-mediated resolution of stalled or broken replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). DNA repair via TSK/TONSL needs to be tightly regulated in dividing cells of plants and animals by histone methyltransferases, which methylate post-replicative chromatin to prevent TSK/TONSL activity outside of stalled or broken replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). In the absence of the post-replicative chromatin maturation step that inhibits TSK/TONSL, genome instability is observed in a TSK/TONSL-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Chromatin-based regulation of TSK in plants has been shown to depend on the redundant activity of the H3.1K27 mono-methyltransferases ATXR5 and ATXR6 (ATXR5/6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), which mono-methylate H3.1K27 to prevent binding of TSK to H3.1 through its conserved tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). In Arabidopsis, where unregulated TSK activity has been extensively studied, this results in many phenotypes, including widespread genomic amplification of heterochromatic sequences (hereafter referred to as heterochromatin amplification), DNA damage, and loss of transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Genomic instability is a defining characteristic of many cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), including H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). The frequent co-occurrence of specific secondary mutations associated with H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), and the defects in genome integrity in cancer cells harboring these mutations, suggest a model where expression of H3K27M generates a DNA error-prone environment that can induce and/or accelerate tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Accordingly, specific DNA repair pathways and DNA repair pathway choice have been shown to be affected by H3K27M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), but a direct link between the oncohistone and misregulation of DNA repair proteins has not yet been established. In this work, we demonstrate that expression of H3.1K27M disrupts the regulation of the TSK/TONSL-H3.1 DNA repair pathway. Using Arabidopsis as a model system for K-to-M mutations on H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), we show that expression of H3.1K27M induces DNA damage. This effect of H3.1K27M is due to its ability to block the activity of ATXR5/6, which results in an increase of H3.1K27me0 in chromatin. Similarly to <italic>atxr5/6</italic> mutants, increased levels of H3.1K27me0 induce heterochromatin amplification and loss of transposon silencing. By inactivating TSK in H3.1K27M-expressing plants, we were able to confirm that ectopic activity of the TSK-H3.1 DNA repair pathway is responsible for disrupting genome integrity. In addition, loss of the DNA repair proteins MRE11 and RAD51 in H3.1K27M-expressing plants results in synthetic lethality, thus suggesting specific vulnerabilities in cells expressing H3.1K27M. We discuss the implications of these results obtained in the Arabidopsis model and how they could translate to a better understanding of the etiology of cancers characterized by H3.1K27M expression.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>H3.1K27M expression induces genomic instability in Arabidopsis</title><p id="P7">To explore the biological mechanisms affected by an H3K27M mutation, we created transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing H3.1K27M under a native H3.1 promoter (H3.1<sub>prom</sub>::H3.1K27M) in the wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0) background, which also expresses a normal set of endogenous histone H3.1 from five H3.1 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). As a control, we also created transgenic plants expressing wild-type H3.1 (H3.1<sub>prom</sub>::H3.1 WT). RNA-seq analysis showed that H3.1K27M transcripts corresponded to ~20% of all H3.1 transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), indicating that a majority of H3.1 proteins in the transgenic plants are wild type. This approach provides the opportunity to evaluate the phenotypic and molecular effects caused by H3.1K27M expression in a model system where H3-variant-specific effects on genome stability and DNA repair have been previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The H3.1K27M transgenic plants demonstrated significant developmental defects compared to Col-0 and wild-type H3.1 controls (H3.1 WT), exhibiting stunted growth and much smaller and narrower leaves compared to the control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1A</xref>). The germination and survival rates of H3.1K27M plants were severely affected, with most plants dying before day 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In addition, the H3.1K27M plants displayed an increase in anthocyanin content, which is commonly associated with cellular stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). To assess for the presence of DNA damage, we conducted comet assays and found a significant increase in tail DNA percentage for H3.1K27M-expressing plants compared to Col-0 and H3.1 WT controls, which is indicative of DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">E</xref>). We also found that H3.1K27M plants were hypersensitive to the genotoxic effects of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1C</xref>). We then used the disrupted beta-glucuronidase <italic>(uidA/GUS)</italic> system to directly assess the frequency of homologous recombination events in our transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). In this system, homology-directed repair is required to reconstitute a gene that can produce a functional GUS protein. Our results showed that GUS activity was much stronger in H3.1K27M transgenic plants, indicating higher levels of homology-directed repair at the <italic>GUS</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). In accord with these results, RNA-seq experiments in Col, H3.1 WT and H3.1K27M plants showed that many DNA damage response genes are upregulated when H3.1K27M is expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that expression of H3.1K27M in Arabidopsis generates DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>H3.1K27M expression inhibits the histone methyltransferase activity of PRC2 and ATXR5/6</title><p id="P9">In human cells, H3K27M mutations interfere with PRC2 in a dominant-negative manner, which prevents the spreading of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Given the high degree of conservation between plant and animal histone H3 variants and PRC2 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), we hypothesized that expression of H3K27M in plants would also block PRC2 activity. To verify this, we performed immunostaining and observed a drastic decrease of H3K27me3 in nuclei from H3.1K27M-expressing plants compared to Col-0 and H3.1 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We also assessed H3K27me3 levels by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing combined with exogenous chromatin spike-in (ChIP-Rx) to normalize the H3K27me3 signal between samples. Profiles for H3K27me3 over protein-coding genes showed a large decrease in H3K27me3 in H3.1K27M plants compared to Col-0 and H3.1 WT in both high- and low-expressing genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2A</xref>). Together, these results suggest that expression of the oncohistone H3.1K27M disrupts PRC2 activity in plants similarly to human cells.</p><p id="P10">In plants, H3K27 methylation is also catalyzed by the SET domain-proteins ATXR5/6, which specifically mono-methylate the H3.1 variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). K-to-M mutations on histone H3 has been shown to inhibit the activity of multiple histone methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), so we predicted that expression of H3.1K27M in Arabidopsis may not only inhibit PRC2, but also ATXR5/6. To validate this hypothesis, we first performed ChIP-Rx analysis and observed a large decrease in H3K27me1 signal over heterochromatin in H3.1K27M-expressing plants compared to Col-0 and H3.1 WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2B</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining using an H3K27M antibody showed that the mutated histone is enriched at chromocenters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), as expected, because H3.1 proteins are concentrated within heterochromatic domains in somatic cells of Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Staining with an H3K27me1 antibody showed the characteristic enrichment of this histone mark at chromocenters in Col-0 and H3.1 WT plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), but a drastic reduction in H3.1K27M-expressing plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). To demonstrate that the loss of H3K27me1 was due to ATXR5/6 inhibition, we generated transgenic plants expressing H3.1<sub>prom</sub>::H3.3K27M in the wild-type Col-0 background. As ATXR5/6 are unable to interact with H3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), we hypothesized that they would not be inhibited by H3.3K27M, but that PRC2 complexes would be negatively impacted as they can interact with both H3.1 and H3.3 in plants. As expected, we found that the level of H3K27me1 in H3.1<sub>prom</sub>::H3.3K27M plants was similar to Col-0, indicating that the presence of H3.3K27M did not inhibit ATXR5/6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). We did, however, find that the level of H3K27me3 was reduced in these plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), thus confirming that PRC2 activity in Arabidopsis is disrupted by H3.3K27M. Consistent with the immunostaining experiments, we observed a large decrease of H3K27me1 in H3.1K27M-expressing plants, but not in H3.1 <sub>prom</sub>::H3.3K27M plants, in total histone samples extracted from leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

In contrast, a reduction in H3K27me3 was seen in both H3.1K27M and H3.1<sub>prom</sub>::H3.3K27M plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

Based on this, we hypothesized that the effect of H3.1K27M on H3K27me1 levels may work through a similar direct inhibitory mechanism on ATXR5/6. To test this, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> histone methyltransferase (HMT) assays with and without H3.1K27M nucleosomes serving as potential ATXR6 inhibitors. Our results showed decreased levels of methylated H3.1 substrates when H3.1K27M nucleosomes were present in the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">J</xref>). In contrast, H3.1K27A (lysine 27-to-alanine) had a smaller inhibitory effect than H3.1K27M on ATXR6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">J</xref>), which is comparable to the effects of these two H3.1 mutants on mammalian PRC2 activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Overall, our data indicate that, in the presence of H3.1K27M, ATXR5/6-mediated mono-methylation of H3.1K27 is inhibited, leading to widespread loss of H3.1K27me1 in the Arabidopsis genome.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>H3.1K27M induces genomic instability defects similarly to <italic>atxr5/6</italic> mutants</title><p id="P12">Loss of H3.1K27me1 in <italic>atxr5/6</italic> mutants leads to various heterochromatic phenotypes, including chromocenter decondensation, heterochromatin amplification (i.e., an increase in the copy number of transposons and other repetitive elements) and loss of transposon silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).

We use this particular mutant for our studies because complete elimination of ATXR5 and ATXR6 activity is lethal in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). The phenotypic variation between H3.1K27M-expressing plants and <italic>atxr5/6</italic> mutants may be linked to the difference in H3.1K27me1 levels between the two genetic backgrounds. This hypothesis is supported by Western blot analyses showing that H3.1K27me1 levels are much lower in H3.1K27M-expressing plants than <italic>atxr5/6</italic> mutants in two-week old plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

We found that elimination of TSK activity suppressed most of the growth abnormalities and early lethality associated with H3.1K27M expression in the Col-0 background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">B</xref>).

Chromocenter decondensation was also found to be suppressed in H3.1K27M-expressing plants lacking TSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). A possible mechanism of suppression is that H3K27me1 levels are restored to wild-type levels in a <italic>tsk</italic> mutant, however, this was ruled out by immunostaining and Western blot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

It is interesting to note that complete suppression of the genomic instability phenotypes in <italic>tsk</italic>/H3.1K27M plants does not lead to plants morphologically resembling Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">B</xref>). This is likely due to the loss of H3K27me3 in these plants caused by inhibition of PRC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Similar phenotypes were observed in the H3.1<sub>prom</sub>::H3.3K27M plants, where H3K27me3 is reduced, but not H3K27me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, E</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

This results in chromatin binding of TSK outside of its normal spatial and temporal boundaries, and as a consequence, DNA damage. However, it is also possible that H3.1K27M increases the interaction of TSK with H3.1, thus leading to DNA damage at genomic regions where H3.1K27M is inserted. Analysis of the structure of the TSK<sub>TPR</sub>-H3.1 complex does not support this mechanism, as H3.1K27 is positioned within a polar pocket that makes it unfavorable for binding hydrophobic entities such as the sidechain of methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). We verified this by performing <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays and confirmed that the interaction of TSK with H3.1 is reduced when lysine 27 is replaced with methionine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>).

Altogether, these findings support a model where, in plants, genomic instability is not due to a direct interaction between H3.1K27M nucleosomes and TSK, but instead arises from increased levels of H3.1K27me0 leading to ectopic TSK activity.</p><p id="P17">To assess if the inhibitory effect of H3.1K27M and H3.1K27 methylation on TSK binding is conserved in the mammalian TONSL ortholog, we performed binding assays using the complete histone interaction module of TONSL (TPR and ARD domains) or the TPR domain only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>). Interestingly, we found that mouse TONSL<sub>TPR+ARD</sub> and TONSL<sub>TPR</sub> displayed increased binding to H3.1K27M compared to wild-type H3.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I-J</xref>), and that the interaction of TONSL<sub>TPR+ARD</sub> with histones is restricted by H4K20me1, but not H3.1K27me1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4K</xref>). These results suggest that H3.1K27M insertion on chromatin leads to ectopic TSK/TONSL activity in both plants and animals, but via a different mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>H3.1K27M-expressing plants are hypersensitive to the loss of specific DNA repair proteins</title><p id="P18">H3.1K27M expression has similar effects on genomic stability as <italic>atxr5/6</italic> mutants. Our previous work showed that various phenotypes in <italic>atxr5/6</italic> mutants are either enhanced or suppressed by the loss of specific DNA repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). For example, loss of RAD51 (involved in homologous recombination) or Pol θ (key player in theta-mediated end joining [TMEJ]) in <italic>atxr5/6</italic> mutants enhances the growth defects of these plants. This is likely due to an increased reliance on repair of damaged DNA resulting from higher levels of H3.1K27me0 and unregulated TSK activity. In Col-0, mutations in <italic>RAD51</italic> or <italic>POLQ</italic> (coding for POL θ) have no effects on plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). These observations suggest that plants expressing H3.1K27M may also be hypersensitive to the loss of DNA repair pathways due to high levels of DNA damage caused by the oncohistone. To test this, H3.1K27M was first introduced into heterozygous <italic>rad51</italic> mutants (T0 plants), as homozygous <italic>rad51</italic> mutants are sterile and therefore cannot be transformed by Agrobacterium using the flower dip method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Transformation of heterozygous <italic>rad51</italic> mutants with constructs expressing H3.1K27M or H3.1 WT resulted in 1% (1/95) and 25% homozygous <italic>rad51</italic> mutants (T1 plants), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The near absence of homozygous <italic>rad51</italic> mutants in the T1 generation of H3.1K27M plants strongly suggests that homologous recombination is a major contributor to DNA repair and plant/cell viability in H3.1K27M-expressing plants. We could not replicate this strategy to assess the contribution of TMEJ via Pol θ in H3.1K27M plants, as <italic>polq</italic> mutants cannot be transformed via Agrobacterium-mediated flower dipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). As TMEJ relies on resected DNA as a substrate to initiate DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), we tested the effect of MRE11 in plants expressing H3.1K27M. MRE11 is a key component of the MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 (MRN) complex responsible for DNA end resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Similarly to the experiment using <italic>rad51,</italic> we introduced H3.1K27M and H3.1 WT into heterozygous T0 plants since homozygous <italic>mre11</italic> mutants are sterile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). We only recovered 2% (1/59) homozygous <italic>mre11</italic> mutants among the T1 progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). In contrast, transformation of H3.1 WT resulted in 23% of the T1 transformants being homozygous <italic>mre11</italic> mutant, which is close to the expected 25% for a transgene with no effect on plant survival. This result suggests that DNA resection mediated by the MRN complex specifically contributes to the survival of H3.1K27M plants. To further explore if H3.1K27M-expressing plants respond like <italic>atxr5/6</italic> mutants to the absence of key DNA repair pathways, we tested non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) by directly transforming H3.1K27M or H3.1 WT into homozygous <italic>ku80</italic> mutants. The absence of Ku80 in plants expressing H3.1K27M did not enhance growth defects or suppress heterochromatin amplification, which parallels the phenotypes observed in <italic>atxr5/6 ku80</italic> triple mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

As observed in <italic>atxr5/6 rad17</italic> triple mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), loss of RAD17 in H3.1K27M plants abolished heterochromatin amplification while having no measurable effects on plant growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.

Overall, these results demonstrate that the phenotypes of H3.1K27M-expressing plants and <italic>atxr5/6</italic> mutants are modulated by the same DNA repair proteins, and that expression of the oncohistone in Arabidopsis generates a dependence on specific DNA repair pathways for survival.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">Genomic instability is associated with DMG-H3K27a and the H3K27M oncomutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). However, underlying mechanisms directly linking H3K27M to DNA damage in these cancers remains mostly unexplored. In this study, we showed using Arabidopsis as a model that expression of H3.1K27M replicates the genomic instability phenotypes observed in <italic>atxr5/6</italic> mutants, which are caused by misregulation of the TSK-H3.1 DNA repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Loss of H3.1K27me1 in <italic>atxr5/6</italic> mutants or H3.1K27M-expressing plants prevents post-replicative chromatin maturation, leaving H3.1 variants unmethylated. As H3.1K27me0 serves to recruit TSK to chromatin, a model emerges where ectopic binding of TSK to chromatin in H3.1K27M-expressing cells, or its retention on chromatin post-replication, induces DNA damage leading to genomic instability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). More work will be needed to understand the mechanism by which TSK induces DNA damage when it is present on chromatin outside of its normal path of entry and exit during chromatin replication.</p><p id="P20">An important question is whether the findings of this study in plants translate to human cells, and if they can help us understand the etiology of DMG-H3K27a. In mammals, post-replicative chromatin maturation restricting TONSL activity has been shown to depend on SET8-catalyzed H4K20me1, which blocks the interaction between TONSL and chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). H4K20me0 is read by the TONSL ARD domain, which is not present in plant TSK orthologs (SET8 orthologs are also absent in plants) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Both TSK and TONSL contain the TPR domain that mediates the specific interaction with the H3.1 variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). TSK binding to H3.1 is inhibited by methylation of K27 in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), but our <italic>in vitro</italic> results suggest that the TPR domain of TONSL is insensitive to mono-methylation at H3.1K27. This indicates that in contrast to plants, misregulation of TONSL activity in mammals may not occur as a result of genome-wide loss of H3K27 methylation due to PRC2 inhibition by H3.1K27M. However, and again in contrast to plant TSK, this study demonstrates that the TPR domain of TONSL displays enhanced binding to H3.1K27M compared to WT H3.1. Therefore, it is possible that H3.1K27M directly recruits TONSL to chromatin and form stable complexes that are not inhibited by the post-replicative chromatin maturation step mediated by SET8 via H4K20me1. This hypothesis will need to be tested in cell culture systems, but if confirmed, would support a model where H3.1K27M directly induces misregulation of TONSL activity, which may lead to DNA damage and genomic instability as in plants. Interestingly, our results suggest that the K27M mutation also increase the affinity of TONSL for the H3.3 variant compared to the non-mutated H3.3 protein. Therefore, there is a possibility that H3.3K27M expression may also lead to the misregulation of TONSL, with consequences for genome maintenance.</p><p id="P21">Finally, our findings are in line with other studies that point to diverse effects of H3K27M on the regulation of DNA repair pathways and genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). These studies and our work suggest that H3.1K27M not only disrupts cellular identity via loss of H3K27me3, but also modulate the activity of DNA repair pathways to alter genomic integrity and induce tumorigenesis. Although this model underscores the incredible potency of H3K27M in disrupting key biological functions (i.e., epigenetic programming and genomic stability) required for cellular homeostasis, it also points to new therapeutic routes associated with the DNA damage response that could be applied to help manage or cure cancers characterized by this oncomutation.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Plant materials</title><p id="P22">Plants were grown at 22 °C under cool-white fluorescent lights (~ 100 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) in long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark).
