Remarkably, ectopic expression of a canonical HCMV entry receptor in monocytes facilitates productive infection of these cells, demonstrating that given efficient viral entry, monocytes, like macrophages, have the capacity to support productive infection. Among the cell surface proteins that are upregulated upon monocyte differentiation are several integrins, which we show play an important role in HCMV entry into macrophages, partially explaining the differences in viral entry.

Like other herpesviruses, HCMV persists through the lifetime of its host by establishing latency. Cells of the hematopoietic system were identified as key sites for HCMV latency. CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and early progenitors of the myeloid system in the bone marrow as well as blood monocytes are the main cells in which HCMV latency has been characterized <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. However, since CD14+ monocytes are short-lived, it has been proposed that the long-term latent reservoir resides in bone marrow HSCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In contrast, terminally differentiated myeloid cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells are considered permissive for productive HCMV infection, and differentiation to these cell types can lead to viral reactivation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Since there is no suitable animal model for studying HCMV latency, much of the knowledge was gained from research performed in these cell culture models.</p><p id="P3">We previously showed that when macrophages are infected, the main factor that dictates productive infection is the initial levels of viral gene expression and specifically the expression of HCMV immediate early genes, IE1 and IE2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The accepted underlying assumption is that chromatin-dependent repression of the viral genome, and specifically of immediate early genes, is the basis for latent infection in monocytes and HSCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and that differentiation leads to distinct chromatin deposition that enables viral gene expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, the molecular roots for the differences in repression upon differentiation are not fully understood.</p><p id="P4">Here, using metabolic labeling of newly synthesized mRNA, we reveal that unlike in macrophages, early viral gene expression in undifferentiated monocytic cells is almost undetectable. By systematically comparing monocytes and their differentiated counterparts, we show that much of this variation is due to major differences in viral entry and that in monocytes, viral genomes rarely reach the nucleus. Remarkably, ectopic expression of the HCMV entry receptor PDGFRα in monocytes, enabled productive infection. This demonstrates that given efficient viral entry, monocytes have the capacity to support productive infection. We further reveal that several integrins that were previously associated with HCMV entry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> are upregulated upon differentiation and play a critical role in macrophage infection. Overall, we uncovered that inefficient entry is a major factor that drives latent infection in monocytes and that integrins may play a central role in the differentiation-dependent susceptibility to productive infection in macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Viral gene expression is undetectable at early stages of infection in monocytes</title><p id="P5">Monocytes are known to be latently infected with HCMV and do not support productive infection. However, following differentiation they become permissive to productive infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Indeed, we could recapitulate these differentiation-based differences in HCMV infection in primary blood monocytes as well as in the monocytic cell lines THP1 and Kasumi-3, which are commonly used as cell models to study HCMV latency. We infected these cell types with an HCMV TB40-E strain containing a GFP reporter (HCMV-GFP), which allows easy quantification of productively infected cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In the monocytic cells, GFP expression remained low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and correspondingly, no infectious progeny production was detected at 10 days post-infection (d.p.i) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, differentiation of the same cells to monocyte-derived macrophages prior to infection, resulted in a distinct population of cells that expressed high levels of GFP at 3 d.p.i, indicating productive infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and indeed these cells produced infectious progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). We recently showed that initial levels of viral gene expression are a major factor in dictating productive infection in macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Since our work and others have also shown that early in monocyte infection, newly transcribed RNA is masked by relatively high levels of virion-associated input RNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, we sought to directly measure early transcription of viral genes. We applied thiol (SH)-linked alkylation for metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM-seq)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. SLAM-seq facilitates the measurement of newly transcribed RNA based on 4-thiouridine (4sU) incorporation into synthesized RNA. After RNA is extracted, 4sU is converted to a cytosine analog using iodoacetamide, and these U to C conversions are identified and quantified by RNA sequencing. We applied SLAM-seq to both primary and THP1 monocytes and macrophages, starting labeling at 3 hours post-infection (h.p.i) for two and three hours (cells were harvested at 5 and 6 h.p.i). We obtained all characteristics of high-quality SLAM-seq libraries in both primary and THP1-derived cells; &gt;5389 quantified genes and high U to C conversion rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>). The levels of newly synthesized cellular transcripts were comparable between infected primary monocytes and macrophages, as well as between infected THP1 monocytes and THP1 macrophages in both two and three hours of labeling, indicating there are no major biases in our labeling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b</xref>). Remarkably, newly synthesized viral transcripts were almost undetectable in monocytes regardless of the labeling time, while in macrophages new viral transcripts were clearly detected after two hours of labeling and their relative fraction further increased at 3 hours of labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The newly synthesized viral transcripts were predominantly immediate early genes (UL122 and UL123), reflecting the initiation of a productive infection cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c</xref>). These results demonstrate that at early stages of infection in monocytes (both primary and THP1), viral genes are hardly transcribed, while in macrophages they are efficiently expressed.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cell surface proteins are upregulated upon monocyte differentiation to macrophages</title><p id="P6">The complete absence of newly synthesized viral transcripts in infected monocytes, compared to macrophages at such early stages in infection, indicates a fundamental difference in HCMV’s ability to initiate gene expression in these two cell types. In order to unbiasedly search for candidate factors that may explain these dramatic differences, we performed RNA-seq on primary monocytes, THP1 monocytes and Kasumi-3 myeloid progenitor cells, as well as on macrophages derived from the same cells. Thousands of genes were differentially expressed upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis in each of the cell types (primary monocytes, THP1 and Kasumi-3 cells) revealed that common pathways change upon differentiation of THP1 and Kasumi-3 cells, while different pathways change upon differentiation of primary monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In primary monocytes, the most significantly differential pathways were related to inflammation and innate immunity and mainly decreased upon differentiation, with interferon response pathways being the most significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). This is in line with our previous work showing that intrinsic expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) is decreased upon differentiation, and that this reduction contributes to the increased susceptibility of macrophages compared to monocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In THP1 and Kasumi-3, which are tumor-derived cell lines, the most significant changes were decrease in pathways related to cell proliferation, such as E2F targets, Myc targets and G2/M checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). A significant reduction in these cells’ proliferation capacity upon differentiation was previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and as we show below this reduction in proliferation likely plays a role in HCMV infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Significantly enriched pathways that were shared between all three cell types included a reduction in apical junction and myogenesis, both not intuitively related to myeloid differentiation processes or to early viral gene expression.</p><p id="P7">Parsimoniously, we expect the same mechanism to explain the difference in infection upon differentiation in all three cell types, thus in order to reveal molecular processes relevant for the different infection outcomes, we focused on common differentially expressed genes. Upon differentiation, 213 genes were commonly upregulated between primary, THP1 and Kasumi-3 cells, which is a significant overlap (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-5</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a</xref>), and 42 genes were commonly downregulated in all three cell types (<italic>p</italic> = 0.133, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a</xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis on the commonly upregulated genes yielded several pathways related to differentiation and maturation of immune cells and immune signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2b</xref>). Since we revealed massive differences in initial viral gene expression, we next focused on processes that can potentially explain these differences. Although there is a major focus in the field on chromatin-related factors that regulate HCMV repression in monocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, such factors, as a group, were not significantly enriched in the shared genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2c</xref>). Nevertheless, four chromatin-related factors were downregulated upon differentiation in the three cell types, including CHD3, which is implicated in the repression of the HCMV genome through the recruitment of HDACs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We therefore explored the potential involvement of histone deacetylation, which is reported to play a key role in the repression of HCMV, in blocking productive infection in monocytes and macrophages. We tested the ability of the potent HDAC inhibitor, TrichostatinA (TSA), which is known to induce expression of IE genes in THP1 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, to induce productive infection in monocytes. While TSA treatment indeed led to an increase in the percentage of productively infected monocytes, a comparable effect was also observed in macrophages. Furthermore, the TSA effect was minor compared to the effect of differentiation, suggesting additional factors contribute to the differences between monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2d</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Intriguingly, we noticed that as a group, cell surface proteins were significantly upregulated upon differentiation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.042, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), indicating that monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation leads to notable changes in cell surface composition. Since changes in cell surface proteins can affect viral entry, which in turn can lead to drastic differences in viral gene expression, we next examined if surface proteins that were previously associated with HCMV entry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>, compiled based on <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and other studies referred in the table) are upregulated upon monocyte differentiation. We found that surface proteins associated with HCMV entry are enriched in the common upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <italic>p = 0.0062</italic>). These upregulated genes include NRP2, which mediates HCMV entry into non-fibroblasts cells (through the viral pentamer entry complex)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> as well as two integrins, ITGB1 and ITGB3, which were shown to play a role in HCMV entry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S2</xref>). These changes in the expression of cell surface proteins, and specifically those involved in HCMV entry, pointed to possible unexplored differences in viral entry between monocytes and macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Inefficient viral entry into monocytes is a major cause for the lack of viral gene expression</title><p id="P9">To explore if indeed disparities in viral entry may explain the drastic differences in viral gene expression, we quantified the number of viral genomes in the nuclei of infected primary and THP1 monocytes and macrophages by DNA FISH. We found that at 12 hours post-infection (h.p.i), almost none of the monocytes harbor viral genomes in their nuclei, while a considerable portion of macrophages harbor at least one viral genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and 3b). To further examine differences in entry efficiency, we utilized a virus in which the tegument protein UL32 is tagged with GFP (UL32-GFP, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>), allowing fluorescent tracking of viral particles. In correspondence with our DNA-FISH measurements, we found considerably more viral particles within infected macrophages compared to infected monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c and 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To test if viral entry is indeed a critical barrier and overcoming it facilitates infection of monocytes, we ectopically expressed PDGFRα, the major entry receptor of HCMV into fibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, which is not expressed in either monocytes or macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4a</xref>) in THP1 cells (THP1-PDGFRα, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4b</xref>). Remarkably, infection of THP1-PDGFRα with HCMV-GFP, resulted in a distinct population of GFP-bright cells at 3 d.p.i., indicating these cells are productively infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Viral titers from infected THP1-PDGFRα were extremely low (possibly due to interference of the ectopically expressed PDGFRα with the release of viral progeny), however, these cells supported viral genome replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) and generated viral replication compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), illustrating they support productive HCMV infection. Importantly, overexpression of PDGFRα did not result in differentiation of the cells, as the cells did not differ morphologically from the parental THP1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4c</xref>), or show any major changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>), excluding the possibility of indirect effects of PDGFRα expression.</p><p id="P11">To substantiate that ectopic expression of PDGFRα in THP1 monocytes directly affects viral entry, we quantified viral genomes at 12 h.p.i. and found that in contrast to the parental THP1, In THP1-PDGFRα viral genomes reach the nucleus in a considerable portion of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Furthermore, infected THP1-PDGFRα monocytes had significantly more viral particles in the cytoplasm than THP1 monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>) and were actively transcribing viral genes at 5 h.p.i., as measured by SLAM-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that inefficient entry of HCMV into monocytes is the major cause for the lack of viral gene expression and that efficient entry of viral genomes can facilitate productive replication even in monocytes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Integrins play a role in HCMV entry into macrophages</title><p id="P12">Our findings indicate that the different outcomes of HCMV infection in monocytes and macrophages are substantially driven by differences in viral entry. Moreover, several cell surface receptors implicated in HCMV infection are upregulated upon differentiation, three of them, NRP2, ITGB1 and ITGB3 are significantly upregulated in differentiation in all three monocytic cells tested. To test if their upregulation might explain the differences in viral entry, we examined whether any of these receptors are necessary for HCMV entry into macrophages.</p><p id="P13">We first focused on NRP2, which mediates HCMV entry into non-fibroblasts cells (through the viral pentamer entry complex)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. NRP2 transcript levels increased dramatically upon differentiation of monocytes to macrophages in the three cell types tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Indeed, cell surface staining illustrated NRP2 is not expressed on the surface of monocytes and differentiation to macrophages was accompanied by low but detectable cell surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). To test if NRP2 is important for viral entry into macrophages, we used siRNA to knockdown NRP2 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5a</xref>). Surprisingly, NRP2 knockdown did not affect the infection of THP1-derived macrophages, showing it likely does not mediate HCMV entry in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). To rule out lack of effect due to residual expression of NRP2 on the cell surface, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate THP1 cells in which NRP2 was knocked out (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5b</xref>). Infection of differentiated NRP2 knockout cells showed similar levels of infection compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>), indicating NRP2 does not mediate HCMV entry into macrophages and its upregulation cannot explain the differences in viral entry. Importantly, since NRP2 mediates entry through the pentamer complex, and the genes encoding pentamer subunits are often mutated during viral propagation, we sequenced the virus (TB40 strain) we used for infection, and ruled out the possibility that accumulation of mutations in the genes encoding the pentamer explain lack of effect of NRP2 in these cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">methods</xref> section).</p><p id="P14">Both ITGB3, which encodes integrin β3 and ITGB1, which encodes integrin β1, were significantly transcriptionally upregulated upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). These β subunits can dimerize with different α subunits to form canonical heterodimers, some of which were implicated in HCMV entry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. In agreement with our RNA-seq measurements, β3 surface expression was not detected in either primary or THP1 monocytes whereas in macrophages its expression was pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>); β1 was expressed on the surface of monocytes but its expression significantly increased in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To dissect if these integrins play a role in HCMV entry into macrophages, we generated CRISPR knockouts of either ITGB3 or ITGB1 in THP1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6a</xref>). Knockout of ITGB1 did not affect HCMV productive infection in THP1-derived macrophages. However, in the absence of ITGB3, differentiated macrophages were much less susceptible to productive infection compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d and 6e</xref>). We also tested the knockout effect of both ITGB3 and ITGB1 but observed no cumulative effect beyond the effect of ITGB3 knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d and 6e</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We validated these results by performing siRNA knockdown in THP1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6b</xref>), showing that knockdown of ITGB3 leads to a significant decrease in productive infection of macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. s6c and s6d</xref>). Furthermore, to directly test the effect on HCMV entry we infected control and ITGB3 knockout macrophages with UL32-GFP and tracked viral particles, revealing that in ITGB3 knockout macrophages viral entry was significantly inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f and 6g</xref>). These results illustrate that the expression of several integrins significantly increases upon monocyte differentiation to macrophages and that the increase in ITGB3 expression plays a crucial role in the entry of HCMV and subsequently in promoting infection of macrophages.</p><p id="P17">We next explored whether ectopic expression of ITGB3 is sufficient to facilitate productive infection in monocytes. Since ITGB3 was shown to be involved in HCMV entry in a complex with ITGAV (integrin αV), which is also upregulated upon monocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">table S2</xref>), we transduced THP1 cells with both ITGB3 and ITGAV under an inducible promoter. Following the induction of expression, we infected these cells with HCMV-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6e</xref>). Overexpression of ITGB3 and ITGAV in monocytes did not lead to an increase in productive infection compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6h and 6i</xref>). These results demonstrate that, although ITGB3 plays a role in HCMV entry into macrophages, its increased expression in macrophages alone is not the sole factor that facilitates the changes in viral entry and other proteins that are induced upon differentiation are likely required.</p><p id="P18">We further examined expression levels of NRP2, ITGB3 and ITGB1 in CD34+ HSCs which are also known to support HCMV latent infection, by analyzing published RNA-seq data from eight healthy patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. NRP2 and ITGB3 are largely not expressed in these cells, while ITGB1 expression could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6j</xref>). This result is also supported by an additional study, showing rare expression of ITGB3 in CD34+ cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Therefore, the lack of surface proteins essential for HCMV entry is likely a major determinant for latent infection also in CD34+ HSCs.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Genome-wide CRISPR screen reveals additional unexpected barriers for productive infection in monocytes</title><p id="P19">THP1-PDGFRα cells can be used to circumvent the entry barrier for infection in monocytes, enabling us to unbiasedly explore which additional factors affect monocyte infection, by conducting a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). THP1-PDGFRα were transduced with the GeCKO CRISPR/Cas9 knockout library, which targets 19,050 human genes with three guides per gene and one thousand non-targeting gRNA as controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, at low multiplicity of infection to ensure expression of a single gRNA in each transduced cell. We infected these cells with HCMV-GFP and at 2 d.p.i. sorted them to GFP-bright and GFP-dim populations, reflecting productive and non-productive infection, respectively. gRNAs were sequenced from both populations, showing a high correlation between replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7a</xref>). By using MAGeCK analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> we defined genes whose gRNAs are significantly enriched in the non-productive or the productive populations, representing factors enhancing or limiting productive infection, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Reassuringly, one of the top enhancing factors was PDGFRα (which was overexpressed in all cells) illustrating our screen captured genes whose targeting affects HCMV infection in these monocytes. Remarkably, almost all (9 out of 11) of the factors enhancing productive infection with fold change greater than 2 are related to the biosynthesis of proteoglycans and more specifically, to the biosynthesis or modification of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which are known to be required for HCMV entry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, further emphasizing the critical role of viral entry efficiency in controlling infection outcome in monocytes. Intriguingly, analysis of the expression of genes related to heparan sulfate deposition revealed that many of the heparan sulfate related genes that enhance productive infection in our screen are also upregulated upon differentiation (Fig, S7b). These findings suggest that heparan sulfate levels or composition might also differ upon monocyte differentiation and contribute to the differences we observed in viral entry between monocytes and macrophages.</p><p id="P20">None of the genes limiting productive infection were statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>) but gene set enrichment analysis of screen scores revealed significant enrichment in genes related to DNA repair and E2F targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>). These results suggest that the proliferative capacity of THP1 cells also inhibits HCMV productive infection. To explore this possibility, we compared infection between THP1-PDGFRα cells under normal growth conditions and under serum starvation. Serum starvation resulted in a significant increase in cells in G0/G1 phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7c</xref>) and significantly more productively infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>), indicating that the proliferative nature of THP1 monocytes inhibits HCMV infection. Given the significant reduction in cell proliferation following differentiation of THP1 and Kasumi-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>), it is likely that in these highly proliferative cells, the differentiation-associated reduction in proliferation also contributes to the differences in susceptibility to productive HCMV infection in monocytes compared to macrophages.</p><p id="P21">Beyond biosynthesis of proteoglycans, factors enhancing productive infection were significantly enriched in genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7c</xref>). Interestingly, many of the oxidative phosphorylation genes which enhance productive infection in the screen, were also significantly upregulated upon monocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7e</xref>, <italic>p =</italic> 4.5x10<sup>-13</sup>). This suggests that increased oxidative phosphorylation capacity may also contribute to increased permissiveness of macrophages compared to monocytes. We tested whether oxidative phosphorylation levels affect productive infection by utilizing ionophore Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), which reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation. Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation using CCCP at concentrations that reduced oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7d</xref>) but did not affect cell viability (Fig S7e) resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of productively infected THP1-PDGFRα monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7f</xref> and S7f), thus validating the screen results. Moreover, also in primary monocyte-derived macrophages, CCCP treatment that did not affect cell viability (Fig S7e), reduced productive infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7g</xref> and S7g). These results suggest that the differentiation-induced increase in the expression of oxidative-phosphorylation genes contributes to the increase in HCMV permissivity upon monocyte differentiation.</p><p id="P22">Taken together, our results suggest that inefficient entry of HCMV into monocytes constitutes a major barrier to productive infection and is therefore a crucial factor leading to latent infection in these cells. The screen we performed revealed additional cellular processes such as cell proliferation and oxidative phosphorylation that change upon differentiation and affect the ability to establish infection in monocytes, likely further contributing to the establishment of latency in undifferentiated monocytic cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">HCMV infection of monocytes results in a latent infection in which the virus is largely repressed and does not replicate, while following differentiation of these cells, they become permissive to productive infection and produce progeny.</p><p id="P24">Previous studies have shown that latent infection is characterized by extremely low levels of viral transcripts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Using metabolic labeling, we show that viral gene transcription is nearly absent in monocytes while substantial in macrophages, suggesting that viral gene expression is effectively inhibited in monocytes. Chromatin regulation has been implicated as a major factor for viral repression during latency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Although some specific chromatin factors have been attributed to this repression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, the differences between monocytes and their differentiated counterparts with regard to chromatin repression remain poorly defined. Our findings indicate that chromatin-based repression alone does not explain why monocytes fail to support a productive infection outcome. Chromatin repression can be relieved in both monocytes and macrophages using HDAC inhibitors, but productive infection in monocytes remains limited.</p><p id="P25">We found a striking disparity in the abundance of viral genomes within the nuclei of infected monocytes compared to macrophages at early time points, in line with previous studies of monocyte infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, and, notably, a significant difference in the quantity of viral capsids within these cells. This strongly suggests HCMV entry efficiency is a major unexplored barrier for productive infection in monocytes. Remarkably, ectopic expression of the HCMV entry receptor PDGFRα in monocytes facilitated productive infection, underscoring inefficient entry as the primary barrier in these cells. This means that although monocytes are capable of supporting productive infection, they do not reach the required threshold of viral genomes due to entry limitations.</p><p id="P26">By performing unbiased transcriptome analyses, we interestingly found significant upregulation upon differentiation of several cell surface proteins which are linked to the entry of HCMV. In search of the relevant entry receptors, we first tackled NRP2 which mediates HCMV entry into non-fibroblast cells, through the viral pentamer complex. Although its expression increased during differentiation, our results indicate that it does not play a major role in viral entry into macrophages, at least with the TB40 strain. ITGB3 and ITGB1 were both shown to play a role in HCMV entry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> and depletion of these integrins showed that ITGB3, which is not expressed in monocytes, is required for HCMV entry into macrophages. However, overexpression of ITGB3 with its canonical partner, ITGAV, was not sufficient to enable productive infection in monocytes, indicating the involvement of additional factors that are required for entry and absent in monocytes.</p><p id="P27">The notion that entry constitutes a major barrier for productive infection suggests that the number of particles that infect a cell plays a major role in the probability of establishing productive versus latent infection. This raises the possibility that the cell type and possibly different cell states also affect the potential of cells to become latently infected through effects on viral entry efficiency. For instance, infection at low multiplicity of infection, potentially in any cell type, can result in a subset of cells carrying an amount of genomes or particles which is too low to establish productive infection, possibly becoming repressed and maintaining latency. Furthermore, exposure to interferons may affect the efficiency of entry, thereby affecting the likelihood of cells to establish productive infection. Other factors that determine infection outcome, such as transcriptional repression, may be different between different cell types, and affect the threshold for the amount of viral particles that are required to establish productive infection.</p><p id="P28">Overcoming the entry barrier by PDGFRα ectopic expression allowed us to systematically screen for additional factors affecting the ability to establish productive infection in monocytes. We found that the proliferation level of monocytic cell lines affects the level of productive infection, in line with previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. We also show that oxidative phosphorylation genes are upregulated with differentiation and oxidative phosphorylation levels are important for establishing productive infection in monocytes and macrophages. Oxidative phosphorylation is known to be upregulated by HCMV and required for viral propagation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, our results further show that the oxidative phosphorylation state at the time of infection affects its outcome.</p><p id="P29">Overall, we have revealed several processes that contribute to latency establishment in monocytes. Specifically, we uncover inefficient entry as the critical barrier for productive infection in monocytes. These results indicate that the quantity of viral particles entering a cell is a key determinant of the virus’s ability to initiate gene expression and ultimately dictates the outcome of infection. Thus, the propensity of a given cell type to support productive HCMV infection is governed by several interrelated factors: (1) the efficiency of viral entry, (2) the levels of antiviral mechanisms that repress viral gene expression, and (3) additional cellular processes that may enhance or inhibit infection, such as cell cycle stage or levels of oxidative phosphorylation. Our findings have far-reaching implications for understanding of how latency is established <italic>in vivo</italic> and which cell types can serve as latency reservoirs.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="P30">All fresh peripheral blood samples were obtained after approval of protocols by the Weizmann Institutional Review Board (IRB application 92-1) and following informed consent from the donors.
