To address this, we used our insights into hepatic modeling to develop hepatocyte-like liver organoids (HeLLOs), a novel human organoid model with mature hepatocyte functions superior to existing models. HeLLOs are easily established from (small) healthy or diseased liver tissues and rapidly expanded for an extended period in optimized culture conditions. Transcriptomic and functional analyses revealed that differentiated HeLLOs closely resemble fresh primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and perform key hepatic functions such as gluconeogenesis, drug metabolism, and bile acid synthesis. We developed a HeLLO-based toxicity assay with higher sensitivity in predicting liver toxicity of known liver-toxic drugs compared to the gold-standard PHHs. By modeling disease-related mechanisms, such as bile acid transport, HeLLOs uncover transport-inhibition toxicity mechanisms of known liver toxic drugs. Single cell sequencing analysis of HeLLOs identified a heterogeneous cluster of cells with cholangiocyte-like and hepatocyte-like cells, overall resembling liver regenerative cells. As such, HeLLOs hold great promise for advancing liver disease modeling and drug testing. To our knowledge, HeLLOs are the best expandable liver model for predicting adverse drug reactions as well as modeling various liver disease mechanisms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The liver is a vital organ that performs numerous essential functions of metabolism, immunity, digestion and detoxification, most of which are carried out by hepatocytes that constitute 80% of the liver volume. Dysfunction in liver-specific pathways within hepatocytes is often linked to diseases, with drug-induced liver injury (DILI) being one of the most significant hepatocyte-related conditions (Andrade, 2019). DILI can manifest as hepatitis, cholestasis or a mix of liver injuries. Several drug-driven disease mechanisms underlie DILI, such as the build up of lipids (steatosis) and the inhibition of transport causing a build up of bile acids (cholestasis). DILI frequently leads to failure of drugs during and after clinical trials, causing delays and increasing the costs of drug development (Dirven, 2021). To predict DILI in the drug development pipeline and to model various liver diseases, many <italic>in vitro</italic> models have been designed to replicate hepatocyte functions. However, most of the models do not proliferate and/or fail to maintain hepatocyte functions for a significant amount of time. These limitations result in inadequate recapitulation of hepatocyte functions and a consequential lack of assay predictivity, thereby hindering drug development, studies of disease mechanisms, and advancements in personalized medicine (Weaver, 2020).</p><p id="P3">While hepatocytes are challenging to culture, cholangiocytes are highly proliferative <italic>in vitro</italic> (Huch, 2015; Sampaziotis, 2017; Roos, 2022). Previously, cholangiocytes in the mouse and human liver have been shown to transdifferentiate into hepatocytes under certain liver damage conditions <italic>in vivo</italic> (Pu, 2022; Gribben, 2024). As such, others have attempted to use cholangiocytes as an alternative source of hepatocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Intrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids (ICO) are established from a cholangiocyte population, are highly proliferative and can be established from small pieces of liver tissue (Huch, 2015; Marsee, 2021). This enables the generation of patient-specific cultures, which are conducive of personalized modeling approaches. Upon differentiation, ICOs have been suggested to recapitulate important hepatocyte functions. However, through comprehensive analysis of various hepatocyte-like cells, we have shown that ICOs still severely lack crucial hepatocyte functions and predominantly resemble cholangiocytes (Ardisasmita, 2022). Thus, ICOs lack important properties to be used effectively for modeling hepatocyte disease and predicting drug toxicity.</p><p id="P4">Here, we present hepatocyte-like liver organoids (HeLLOs), a highly proliferative human liver model resembling cholangiocytes during expansion, which can be differentiated to express important hepatocyte functions. We show that HeLLOs more closely resemble mature hepatocytes at the transcriptomic and functional level than other hepatocyte models. More specifically, functional analyses show that HeLLOs acquire mature drug metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, bile acid transport, and liver protein secretion functions. Furthermore, these capabilities allow HeLLOs to serve as a reliable platform for modeling and predicting the effects of liver-toxic drugs <italic>in vitro</italic> in terms of cytotoxicity and other toxicity mechanisms. Finally, we show that transferring ICO cultures to HeLLO medium greatly enhances functional hepatic differentiation. Taken together, HeLLOs provide a novel breakthrough technology for patient-derived or healthy liver modeling.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>HeLLOs are easily established, expanded and more hepatocyte-like than existing liver organoid models</title><p id="P5">Various hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) have been published, each with strengths and limitations (Xiang, 2019; Zhang, 2018; Du, 2014; Fu, 2019; Chen, 2018). A significant limitation of the HLCs with strong hepatic phenotypes is their inability to proliferate, suggesting that proliferation and differentiation signals counteract each other. Based on the hypothesis that high proliferation signals hamper the acquisition of mature hepatic phenotype, we defined growth factor-reduced expansion and growth factor-depleted differentiation media for organoid culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). With these media, we established hepatocyte-like liver organoids (HeLLOs) by mincing small liver tissue pieces or biopsies derived from healthy donors or patients and culturing in HeLLO expansion medium (HeLLO-EM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). HeLLO-EM organoids were highly proliferative and exhibited cystic organoid structures similar to other existing liver-derived organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-B</xref>; Huch, 2015; Sampaziotis, 2017). Importantly, HeLLO-EM displayed much higher hepatocyte gene expression than these other organoid models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis also showed upregulation of genes related to hepatocyte functions in HeLLO-EM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>). HeLLOs cultured in hepatic differentiation medium (HeLLO-DM) collapsed into dense organoids and were smaller in size compared to intrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids in differentiation medium (ICO-DM) from Huch et al., which is the liver organoid protocol claiming to derive hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, HeLLO-DM displayed much higher expression of important hepatic markers compared to donor-matched ICO-DM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>) and remained stable for more than two weeks in culture after differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). Finally, using immunofluorescence staining we confirmed that HeLLO-DM showed stronger protein expression of the important hepatocyte markers ALB, CYP3A4, and CYP2E1, compared to ICO-DM derived from the same donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Removal of growth factors drives hepatocyte differentiation of HeLLOs</title><p id="P6">To further demonstrate that the removal of growth factors leads to improved hepatic phenotype in organoid culture, we screened the growth factor-rich ICO-DM. Removal of the growth factors in ICO-DM resulted in a sharp increase of hepatocyte marker gene expression levels indicating that removal of growth stimuli is one of the most important factors for hepatic differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). Interestingly, ICOs cultured in ICO-EM and subsequently differentiated in ICO-DM without growth factors (ICO-DM -GF) still expressed lower hepatocyte gene expression levels compared to HeLLOs cultured in HeLLO-DM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>), indicating that both HeLLO-EM and HeLLO-DM media are important to obtain better hepatocyte phenotypes compared to ICO-EM and ICO-DM. Possibly, the growth factor removal only partially explains the improved hepatic phenotype as other factors in the HeLLO media might contribute as well.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>HeLLOs display a mature hepatic gene expression profile</title><p id="P7">We performed a whole transcriptomic analysis as a comprehensive evaluation of the hepatic differentiation status of HeLLO-DM. CellNet classification indicated that the liver classification increased remarkably in HeLLOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Additionally, Principal component analysis (PCA) of HeLLO-DM showed a clear transition towards the liver in principal component 1, which captures the largest difference between the samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). Both CellNet and PCA results still suggested an incomplete acquisition of hepatocyte phenotypes, which we confirmed by assessing specific hepatocyte and cholangiocyte markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2F</xref>). We observed that upon differentiation, HeLLOs retained some cholangiocyte markers while gaining liver-level expression of important hepatocyte markers. In contrast, ICOs failed to acquire this hepatocyte phenotype, but retained a general cholangiocyte phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D-E</xref>). Upon closer inspection of the transcriptomic differences between HeLLO-DM and ICO-DM, we discovered that HeLLO-DM specifically upregulated hepatic genes important for energy and drug metabolism and transport pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2G</xref>). Furthermore, HeLLO-DM lost the expression of progenitor markers as opposed to ICO-DM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F</xref>). Together, these data show that upon differentiation, HeLLOs acquire a hepatic phenotype while retaining some degree of cholangiocyte identity.</p><p id="P8">Using cross-study transcriptome comparison analysis (HLCompR; Ardisasmita, 2022), we benchmarked HeLLOs to other HLCs. In terms of overall resemblance to primary human hepatocytes (PHH), HeLLO-DM was not the most similar HLC-type to PHHs or the liver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A &amp; B</xref>). However, when considering specific hepatic function gene sets such as gluconeogenesis, drug metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and bile synthesis, HeLLO-DM outperformed most other HLCs and closely resembled the PHHs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>). This shows that HeLLOs strongly express pathways related to specific important hepatic functions, but do not acquire the complete hepatic phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>HeLLOs exhibit mature hepatocyte functions</title><p id="P9">We then set out to assess whether HeLLO transcriptomic resemblance to the liver translated to functional activity for these pathways. HeLLO-DM produced albumin at similar levels to sandwich-cultured PHHs while donor-matched ICO-DM produced only low levels of albumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> &amp; S4A). Similarly, HeLLOs demonstrated a significantly higher alpha-1 antitrypsin production compared to ICOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>). To investigate whether the high gluconeogenic gene expression level in HeLLO-DM also leads to functional gluconeogenesis, we first starved the organoids by exposing them to glucose-free media for 4 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>) followed by incubation in glucose-free media either with or without gluconeogenic substrates and inducers for 24 hours. HeLLO-DM produced glucose only when gluconeogenic substrates and inducers were present, indicating functional gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Next, we tested the metabolic activities of the most important phase I and II drug metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and UGTs; Saravanakumar, 2019). Drug metabolism activities of HeLLO-DM significantly outperformed ICO-DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4D</xref>). HeLLO-DM also showed higher enzyme activities for different enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Importantly, activities of several fatty acid oxidation enzymes in HeLLO-DM were higher than in fibroblasts, which are the current standard for clinical testing (Sim, 2002). Enzymes involved in bile acid synthesis were also more active in HeLLO-DM compared to ICO-DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>HeLLOs can be used as liver disease models</title><p id="P11">An essential function of hepatocytes is the transport of bile into the bile canaliculi. In HeLLOs, the polarization of the organoids is similar to the organization <italic>in vivo</italic>, with the apical lumen of the organoids representing the bile compartment and the basolateral matrix representing the sinusoidal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We developed a bile acid transport assay by exposing HeLLO-DM to a fluorescent bile acid for 24 hours followed by fluorescence imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We observed clear transport of the fluorescent bile acid into the lumen of the HeLLOs, indicating the capacity to model hepatocyte bile acid transport functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). ICO-DM is incapable of such bile acid transport, possibly due to low expression levels of NTCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). To determine the transporters responsible for bile acid transport, we exposed the HeLLOs with drugs known to inhibit the bile acid transporters. We observed complete ablation of bile acid transport after exposure to zafirlukast (NTCP inhibition; Donkers, 2017) and rifampicin (BSEP inhibition; Weaver, 2020; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that bile acid transport is NTCP and BSEP dependent. We also developed a lipid accumulation assay by exposing HeLLO-DM to a high dose of free fatty acids (FFA) for 4-10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) and observed a clear accumulation of lipid droplets inside HeLLOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>HeLLOs can predict drug-induced liver injury</title><p id="P12">Based on the high drug metabolism activity, we set out to test the capacity of HeLLOs to predict drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Cytotoxic effects were measured by exposing HeLLO-DM and ICO-DM for 24 hours with different concentrations of drugs known to induce hepatotoxicity followed by viability assessment using ATP-based assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). First, we performed a dose response viability experiment using acetaminophen, diclofenac (two DILI-associated drugs), and metformin (a non-hepatotoxic drug) in HeLLO-DM and ICO-DM.</p><p id="P13">HeLLO-DM displayed increased sensitivity to liver toxic drugs compared to ICO-DM, as indicated by the decrease in EC50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we compared HeLLO-DM to cultured PHHs, the current gold standard, to predict drug liver toxicity using the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Li et al. 2020</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>). We measured the EC50 of 15 additional DILI-concern drugs (17 in total) and 2 non-DILI-concern drugs (3 in total) in HeLLO-DM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>&amp;B). For each drug, we defined the margin of safety (MOS) values as the ratios of EC50 over Cmax (drug concentration in the blood after a therapeutic dose) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Using an MOS threshold of 100 × Cmax, HeLLO-DM demonstrated greater accuracy in predicting drug liver toxicity than PHHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). HeLLO-DM correctly predicted toxicity for 10 out of 17 toxic drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C&amp;D</xref>), including the 6 drugs correctly predicted by 2D cultured PHHs and 4 drugs that 2D cultured PHHs incorrectly predicted as safe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">DILI may not only arise from direct cytotoxicity, but also from cholestasis. To test whether HeLLOs can model drug-induced cholestasis, we exposed HeLLOs to cholestasis-inducing drugs (using a non-cytotoxic concentration) and performed the bile acid transport assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). We observed a clear absence of bile acid transport after exposure to three known cholestasis-inducing drugs, demonstrating that HeLLOs recapitulate specific <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity mechanisms of cholestatic drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Together, our data show that HeLLOs are more reliable in predicting DILI than current gold standard and can additionally model underlying drug-related disease mechanisms, such as cytotoxicity and cholestasis.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Single-cell sequencing of HeLLOs uncovers heterogeneity within HeLLO-DM organoid populations</title><p id="P15">To assess cellular heterogeneity in HeLLOs, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on donor-matched HeLLO and ICO samples. After filtering out low quality cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A</xref>), we retained 352 ICO-EM cells, 536 ICO-DM cells, 654 HeLLO-EM cells, and 688 HeLLO-DM cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6B</xref>). Interestingly, each organoid type formed separate clusters, indicating distinct cell identities between the organoid types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similar to the bulk RNA sequencing results, the HeLLO-DM cluster displayed the highest hepatocyte marker gene and lowest cholangiocyte marker gene expression levels compared to the other organoid clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">When we further analyzed the clusters, we identified 2 sub clusters of HeLLO-EM (H1 &amp; H2) and ICO-EM (I1 &amp; I2), 3 sub clusters of ICO-DM (ID1-3), and 4 sub clusters of HeLLO-DM (HD1-4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Both H1 and I1 clusters highly expressed proliferation markers related to the S and G2M phases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6D</xref>). To identify the cell identity of each cluster, we performed cell type classification using the human liver development atlas as reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Wesley et al., 2022</xref>). Cluster HD3 scored highest in adult hepatocyte resemblance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) and lowest in adult cholangiocyte resemblance compared to the other clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6E</xref>), which were classified as adult cholangiocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6E</xref>). These were also reflected by the high expression of hepatic marker genes in cluster HD and high expression of cholangiocyte marker genes in the other clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). To further compare the HD3 cluster to hepatocytes, we integrated the hepatocyte data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Aizarani et al. (2019)</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6F</xref>). Although cluster HD3 expressed similar levels of some hepatocyte marker genes, the cholangiocyte marker gene expression levels were still much higher than hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Additionally, there was no observable liver zonation pattern in the HD3 cluster since both hepatic periportal and pericentral modules were expressed in the same cells although with a tendency towards a periportal phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6G</xref>). Together, this indicates that cells in cluster HD3 are in a biphenotypic state between hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.</p><p id="P17">To investigate the transcriptomic changes during the HeLLO differentiation process, we performed a trajectory analysis which showed a differentiation trajectory starting from proliferating cluster H1 to non-cycling H2, moving first to cluster HD1 which branches into cluster HD2, HD3, and HD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6H</xref>). When analyzing the differences between clusters (HD1-4), we observed an intermediary cluster lacking hepatocyte and cholangiocyte expression (HD1), a cholangiocyte cluster (HD2), a secreting cholangiocyte cluster (HD4) and a hepatocyte cluster (HD3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). In this population of cells, HD3 seems to be the end-point according to the trajectory analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6H</xref>). Hence, we inferred that the general trajectory is a cholangiocyte to a hepatocyte phenotype, which is reminiscent of a regenerative transdifferentiation ductular response that has been reported in both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Pu, 2023</xref>; Gribben, 2024). In the mouse study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Pu et al. (2023)</xref>, liver injury caused by hepatocyte senescence resulted in bile epithelial cells (BECs) transforming into the regenerating biphenotypic transitional liver progenitor cells (TLPCs) which express both cholangiocyte and hepatocyte markers. When scoring our samples using the differentially expressed genes between TLPCs and BECs from Pu et al., the HD3 cluster had the highest score for the gene set upregulated in TLPCs and the lowest score for the gene set downregulated in TLPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). This suggests that the HeLLO differentiation process might represent the transdifferentiation found in regenerating BEC ductular response.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>HeLLOs can be established from ICOs</title><p id="P18">Many biobanks and protocols are built on the ICO protocol. To test whether ICOs can be transformed into HeLLOs, ICOs were grown for four passages, the medium was switched to HeLLO expansion medium in passage five (Switch), grown for several days, and subsequently differentiated using HeLLO differentiation medium (Switch-DM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A</xref>). The expression of hepatocyte marker genes of Switch and Switch-DM reached similar levels to HeLLO and HeLLO-DM, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7B</xref>). The overall gene expression of Switch-DM also became more similar to HeLLO-DM than to ICO-DM although still less liver-like than HeLLO-DM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7C</xref>). Switch-DM also transported bile acids effectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7D</xref>). Culturing in HeLLO-EM medium for multiple passages after switching did not alter the hepatocyte gene expression levels markedly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7E</xref>). Finally, switching directly from ICO expansion medium to HeLLO differentiation medium (Direct-DM), diminished the hepatocyte gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7F-G</xref>), once again highlighting the importance of utilizing both optimized expansion and differentiation media to maximize hepatocyte differentiation capacity.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Potential applications of HeLLOs</title><p id="P19">HeLLOs possess the potential to be used for both gene and autologous cell therapies to cure liver-related diseases, possibly by providing an engraftable cell source. As a proof of concept, we gene edited HeLLOs using engineered virus-like particles (eVLPs) containing adenosine base editor (ABE) and single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the <italic>HBEGF</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8A</xref>). Four adenosine bases could be edited in the ABE editing window (A1-A4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8B</xref>). Addition of the eVLPs to the HeLLOs resulted in high editing efficiency, reaching 80% editing in one of the target bases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8B</xref>).</p><p id="P20">For cell therapy purposes, HeLLOs have to be grown in compliance with good manufacturing practice. This includes fully-defined components used during culture. However, the typical hydrogels used for organoid culture (BME) originate from animals and the composition is poorly defined. Synthetic hydrogels solve these problems and increase reproducibility and malleability. Therefore, we tested growing HeLLOs in synthetic and well-defined polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels. The hydrogels were additionally supplemented with arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) peptides. HeLLOs could proliferate in these PEG hydrogels, although at a slower rate than in BME (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8C</xref>). This suggests the necessity of extracellular matrix components to help cell proliferation as previously reported (Ye, 2019).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">In this study, we developed a human liver organoid, designated as HeLLOs, that yields novel insights into liver biology and disease mechanisms. HeLLOs can be efficiently established from small liver pieces or biopsies or from ICOs and are readily expanded using optimized media for both expansion and differentiation to enhance hepatocyte characteristics. Differentiated HeLLOs form dense organoids upregulating hepatic expression while losing progenitor and (some) cholangiocyte markers. HeLLO-DM maintained stable hepatocyte gene expression for over two weeks. Functionally, HeLLO-DM produce albumin and alpha-1-antitrypsin at levels comparable to sandwich cultured PHHs and show remarkably high enzymatic activities of several enzymes in bile acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, HeLLOs represent the first expandable liver cell model with functional gluconeogenesis and hereby offer the first patient-specific long-term model for studying gluconeogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, HeLLO-DM show higher drug enzyme activity of phase I and II drug metabolizing enzymes compared to ICO-DM. In our drug liver toxicity assays, HeLLO-DM more accurately predicted toxicity (HeLLO-DM = 10 out of 17; PHH = 6 out of 17) for known liver toxic drugs than the current gold-standard 2D cultured PHHs and enabled modeling of <italic>in vivo</italic> drug toxicity mechanisms such as cholestasis and steatosis. Single cell sequencing analysis shows cell heterogeneity in HeLLO-DM and presents evidence of the transdifferentiation process from cholangiocytes to hepatocytes. Herewith, we have developed HeLLOs, a human liver organoid platform to model essential liver functions to uncover novel mechanistic insights and develop and test therapies.</p><p id="P22">HeLLOs resemble cholangiocytes in the expansion phase and gain important hepatocyte functions during differentiation. Cholangiocyte transdifferentiation has been proposed as an <italic>in vivo</italic> regeneration mechanism, in which part of the cholangiocyte population transdifferentiates into hepatocytes in mice and men under certain liver damage conditions (Pu, 2023; Gribben, 2024; Akhurst, 2001; Preisegger, 1999). The ICOs generated using Huch et al. protocols are thought to mimic such damage responses (Huch, 2015). Although the Huch protocol proposes a differentiation method to reach a hepatocyte phenotype, we have shown in this and other studies that ICO-DM hardly recapitulates hepatocyte functions (Ardisasmita, 2022; Lehmann, 2022). In this study, we show that HeLLO-DM fills the gaps of ICO-DM by demonstrating a more mature hepatocyte functionality.</p><p id="P23">Single-cell sequencing analysis revealed that HeLLO-DM comprises a mixture of cholangiocyte and hybrid cholangiocyte-hepatocyte cells, and result in an incomplete hepatic classification of HeLLO-DM. Possibly, this indicates that the transdifferentiation process in HeLLO-DM is still incomplete. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous cells in HeLLOs may be advantageous for modeling both cholangiocyte and hepatocyte functions. Our comparison with the TLPCs from regenerating livers (Pu, 2023) revealed that HeLLOs resemble the regenerating liver population in terms of downregulated and upregulated genes between TLPCs and BECs. Given the transition from a cholangiocyte phenotype in HeLLO-EM to a hepatocyte phenotype in HeLLO-DM, this possibly indicates that HeLLOs are the first <italic>in vitro</italic> proof of the capacity of human cholangiocyte transdifferentiation towards hepatocytes.</p><p id="P24">The characteristics of HeLLOs are promising for drug development, particularly for the prediction of drug mechanisms underlying drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Our findings demonstrate that HeLLOs exhibit reliable drug toxicity sensitivity exceeding the current gold-standard PHHs (HeLLO sensitivity: 53%, PHH sensitivity: 27%), and strong functional drug metabolism capacity, showing that HeLLOs are capable of identifying drug toxicity risks. Underlying DILI there are several disease mechanisms leading to toxicity, including cholestasis and steatosis. In the context of cholestasis, we demonstrated proof-of-concept transport inhibition for three drugs known to cause cholestasis. With regards to steatosis, we have already shown that HeLLOs can accumulate lipids upon fatty acid exposure. Furthermore, HeLLOs can generate a diverse panel of donors for population-relevant DILI predictions, which is currently hindered by the availability of donors for PHH-derived and cancer models. Given the FDA’s move from animal testing towards <italic>in vitro</italic> models, HeLLOs offer a compelling alternative to animal testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Wadman, 2023</xref>). Furthermore, it has been proposed that differences between people result in varying toxicological responses that can affect the occurrence of DILI (Chen, 2015). As such, donor diversity represented by HeLLOs could in the future help fill the current gap in liver modeling.</p><p id="P25">In conclusion, we present HeLLOs as a versatile and promising platform for (personalized) liver disease modeling and drug testing. The high expansion and hepatic differentiation potential underscores their value in addressing the limitations of current hepatocyte-like models and support future advancements.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Study approval and human subjects</title><p id="P26">The study was approved by the responsible local ethics committees (Institutional Review Board of the University Medical Center Utrecht (STEM: 10-402/K; TcBio 14-008; Metabolic Biobank: 19–489) and Erasmus MC Medical Ethical Committee (MEC-2014-060)).
