Atrial myocytes express a small acidic organelle called atrial granules (AG), which store and excrete atrial natriuretic peptide and are not expressed by healthy ventricular myocytes. AG are known to be acidic with a high calcium content. The number and position of these calcium-rich organelles relative to other signaling sites has not been investigated. Staining of acidic organelles in adult guinea pig cardiomyocytes showed the presence of fluorescent acidic puncta throughout the cytosol. Atrial myocytes exhibited an increased concentration of acidic organelles at the nuclear poles. Live cell fluorescent studies using PBA to inhibit peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase, a crucial component of AG membranes, effectively eliminated staining at the nuclear poles and most acidic puncta in atrial cells. The application of PBA to ventricular myocytes did not affect LysoTracker staining. Electron microscopy studies on goat atrial fibrillation (AF) and sham control tissue, allowed visualization of AGs. Quantitative analysis revealed AGs to be in close apposition to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. AGs were significantly increased in AF goat samples when compared to sinus rhythm from 3D electron tomography images. Our imaging studies suggest that AGs make up a large percentage of atrial acidic stores, with AG associated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum and their number increasing during AF. We raise the question whether the positioning of AGs are strategic to communicate with other calcium organelles. Further studies to investigate whether AGs contribute to physiological calcium signalling are required.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>atrial granules</kwd><kwd>cardiomyocytes</kwd><kwd>PAM</kwd><kwd>atrial fibrillation</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">In addition to their degradative role in cells, acidic organelles (namely lysosomes) contribute significantly to basal calcium transient amplitude and β-adrenergic responses in both atrial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] and ventricular myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Atrial granules (AGs) are also known to be acidic and contain a high calcium content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Lysosomes, in ventricular myocytes, are located near the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and mitochondria, creating membrane contact sites that can potentially function as signaling microdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. The discovery of AGs and natriuretic peptides within them lead to the atrium being identified as an endocrine organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. AGs are lysosome-related organelles which secrete atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Peptylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] is the primary membrane protein in atrial granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], crucial for amidated peptide biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. PAM plays a noncatalytic role in the atrium and its actions are confined to the early stages of the secretory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. An accumulation of AGs around the golgi complex has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], however their number relative to lysosomes and positioning with relation to other calcium signalling sites has not been fully explored in atrial physiology and pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Myocyte Isolation</title><p id="P4">All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the United Kingdom Home Office Guide on the Operation of Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986. Live cell imaging experiments were conducted on Guinea pig isolated adult atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes. Cell isolation methods were previously published in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Briefly, guinea pig hearts were dissected and washed in heparin-containing PSS (in mM: NaCl 125, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, KCl 5.4, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, glucose 5.5, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8, pH to 7.4 with NaOH, 20 IU heparin per mL to prevent blood clots forming) and mounted on a Langendorff setup for retrograde perfusion via the aorta. The heart was perfused in a modified Tyrode solution containing (in mM): NaCl 136, KCl 5.4, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 12, sodium pyruvate 1, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, EGTA 0.04, glucose 5; gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> to maintain a pH of 7.4 at 37°C for 3 minutes. Solution was switched to a digestion solution: the modified Tyrode above containing 100 μM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.04 mg/ml Liberase™ (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) and no EGTA. After 25 minutes of enzymatic digestion, the heart was removed. Atria were separated from ventricles in a dissection bath. Tissue was cut into small pieces (around 2x2 mm<sup>3</sup>) followed by 1 minute of gentle trituration. Atrial myocytes were stored in a high potassium medium (in mM: KCl 70, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 5, K<sup>+</sup> glutamine 5, taurine 20, EGTA 0.04, succinic acid 5, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 20, HEPES 5, glucose 10; pH to 7.2 with KOH0) and ventricular myocytes were stored in modified Tyrode solution.

Consistent with our live cell results, EM of fixed goat atrial tissue revealed the presence of both lysosomes and AG in atrial myocytes. AG in sham-operated control samples had a maximum diameter of 170±4 nm (n=35 lysosomes, N=4 goats, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). AGs were observed in close apposition to the SR (13.8±1.72 nm at the closest point, n=34, N=4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The average AG was a minimum of 195.6±34.8 nm (n=34, N=4) away from the nearest mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). After 6 months in AF, AGs showed no significant changes in diameter than those observed in sham-operated controls (maximum diameter 164±3 nm, n=50, N=4 goats, P&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In AF tissue, AGs were positioned significantly further away from their nearest SR, at an average distance of 25.1±2.61 nm (n=46, N=4), compared to 13.8±1.72 nm in sham-operated samples (***P&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Our imaging studies suggest that AGs comprise a large percentage of acidic calcium stores within atrial cardiomyocytes. Here for the first time, we describe nanojunctions between AGs and the SR in mammalian cardiomyocytes. In goat AF samples, we observe significant structural remodelling between the positioning of AGs to SR and mitochondria. We found that AGs are situated significantly further away from the SR and closer to mitochondria in goat AF tissue when compared to sham-operated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Similar observations have been made recently by our group in relation to positioning of lysosomes with mitochondria and SR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. The strategic positioning of AG raises the question of whether there is functional cross talk between AGs and other calcium-containing stores. It is an important next step to explore whether AGs contribute to physiological calcium signalling on top of their known hormone secretory role.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S11"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>R.A.B.B. is funded by a Sir Henry Dale Wellcome Trust and Royal Society Fellowship (109371/Z/15/Z) and R.A.B.B. acknowledges support from The Returning Carers’ Fund (Oxford University, Medical Sciences Division).

Maximum AG diameter in sham-operated (n=35) and AF goats (n=50). B: Minimum distance between AG and nearest SR measured in sham-operated (n=34) and AF goats (n=46). C: Minimum distance between lysosomes and mitochondria in sham-operated (n=34) and AF goats (n=48). D: Summary table indicating maximum diameter, nearest SR and nearest mitochondria measured from sham-operated and AF goats tomograms. AG: atrial granules; SR: sarcoplasmic reticulum. E: Snapshot from goat left atrial sinus rhythm control from 3D tomograms F: Snapshot from goat left atrial with AF from 3D tomograms. Snap shots from E and F show proximity of atrial granules (AG, red) to Mitochondria (Mito, blue) and Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR, yellow arrows). Scale bars provided on each image represent 400 nm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201297-f002"/></fig></floats-group></article>
