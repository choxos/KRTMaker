Recently, the interaction of WNKs with Nuclear Receptor Binding Protein 1 (NRBP1) and Transforming Growth Factor β-Stimulated Clone 22 Domain (TSC22D) proteins was reported. Here we explored the effect of NRBP1 and TSC22Ds on WNK signaling in vitro and in the DCT. TSC22D1.1, TSC22D2, and NRBP1 are localized in DCT WNK bodies, which are cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates associated with WNK activation. In HEK293 cells, long TSC22D isoforms and NRBP1 increase WNK4 activity. DCT-specific NRBP1 knockout mice have reduced NCC phosphorylation and activate a compensatory response. Thus, NRBP1 and long TSC22D proteins are positive modulators of WNK signaling and modulate Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption in the kidney. NRBP1 and TSC22Ds likely influence WNK signaling in other tissues, impacting various physiological processes.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Teaser</title><p id="P2">The pseudokinase NRBP1 and its associated TSC22D proteins modulate WNK kinases to regulate sodium reabsorption in the kidney.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The With No lysine (K) (WNK) kinase family is comprised of four members (WNK1-4). These proteins have been implicated in the regulation of cell volume, epithelial electrolyte transport, neuronal intracellular chloride concentration, and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Most of these functions involve phosphorylation by WNK kinases of their canonical downstream targets Ste20-related Proline-Alanine-Rich Kinase (SPAK) and Oxidative Stress Response 1 (OSR1), that in turn phosphorylate and modulate the activity of Cation Chloride cotransporters (CCCs) of the Slc12 family. Among these CCCs, we find the loop diuretic-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup>:K<sup>+</sup>:Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter (NKCC2) and the thiazide-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup>:Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter (NCC), that mediate NaCl reabsorption in the thick ascending limb and distal convoluted tubule (DCT) of the kidney nephron, respectively.</p><p id="P4">Mutations in the genes encoding WNK1 and WNK4 are cause of a tubulopathy called Familial Hyperkalemic Hypertension (FHHt) (also known as Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II or Gordon syndrome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Patients with FHHt present with hypertension, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. These electrolytic derangements are essentially due to the overactivity of NCC that is exclusively present in the apical membrane of the DCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Thus, the role of WNK kinases in DCT physiology has been extensively studied. Evidence suggests that WNK4 is the major catalytically active WNK isoform in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Moreover, in DCT the vast majority of WNK1 mRNA encodes a short isoform (kidney specific (KS)-WNK1) lacking kinase catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Consistent with this, NCC activity and phosphorylation in the DCT, is completely lost in WNK4 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P5">We and others have recently described that during osmotic stress, a condition in which WNK kinases are activated to promote ion influx to the cell through modulation of CCCs, the interaction of WNK1 with Nuclear Receptor Binding Protein 1 (NRBP1) and proteins of the Transforming Growth factor β-Stimulated Clone 22 Domain (TSC22D) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) is stimulated. The latter are known interactors of NRBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). The NRBP family is comprised of two members (NRBP1 and NRBP2) that are highly homologous. Interestingly, these proteins are pseudokinases that are evolutionarily related to WNK kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). They present a general architecture similar to that of WNK kinases, with a short N-terminal domain, followed by the pseudokinase domain, and a C-terminal domain that is much smaller than that of WNK kinases, but that at least contains one common feature, which is a globular Conserved C-Terminal (CCT) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) (also known as PF2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>)). Similar CCT domains are present in WNKs and SPAK/OSR1. The CCT domains of SPAK and OSR1 have been shown to mediate the interaction of these kinases with RFxV motifs present in interacting partners like CCCs and WNKs. In addition, other protein binding motifs have been shown to be present in the C-terminal domain of NRBP1, like a Myeloid Leukemia Factor 1 binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), an elonging BC binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), and a cullin binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The TSC22D family is encoded in mammals by four different genes (TSC22D1-4), some of which can produce multiple isoforms. Of note, the TSC22D isoforms can be classified into short and long isoforms depending on the length of their N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Long isoforms contain a long and mainly disordered N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), followed by a short, structured C-terminal domain known as TSC22 domain that is implicated in homo- and heterodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Within the disordered N-terminal domain, a conserved region that mediates interaction with NRBP1 has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Interestingly, within this region, in addition to a canonical RFxV motif, a highly conserved RWxC motif was also identified that participates in the interaction with NRBP1. Thus, it was proposed that CCT-binding motifs could be termed Rϕ (where ϕ represents an hydrophobic residue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Short TSC22D isoforms lack most of the disordered N-terminal region, and thus lack Rϕ motifs, but retain the C-terminal TSC22 domain. Previous work has shown that short isoforms exert opposing effects to long isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Hyperosmotic stress has been shown to induce the formation of WNK1-containing biomolecular condensates that are formed through liquid-liquid phase separation in response to molecular crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The long, intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of WNKs has been shown to be essential for the formation of WNK condensates. Interestingly, it has been recently shown that TSC22D and NRBP proteins also localize to WNK1-containing condensates induced by hypertonic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that, like WNK1, NRBP1 and TSC22D proteins are essential for adequate cell volume regulation in response to osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). In the kidney, and specifically in DCT cells, WNK condensates are observed under certain conditions in which WNK kinase abundance increases (e.g. hypokalemia and FHHt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Data available in kidney proteomic and transcriptomic databases show TSC22D2 mRNA and protein abundances are considerably higher in DCT than in other nephron segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The data also reveal that the long isoform of TSC22D1 (TSC22D1.1) is also highly enriched within the DCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). In addition, knockout of the <italic>TSC22D3</italic> gene in mice (which encodes several short isoforms) leads to NCC overactivation and an FHHt-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). TSC22D3, also known as Glucocorticoid Induced Leucine Zipper (GILZ), has been shown to reduce SPAK and NCC phosphorylation when overexpressed in cells. These observations suggest that proteins from the TSC22D family in conjunction with NRBP, may play a relevant role in WNK signalling and DCT physiology. In the present study we explored the localization of specific TSC22Ds and NRBP1 in kidney tissues and investigated how these proteins impact the WNK4-SPAK/OSR1 pathway. Our data strongly suggest a physiological role of these proteins in DCT, and this role is most likely generalizable to other cell types and tissues where WNK function is essential.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S4"><title>Expression of the long TSC22D isoforms TSC22D2 and TSC22D1.1 is enriched in the DCT where these proteins are present in WNK bodies together with NRBP1</title><p id="P9">A particular feature of the DCT is that, under certain conditions, WNK4, KS-WNK1, SPAK and OSR1 are observed to localize in cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) that are believed to comprise biomolecular condensates similar to the ones formed in cells treated with hypertonic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). These condensates have been termed WNK bodies. Thus, we sought to investigate the distribution of TSC22D2, TSC22D1.1, and NRBP1 proteins in kidney tissue by immunofluorescent staining at baseline and in mice maintained on a low K<sup>+</sup> diet, a condition in which WNK bodies and NCC activation are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). At baseline, no clear positive signal was observed with the TSC22D1.1 and NRBP1 antibodies, whereas the TSC22D2 antibody displayed a clear apical signal that was exclusively detected in NCC-positive cells (i.e. DCT cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In contrast, in kidneys from mice on low K<sup>+</sup> diet, the three antibodies gave a similar signal: a cytoplasmic punctuate signal. This signal was mainly observed in DCT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), but also seen in a few sporadic NCC-negative cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). The latter were presumably CNT cells in which KS-WNK1 expression, a major driver of WNK body formation, is also observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). We cannot rule out that the absence of signal observed for NRBP1 and TSC22D1.1 in baseline conditions may have been due to insufficient sensitivity of the antibody assay, as NRBP1 expression, for example, is presumed to be ubiquitous and constitutive. However, detection within WNK bodies is likely to be made possible as a result of a high concentration of these proteins within these structures making these more readily detected in the immunofluorescence experiments. A punctuate cytoplasmic localization for TSC22D1.1 and TSC22D2 in DCT cells was also observed in other mouse models in which large WNK bodies have been previously reported: WNK4 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) and KLHL3-R528H knockin mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Interestingly, greater TSC22D1.1 and TSC22D2 abundance was observed in KLHL3-R528H knockin mice and greater abundance of TSC22D1 was also observed in WNK4 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B and C</xref>). In this latter model, WNK bodies presence is thought to be part of a failed compensatory response. Despite being described as transcriptional factors, we failed to detect nuclear signal of TSC22D1.1 or TSC22D2 in both transgenic models where the abundance of these proteins was increased.</p><p id="P11">We confirmed that TSC22D1.1, TSC22D2, and NRBP1-positive cytoplasmic puncta correspond to WNK bodies through colocalization with SPAK or WNK1, which was observed in tissues from mice on low K<sup>+</sup> diet and from WNK4<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The signal observed with the WNK1 antibody most likely corresponded to KS-WNK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Altogether these results show that TSD22D1.1 and TSC22D2 within the kidney are mainly expressed in the DCT where these proteins colocalize with elements of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway in conditions in which WNK bodies are formed. In addition, NRBP1 is also present in DCT WNK bodies.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Co-expression of NRBP1 with long TSC22D isoforms promotes activation of the WNK4-SPAK pathway</title><p id="P12">To explore the physiological role of TSC22D and NRBP proteins in the DCT, we decided to study the effect of these proteins on the activity of the WNK4-SPAK pathway. We focused on WNK4 because, as mentioned earlier, this is the main (and probably the only) catalytically active WNK kinase present in the DCT. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with SPAK, WNK4, NRBP1, and long TSC22D isoforms in different combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). Levels of SPAK phosphorylation (pSPAK) were assessed by immunoblot as a readout for WNK pathway activity. In the absence of transfected WNK4, TSC22D1 and TSC22D4, when expressed together with NRBP1, increased the levels of pSPAK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). A trend toward increased pSPAK was also observed in the presence of TSC22D2 and NRBP1. In the presence of WNK4, all three long TSCs, TSC22D1.1, TSC22D2 and TSC22D4, had an activating effect on SPAK phosphorylation when expressed in conjunction with NRBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). Of note, activation of WNK4-SPAK was also observed in the presence of NRBP2/TSC22D2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S3</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In these experiments, we noted that expression of long TSC22D proteins or WNK4 increased the amount of NRBP1 protein. This effect was additive, as higher NRBP1 levels were observed in the presence of a TSC22D and WNK4, than in the presence of either one of these proteins alone. The increase in pSPAK levels in the TSC22+NRBP1 groups was not due to the higher abundance of NRBP1 in this group because when we compared the effect of increasing NRBP1 abundance by increasing the amount of transfected DNA with the effect observed upon co-expression of TSC22D2, a much more notable increase in pSPAK was observed in the latter case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Finally, to investigate if the observed increase in pSPAK levels was due to increased activity of the WNK kinase (either the endogenous WNK or the transfected WNK4), we assessed WNK4 phosphorylation at the T-loop site (S335 in human WNK4; this is a site that is autophosphorylated and whose phosphorylation promotes kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>)). A clear increase in WNK4 T-loop phosphorylation was observed in the presence of TSC22D2 and NRBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>), suggesting that these proteins increase the ability of WNKs to autophosphorylate. These findings are consistent with the observations made by us in a parallel work in which NRBP1 was shown to increase activity of WNK4 in in vitro kinase assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Knockout of NRBP1 in the DCT reduces NCC phosphorylation</title><p id="P15">To confirm the role of NRBP1/TSC22Ds in the modulation of the WNK4-SPAK pathway in vivo, we generated DCT-specific, inducible NRBP1 knockout mice by crossing conditional ready NRBP1 mice (EMMA Strain ID: 09610) with NCC-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Mice were studied on a normal K<sup>+</sup> diet and on a low K<sup>+</sup> diet for 5 days, the latter to promote WNK4-SPAK pathway activation in the DCT and the formation of WNK bodies. NRBP1 immunostaining of tissues from mice under low K<sup>+</sup> diet confirmed the absence of NRBP1 expression in DCTs from tamoxifen-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). NRBP1-positive condensates were observed in sporadic cells that were NCC-negative, supporting the specificity of the cell type-specific targeting strategy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). In contrast, NRBP2 staining in knockout mice on low K<sup>+</sup> diet showed a clear positive signal in the DCT, where NRBP2 localized in WNK bodies. Large WNK4-positive WNK bodies were also observed in the knockouts. Moreover, under normal K<sup>+</sup> diet WNK bodies were observed in the knockout mice, whereas, under these conditions, WNK bodies were absent in the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Analysis of WNK4-positive WNK bodies of mice under low K<sup>+</sup> diet showed that these were larger in size and had reduced circularity in the knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). A tendency for higher number of WNK bodies was also observed. Interestingly, reduced pNCC and NCC levels were observed in NRBP1 knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D-E</xref>). Previous work has also shown in WNK4 and other WNK-pathway deficient mice that loss of NCC phosphorylation results in a marked reduction in NCC protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). No differences in the levels of pSPAK/OSR1, SPAK, NRBP1, or WNK4 were observed presumably due the ubiquitous nature of these proteins that may have obscured changes occurring only in the DCT. Thus, the presence of NRBP2 in the DCT and the likely compensatory increase in WNK bodies observed in the knockouts did not appear to be sufficient to prevent a defect in pathway activation in the absence of NRBP1. This compensation, however, probably prevented a more dramatic decrease in NCC phosphorylation and activity which is why no dramatic electrolytic derangements were observed other than a tendency to hypokalemia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Activation of the WNK4-SPAK pathway by NRBP1/TSC22D2 depends on direct or indirect interactions mediated by CCT domains and RΦ motifs</title><p id="P16">It is well known that the direct WNK-SPAK/OSR1 interaction depends on the CCT domain in SPAK/OSR1 and the Rϕ motifs present in WNKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Interestingly, WNK kinases, in addition to Rϕ motifs, also contain two CCT-like (CCTL) domains termed CCTL1 and CCTL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>), whose function has remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). The key residues within the CCT domain of OSR1 that establish interactions with residues of Rϕ motifs have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). We have previously shown that mutations of some of these key residues in the CCTL domains of WNK4 (F476A, F478A) and (V701A, F703A) reduce the ability of the kinase to phosphorylate SPAK, without affecting its interaction with SPAK or its homo- or heterodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that these CCTL domains of WNKs may be relevant for the interaction with the Rϕ motifs of long TSC22D proteins and that a reduced interaction with these proteins may explain the decreased activity of these mutants. To test this, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments in which we observed that, indeed, mutations within the first (CCTL1) or second (CCTL2) CCT motifs of WNK4 reduced its interaction with TSC22D2, and that mutations within both domains (CCTL1,2 mutant) further reduced the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To determine if the reduced activity of the WNK4 CCTL1,2 mutant was due to reduced interaction with TSC22D proteins, we examined the effect of NRBP1 and TSC22D2 co-expression on SPAK phosphorylation in the presence of this mutant version of WNK4. Unexpectedly, co-expression with NRBP1 and TSC22D2 significantly enhanced the mutant’s ability to phosphorylate SPAK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that NRBP1 and TSC22D2 might activate WNK4-CCTL1,2 through an indirect interaction mediated by SPAK (i.e. TSC22D2 may recruit WNK4 through binding to SPAK). This was suspected given that absence of co-localization of TSC22D2 with the CCTL1,2 mutant was rescued in the presence of SPAK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we assessed WNK4 activation by measuring WNK4-T-loop phosphorylation in the wild-type protein, the WNK4-CCTL1,2 mutant, the WNK4-RFAA mutant (in which SPAK interaction is abrogated by mutating the Rϕ motif that mediates interaction with SPAK), and a triple mutant called WNK4-TM, in which both CCTL domains and the SPAK-binding site were mutated. This latter mutant was thus completely unable to establish CCT-Rϕ interactions. We observed that NRBP1 and TSC22D2 increased the level of T-loop phosphorylation for WNK4-WT, WNK4-RFAA, and WNK4-CCTL1,2, but this was not observed with the WNK4-TM construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). This suggests that the activation of the WNK4-CCTL1,2 mutant was indeed facilitated through an indirect interaction with NRBP1 and TSC22D2 mediated by SPAK. In summary, it would appear that there is a very large combinatory of Rϕ-CCT interactions in this pathway’s components that could partially compensate for the absence of a CCT domain or Rϕ motif in any single protein.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Both, WNK proteins and long TSC22D proteins can promote condensate formation</title><p id="P18">When we observed subcellular localization of a GFP-tagged SPAK we noticed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization in the absence of WNK4 and TSC22D2.

These condensates became more prominent when TSC22D2 and WNK4 were co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>). This suggests that WNK4 and TSC22D2 overexpression can promote condensate formation which is consistent with the fact that these proteins contain a large intrinsically disordered domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Interestingly, no condensates were observed when SPAK, WNK4, and TSC22D2 were co-expressed with NRBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Given that increased pSPAK levels are observed under this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) and given that the cells transfected with the four constructs had a more turgent appearance than cells transfected without NRBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>), we suspected that absence of condensation could be due to an Slc12-mediated increase in cell volume that would decrease molecular crowding and prevent WNK condensation. This hypothesis was indeed supported by the observation that in Slc12 knockout cells, in which NKCC1 and all KCCs were knocked out and absence of SLC12 activity was confirmed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>), NRBP1 overexpression in the presence of SPAK, WNK4, and TSC22D2 did not prevent condensate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Colocalization of WNKs and TSC22D proteins in condensates depend on both direct and indirect interactions</title><p id="P19">As mentioned above, the WNK4 T-loop phosphorylation experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref> suggested the occurrence of an indirect interaction between WNK4 and TSC22D2 mediated by SPAK. Further supporting this observation, we observed co-localization of WNK4-WT, WNK4-CCTL1,2, and WNK4-RFAA with TSC22D2 and SPAK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A-C</xref>), but we did not observe colocalization of WNK4-TM with these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8D-E</xref>). Interestingly, in this latter case, we observed WNK4-positive condensates that were negative for TSC22D2 and SPAK, as well as TSC22D2/SPAK-positive condensates that were negative for WNK4 coexisting within cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8E</xref>). These results showed that, as long as WNK4 can establish interactions with TSC22D2 or SPAK, it can be recruited to TSC22D2 containing condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8F</xref>). This also suggested that SPAK can maintain indirect interactions with WNK kinases through long TSC22D proteins. Altogether, these results suggest that any interaction that allows for recruitment of the necessary components to the condensates may be enough to facilitate the activation of this system. This conclusion was further supported by the following experiment. When the WNK4-TM was fused to FKBP12 and TSC22D2 was fused to the FKBP-Rapamycin Binding domain of mTOR (FRB domain), addition of rapamycin, a drug that induces the FKBP12-FRB interaction, induced co-localization of WNK4-TM and TSC22D2, as well as SPAK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8G-J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>A short TSC22D isoform, TSC22D3.1, inhibits SPAK phosphorylation</title><p id="P20">Short TSC22D isoforms have been previously shown to exert opposite effects to TSC22D long isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).

This motivated us to investigate the effect of TSC22D3 on the WNK4-SPAK pathway. We observed that the expression of TSC22D3.1 decreased the phosphorylation of SPAK in cells expressing SPAK, WNK4, and NRBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A-B</xref>). A similar inhibitory effect of TSC22D3.1 was observed in the presence of overexpressed TSC22D2.</p><p id="P21">To assess the differential and/or possibly opposing effect of a short versus a long TSC22D protein on WNK condensate formation, we expressed TSC22D2 (a long TSC22D isoform) and TSC22D3.1 (a short TSC22D isoform) alone or in combination, together with WNK4 and SPAK, and observed their effects. When cotransfected with WNK4 alone, SPAK was localized in cytoplasmic condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). SPAK localization was similar when TSC22D3 was added, while TSC22D3 showed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization (i.e. not in WNK condensates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9D</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of TSC22D2 with SPAK and WNK4 (in the absence of TSC22D3) resulted in condensates in which SPAK and TSC22D2 colocalized. These were larger and more irregular in shape, supporting a pro-condensation role, or a condensate modifying property for long TSC22D proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9E</xref>). Finally, in the presence of all components (WNK4, TSC22D3, and TSC22D2), SPAK localization was diffuse in most cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9F</xref>). However, condensates were still present in some cells, and these condensates were positive for both TSC22D2 and TSC22D3 (not shown).</p><p id="P22">We also observed that TSC22D3 can interact with TSC22D2 in immunoprecipitation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9G</xref>).

This hypothesis was supported by the observation that stimulation of TSC22D2 self-oligomerization prevented the inhibitory effect of TSC22D3. Self-oligomerization of TSC22D2 was achieved by fusing TSC22D2 to Cry2-Clust, a light-responsive oligomerization domain from <italic>A.

First, we showed that TSC22D2 and TSC22D1.1 expression is indeed enriched in the DCT when compared to other nephron segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), consistent with previous transcriptomic and proteomic studies. This further highlights the relevance of this signaling pathway in these cells where WNK4 and KS-WNK1 are also enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Moreover, our data showed that, under different conditions in which WNK bodies are formed in the DCT and NCC is activated (e.g. low K<sup>+</sup> diet), TSC22D1.1, TSC22D2, and NRBP1 localize within WNK bodies. This constitutes an additional piece of evidence suggesting the similarity of the low K<sup>+</sup>-induced DCT WNK bodies and the WNK condensates that are induced by hypertonicity in different cell types as part of the cell-volume regulatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Second, our data suggest that NRBP1 and TSC22D proteins can exert an activating effect on the WNK4-SPAK/OSR1 pathway by promoting an increase in the autophosphorylation of WNK4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This is consistent with the observation by Xiao et al. that, like WNK1, TSC22D2 and NRBP1 also participate in cell volume regulation and are functionally related as revealed by co-essentiality analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). It is also consistent with the observation that NRBP1 knockout in cultured cells reduces pSPAK and phosphorylation of WNK1 at the activating Ser382 phosphorylation site, and also that, in in vitro kinase assays performed with recombinant WNK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-449), NRBP1 presence increased the T-loop autophosphorylation of WNK4 as well as the WNK4-mediated OSR1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). This latter result, however, is slightly different from our observations made in the HEK293 assay because in these cells we only observed WNK4 activation in the presence of both NRBP1 and long TSC22D proteins, but not in the presence of NRBP1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This was particularly evident in the dose-response experiments in which the addition of increasing amounts of NRBP1 did not increase pSPAK levels, but addition of NRBP1 together with TSC22D2 had a robust activating effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). The contrast in these observations is likely due to the different nature of the assays (e.g. in vitro context vs. cellular context). Our studies indicate that TSC22D isoforms are likely to be required for NRBP1 to maximally activate WNK4 and likely other WNK isoforms. In future work, it would be important for the impact of TSC22D isoforms to be assessed in the in vitro activation studies.</p><p id="P26">We speculate that a direct interaction between the WNK kinase domain and the NRBP1 pseudokinase domain may occur and that, like for other pseudokinases that have regulatory activity on their related kinases, the pseudokinase (NRBP1) may adopt an active conformation in response to a stimulus (e.g. hypertonicity) that permits its interaction with the kinase (WNKs) leading to its allosteric activation. This proposal is based on interaction models presented in a parallel study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), but importantly this hypothesis remains to be tested experimentally. The requirement for both a long TSC22D protein and NRBP1 to observe activation in the cellular HEK293 assay suggests that TSC22D interaction with NRBP1 may be required to achieve the conformation necessary for interaction with WNK in vivo. Another possibility is that, given that TSC22D proteins are highly disordered and appear to contribute to condensate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>), overexpression of both NRBP1 and long TSC22Ds promote the WNK-NRBP1 interaction to occur within biomolecular condensates where the high concentrations of components of this pathway may enhance WNK kinase activation. Alternatively, WNK condensates may constitute an environment with specific physicochemical properties that may favor WNK activation by NRBP1.</p><p id="P27">The modulatory role of NRBP1 and TSC22D proteins on the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway was demonstrated in vivo, as the inducible deletion of NRBP1 specifically in the DCT significantly reduced the phosphorylation of NCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). NRBP2 presence in these cells likely exerts some compensatory effect, as our data show that NRBP2 can also promote WNK-SPAK/OSR1 activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>), and NRBP2 presence was clearly observed in DCT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Moreover, increased WNK bodies’ size in the knockout mice was probably also part of a compensatory response. Increased presence of WNK bodies has been observed in other models with reduced NCC activity like WNK4 knockout mice and CAB39/CAB39L double knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Interestingly, in the present study increased TSC22D1.1 kidney abundance was observed in WNK4 knockout mice which might also be part of the failed compensatory response that occurs in these mice.</p><p id="P28">Previous works have shown other functional roles of NRBP1 and TSC22D proteins. For example, NRBP1 has been proposed to function as a substrate adaptor molecule for Cullin-Ring Ligase (CRL) complexes with ubiquitin ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Whether this function is related to their ability to modulate the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling pathway remains to be determined. However, the observation that NRBP1 binding to CRL elements (e.g. Elongins B and C) is not modulated by hypertonicity like interaction with WNKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), suggests that these may constitute independent functions. One of the proposed targets for a NRBP1-containig CRL complex is SALL4, a transcription factor that is key in mediating stem cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Inducible knockout of NRBP1 in intestinal progenitor-like cells of mice caused aberrant proliferation of these cells and SALL4 was found to be increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Interestingly, a SALL4 paralogue, SALL3 is highly enriched in the DCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Our data shows that SALL3 can indeed bind NRBP1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>), but we did not observe changes in SALL3 expression or localization in the DCTs of NRBP1 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). Further work is necessary to explore the possible role of NRBP1 in SALL3 regulation in the DCT. In addition, the evidence of the role of NRBP1/TSC22Ds in the regulation of cell proliferation is extensive. For instance, global knockout of NRBP1 in mice was observed to produce an increased incidence of tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) and decreased NRBP1 expression has been observed in a wide variety of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). In drosophila, the NRBP1 homologue MADM and the long TSC22-like protein Bunched A have been shown to promote growth (cell number and cell size) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Whether these roles are related to WNK modulation, CRL function, or both remains uncertain. Further exploration of the DCT-specific knockout mice will be necessary to assess if NRBP1 absence affects DCT cell proliferation.</p><p id="P29">Finally, we also investigated the role of specific domains and motifs involved in the interactions among the components of this pathway. Mainly, we focused on defining the role of each interaction domain/motif present in WNK4. The presence of a single validated Rϕ motif in WNK4 simplified this analysis. Our data is consistent with the notion that the CCT domain-Rϕ motif interaction mechanism comprises the dominant mechanism mediating site-specific interactions among components of this pathway. A summary of the current knowledge is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</xref>. An Alphafold model has been generated in which most of these experimentally-validated interactions are predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). It remains to be determined whether this structured complex can exist within WNK biomolecular condensates. Our data provides at least some evidence that there is certain flexibility regarding the specific interactions that can be used to recruit pathway components to the condensates and promote pathway activation. For instance, it was observed that, in the absence of direct WNK-TSC22D interaction (WNK4-CCT1,2 mutant), the SPAK-WNK4 interaction could recruit WNK4 into TSC22D2 containing condensates, and thus, TSC22D/NRBP1-mediated activation of WNK4 could occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Furthermore, fusion of the exogenous interaction modules FRB and FKBP12 to TSC22D2 and to the WNK4 triple mutant who is incapable of binding SPAK or TSC22Ds, respectively, rescued the interaction in the presence of rapamycin and promoted pathway activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8F-I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Mice studies</title><p id="P30">Animal studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán.

In a first step, guide CCGCTTCCGCGTGAACTTCG targeting <italic>SLC12A2</italic> at exon 1 was inserted into vector pX458 at the <italic>Bbs</italic>I site. HEK293 cells were then transfected with this targeting vector. Two days post transfection, cells were FACS sorted using EGFP fluorescence as a marker of vector expression, and single green cells were plated in 2-3 x 96-well plates. Clones were allowed to grow, transferred to 24-well plates, and tested for NKCC1 function. One clone lacking bumetanide-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A</xref>) was selected and used for targeting K-Cl cotransport function. Note that under regular conditions, there is no KCC function detectable in HEK293 cells. The function can be elicited by exposing cells to the WNK inhibitor WNK463 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref>, bars 1-3). Because transcript abundance of all four K-Cl cotransporters is similar in HEK293 cells (human protein Atlas, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), we targeted the SLC12A4-7 genes at once. The following guides were selected: SLC12A4 (GGGCAGGTACACCCCCATGA), SLC12A5 (CGGCAGGTACACGCCCATGA), SLC12A6 (TGGGAGGTAGACACCC ATGA), SLC12A7 (CGGCAGGTAGACGCCGATGA). Cells were transfected with equal amounts of each pX458 vector, FACS sorted two days later, and clones were isolated and tested for function. Clone HEK293-ΔKCC-26 was selected and further characterized. As seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref> (bars 5 &amp; 6), no activation of K<sup>+</sup> influx is observed in these cells with WNK463, demonstrating absence of K-Cl cotransporter function.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title><sup>83</sup>Rb uptake experiments</title><p id="P40">K<sup>+</sup> influx measurements were performed using <sup>83</sup>Rb as a tracer. Prior to the experiment, cells were plated in 24-well plates pre-coated with poly-L-lysine (0.1 mg/mL). They were then exposed to isosmotic or hyperosmotic (NKCC1 function) saline for 15 min preincubation in the presence or absence of 1 μM WNK463 (Sigma Aldrich). The isosmotic saline contained in mM: 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl<sup>2</sup>, 0.8 MgSO<sup>4</sup>, 1 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The hyperosmotic saline was of identical composition but contained 80 mM sucrose. After aspiration, the preincubation solution was replaced with identical saline containing 100 μM ouabain, 0.25 μCi/mL <sup>83</sup>Rb with or without 20 μM bumetanide (NKCC1 function), 1 μM WNK463 (to activate KCC function), 10 μM ML077 (VU0240551, to inhibit KCC function). Before the flux experiment started, two 5 μL aliquots of radioactive saline were sampled, added to vials containing 5 mL scintillation fluid, and used as standards. Each flux condition was measured in triplicate. The uptake was terminated after 15 min by aspiration of the radioactive solution and 3 rapid washes with ice cold saline. Cells were then lyzed with 500 μL NaOH 0.2N for 1 hour, then neutralized with 250 μL acetic acid glacial. Lysates (150 μL for scintillation counting and 20-30 for protein assays) were sampled. K<sup>+</sup> influx was calculated and expressed in nanomole K<sup>+</sup> per mg protein per min.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Generation of a Long-WNK1 (L-WNK1) knockout HEK293 cell line</title><p id="P41">The PX458 polycistronic plasmid was used that allows for simultaneous SpCas9, GFP, and gRNA expression as described in the protocol by Ran et al.

HEK293 cells were transfected with this plasmid as described in a previous section, detached 48 hours later, and subjected to FACS based on GFP fluorescence for single cell isolation into a 96-well plate. After clonal expansion, cells were subjected to Western Blot to assess the levels of WNK1 abundance and kinase activity by the measurement of pSPAK-S371 phosphorylation (the S motif site, previously identified as S373; see Q9UEW8 in Uniprot). The C3 clone was selected as the knockout cell line, as undetectable levels of WNK1 were found, as well as clearly reduced levels of SPAK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Plasmids</title><p id="P42">All modified constructs (e.g. WNK4 mutants, FKBP12 and FRB fusion proteins, tagged proteins, etc.) were generated by Fast Cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>).

family. The four TSC22D genes (TSC22D1-4) present in mammals can give rise to multiple isoforms through alternative slicing. TSC22D isoforms can be classified into short and long, depending on the absence or presence, respectively, of a long, disordered N-terminal domain. The highly conserved C-terminal domain (named TSC22 domain) is present in all isoforms and is the only region of the protein that presents structural organization. This TSC domain is involved in protein homo- and heterodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Interestingly, only the long isoforms present Rϕ motifs located within a region of intrinsic disorder that have been shown to be necessary for interaction with the CCT domain of NRBP1, but may also mediate interaction with SPAK/OSR1 and WNKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). <bold>(B)</bold> Relative abundance of transcripts and proteins of the NRBP and TSC22D families along different renal segments.

When the Rϕ motif of WNK4 is mutated (WNK4-RFAA), SPAK can be recruited to WNK4-condensates via interaction with TSC22D2. However, when the CCTL domains and the Rϕ motif of WNK4 are all mutated (WNK4-TM), neither SPAK, nor TSC22D2 can be recruited to WNK4 condensates and independent TSC22D-SPAK containing condensates are formed.
