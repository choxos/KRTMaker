Previous studies show transient upregulation of the metallothionein (MT) gene cluster as part of a complex transcriptional response to a class of histone demethylase tool compounds targeting human Fe<sup>2+</sup> dependent ketoglutarate oxygenases KDM6A (UTX) and KDM6B (JmjD3). The prototypic bioactive KDM6 inhibitor GSK-J4 induces apoptotic cell death in multiple myeloma cells and corresponding transcriptomic profiles are dominated by metal and metabolic stress response signatures, also observed in primary human myeloma cells. Here we investigate the hypothesis that metal-chelation by GSK-J4 provides the means for transport and intracellular release of Zn<sup>2+</sup> leading to a metallothionein transcriptomic response signature. Live cell imaging of myeloma cells shows transient increases in intracellular free Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations when exposed to GSK-J4, consistent with a model of inhibitor-mediated metal transport. Comparisons of GSK-J4 and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatments in the presence or absence of metal chelators show that both treatment conditions induce different transcription factor repertoires with an overlapping MTF1 transcriptional regulation responsible for metallothionein and metal ion transport regulation. The data provide a possible explanation for the observed metal response upon GSK-J4 inhibition however the relationship with the pro-apoptotic mechanism in myeloma cells requires further investigation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Metal ions derived from iron, copper, zinc, cobalt, chromium, manganese, magnesium, calcium, molybdenum, and non-metal elements such as selenium play fundamental roles in biochemistry. They participate in processes such as transport and utilisation of oxygen, in metabolic pathways as well as in transcriptional regulation and accordingly are required to maintain homeostasis in virtually all aspects of cellular physiology. In humans, both metal deficiencies and metal excess are causative in rare disorders or are involved in cancer or development in a metal-specific manner, including for example abnormal zinc levels leading to growth retardation or altered immune functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Redox-inert metal ions such as Zn<sup>2+</sup> are co-factors for approximately 10% of human proteins, are required for catalytic activity and structural integrity of proteins, or constitute in the case of calcium, and more recently also postulated for zinc, second messengers in cellular signalling processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Levels of free metal ions in cellular systems are tightly regulated and range from atto- to micromolar concentrations, dependent on the metal ion, while total concentrations are often significantly higher due to exquisite proteinaceous buffering systems present within the cell. These buffering and membrane transport systems provide the homeostatic control that maintains essential transition metal ions at characteristic cellular concentrations. A paradigm for biological metal buffering are metallothioneins, isolated in 1950’s as a cadmium binding protein from horse kidney by Vallee and Margoshes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. In humans, metallothioneins constitute a cluster of 14 genes, located on chromosome 16q13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], encoding structurally similar, 60-odd amino acid residue, cysteine-rich intracellular metal-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Metal ligands include zinc and copper, but also others such as cadmium, mercury, platinum as well as silver, providing protection to cells and tissues against heavy metal toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Whilst this toxicological defense mechanism has been postulated early on, more recently metallothioneins have been implicated in normal physiological processes such as hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation, and in disease, such as cancers, through their ability to control zinc levels and maintain redox homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Transcription of metallothionein genes, as well as other genes involved in zinc metabolism such as the zinc exporter SLC30A1 are regulated by the metal-response element (MRE) – binding transcription factor 1 (MTF1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Upon metal exposure or cellular changes in the availability of metal ions, MTF1 binds zinc and other metal ions in the cytosol, initiating nuclear translocation and chromatin binding of MTF1 to metal response elements (MRE) found in promoters of metallothioneins and other target genes.</p><p id="P5">Metal chelation is an important therapeutic principle in treatment of metal intoxication and in several metabolic and fibrotic diseases, in anti-cancer or anti-infective therapies, where metalloenzymes are selected as drug targets. Inhibitor chemotypes for these metalloenzymes are substrate or co-substrate mimics containing metal chelation motifs. One such example is the prototypic cell-permeable inhibitor GSK-J4, which specifically inhibits the histone lysine demethylases KDM6A and KDM6B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. These enzymes constitute an important class of epigenetic regulators such as” readers, writers and erasers” of a histone code [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. KDM6 enzymes play an important role in regulation of chromatin modifications and belong to the “eraser” group by specifically demethylating methylated histone 3 lysine27 (H3K27me1/2/3/) residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. This lysine methylation constitutes the enzymatic product of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and plays a central role in cellular physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Considering the critical role of metal homeostasis in oncological processes and the inherent metal-chelating capabilities of GSK-J4, our study aims to investigate the effects of GSK-J4’s inhibition of KDM6A and KDM6B on metal ion regulation in myeloma cells. We hypothesize that GSK-J4 mediates its effects not only through epigenetic modifications but also by altering cellular metal landscapes, potentially impacting disease outcomes. This investigation aims to bridge the gap between metal homeostasis and epigenetic regulation, offering new insights into the therapeutic mechanisms of histone demethylase inhibitors in cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>A focused epigenetic compound library screen identifies the KDM6 inhibitor GSK-J4 as anti-proliferative agent across multiple myeloma cell lines</title><p id="P7">We compiled a focused library consisting of &gt;120 validated and well-characterised epigenetic tool compounds to interrogate epigenetic biology, either in-house developed or by using commercially available sources (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI DATA 1</xref>). We have successfully used this approach to investigate and dissect the roles of multiple epigenetic modulators in several areas including oncology, inflammation or stem cell biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Using a colorimetric resazurin-based metabolic viability read-out as proxy for anti-proliferative activity we now assessed activities of epigenetic tool compounds over 72 hrs against 4 multiple myeloma cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI DATA 1</xref>). The library screen clearly identified several epigenetic classes previously shown to inhibit myeloma cell proliferation such as inhibitors for BET bromodomains (eg BRD4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], histone deacetylases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], or methyltransferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], as well as other known metabolic targets such as proteasome or tRNA synthetase inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], which we included as positive controls. In addition we here show that the KDM6 inhibitor series GSK-J4, including its derivative KDOBA67 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] is highly active across all myeloma cell lines tested. The GSK-J4 series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) was developed as a selective, cell-permeable, bioactive tool compound set to interrogate histone demethylase KDM6 biology by using a structure-guided approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Apart from LSD1 (KDM1), histone demethylases belong to a family of evolutionarily conserved 2-oxoglutarate and Fe<sup>2+</sup> dependent oxygenases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. GSK-J1, the intracellularly active molecule, has an IC<sub>50</sub> of 60 nM for KDM6B in an in vitro demethylase assay and binds with its amino-propyl moiety in the 2-oxoglutarate pocket of KDM6, whilst the pyridyl-pyrimidine biaryl of GSK-J1 makes a bidentate interaction with the catalytic metal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). This metal-chelating binding mode is critical for demethylase inhibition. The pyridine regio-isomer GSK-J2 cannot form such an interaction and hence displays considerably weaker KDM6 inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μM) making it an ideal negative control compound to investigate the functional role of KDM6 enzymes. To overcome the issue of cell permeability often encountered with carboxyl-containing molecules, ethyl esters of GSK-J1 and GSK-J2 (GSK-J4 and GSK-J5, respectively) were synthesized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This pro-drug approach provides cell permeability and on-target activity after intracellular cleavage of the carboxyl-ester of GSK-J4 and GSK-J5 which is mediated by unspecific intracellular hydrolases. Accordingly, GSK-J5 does not show anti-proliferative activity in our cell-based screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The KDM6 inhibitor GSK-J4 has potent anti-proliferative activity in multiple myeloma cell lines</title><p id="P8">We determined EC<sub>50</sub> values for several myeloma cell lines showing low-to submicromolar EC<sub>50</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 1.0 +/-0.6 μM for GSK-J4 in the JJN3 multiple myeloma cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, 1E</xref>). Consistent with a metabolic impairment indicating anti-proliferative effects upon inhibitor treatment we observed a reduction of DNA replication as measured by BrDU incorporation, showing a reduction of the proportion of cells in S and G2/M and an increase in sub-G1 cell cycle phases in JJN-3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, JJN3 cells treated with GSK-J4 for 72 hrs exhibited increased expression of apoptosis marker ANNEXIN-V as well as propidium iodide staining by flow cytometry, indicating the activation of a pro-apoptotic mechanism leading to increased cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Transient upregulation of metallothionein genes in myeloma cell lines and patient bone marrow is a pervasive transcriptional signature of GSK-J4 treatment</title><p id="P9">To better understand the GSK-J4 mediated response, we performed transcriptomic analyses using several different methodologies. Firstly, microarray studies of JJN3 cells treated with &gt;EC<sub>50</sub> (2 mM) GSK-J4 over 6 or 24 hr exhibited a strong upregulation of metallothionein genes including <italic>MT1E, MT1F, MT1G, MT1H, MT1X</italic> and <italic>MT2A</italic> while the inactive analogue GSK-J5, did not show any significant transcriptional changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Metallothionein up-regulation correlated with increased expression of the zinc transporter <italic>SLC30A1</italic>, suggesting a potential biological relationship between KDM6 inhibition and zinc homeostasis. This effect was also observed in RPMI myeloma cells. The dominant transcriptional metallothionein induction is also observed at sub-EC<sub>50</sub> (0.5 mM) at 24 hr treatment. This metallothionein response was distinct from that produced by bortezomib – a proteasome inhibitor known to disrupt protein homeostasis in myeloma. In addition to this metal response, a signature of upregulated ATF4 target genes was found in both the GSK-J4 and bortezomib treated cells, reflecting induction of the integrated stress response (ISR) by these compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. By re-analysing previous datasets comprising a wide array of cell-based systems from our and other laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] we indeed detect a significant induction of metallothionein genes upon GSK-J4 exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>), suggesting metallothionein induction as a generic feature of the transcriptional response upon GSK-J4 treatment. We next performed bulk RNA sequencing of JJN3 cells treated with GSK-J4 in a time series for 3hr, 6hr and 24hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-D</xref>). These data revealed a transcriptional signature that consisted of over 2060 genes showing a significant log2-fold change across all timepoints. From the upregulated gene set, an enriched MTF1 transcription factor motif was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), further confirming the presence of a zinc response following GSK-J4 treatment. Similarly, an enrichment of genes associated with the ATF4 transcription factor motif was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). In line with the observed data, Gene Ontology analysis of the transcriptional data at 24 hrs confirmed stress responses to Zn<sup>2+</sup>, regulation of the execution phase of apoptosis and an endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). The metallothionein response was detectable at 3 hrs, was maximal at 6 hrs but began to decline after 24 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). These trends were confirmed by using qPCR of the MT1X gene as surrogate marker, which showed reduced expression after treatment with GSK-J4 for 12 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To investigate whether GSK-J4 produced a comparable response in myeloma patient derived cells, we exposed a myeloma bone marrow aspirate to GSK-J4 for 24 hrs and measured the transcriptional response by single cell sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). In addition to myeloma cells, we also identified clusters of myeloid and lymphoid cells (B-cells, T-cells, NK-cells). Expression analysis reveals that GSK-J4 treatment induces upregulation of metallothionein genes MT1X and MT1G in the myeloma and myeloid and to some extent in the lymphoid cell clusters. The data confirm that the GSK-J4 induction of metallothionein genes, as observed in previous studies in peripheral blood-derived immune cells occurs also in bone marrow immune populations, including myeloma cells. The role of metallothioneins in the immune system is largely underexplored but a role in immunity has been postulated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Modulation of intra- and extracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels regulate metallothionein gene expression</title><p id="P11">We next investigated whether the upregulated metallothionein response to GSK-J4 originated from changes in levels of intracellular or extracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup>. JJN3 cells exposed to GSK-J4 (1hr and 3hr) were treated with either TPEN or EDTA, Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelators that are cell-permeable and non-permeable, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] and the transcriptional metallothionein response was monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A- B</xref>). A similar response pattern was observed in AMO1 and MM1S cell lines, measured at the 3hr timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3-D</xref>). Both TPEN and EDTA significantly reduced levels of MT1X in the DMSO treated control as measured by qPCR, indicating a very tight control of the MT gene locus by Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels. Importantly, the GSK-J4 induced metallothionein response at 3hrs (about 10-fold induction eg in JJN3, about 100-fold in AMO1 cells) is completely abrogated by the Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-D</xref>), suggesting that metal levels sensed through MTF1 may be the primary stimulus for the observed transcriptional metallothionein response observed with the KDM6 inhibitor. Bioavailable zinc in the form of ZnSO<sub>4</sub> yields a 10-fold induction by 1 hr, upregulating to nearly 100-fold by 3 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). This strong upregulation can only be partially blunted by the addition of chelating agents, indicating a dominant and tight MTF1 regulation of the transcriptional metal response. While MT2A, MT1X, MT1E and MT1G are clearly upregulated at the 3-hr timepoint, the magnitude of metallothionein induction differs between GSK-J4 and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatments which may indicate a concentration-dependent effect of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on the transcriptional response.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>GSK-J4 treatment increases intracellular zinc levels in myeloma cells</title><p id="P12">The transcriptional response elicited by GSK-J4 treatment strongly indicates a role for divalent metal ions. Given the effect of chelators, we hypothesized that an increase in intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions might be involved in the process. To investigate this, we used Fluozin-3 AM staining and live cell imaging by fluorescence microscopy to measure intracellular free Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations within single JJN3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Following GSK-J4 treatment, intracellular free Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels transiently increased with a peak observed at 50 min of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), followed by a decline in free Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels. Importantly, exposure of myeloma cells to ZnSO<sub>4</sub> (200 μM) does not reduce cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and we do not observe a shift in the EC<sub>50</sub> of GSK-J4 when JJN3 cells are co-treated with 20μM ZnSO<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). These data are consistent with a Zn<sup>2+</sup> transport into cells directly mediated by GSK-J4, possibly through the pyridine-pyrimidine chelating element of GSK-J4. Such a model implies chelation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> by GSK-J4 from the media, transport of the metal-inhibitor complex across the plasma membrane, and subsequent release of Zn<sup>2+</sup> within the cell.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>GSK-J4 and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment share a common metallothionein and stress response but induce different transcriptional programs and intracellular pathways</title><p id="P13">Above we have shown that GSK-J4 induces a transient increase in intracellular zinc and induces cell death in JJN3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>) but that Zn<sup>2+</sup> alone (through ZnSO<sub>4</sub>) does not induce cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). To identify gene signatures that may be related to induction of cell death by GSK-J4, it was necessary to try and uncouple the temporal dynamics of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> response from the overall GSK-J4 response. We monitored transcriptional changes in JJN3 cells treated with either ZnSO<sub>4</sub> or GSK-J4 over a 24-hour time course. Using a cut-off value of 50 in base mean expression across the different conditions, both ZnSO<sub>4</sub> and GSK-J4 resulted in changes in gene expression over the 24-hr time scale, with 83 differentially regulated genes in the ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment and 124 differentially expressed genes with GSK-J4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A, 5B</xref>). Apart from the metallothionein response genes, bulk RNA-seq data revealed few upregulated genes that overlapped between GSK-J4 and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> conditions. Both treatments regulate genes involved in intrinsic apoptotic signalling pathways and nutrient responses such as HMOX, SESN2, BBC3, ATF3 and DDIT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5C, 5D</xref>). Zn<sup>2+</sup> specific responses are dominated by induction of heat shock proteins and chaperones such as HSPA6, DNAJA4 and DNAJB1, while KDM6 inhibitor (GSK-J4) specific genes involve elements of the ISR and include INHBE, DDIT3, ATF4, HERPUD1 and ERN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Previous work using a MTF1 depletion approach, demonstrated the existence of a network of metal response factors mediating transcriptional responses to Zn2+ treatment, with MTF1 controlling a postulated hierarchical structure of Zn2+ sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Transcription factors control expression of critical genes and thus may play a prominent role in eliciting the differences seen between GSK-J4 and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatments. We next investigated the transcription factor repertoires that each treatment produced. Consistent with an ATF4 dominated response, GSK-J4 treatment leads to the upregulation of several transcription factor genes associated previously with the ISR. In particular, increases were observed for DDIT3, but also CEBPB. Upregulation of chromatin factors such as histone demethylase KDM4A and SS18L1 as part of the BAF complex may indicate an epigenetic component as part of the GSK-J4 response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). In contrast, few transcription factors were differentially upregulated by ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment and did not include any associated with the ISR. Instead, they included early stress response transcription factors such as EGR1, FOS, FOSL or IER5 indicating different stress responses between Zn2+ and GSK-J4 treatment, despite an overlapping metal response pattern.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P14">The transcriptional upregulation of metallothionein genes has been a hallmark of multiple studies using inhibitors of the histone demethylase KDM6 - observed in published RNA-seq datasets generated from different cell types as well as from primary myeloma cells and cell lines. We had originally hypothesized that KDM6 inhibition may directly impact the transcriptional response of the metallothionein locus by virtue of chromatin modification and subsequent gene regulation. However, our data from live-cell imaging and chelation assays demonstrate that GSK-J4 produces a transient surge in intracellular free Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. This suggests that direct metal chelation by GSK-J4 and subsequent transport of an inhibitor-Zn<sup>2+</sup> complex across the plasma membrane is the source eliciting a transcriptional metal response signature. There is clear precedent of small molecules acting as ionophores, e.g. as observed for Zn<sup>2+</sup> transmembrane transport mediated by chloroquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Accordingly, this increase in free intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> provides a reasonable explanation for the increase in metallothionein gene expression that is observed in our study, however this does not rule out additional transcriptional mechanisms that are mediated through KDM6 inhibition. Although ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment and KDM6 inhibition share a metallothionein response through MTF1, the two treatments diverge in other transcription factor repertoires they elicit. Previous studies have shown a hierarchy of Zn<sup>2+</sup> response factors, with MTF1 as dominating transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Differences in transcription factor repertoires, in particular the induction of the ATF4 mediated ISR, might explain the pro-apoptotic effects observed with KDM6 inhibition. Our previous studies in chordoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], NK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], and Th17 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] have consistently shown presence of a dual metallothionein and ATF4 driven response upon GSK-J4 treatment, where the latter may contribute to phenotypic responses such as cytokine regulation in immune cells. Available data suggest that GSK-J4 is not an unselective cellular toxic agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. While immune cells do not display signs of apoptosis but undergo a reversible proliferation block as observed with T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] certain cancer cell types such as chordoma and myeloma experience cell death upon KDM6 inhibition. In chordoma this effect is due to direct regulation of the essential oncogenic transcription factor brachyury (TBXT) by KDM6, resulting in increased repressive H3K27me3 marks thus silencing the oncogenic transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Cancers such as myeloma have a high secretory protein output which requires complex mechanisms to control proteotoxic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. The observed cell death upon KDM6 inhibition in myeloma cells may therefore be related to the ISR dominated by pro-apoptotic DDIT3 expression, an observation with possible therapeutic implications, justifying further studies.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Multiple Myeloma cell lines</title><p id="P15">The human multiple myeloma cell lines JJN3, RPMI-8226, MM1R, and NCI-H929 were gifts from Prof Claire Edwards, NDORMS, University of Oxford.
