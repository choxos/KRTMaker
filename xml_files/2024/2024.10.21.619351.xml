Reduced PCO activity in hypoxia, as seen during submergence, stabilises Group VII Ethylene Response Factors (ERFVIIs), master regulators of adaptive metabolic and anatomic responses. Equally important is timely arrest of these responses upon reoxygenation, assumed to occur through ERFVII degradation. Reoxygenation involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Here, we report that instead of degradation, reoxygenation results in ERFVII nuclear stabilisation, an effect mimicked by direct H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. Interestingly, typical hypoxia marker genes are repressed while genes involved in ROS homeostasis and oxidative stress protection are upregulated. Using <italic>in planta</italic>, heterologous and biochemical assays, we reveal that ROS-related ERFVII stabilisation is caused by PCO inactivation. Stabilised ERFVIIs are retained at hypoxia-responsive promoters but become repressors. Our findings suggest that by responding to both oxygen and ROS, PCOs coordinate ERFVII stability to regulate timely responses to damaging fluctuations in oxygen availability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>peroxide</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>reoxygenation</kwd><kwd>desubmergence</kwd><kwd>plant cysteine oxidases</kwd><kwd>ethylene response factors</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">All aerobic organisms require oxygen for efficient energy generation; they therefore have mechanisms capable of sensing reduced oxygen availability (hypoxia) to coordinate an adaptive response. Plants experience hypoxia as both an acute stress, such as that caused by submergence, or as a developmental cue in rapidly metabolizing tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In both scenarios, the molecular response to the hypoxic conditions has been well characterised and involves reduced activity of oxygen-sensing Plant Cysteine Oxidase enzymes (PCOs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. PCOs create a direct molecular link between environmental O<sub>2</sub> and stabilization of transcriptional regulators including ERFVIIs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Using molecular O<sub>2</sub>, PCOs catalyse the oxidation of the N-terminal cysteine residue of their substrates, forming cysteine sulfinic acid (SO<sub>2</sub>H) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. This initiates degradation of the substrate via the Cys/Arg branch of the PRT6 N-degron pathway in normoxic plants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Alternately, low O<sub>2</sub> (hypoxia) limits PCO activity resulting in substrate stabilisation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In the case of ERFVIIs, the stabilized transcription factors bind to hypoxia responsive promoter elements (HRPE) resulting in the elevated expression of a number of core hypoxia responsive genes (HRGs) required to switch from aerobic respiration to fermentative respiration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. This adaptive response helps plants survive short periods of hypoxia arising from reduced oxygen diffusion when plants are submerged during a flood event.</p><p id="P3">While the acute hypoxia experienced by submerged plants is itself stressful, the reoxygenation that occurs on desubmergence is also challenging. Plants must readapt to aerobic respiration and photosynthesis, as well as cope with photoinhibition and desiccation while enduring sugar and energy shortage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. One outcome of hypoxia followed by rapid reoxygenation in both plants and mammals is a burst of elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular the superoxide anion radical (O<sub>2</sub><sup>●-</sup>) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.These ROS are specific molecular derivatives of oxygen produced during normal aerobic metabolism, primarily in chloroplasts and mitochondria with high electron flow and metabolic rates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Under hypoxia, O<sub>2</sub><sup>●-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production occurs through inefficient O<sub>2</sub> reduction at electron transport chains, as well as by NADPH oxidases such as RBOHD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Upon reoxygenation, the reactivation of mitochondrial and photosynthetic activities, involving proteins which may have been damaged during hypoxia, causes electron leakage in the electron transport chains and membrane associated processes, which subsequently further increases ROS levels to result in a ROS burst <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. There is evidence that this response is associated with hypoxia/reoxygenation in submerged plants: submergence stress in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (hereafter Arabidopsis) is reported to induce systemic ROS wave responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and in Arabidopsis rosettes, desubmergence is reported to induce expression of plasma membrane-localized NADPH oxidase/respiratory burst oxidase that produces superoxide in the apoplastic space <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Given that hypoxia stress entails ROS elevation at its onset and after reoxygenation, there is likely to be cross-talk between cellular responses to both signals. Indeed, in Arabidopsis the hypoxia-responsive universal stress protein 1 (HRU1) is reported to be upregulated by the ROS-related transcription factor heat-shock factor 2A <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> and ROS-responsive genes are activated by hypoxia-responsive ERFVIIs in Arabidopsis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and SUB1A in rice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. However, it is not known whether there is a direct interaction between ROS and the plant oxygen-sensing machinery. ERFVIIs have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in modulating the response to multiple stresses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. It has been proposed that, given the oxygen-sensitivity of the PCOs, reoxygenation would lead to rapid ERFVII degradation and reduced HRG expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Here, we investigated the contribution of ROS (specifically H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> to PCO-ERFVII mediated responses to hypoxia and reoxygenation. We report that upon reoxygenation or direct H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, ERFVIIs in fact remain stable and localised in plant nuclei and that this is due to ROS-mediated PCO-inactivation. Interestingly, we find that ERFVIIs repress HRG expression under these conditions while instead activate expression of genes associated with oxidative stress. These data indicate that the PCO-ERFVII signalling pathway can sense both oxygen depletion and a corresponding ROS surge, allowing them to differentiate between hypoxia and oxidative stress and coordinate the appropriate cellular response.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>ERFVIIs are required for post-hypoxia recovery in Arabidopsis seedlings</title><p id="P5">Given that plant recovery from a submergence event requires survival of the desubmergence-associated ROS burst, we first investigated whether ERFVII stabilisation during hypoxia contributes to tolerance of this ROS burst and the likely resulting oxidative stress by comparing recovery from reoxygenation in Arabidopsis wild type and <italic>erfVII</italic> mutant plants. We subjected seven-day old seedlings to severe hypoxia (0.5 % O<sub>2</sub>, no light) or normoxia (21 % O<sub>2</sub>, no light) for 24 h; their growth phenotype was analysed immediately after the treatment (before reoxygenation) and 4 days after reoxygenation, during which plants were maintained in 16:8 photoperiod under ambient atmospheric conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). While we did not observe differences between the wild type and the mutant immediately at the end of the hypoxic treatment, after 4 days of reoxygenation <italic>erfVII</italic> seedlings that had been exposed to hypoxia demonstrated strongly reduced primary root survival in comparison to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Root growth was impaired after reoxygenation in the <italic>erfVII</italic> seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), which resulted in reduced biomass accumulation compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Although we cannot rule out from this experiment that the differences observed are due to inability of the <italic>erfVII</italic> seedlings to mount an adaptive response to hypoxia, they nevertheless indicated the possibility that ERFVIIs contribute to the plant’s ability to cope with reoxygenation stress.</p><p id="P6">Based on previous studies where constitutive RAP2.2, RAP2.3 and RAP2.12 protein expression caused increased levels of ROS-related genes in Arabidopsis seedlings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, we speculated that ERFVIIs may function to limit ROS accumulation following reoxygenation. As a marker of ROS accumulation, overall levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were compared in <italic>erfVII</italic> mutant and wild type seedlings upon reoxygenation, using 3’3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining. Arabidopsis seedlings were treated with 0.5 % O<sub>2</sub> for 24 h then stained with DAB after 0 h, 1 h and 6 h reoxygenation. Control plants were kept under aerobic conditions for 24 h in the dark, followed by exposure to the light for the same time periods. When compared after reoxygenation, increased DAB staining was observed in <italic>erfVII</italic> seedlings compared to wild type after 1 h, indicating higher accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in <italic>erfVII</italic> than in wild type seedlings upon reoxygenation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F, G</xref>). This result is consistent with a similar study which detected relatively lower levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> upon desubmergence in the aerial tissue of rice expressing <italic>SUB1A</italic>, an N-degron pathway resistant ERFVII, compared with plants lacking <italic>SUB1A</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Together, the results suggest that ERFVIIs contribute to recovery post-submergence by reducing accumulation of ROS upon reoxygenation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ERFVIIs are stabilised in Arabidopsis seedlings by both post-hypoxia reoxygenation and oxidative stress</title><p id="P7">During hypoxic conditions, ERFVIIs are known to be stabilized and accumulate in the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Since our results indicate that ERFVIIs also contribute to growth recovery after reoxygenation, we investigated the abundance and localization of RAP2.12 in Arabidopsis cells in conditions that mimic post-submergence reoxygenation, as well as upon the addition of exogenous ROS in the form of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. We treated transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings constitutively expressing RAP2.12 fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) with or without TBHP (1 mM) in normoxia, hypoxia and after reoxygenation (3 h post-hypoxia, consistent with the timing of oxidative damage of lipids reported in Arabidopsis after desubmergence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>). We then looked for RAP2.12-associated GFP signal in Arabidopsis root cells using confocal imaging. As expected, we observed elevated RAP2.12-GFP localization in the nuclei of hypoxic plants compared to normoxic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Upon reoxygenation, ERFVII may be presumed to destabilize with the resumption of PCO enzyme function in aerobic conditions, however we found that the RAP2.12-GFP signal persisted in the nucleus after 3 h reoxygenation treatment, both in the presence and absence of TBHP. Interestingly, we observed that TBHP treatment resulted in an increase in RAP2.12-GFP signal in the nuclei of plants exposed to both air and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). We confirmed these observations using a second transgenic Arabidopsis line expressing RAP2.3 fused with GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). A time-course observation of TBHP-treated, normoxic plants showed stabilisation of RAP2.3 within less than 2 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). Collectively, these data revealed that ERFVIIs remain stable in the nucleus upon reoxygenation, when plants are exposed to ROS as well as O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="P8">To complement the data obtained with GFP-fused ERFVIIs, we generated an Arabidopsis line constitutively expressing the full RAP2.3-coding sequence fused in frame with the nano-luciferase enzyme (RAP2.3-nLUC). This transgenic line conveniently reports on ERFVII stability. Seven-day old RAP2.3-nLuc seedlings were treated with or without TBHP (1 mM) in normoxia, hypoxia and after reoxygenation, as in the subcellular localisation experiment. As expected, in the absence of TBHP luciferase activity was higher in hypoxic seedlings than in normoxic ones, consistent with N-degron pathway-mediated degradation of RAP2.3 in normoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). TBHP-treated seedlings in normoxia exhibited significantly higher luciferase activity compared to controls, consistent with ERFVII stabilisation under aerobic conditions when cells are exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). We confirmed that this phenomenon is dose- and time-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B, C</xref>) with RAP2.3 stabilization reaching a plateau at 2 h of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, during reoxygenation, and in the absence of exogenous TBHP, luciferase activity did not decrease from hypoxic levels, remaining significantly higher than in normoxic seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Taken together, these measurements quantitatively confirm the stability of ERFVIIs upon both oxidative stress and during the reoxygenation period. A second ERFVII reporter line expressing a 1-28 aa fragment of RAP2.12 fused with the firefly luciferase enzyme (RAP2.12<sub>1-28</sub>-FLuc)<sup>3</sup> exhibited similar behaviour (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>), with elevated FLuc activity in TBHP-treated aerobic and reoxygenated seedlings, further confirming our findings.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>ROS-induced ERFVII stabilisation is conferred via the N-terminus</title><p id="P9">The observations obtained with the RAP2.12<sub>1-28</sub>-FLuc line indicate that the prevention of the predicted O<sub>2</sub>-dependent degradation exclusively required the N-terminal region of ERFVIIs, known to contain the conserved N-degron MCGGAII <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We therefore sought to determine whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated ERFVII stabilisation is conferred via modification of its Nt-Cys (the catalytic target of the PCOs) rather than other ERFVII residues. We used a transgenic RAP2.3-nanoluciferase fusion in which the N-terminal cysteine of the transgenic RAP2.3 is mutated to alanine (C2ARAP2.3-nLUC), thereby preventing PCO-initiated proteolysis of RAP2.3. We examined the luciferase signal in C2ARAP2.3-nLUC seedlings exposed to air or hypoxia and treated with or without TBHP. In contrast to Cys2-RAP2.3-nLuc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>), the luciferase signal of C2A-RAP2.3nLUC did not vary significantly upon hypoxia or TBHP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). This suggested that prevention of ERFVII degradation is specifically due to the inability of the N-degron pathway to process protein N-termini and that TBHP-induced oxidative stress cannot increase ERFVII stability when ERFVIIs are no longer N-degron substrates.</p><p id="P10">The comparative observations of luciferase activity in RAP2.3-, RAP2.12<sub>1-28</sub>- and C2ARAP2.3-linked reporter lines suggested that ERFVII stabilization upon TBHP treatment or upon post-hypoxia reoxygenation is linked to the protection of N-terminal cysteine from the N-degron pathway. To dissect the step at which N-degron processing is inhibited under these conditions, we next used a heterologous DLOR (Double Luciferase Oxygen Reporter) reporter assay developed in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Here, the relative luciferase output (FLuc/RLuc) of the DLOR reporter is strictly dependent on transgenic PCO enzymes (in this case <italic>At</italic>PCO4) expressed in yeast, which otherwise lack N-terminal cysteine oxidation activity. TBHP treatment of exponentially grown yeast caused a fast and dose-dependent increase of DLOR output, thus demonstrating TBHP-induced ERFVII stabilization, similar to our observations in plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B, C</xref>). The optical density (OD) of the TBHP-treated cultures was reduced slightly in TBHP-treated cells compared to control, but this was dose-independent in contrast to the dose-dependent effect on FLuc activity, indicating a specific effect of TBHP on the DLOR system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Having confirmed the stabilisation of ERFVII in PCO-expressing yeast, we then used this system to independently probe each step of the N-degron pathway for susceptibility to TBHP. The Arg/N-degron pathway in yeast is mediated by ATE1-dependent arginylation of Nt-Glu-, Nt-Asp- or Nt-Cys-SOO(O)H-initiating proteins and UBR1-catalyzed ubiquitinylation of Nt-Arg-proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. We used two alternative versions of DLOR, D-DLOR and R-DLOR, in which the Nt-Cys (C) of the RAP2.12<sub>2-28</sub> domain is mutated to aspartate (D) or arginine (R), respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. C-DLOR, D-DLOR and R-DLOR were all treated with 0.5 mM TBHP for 30 min and the relative FLuc activity was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). The signal was increased by TBHP treatment only in C-DLOR yeast, whereas it did not change significantly in D-DLOR and R-DLOR strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results indicate that TBHP does not interfere with ATE1 and UBR1 function, thereby suggesting that ROS-induced ERFVII stabilization in yeast occurs through inhibition of the PCO-catalysed step, suggesting that this is also the case in plants.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> inhibits recombinant PCO enzymes</title><p id="P12">We set out to determine the biochemical mechanism that leads to inhibition of Nt-Cys sulfinylation in plant cells. We first examined whether TBHP or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment could inhibit PCO activity. We treated 10 µM recombinant AtPCO4 with 50 µM TBHP or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and then tested its ability to catalyse oxidation of a 14-mer peptide corresponding to the RAP2.12 N-terminus (hereafter RAP2<sub>2-15</sub>) using liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Both treatments led to a significant reduction in AtPCO4-catalysed RAP2<sub>2-15</sub> oxidation compared to untreated enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). In a dose-dependence assay, we found 3 to 5 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to be sufficient to inhibit 50 % activity of 10 μM AtPCO4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). We also assessed the sensitivity of all five AtPCOs to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, in a 5-minute end point assay with 5 µM or 10 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) and found that all of these enzymes showed significantly decreased activity in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure, with strongest inhibition for AtPCO4 and AtPCO5. Given that Cys residues are susceptible to non-enzymatic oxidation, we also tested whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could directly oxidise RAP2<sub>2-15</sub> under the same conditions and thus generate potential N-degrons. We found that 1mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment resulted in a small amount of spontaneous RAP2<sub>2-15</sub> Nt-Cys oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), comprising sulfenic acid (+16 Da), sulfinic acid (+32 Da) or sulfonic acid (+48 Da) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Under these conditions, direct H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment only resulted in 5.3 % RAP2<sub>2-15</sub> oxidation compared to AtPCO4-catalysed oxidation. Overall, therefore, the results indicate that the primary effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and TBHP on N-degron pathway mediated ERFVII stability is inhibition of PCO activity.</p><p id="P13">To explore the mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated PCO enzyme inhibition, we first tested whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> causes oxidative modification of the PCO4 enzyme. Whole protein mass spectrometry of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated enzyme revealed a +209 Da mass increase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>) which we considered likely due to non-specific oxidation of susceptible residues. Cys residues are particularly prone to oxidative modification to Cys-sulfinic acid, therefore we used a sulfinic acid-specific DiaAlk probe <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> which confirmed that Cys residues of PCO4 undergo sulfinic acid modification upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>). Further interrogation using LC-MS/MS based proteomic analysis of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated and non-treated PCO4 showed that Cys165, Cys172 and Cys190 of PCO4 form sulfinic (+31.98 Da) and sulfonic acids (+47.97), all of which are close to the AtPCO4 active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), with the highest proportion of oxidation occurring on Cys165 upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C-F</xref>). Oxidation of any of these Cys residues could therefore potentially negatively impact the ability of PCO4 to bind substrate or catalyse oxidation. The PCOs are Fe(II)-dependent thiol dioxygenases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), therefore as well as protein modification, ROS-mediated oxidation of PCO active site Fe(II) could result in their inhibition. Continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) spectroscopy revealed that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment resulted in an increase in rhombic Fe(III) signal at the PCO4 active site, similar to that seen upon treatment of isolated Fe(II).<sub>aqueous</sub> with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). This confirmed that Fe(II) oxidation is indeed another possible mechanism for PCO inhibition. Finally, we tested whether the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> mediated inhibition of AtPCO4 could be restored using known cellular reductants glutathione and ascorbate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> as well as a synthetic thiol reductant dithiothreitol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.

To address this conundrum, we set out to investigate whether ROS signalling affects the hypoxia response in Arabidopsis by measuring the expression of hypoxia-responsive genes (HRGs) upon hypoxia, reoxygenation and direct treatment with TBHP. We exposed 7-day old seedlings to 1 mM TBHP or mock control under normoxia, hypoxia and reoxygenation. We monitored the expression of six hypoxia marker genes: three involved in fermentative metabolism (<italic>Alcohol Dehydrogenase 1</italic> (<italic>ADH1</italic>), <italic>Pyruvate Decarboxylase 1</italic> (<italic>PDC1</italic>) and <italic>sucrose synthase 1 (SUS1</italic>)), the <italic>non-symbiotic hemoglobin 1 (Hb1</italic>) and two transcription factors (<italic>HYPOXIA RESPONSE ATTENUATOR1 (HRA1</italic>), and <italic>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARY DOMAIN 41 (LBD41)</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, using real-time qPCR. This analysis confirmed upregulation of all six genes in hypoxia and their downregulation under reoxygenation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), consistent with findings from previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Interestingly, TBHP-treated plants showed significantly lower expression levels of all hypoxia responsive genes compared to untreated plants under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), with expression levels similar to aerobic conditions. These genes also showed low expression levels in reoxygenated plants treated with TBHP. These results are surprising given that we observed ERFVII stabilisation on TBHP treatment and/or reoxygenation and suggested that ROS interfere with the plant’s hypoxia responses, even while plants are experiencing hypoxia stress. Consistent with these observations, expression of the core hypoxia responsive genes in the <italic>RAP2.3-nLUC</italic> transgenic Arabidopsis lines was also elevated in hypoxia, but significantly decreased upon TBHP-treatment under hypoxia and/or under reoxygenation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). To determine whether TBHP-treatment promoted expression of oxidative stress responsive genes, we investigated expression of Cysteine-Rich Receptor-Like Kinase (<italic>CRK36</italic>), GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE (CLASS TAU) 24 (<italic>GSTU24</italic>) and zinc-finger protein (<italic>ZAT12</italic>) in Arabidopsis wild type 7-day old seedlings under similar treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). These genes are reported to be triggered by ERFVII transcription factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We found that all three genes were upregulated upon TBHP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). These results confirmed that the plants did indeed experience oxidative stress as a result of TBHP treatment, and demonstrate that TBHP treatment does not inhibit their transcriptional machinery, but selectively acts to prevent expression of HRGs.</p><p id="P15">HRGs are controlled by ERFVIIs through their interaction with the Hypoxia Responsive Promoter Element (HRPE) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. To understand how TBHP treatment resulted in reduction of HRG expression, we investigated whether oxidative stress reduces the binding of ERFVIIs to HRPEs. To do this, we used a transgenic Arabidopsis line with a synthetic promoter harbouring a five time repeat of HRPE driving the expression of a gene encoding a nanoluciferase enzyme (<italic>nLuc</italic>). We measured the expression level of <italic>nanoluciferase</italic> as well as the expression of the same six core hypoxic genes described above, in air, hypoxia and reoxygenation with or without TBHP-mediated oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>).

These results indicate that TBHP treatment interferes with the transactivation of genes whose promoter includes at least one HRPE, and not through a different DNA motif.</p><p id="P16">We next raised the question of whether oxidative stress hinders the ability of ERFVII to physically interact with the HRPE. We performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiment using a GFP-tagged truncated version of RAP2.12 lacking 13 amino acid residues at the N-terminus (Δ13RAP2.12-GFP, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>). Due to the absence of the Cys- residue at the N-terminus, RAP2.12 is constitutively stable and therefore able to transactivate the hypoxia response. 7-day old seedlings were treated with TBHP upon normoxic conditions, followed by evaluation of the enrichment in the promoter regions of four hypoxia-responsive genes, <italic>ADH1, HB1</italic>, <italic>HRA1</italic> and <italic>LBD41</italic>, together with three ERFVII-dependent oxidative stress-responsive genes <italic>ZAT12</italic>, <italic>ATH8</italic> and GSTU24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). <italic>UBQ10</italic> and <italic>EI4A1</italic> promoters, which do not respond to ERFVII, were used as negative controls. ChIP-qPCR revealed an enrichment for all genes upon normoxic conditions, when compared to the negative controls, confirming that Δ13RAP2.12-GFP binds to the promoter regions of these genes. A significant reduction in genomic enrichment was only observed for the <italic>LBD41</italic> promoter upon TBHP treatment, while no statistical difference was measured for any other promoters. These results suggest that oxidative stress only mildly affects RAP2.12 binding to selected genomic regions. Additional regulation is therefore likely required to reach the complete suppression of the transcriptional hypoxic response observed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>ERFVIIs control transcriptional reprogramming during oxidative stress</title><p id="P17">Having shown that ERFVII stability upon oxidative stress does not induce the canonical hypoxia response, we set out to investigate more broadly the contribution of ERFVII transcription factors to the transcriptional response to oxidative stress. To this end, we sequenced the polyA-enriched transcriptome of 7-day old wild type and <italic>erfVII</italic> seedlings treated with 1mM TBHP. We included untreated seedlings of both genotypes as controls. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>) confirmed a moderate effect of ERFVII inactivation under control conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, where only 92 genes were differentially expressed (|FC|&gt;1.5, p&lt;0.05) between the mutant and the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). The group of significantly down-regulated genes included four of the 49 core-hypoxia responsive genes, likely expressed in cells physiologically exposed to low oxygen tension <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table SX</xref>). The <italic>erfVII</italic> mutant seemed to modulate gene expression as if experiencing a mild oxidative stress under control conditions, as demonstrated by the separation of samples in the dimension primarily affected by TBHP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Moreover, exposure to TBHP exerted a clearly distinct effect on the two genotypes. Indeed, pairwise comparisons revealed that the <italic>erfVII</italic> mutant induced a higher number of genes than the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). We found 282 genes that were both up-regulated in the <italic>erfVII</italic> mutant upon TBPH treatment compared to the wild-type and down-regulated in the wild-type upon TBHP treatment compared to mock conditions. This set of genes included those involved in salicylates-mediated response, senescence, hypoxia and oxidative stress responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). This indicates that TBHP-stabilised ERFVIIs repress these transcriptional responses. In contrast, 136 genes (18%) were not up-regulated by TBHP treatment in the <italic>erfVII</italic> mutant, opposite to what we observed in the wild type, indicating that TBHP-stabilised ERFVIIs also act as activators of expression of this sub-set of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Additionally, the 142 genes which were down-regulated upon TBHP treatment in <italic>erfVII</italic> seedlings, but not in the wild-type, were enriched in GO terms related to plastids, chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F, G</xref>). Overall, our results expand the molecular role of ERFVIIs as both activators and repressors of transcription (in a gene-selective manner) in response to hypoxia and oxidative stress, providing a potential rationale for their implication in responses to both reoxygenation and a broader range of biotic and abiotic stresses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">Plant flood survival requires tolerance to both submergence-induced hypoxia and the reoxygenation stress associated with desubmergence. The molecular response to submergence-induced hypoxia is well-characterised, comprising PCO/O<sub>2</sub>-dependent regulation of ERFVII stability and the consequent upregulation of genes enabling adaptive metabolic reconfiguration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.

We first confirmed that ERFVIIs have a role in facilitating both tolerance to, and recovery from, hypoxia-reoxygenation stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We then confirmed that ERFVIIs persist in the nucleus after reoxygenation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and collected evidence that this is caused by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated inactivation of the plant Nt-Cys-degron pathway at the PCO level, leading to ERFVII stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that ROS-stabilised ERFVIIs do not promote, but rather repress, the expression of hypoxia responsive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Finally, we uncovered that ERFVIIs modulate transcription of a different set of genes in response to ROS than they do in response to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) <bold>suggesting the</bold> PCO-ERFVII signalling pathway can be redirected in a stress-specific manner. ERFVII transcription factors have previously been proposed to mediate responses to multiple stresses, including high salinity, heat and temperature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. These stresses are proposed to impact the degradation of ERFVIIs via the N-degron pathway, for example salt stress is reported to decrease NO production <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> and is speculated to reduce ATE or PRT6 function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Our data, showing that exogenous supply or endogenous production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> results in PCO inhibition and ERFVII stabilisation, suggests that other conditions that involve enhanced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, such as cold stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> or pathogen attack <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, may also invoke ERFVII stabilisation via this method.</p><p id="P19">PCOs are able to respond sensitively to O<sub>2</sub> availability through the kinetic effect on ERFVII oxidation. The response of PCOs to the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> however is less finely-tuned; inhibition of PCO function by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> appeared to occur in a less specific manner, likely via a combination of both oxidation of the active site Fe(II) to Fe(III), as detected by EPR, and via oxidation of Cys residues in or near the active site, as detected by Cys-sulfinate detecting probes and tryptic digest-mass spectrometry. It is also possible that other oxidative modifications took place that we were unable to detect. These modifications are all capable of impacting substrate binding and catalysis to reduce or ablate the activity of the enzyme. While we characterised these effects <italic>in vitro</italic>, the sensitivity of the enzymes to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated inhibition (5 µM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could reduce the activity of 10 µM AtPCO4 by 50%) suggests that local concentrations of ROS at approximately equivalent concentrations to that of enzyme would be sufficient to have a biologically relevant effect. Notably, there is a precedent for ROS-mediated inhibition of oxygen-sensing enzymes in mammalian systems, were H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated inhibition of Factor Inhibiting HIF, an Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate dependent oxygenase, has been reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. We were not able to observe repair of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated PCO inhibition with cellular antioxidants <italic>in vitro</italic>, however it would be of interest to examine whether modulation of redox status in cells could impact ERFVII stabilisation, or indeed whether enzymes that can reverse Cys oxidation may have a role in protecting PCOs from ROS-mediated damage.</p><p id="P20">Our intriguing findings that upon ROS treatment, despite ERFVII stabilisation and retention at HRPEs, HRGs are ‘turned off’ while responses to oxidative stress are ‘turned on’, provide an explanation for the role of ERFVIIs as a major hub to control adaptation to different adverse environment conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The versatility of ERFVIIs in producing stress-tailored responses is surprising and can be explained by their interaction with distinct proteins and DNA motifs. Our results indicate that oxidative stress causes only mild dislocations of ERFVII from hypoxia responsive genes and more likely turns ERFVII from positive to negative regulators of gene transcription. This could explain the limited overlap between the transcriptional changes observed between hypoxia and other stresses that involve ERFVII stabilisation, despite the crucial role these TFs play in enabling tolerance. A systematic survey of their protein and DNA partnerships under different conditions will reveal the complex regulatory networks orchestrated by these TFs. The trihelix TF HRA1, previously reported to associate with RAP2.12 and reduce its trans-activation capacity, is a promising candidate for such a role.The different assortment of conserved motifs identified in ERFVIIs in vascular plants suggests a plethora of different interactions depending on the group member. For example, the Hypoxia Responsive ERFVIIs HRE1 and HRE2 seem to play a minor role in the early activation of hypoxic genes, although it is possible they are majorly involved in other transcriptional responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The generation of ERFVII variants devoid of specific domains will support the hunt and the characterisation of these interactions.</p><p id="P21">The ability of ERFVII to regulate different subsets of genes in response to different stimuli raises questions about the evolution of these TFs. Was the last common ancestor of the ERFVIIs, which likely appeared at the origin of land plants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, a generic regulator of stress tolerance required to cope with an environment of increasing ROS? Or rather did the ERFVIIs evolve first as signaltransducersfor hypoxia, and only later expand their role to accommodate the response to other stresses? In today’s environment, however, it appears that the PCO-ERFVII sensing and signalling nexus is more nuanced than a simple response to fluctuations in O<sub>2</sub> availability. Its sensitivity to oxidative stress, including that which occurs upon reoxygenation, allows dynamic control in response to a range of cues. The overall impact of this ability to switch between subsets of genes explains the key role played by ERFVIIs in plant survival of both submergence and desubmergence.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Star Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="S12"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p id="P22"><italic>A. thaliana</italic> Columbia-0 (Col-0) was used as wild-type ecotype.

Methionine (M) in the N-terminal position is target of the methionine aminopeptidase enzyme (MAP), leaving an exposed cysteine which, in presence of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is targeted for oxidation by plant cysteine oxidase (PCO). The resulting Cys-sulfinic acid is sequentially modified by arginyl aminotransferases 1/2 (ATE) triggering proteasomal degradation after ubiquitination by proteolysis E3 ligase (PRT6), in presence of nitric oxide (NO). Upon hypoxic conditions, ERFVII are stabilized and relocalize to the nucleus where they bind the hypoxia responsive promoter element (HRPE) triggering the hypoxic response.
