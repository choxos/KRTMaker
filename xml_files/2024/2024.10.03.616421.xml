One significant threat is wheat powdery mildew, caused by the obligate biotrophic ascomycete <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic>. This pathogen can reduce grain yield by 7.6-19.9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], leading to annual losses exceeding 4 billion euros worldwide despite the use of agrochemicals, adaptation of agronomic practices and the deployment of resistance cultivars. Although more than a hundred powdery mildew resistance genes (<italic>Pm</italic>) have been reported, only a few can provide effective resistance in the main wheat-growing areas. For example, from the 16 molecularly cloned <italic>Pm</italic> genes, only a handful are efficient against wheat mildew races in three of the 17 Agroecological Zones where wheat is grown, leaving vast regions, like Europe and Central Asia with no effective <italic>Pm</italic> resistance genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], forcing breeders to rely on challenging massive evaluation of overall resistance, which remain challenging to implement in breeding programmes due to the underlying genetic complexity.</p><p id="P5">This moderate efficacy of powdery mildew resistance loci in modern varieties is the result of pathogen adaptation as well as a consequence of the narrow genetic base imposed by the bottlenecks of hexaploidization and domestication, exacerbated during the Green Revolution with breeding activities based on few founders. This resulted in genetic erosion and increasing susceptibility and vulnerability to environmental stresses, pests, and diseases, forcing farmers to increasingly rely on pesticides to control wheat diseases, such as powdery mildew. However, chemical control via pesticides is costly, harmful to ecosystems, and increasingly ineffective due to global fungicide resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Additionally, the European Commission aims to reduce pesticide usage by 50% by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. In this context, resistance breeding is critical for sustainably controlling pests and pathogens while reducing pesticide dependency.</p><p id="P6">Plant disease resistance is molecularly diverse and categorized as either race-specific or quantitative resistance (QR). Race-specific resistance provides mostly complete resistance to some pathogen races and only occurs in the presence of a resistance (<italic>R</italic>) gene in the plant, and the corresponding effector-encoding avirulence (<italic>Avr</italic>) gene in the pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. In contrast, QR provides partial quantitative resistance at the adult plant stage to all races of a pathogen species, independent of rapidly evolving pathogen effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. There are only ~ 460 wheat resistance genes genetically defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] that are currently being used in breeding. However, based on pan-genome analyses, not representative of the all wheat diversity, up to 7,000 resistance genes could be present in the wheat gene pool (Walkowiak et al., 2020). This means that there is a putatively large, unexplored diversity of <italic>Pm</italic> genes stored in wheat gene banks that await being uncovered and used for resistance breeding. In this context, crop wild relatives (CWR) and landraces, genetically diverse populations traditionally cultivated in low-input systems and adapted to different ecoclimatic conditions, represent a valuable genetic resource for improving crops against the occurring climate change.</p><p id="P7">As an alternative to traditional quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) offer a faster approach to identifying statistical associations between phenotypic and genetic variations. This method bypasses the need to create segregating populations, significantly reducing the time required. However, there is a notable lack of assessment of the genetic and, in particular, phenotypic diversity of CWR and landraces, limiting their use in breeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Although genome sequencing costs have dramatically declined, generating reference-quality assemblies of a species like wheat, with its 15Gb genome, remains both expensive and computationally demanding. Alternatively, various array- and sequencing-based genotyping platforms have emerged to interrogate the genome-wide diversity of wheat genomes. One such method is single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based arrays, which have proven useful in identifying disease resistance genes in wheat germplasms. However, they typically rely on a single reference genome (or a few accessions), dramatically limiting the SNP set that can be detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], and they only can detect SNPs but not the remaining structural variations (SVs), such as insertions, deletions, duplications, copy number variants (CNVs) or translocations that have been shown to underlie relevant traits, such as stress tolerance or disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].</p><p id="P8">To overcome these limitations inherent to SNP-based arrays, alternative genotyping approaches were developed, e.g. Diversity Array Technology sequencing, or DArTseq (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.diversityarrays.com/">http://www.diversityarrays.com/</ext-link>), which produces short sequence fragments by restriction enzyme-mediated genome complexity reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. This technology selects predominantly low-copy number regions of the genome and by sequencing small regions, typically 200-300 bp, with high coverage, it enables the calling of high-quality SNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The resulting SNPs information allows interrogating the diversity of hundreds of wheat genotypes at an affordable cost. Such an approach has been successfully applied to wheat in multiple studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p id="P9">In many model species, only one reference genome is used, and wheat is no exception. Most studies involving wheat genotyping define SNPs or other variations relative to the <italic>Chinese Spring</italic> (CS) reference genome. GWAS based on single reference genomes is restricted to the discovery of genes and variations present in that specific reference genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. However, plants have been shown to have extensive structural variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] which cannot be represented by a single reference genome, highlighting the need for more diversity. Further, resistance genes are often part of introgressions from wild relatives or they show presence/absence polymorphism. Consequently, a single reference genome is unlikely to capture all genetic variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. To avoid these two biases one can use multiple reference genomes to increase the variation detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>].</p><p id="P10">Alternatively, an alignment-free approach can be used. This approach differs from the classical SNPs-based markers as it directly correlates the presence/absence of small sequences (typically 31bp), called <italic>k</italic>-mers, with phenotypes. Using <italic>k</italic>-mers as markers allows the detection of almost any type of structural variant, including insertions, deletions, or transpositions in addition to classical SNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. However, one limitation of alignment-free approaches is the challenge of linking <italic>k</italic>-mers with causal genes.</p><p id="P11">To leverage the untapped genetic diversity of wheat accessions and establish a broadly applicable workflow for plant genomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), we assembled a diverse collection of 461 Swiss bread wheat accessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and developed a <italic>k</italic>-mer-based GWAS pipeline using multiple wheat reference genomes inspired by work done in flowering plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-D</xref>). We mapped the raw reads onto ten <italic>T. aestivum</italic> reference genomes generated in the 10+ Wheat Genome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], as well as multiple wheat progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). With this approach, we demonstrated that we could detect a larger diversity of segregating loci involved in powdery mildew resistance that would have been missed using a single reference genome. The association mapping detected multiple known <italic>Pm</italic> genes including <italic>Pm1, Pm2, Pm60</italic>, or <italic>Pm4b</italic>, but also novel regions associated with powdery mildew resistance in chromosomes 3D, 5D, and 6A, totaling 34 potential genomic regions of interest spread across all the subgenomes.</p><p id="P12">Of note, unlike standard GWAS, our method identifies associations with structural variations and sites not present in a single reference genome, highlighting the relevance of landraces and old cultivars stored in genebanks as a source of novel genetic variation important not only for mildew resistance but any other agronomic trait important for adaptation to a changing environment.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S6"><title>A Swiss wheat collection shows variation in powdery mildew resistance to 10 <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates with different virulence profiles</title><p id="P13">Powdery mildew isolates differ in avirulence gene content and, therefore, the observed reaction to wheat <italic>Pm</italic> resistance genes is isolate-dependent. High-throughput sequencing technologies allow a prediction of effector gene content. As most avirulence genes are still unknown at the molecular level, there are no straightforward tools to select <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates with functional effectors without prior functional validation or extensive phenotyping in tester lines. Therefore, we picked <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates from different regions where wheat is cultivated to support a wide search of potential host-resistance components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We selected nine <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f. sp. <italic>tritici</italic> isolates from six of the nine populations representing geographical origins detected by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. These include two Swiss isolates (CHE_96224 and CHE_97251) from the European cluster, and one from England, (GRB_JIW2) Poland (POL_3), Turkey (TUR_1c), Iran (IRN_GOR5), Kazakhstan (KAZ_1b), Argentina (ARG_4_2), and Japan (JPN_CHIKA) each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). An additional isolate from Poland (THUN12), is a hybrid between wheat and rye mildew, which was not part of the PCA analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. The geographic origin of those 10 isolates is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>.</p><p id="P15">To assess the potential of the selected <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates to search for resistance genes, we first determined their avirulence/virulence pattern on 37 <italic>Pm</italic>-tester lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Such tester genotypes have been generated through different crosses, usually involving a wild relative of wheat with a susceptible hexaploid wheat genotype, to ensure the sole presence of a specific <italic>Pm</italic> gene for pathogenicity tests. Across all <italic>Pm</italic>-tester lines, each of the ten isolates revealed a different resistance pattern. Interestingly, only the <italic>Pm13</italic> tester line was resistant to all isolates. In contrast, <italic>Pm9, Pm5b, Pm20</italic>, and <italic>Pm3g</italic> were susceptible to all ten isolates. Overall, we observed a large variation between the <italic>Pm</italic>-tester lines across the isolates, demonstrating the potential of the chosen <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates for detecting a wide variety of powdery mildew resistance genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Using the ten chosen <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates, we then phenotyped a collection of Swiss accessions (<bold>Supplemental Table</bold>), consisting of 139 and 276 spring and winter accessions, respectively, together with 46 accessions of undefined growth habit (growing in both conditions), totalling 461 accessions. Those accessions include old cultivars and landraces and represent a selection of the diversity held in the Swiss genebank. Mildew resistance phenotyping revealed a large variation in powdery mildew resistance among the collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Across the 10 isolates, an average of 80 accessions were resistant to individual <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates, while, on average, 354 were susceptible to single <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). The most virulent <italic>Bgt</italic> isolate, POL_3, had only 32 resistant accessions, while the most avirulent <italic>Bgt</italic> isolate, ARG_4_2, had over 25% (n = 146) of the accessions showing resistance. Additionally, 206 accessions were susceptible to all <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates, while only 28 were resistant to all. The latter are of great interest to discover potential broad-spectrum resistance genes.</p><p id="P17">To further explore the commonality between the isolates, we looked at the correlation of their virulence/avirulence patterns across the Swiss collection. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The highest correlations were observed between JPN_CHIKA and ARG_4_2 (R=0.76) and between CHE_96224 and IRN_GOR5 (R<sup>2</sup>=0.81), with POL_3 being the most distinct <italic>Bgt</italic> isolate with an average correlation value of 0.42 to all other isolates. There was no particular correlation between the geographical origin of the isolate and the virulence/avirulence pattern. For example, the virulence/avirulence patterns of the two isolates from Switzerland, as well as the two from Poland, are poorly correlated with each other compared to the other isolates. When comparing the genetic distance of powdery mildew isolates, there was no clear correlation between the phenotypic and genotypic variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, D</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We developed a Shiny app (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://benjiapp.shinyapps.io/Map_agent_pheno/">https://benjiapp.shinyapps.io/Map_agent_pheno/</ext-link>) to explore the resistance distribution for each <italic>Bgt</italic> isolate. As an example, the resistance distribution is shown for isolate CHE_96224, a very avirulent <italic>Bgt</italic> isolate widely used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). 138 accessions showed resistance (&lt;=20% leaf covered) to CHE_96224, whereas 94 accessions were fully susceptible (=100), with 229 accessions showing an intermediate phenotype.</p><p id="P19">When grouping based on the phenotypic responses to <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates, wheat accessions were grouped into three main clusters. The first and biggest cluster (315 accessions), consists of mostly susceptible accessions to all <italic>Bgt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). The second cluster (105 accessions), has mostly accessions resistant to all isolates or accessions susceptible to CHE_96224, IRN_GOR5, POL_3, TUR_1C <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates. When comparing with the <italic>Pm</italic>-tester lines, such a pattern of accessions being only susceptible to CHE_96224, IRN_GOR5, POL_3, and TUR_1C perfectly matches with the virulence/avirulence patterns of the lines containing <italic>Pm1e, a</italic>, and <italic>d</italic>, which suggests that these accessions might contain the <italic>Pm1</italic> locus. The third cluster was formed by 64 accessions that are all resistant to CHE_96224, IRN_GOR5, ARG_4_2, and JPN_CHIKA, while a subset of them are also resistant to THUN12 and TUR_1C. Comparison with the <italic>Pm</italic>-tester lines resistance spectra shows that such a pattern corresponds to <italic>Pm4b</italic> and <italic>Pm2</italic> or <italic>Pm32</italic>-containing lines and indicates that the <italic>Pm2, Pm4b</italic>, or <italic>Pm32</italic> genes are likely to be present in the Swiss collection.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The <italic>Pm2</italic> and <italic>Pm4b</italic> race-specific resistance genes are widely present in the Swiss collection</title><p id="P20"><italic>Pm4</italic> and <italic>Pm2</italic> are key genes used in breeding programs involved in powdery mildew resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] and have been detected in several wheat populations globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. To investigate whether local wheat hexaploid landraces and old cultivars from the Swiss collection contain these genes as suggested by the phenotyping analysis described above, we tested for the presence of <italic>Pm4b</italic> and <italic>Pm2</italic> using haplotype markers and further sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Out of 461 accessions, 50 and 31 contained <italic>Pm2</italic> and <italic>Pm4b</italic>, respectively, with eight accessions having both genes. Whereas most of the accessions containing <italic>Pm4b</italic> showed the expected resistance to CHE_96224, IRN_GOR5, JPN_CHIKA, THUN12, and TUR_1C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] few accessions did not match this pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). In the case of expanded resistance, such accessions might contain additional resistance genes, while the lack of resistance is most likely due to the presence of the non-functional <italic>Pm4f</italic> allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>].</p><p id="P21">On the other hand, most accessions containing the <italic>Pm2</italic> gene had a resistance spectrum matching the expected pattern of the <italic>Pm2</italic> near isogenic lines (NIL), being resistant against CHE_96224, IRN_GOR5, ARG_4_2, and JPN_CHIKA. Some exceptions were observed, which are possibly caused by the presence of other resistance genes. Given these two examples, it is very likely that additional sources of resistance are present in the Swiss wheat collection. To discover new genes involved in powdery mildew resistance we set out to run GWAS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>DArTseq genotyping reveals large genetic diversity of the Swiss collection</title><p id="P22">All accessions from the Swiss wheat collection were genotyped using DArTseq. This genotyping by sequencing (GBS) method aims to reduce the proportion of repetitive sequences, keeping genome coverage more homogenous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. To assess this, we analyzed the distribution of the sequencing reads across the Chinese Spring IWGSC_2.1 reference genome (CS, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]). Mapping raw reads of all accessions to the reference genome revealed that 40% of the annotated genes had at least one read within their coding region. When extending to +/- 10 kb around the coding sequence of a gene, 72% of the genes were tagged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). Additionally, the distribution of reads was similar between homologous chromosomes with 1,491,774, 1,605,237, and 1,350,862 reads mapping to the subgenomes A, B, and D, respectively. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). On average, 2.3% of the reads per accession did not map to the CS genome.

In addition to the SNP array, a matrix of 10,068 SNPs was generated by mapping the DArTseq reads to the CS genome. When comparing the number of SNPs per chromosome for each matrix, the D subgenome showed the expected lower number of SNPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). This reduced diversity is due to a strong bottleneck in the formation of hexaploid wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].

With both SNPs matrices, for the <italic>Bgt</italic> isolate POL_3, no significant regions were detected. However, combining the GWAS results from all the other isolates, we detected 241 and 53 significant SNPs from the DArTseq and the SNP-chip, respectively. They were embedded in seven genomic regions, with two regions standing out above the rest: one located at the beginning of chromosome 5D for resistance to CHE_96224 and IRN_GOR5, and one at the end of chromosome 7A for resistance to ARG_4_2, CHE_97251, GRB_JIW2, JPN_CHIKA, KAZ_1b, and THUN12.

The GWAS using <italic>k</italic>-mers as genotype yielded 16,895 significant <italic>k</italic>-mers with an average of 5,876 significant <italic>k</italic>-mers per isolate. Isolate KAZ_1b had the highest number of significant <italic>k</italic>-mers (12,806), and TUR_1C lowest number (1,819) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similar to the SNPs, no significant <italic>k</italic>-mers were detected for the POL_3 isolate (summary in <bold>Supplemental Table</bold>). Using the SNPs matrices, the classical outputs are lists of significant SNPs, for <italic>k</italic>-mers, the output is a list of significant <italic>k</italic>-mers, of 31 bp in length. To position these <italic>k</italic>-mers within a genome, several steps are needed: after retrieving the reads containing the <italic>k</italic>-mers, these reads are aligned to the genome and then the k-mers p-value can be linked to a genome position (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> for the pipeline).</p><p id="P26"><italic>k</italic>-mer GWAS identified the same resistance-associated regions as the two SNPs matrices, plus additional novel associations.

Based on the resistance pattern analysis of the phenotypic data and the haplotype analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>), this gene is present in the Swiss wheat collection. To better understand why such a region is only detected using <italic>k</italic>-mers, we zoomed into the <italic>Pm4</italic> region and plotted the results of the three approaches together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). This revealed that the higher resolution of the <italic>k</italic>-mer GWAS was due to the higher number of markers in the region: there are 165, 141, and 1627 markers for the DArTseq, the SNP-chip, and the <italic>k</italic>-mer-GWAS, respectively.</p><p id="P27">Only with the <italic>k</italic>-mers GWAS approach, we detected additional associated regions in chromosomes 2A and 5D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The Manhattan plot containing all the significantly associated regions for all the isolates is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>.

In contrast, while only 2.3% of the overall reads did not map to the CS genome, a much larger proportion, i.e.32% of the significant <italic>k</italic>-mers, did not map to the CS genome. This suggests a significant enrichment of non-mapping k-mers among those identified as significant, compared to the general read mapping. Such a difference is most likely caused by introgressions and/or presence/absence polymorphisms that are frequently the origin of resistance to powdery mildew [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. If such an introgressed region is not present in CS, reads containing significantly associated <italic>k</italic>-mers would not map. To investigate the possible origin of the non-mapped <italic>k</italic>-mers, we used 10 additional <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] as reference genomes. Using this set of genomes, we found that 53% (8,969) of the significant <italic>k</italic>-mers were mapped in all genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). We considered a <italic>k</italic>-mer mapped when at least one of the reads containing such <italic>k</italic>-mers mapped to one or more genomes. A further 30% (5,003) were mapped in some but not all of the genomes, and the remaining 17% (2,923) did not map to any of the 10 <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, by adding the 10 genomes as references, we could map 83% of the <italic>k</italic>-mers, compared to 68% when using only CS as a reference. Some of the <italic>k</italic>-mers that do not map to CS map to new regions of interest in other reference genomes. Besides, some <italic>k</italic>-mers also map to regions that have already been detected using CS, but reduce the width and increase the precision of the peak. Taking <italic>Pm4</italic> as an example, we found that when using SYMattis as a reference genome, the associated region perfectly overlaps with the position of the annotated <italic>Pm4</italic> gene, which is not the case for CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). The <italic>Pm4</italic> gene is known to originate from an introgression from tetraploid wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], and blast analysis shows that the gene is present in SYMattis and absent in CS. This explains the higher precision when using SYMattis as a reference genome. Using the <italic>k</italic>-mer approach, we pinpointed narrower peaks, allowing us to define more precisely genomic regions harboring genetic loci of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Progenitor genomes allow mapping an additional 8% of the significant <italic>k</italic>-mers</title><p id="P29">Many introgressions derived from wild relatives in bread wheat have been described to contain resistance genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>].

Due to the complexity of displaying association data from multiple isolates across different genomes, we developed a Shiny app, accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://benjiapp.shinyapps.io/Manhattan_plot/">https://benjiapp.shinyapps.io/Manhattan_plot/</ext-link>. To generate a Manhattan plot, users must follow the following steps: (i) select a reference genome, (ii) choose an isolate, and (iii) specify the chromosome (s) to display. While only one genome can be visualized at a time, multiple isolates can be compared simultaneously by stacking multiple plots. For a more detailed view of an associated region, users can zoom in by specifying the coordinates of a region of interest.

Furthermore, <italic>k</italic>-mers from this group also tag other loci of interest, such as on chromosomes 2B and 6B. Extending this to all the reference genomes we found, for instance, that an associated region at the beginning of chromosome 3D was only detected when using Renan, Lancer, and CS as reference genomes. Out of the 34 main regions detected across the 10 reference genomes and the 10 isolates, only 15 are shared in all reference genomes.

Comparing these data with the pattern of <italic>Pm</italic>-tester lines, we found that a combination of multiple <italic>Pm</italic> genes could explain this distribution.

The associated regions on chromosomes 3A and 3D were only detected when using the reference genomes of Fielder, Julius, and Lancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 10</xref>). The region on chromosome 2B overlaps with the homologous region associated with <italic>Pm4</italic>, making it challenging to clearly separate the two. The associated regions on chromosome 3A and chromosome 3D directly overlap a Werner-like exonuclease gene (TraesJUL3A03G01434660), present in one and two copies on chromosome 3A and chromosome 3D, respectively. Each of these three copies is perfectly conserved across all the reference genomes used in this study, except for Landmark and Renan, which lack these copies. Due to this conservation across most genomes and the lack of correlation with the resistance patterns of these genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 11</xref>), the associated regions on chromosome 3A and chromosome 3D are unlikely candidates for powdery mildew resistance.</p><p id="P37">Focusing on the association on chromosome 2B, we applied the same approach to examine structural variation across the genomes. To include the entire start of the chromosome we did an alignment of the first 40 Mb of chromosome 2B across all genomes which revealed structural diversity around the Werner-like gene region. In the genomes of CS, Landmark, Norin, and Stanley, this region is conserved, and all these genotypes are susceptible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Importantly, this region is absent in the reference genomes of all resistant cultivars, namely Renan, Mace, and SYMattis. These data suggest that the Werner-like exonuclease gene on chromosome 2B might be a susceptibility gene that has not been previously identified, potentially revealing a new mechanism of powdery mildew resistance. Such a gene has also been found in a (DNA affinity purification sequencing) DAPseq experiment in a search of TaZF binding site. TaZF have been found to be involved in powdery mildew resistance by recruiting both Pm2a and AvrPm2 from the cytosol to the nucleus.

Its presence in these three genomes is not consistent with phenotypic observations: while Renan and Lancer are resistant to many of the tested powdery mildew isolates, CS is not resistant to any. To further explore this region, the 2 Mb around the most associated <italic>k</italic>-mer was extracted and aligned with all the genomes. This region is conserved between CS, Lancer, and Renan but not for the other genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Given that CS is not resistant, it is expected that haplotype diversity occurs in the region between Lancer/Renan and CS. Indeed, we observed such diversity within the first 500kb of the region, which shows considerable variation between CS and Lancer, but is almost fully conserved between Lancer, Renan and Norin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). While Lancer is resistant to 7 of 9 isolates, Renan is only resistant to CHE_96224, IRN_GOR5, THUN12, JPN_CHIKA, TUR_1C, and Norin is susceptible to all isolates. After extracting all the genes annotated in the region from the Lancer genome, we blasted them to all other genomes to find how conserved each of the genes were. The heatmap in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 12</xref> summarizes this.</p><p id="P39">Each of the protein sequences have been also blasted to the NCBI database to extract possible functions. Thirteen genes are found to be NBS-LRR genes, although all of them are fully conserved between Lancer and Norin, including +/- 2kb of the coding region.

We found 12 genes present only in Lancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 12</xref>), out of those five are uncharacterized protein, two are Wax Ester synthase like protein, one is a fatty acyl-CoA reductase, one is a glucomannan 4-beta-mannosyltransferase and one is a receptor like prot12. Waxes are part of the cuticle and protect different organs from biotic and well as abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>].

Our results underscore the suitability of our collection as a source of resistance to wheat powdery mildew.</p><p id="P46">By comparing response patterns derived from the interaction between wheat landraces and the set of 10 <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates with known virulence/avirulence spectra based on 37 <italic>Pm</italic> tester lines, the presence of <italic>Pm1, Pm2, Pm4</italic>, and <italic>Pm60</italic> resistance genes could be postulated. Further, the presence of <italic>Pm2</italic> and <italic>Pm4</italic> could subsequently be confirmed using diagnostic molecular markers. Of note, the 28 landraces fully resistant to the 10 tested <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates have the same pattern as the <italic>Pm13</italic> and <italic>Pm36</italic> tester lines. Both <italic>Pm2</italic> and <italic>Pm4</italic> genes have been recently cloned and encode kinase-fused resistance proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>], a new resistance gene family private to <italic>Triticeae</italic> that provides resistance to different fungal diseases in major cereal crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Further work is needed to confirm if <italic>Pm13</italic> and <italic>Pm36</italic> resistance genes are responsible for the “all isolate” resistance observed in the 28 landraces, or if novel, unknown <italic>Pm</italic> genes are causing this broad-spectrum resistance. If the presence of these resistance genes is confirmed in hexaploid wheat landraces, they could be used more broadly in breeding programs. <italic>Pm13</italic> was cloned from <italic>Ae. longissima</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>], while <italic>Pm36</italic> presence has only been documented in a few wild emmer wheat accessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>], making its practical use in breeding programs challenging. As landraces are sexually fully crossable with bread wheat, these resistance loci could be directly cross-bred into modern cultivars, sidestepping long and laborious backcrossing with wild relatives like <italic>Ae. longissima</italic>.</p><p id="P47">As the bimodal-like distribution of seedling response to wheat powdery mildew suggested the presence of major genes controlling resistance, we performed a GWAS with genotyping data generated with the SNP-chip produced by TraitGenetics. Association mapping analysis revealed 53 significant SNPs, pinpointing seven genomic regions associated with all-stage resistance, two of them corresponding to the <italic>Pm1</italic> (or <italic>Pm60</italic>) and <italic>Pm2</italic> resistance genes. This apparent limited capacity of detecting resistance loci may be explained by the intrinsic nature of the SNP-chip. First, the chip can only detect SNPs. However, SVs such as insertions, deletions, duplications, CNVs, and translocations have been reported to underlie disease resistance phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. Second, SNP-chip design relied on a single reference genome, Chinese Spring, and a few accessions, limiting the SNP set that can be detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>].</p><p id="P48">To overcome these limitations, we further genotyped the collection with DArTseq technology, a genotyping technology that is not biased by reference genomes, as it sequences restriction fragments produced by restriction enzyme-mediated genome complexity reduction, which theoretically increases its capacity to detect loci of interest compared to the SNP-chip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Using such data and CS as a reference genome, a SNPs matrix containing 10,068 SNPs was generated. Additionally, a matrix of 11,252 polymorphic SNPs was generated using 12k Illumina Infinium 15K wheat SNP array (TraitGenetics GmbH, Gatersleben, Germany). The use of these matrices resulted in significant SNPs associated with wheat mildew resistance overlapping with the presence of known <italic>Pm</italic> genes like <italic>Pm2</italic> and <italic>Pm4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, although the SNPs matrix derived from DArTseq contained less SNPs compared with the SNPs chip, it resulted in sharper peaks. Such associated regions contain SNPs with a high proportion of missing data and only when including SNPs with 80 percent missing data, all SNPs were included for GWAS. This is not surprising knowing that wheat genomes contain many introgressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] that would result in such a pattern.</p><p id="P49">In order to avoid the bias of the reference genome, we generated a matrix of <italic>k</italic>-mers from the raw data of DArTseq. This led to 176 million unique <italic>k</italic>-mers of length 31bp. Such <italic>k</italic>-mers can tag SNPs, as well as other structural variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], and it is known that, especially in plant genomes, an important part of genetic diversity is due to structural variations in different forms, such as presence/absence variants (PAVs), CNVs, insertions or deletions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. The disadvantage of using <italic>k</italic>-mer is that the location in the genome is not known. When using Illumina sequencing data, reads containing <italic>k</italic>-mers can be assembled into larger segments and subsequently Blast or sequence alignment can be used to find the corresponding gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. However, the nature of DArTseq data does not allow such an approach. To circumvent this limitation and being capable of comparing with the SNPs GWAS, we mapped the DArTseq raw reads to CS. We could detect all the associated regions already detected using SNPs matrices as well as new ones on chromosomes 2A and 5D. However, only 68% of the <italic>k</italic>-mers could be mapped using the reference genome Chinese Spring. The discrepancy with the number of reads mapping (97.3%) again points towards the fact that introgressions are well-known to harbor genuinely new alleles of agronomic interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. To overcome this, we used multiple reference genomes; ten bread wheat genomes, and four genomes from the progenitors of wheat to capture as much variation as possible. Still, the main disadvantage of <italic>k</italic>-mer-based GWAS approaches is the lack of standardized methods for conducting such analyses. This is in sharp contrast to user-friendly programs like TASSEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>] or GAPIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>] that have been developed for SNPs-based GWAS pipelines. To apply the <italic>k</italic>-mer-based association mapping analysis to multiple genomes we developed a pipeline. With this, we increased from 11,570 significant <italic>k</italic>-mers when using CS as a reference genome to 15,712 significant <italic>k</italic>-mers. This translated into the identification of 27 additional new regions associated with resistance to powdery mildew. The inclusion of more reference genomes allowed us to map 25% more <italic>k</italic>-mers reaching 93% of all the significant <italic>k</italic>-mers detected using GWAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Among the 27 regions, we focused on two of the most promising candidates: a gene annotated as a Werner-like exonuclease and a Wax Ester synthase gene in chromosomes 2B and 3D, respectively. Notably, none of the regions were revealed when using the SNP matrices, which highlights the higher discrimination power of the <italic>k</italic>-mer-based approach. This also suggests that these gene’s presence or absence may be attributed to introgressions.</p><p id="P50">In humans, Werner-like exonucleases have been shown to degrade DNA in a structure-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Werner-like exonucleases have been shown to interact with the Ku heterodimer which is required for the non-homologous end joining pathway of DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. However, no studies to date report their involvement in plant immunity. The correlation with the phenotype shows that the presence of the gene is associated with susceptibility to four <italic>B. graminis</italic> isolates, CHE_96224, IRN_GOR5, JPN_CHIKA, and TUR_1C as well as THUN12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). The genomes of CS, Landmark, Norin, and Stanley contain the two copies of the Werner-like exonuclease gene on chromosome 2B, while the other genomes do not have any. Susceptibility factors are rare, but some prominent examples have been described in cereal immunity. For instance, the well-known natural mutation of the <italic>Mlo</italic> gene in barley provides broad-spectrum resistance against barley powdery mildew [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>], while the <italic>pi21</italic> recessive mutation is linked to long-lasting resistance to rice blast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]. More recently, genome-edition of the wheat <italic>Mlo</italic> orthologue has proven to confer resistance to wheat powdery mildew without growth penalties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>], while the inactivation of a target for rust effectors, the wheat kinase <italic>TaPsIPK1</italic>, confers broad-spectrum resistance to rust fungi. <italic>CRISPR</italic>/Cas9 mutations of the two copies of the gene on chromosome 2B would clarify if the Werner-like gene is a susceptibility factor, which if proven, would be the second report of a disease susceptibility gene to wheat powdery mildew, opening up new avenues to control the disease.</p><p id="P51">The region around 5Mb of chromosome 3D is present in four out of all the genomes tested, namely CS, Renan, Norin and Lancer. Such patterns correspond to a possible introgression that is strongly associated with resistance to powdery mildew. As the resistance pattern observed on Renan genome can be fully explained by the presence of a functional allele of <italic>Pm4</italic>, and CS as well as Norin are fully susceptible, we focussed on genes solely present in Lancer. We found that 3 of the 12 genes present in Lancer in these regions are involved in Waxes synthesis. Evenso they are not known to be directly involved in resistance to powdery mildew, waxes of the cuticle are forming a physical and chemical barrier to biotic and abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Further functional and molecular analyses are required to confirm the possible role of such genes in plant defense.</p><p id="P52">Adult plant resistance to diseases is genetically complex, usually controlled by several genes associated with genomic regions called quantitative trait loci (QTL), resulting from the effect of each QTL acting —with small or larger effects— leading to a partial phenotypic resistance. Detection of minor-effect QTLs is highly challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. To further test the detection power of our <italic>k</italic>-mer-based GWAS approach over the SNP-based approach, we performed association analysis using adult plant resistance to wheat powdery mildew collected under field conditions over two seasons. We found that when using SNP matrices, no significantly associated regions to mildew resistance were detected, while the use of our <italic>k</italic>-mer GWAS allowed the detection of multiple regions of interest. With our approach, we show that the capacity to detect those small QTLs is achieved compared to the commonly used SNP-based approaches. Implementing our pipeline to future field studies would result in more accurate and larger detection of QTLs, allowing breeders to accumulate major- and minor-effect loci that can be used for the improvement of wheat powdery mildew (and virtually any other disease) resistance.</p><p id="P53">The <italic>k</italic>-mer-based pipeline presented here offers several advantages over conventional SNP-based association mapping analysis. First, <italic>k</italic>-mers allow for the assessment of almost all types of variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. While SNP matrices can only detect SNPs, <italic>k</italic>-mers can interrogate diversity given by SVs, such as large indels or introgressions. This led to the discovery of loci associated with resistance that would have been missed using SNP matrices. Second, by utilizing <italic>k</italic>-mers directly from raw sequencing data, we could bypass error-prone stages of variant discovery and genotyping, thereby facilitating the identification of causal variants. Third, the inclusion of multiple reference genomes notably expanded the number of potential loci associated with resistance by interrogating broader diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. All these improvements translate into greater efficiency on the same phenotypic and genotypic basis, both expensive and labor-intensive to get.</p><p id="P54">With the increase in the number of genomes being sequenced, we foresee that our approach can become very popular as pangenome GWAS using SNPs has not yet been implemented. Our k-mer GWAS approach proves to be the best choice as such markers can more accurately represent genome diversity, and detailed comparison between available reference genomes would lead to the identification of useful alleles and allele stacking strategies to sustain resistance breeding activities.</p></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S18"><title>DNA extraction and genotyping</title><p id="P55">The 461 accessions from the Swiss collection have been genotyped using Diversity Arrays Technology Pty Ltd (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.diversityarrays.com/">http://www.diversityarrays.com/</ext-link>) for sequencing and marker identification as a batch of the AGENT project.

Going through the genomes with a window of 1 Mb, all the windows containing at least 10 significant <italic>k</italic>-mers were extracted. Then from each region, all the protein sequences of the annotated genes within the region were saved. Each of the protein sequences were blasted to the plant NCBI database (taxid:3193). The blast has been automated using a Python script available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/benjj212/Kmer_GWAS_AGENT">https://github.com/benjj212/Kmer_GWAS_AGENT</ext-link>. For each blast, the first two results were extracted and listed. The regions known to contain already characterized Pm genes were then tagged.
