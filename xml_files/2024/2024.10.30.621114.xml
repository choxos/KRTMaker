Its development involves complex processes of sex specification, tissue patterning and morphogenesis, which, if disrupted, can cause lifelong health issues, including infertility. Here, we generated an extensive single-cell and spatial multi-omic atlas of the human reproductive tract during prenatal development, which allowed us to answer questions that smaller-scale, organ-focused experiments could not address before. We identified potential regulators of sexual dimorphism in reproductive organs, pinpointing novel genes involved in urethral canalisation of the penis, with relevance to hypospadias. By combining histological features with gene expression data, we defined the transcription factors and cell signalling events required for the regionalisation of the Müllerian and Wolffian ducts. This led to a refinement of how the <italic>HOX</italic> code is established in the distinct reproductive organs, including increased expression of thoracic <italic>HOX</italic> genes in the rostral mesenchyme of the fallopian tube and epididymis. Our study further revealed that the epithelial regionalisation of the fallopian tube and epididymis required for sperm maturation in adulthood is established early in development. In contrast, later events in gestation or postnatally are necessary for the regionalisation of the uterocervical canal epithelium. By mapping sex-specific reproductive tract regionalisation and differentiation at the cellular level, our study offers valuable insights into the causes and potential treatments of reproductive disorders.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The development of the human reproductive tract is a complex morphogenetic process orchestrated by paracrine interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and hormonal signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The internal genitalia (with the exception of the gonads) originate from the Müllerian and Wolffian ducts and the urogenital sinus. In females (XX), the Müllerian ducts develop into the fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and upper vagina, while the urogenital sinus forms the lower vagina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. In males (XY), the Wolffian ducts give rise to the epididymis, vas deferens and seminal vesicles, while the urogenital sinus becomes the prostate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The genital tubercle gives rise to the external genitalia: the clitoris in females and the penis in males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Initially, embryonic reproductive tissue precursors (i.e. Müllerian/Wolffian ducts, urogenital sinus and genital tubercle) comprise an undifferentiated epithelial inner layer and surrounding mesenchyme. As development progresses, the sexually dimorphic differentiation of the mesenchyme precedes and dictates the differentiation of the epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Müllerian and Wolffian duct differentiation is particularly complex, as precise spatial boundaries must be established between the resulting organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Both Müllerian and Wolffian ducts are present in genetically female and male embryos until approximately 9-10 post-conceptional weeks (PCW). If the embryonic gonads differentiate into testes under the control of the Y chromosome-linked <italic>SRY</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, Sertoli cells in the testes produce anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), which causes the Müllerian ducts to regress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Leydig cells in the testes secrete testosterone, which promotes the development of the Wolffian ducts into the upper reproductive tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, and which is further converted into dihydrotestosterone, masculinising the lower reproductive tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. In the absence of <italic>SRY</italic> and these hormones, as in XX embryos, the Wolffian ducts regress and the Müllerian ducts, urogenital sinus and genital tubercle develop into the female reproductive tract.</p><p id="P5">Genetic and environmental disruptions to reproductive tract development can lead to congenital anomalies, infertility and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. For example, approximately 7% of women have congenital uterine anomalies, rising to ~17% among those with recurrent miscarriages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating human reproductive tract development remain poorly studied and have primarily been inferred from rodent and chicken loss-of-function studies or human histological observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Recently, we and others have used single-cell transcriptomics to study the developing human reproductive tract, primarily focussing the gonads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and, to a limited extent, the upper portions of the Müllerian and Wolffian ducts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. However, we lack a holistic study of the entire tract development in both sexes.</p><p id="P6">Here, we generated a highly-resolved, spatiotemporal, multi-omic map of the entire developing human reproductive tract (excluding the gonads), profiling over half a million cells spanning the first and second trimesters. We detailed the cellular and molecular features of the female and male reproductive tracts throughout the critical stages of sexual differentiation, revealing how sex-specific signals drive the dimorphic development of reproductive organs and the regression of sexually unmatched ducts. Additionally, we resolved the cascade of gene expression changes from tissue-wide gradients into lineage-specific compartments within the Müllerian and Wolffian ducts, defining the key transcription factors and cell-cell communication events that drive their differentiation into final organ derivatives. Finally, we harness our atlas to pinpoint cell types and developmental windows likely affected by endocrine-disrupting chemicals and clinically approved drugs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Spatiotemporal atlas of human reproductive tract development</title><p id="P7">We profiled 80 reproductive tract samples from 6 to 21 PCW, covering stages of specification and differentiation of the internal and external genitalia as well as the regression of unmatched reproductive ducts.

Notably, the uterus and cervix show a very similar cell type composition, indicating that further regionalisation likely occurs after 21 PCW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>).

Wolffian-like mesenchymal and epithelial cells (epoophoron) are apparent near the fallopian tubes in females until 21 PCW, while fallopian-like epithelial cells are observed in some male samples between 10 and 14 PCW, indicating that Müllerian differentiation can occur in males before regression orchestrated by AMH concludes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c, f-g</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Figure 2a-b, e, Supplementary Figure 3a-b,e</bold>).</p><p id="P11">Consistent with studies in the mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, we do not identify sex-specific cell types in the developing penis and clitoris.

The Müllerian ducts initially consist of simple meso-epithelial tubes that are specified from the extra-gonadal coelomic epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> around 6 PCW. They migrate caudally in response to signalling from the Wolffian ducts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> (which emerge earlier, around 4 PCW, a developmental stage difficult to access and therefore not included in our study), and eventually fuse at the urogenital sinus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To shed light on the early events of human Müllerian duct formation, we subsetted the scRNA-seq data to the cell types that play key roles in its emergence, migration, and initial regression (between 6 and 8 PCW): the anterior mesonephric coelomic epithelium and the undifferentiated Müllerian epithelium and mesenchyme. Using <italic>Slingshot</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> we recovered two trajectories from the progenitor coelomic epithelium population to the Müllerian epithelium and mesenchyme, respectively.

Briefly, the first step of the pipeline involves integrating the tiles along the Z-axis using maximal projection for each channel and then stitching them together along the remaining X and Y spatial axes. Because the tissue moves slightly between sequencing rounds, image registration is required to correct for spatial misalignment of the fluorescent spots. This registration is achieved using non-linear optical flow to align the small, Gaussian-like spots in the images. Once the images have been stitched and corrected for misalignment, we use the DAPI signal to segment the nuclei with CellPose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R137">137</xref></sup>. For computational efficiency, images are first sliced into smaller 10,000 x 10,000 pixels patches. Even though there is no membrane protein staining, cell segmentation can be obtained by expanding the segmented nuclei by ~10/15 pixels to mimic the cytoplasm. Finally, spots appearing across registered coding channels are detected and their intensities are extracted. The intensity values for each spot over imaging cycles are then decoded based on the collection of barcodes in the codebook provided by CARTANA with the PoSTcode algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R138">138</xref></sup>. To minimise false positives, PoSTcode inflates the codebook with an additional background barcode.

Major anatomical landmarks were therefore annotated on the “virtual” RGB image based on the morphology and the H&amp;E image of the consecutive section. Histological landmarks were not annotated as they necessitate the texture information captured by H&amp;E staining only. By combining the information about the cell type label of each ISS cell and its annotated anatomical location within the tissue architecture, we then computed an enrichment score (z-score) of each cell type in each anatomical location (separately per view of the data).
