N-myc interacts with many factors and complexes to affect transcription. One such complex is the RNA Polymerase III assembly factor, TFIIIC, a six-member complex that is essential for the transcription of small, structured RNA. TFIIIC and N-myc mutually restrict each other’s chromatin association, and their complex contributes to quality control in mRNA transcription. We previously demonstrated that the largely intrinsically disordered transactivation domain of N-myc interacts directly with a sub-complex of TFIIIC, τA. Structural studies by others show that DNA binding of τA is largely mediated by TFIIIC3, which suggests that TFIIIC5 is at most a secondary binding site for DNA. Here we identified the DNA binding domain of TFIIIC5 as a key binding site for N-myc. We used an integrated approach combining NMR, HDX mass spectrometry, pull-downs and biophysical assays to elucidate the molecular basis of the interaction. Two sequences in the transactivation domain of N-myc bind to the DNA binding interface of TFIIIC5. AlphaFold modelling predicts a high-confidence binding mode for the higher affinity N-myc motif that overlaps with the predicted intramolecular binding site of the C-terminal acidic plug of TFIIIC5, removal of which enhances the binding of N-myc. The same two motifs in N-myc also interact with Aurora-A kinase, which competes with N-myc for TFIIIC binding during S-phase. This model elucidates how the N-myc:TFIIIC5 interaction competes with other interactions, providing a basis for their mutual censoring function and regulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F8" position="anchor"><label>Graphical Abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS199575-f008"/></fig>

They are largely intrinsically disordered, however their C-terminus is known to form a basic Helix-Loop-Helix leucine zipper domain with its constitutive binding partner, MAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). This complex binds preferentially to six base-pair DNA sequences known as E-boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Myc family members have physiological roles in development and tissue homeostasis, and they are very important drivers of oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Of the 11,000 samples, covering 33 cancer types, tested in the Pan Cancer Genome Atlas 28% were found to be copy number amplified for a myc family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Myc is thought to be a non-linear amplifier of transcription, acting to amplify existing transcriptional programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Myc has been demonstrated to be an activator of all three metazoan DNA dependent RNA polymerases, Pol I (rRNA), Pol II (mRNA), and Pol III (tRNA and other small structured RNA species) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The mechanisms by which myc activates transcription are still incompletely defined. However, it is clear that myc has a large number of binding partners in cells including many proteins involved in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Both c-myc and N-myc have been shown to increase the phosphorylation of serine 2 in the C-terminal heptad repeat of pol II, this facilitates the release of the polymerase from a pause in a promoter proximal region into the gene body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). More recently c-myc has been shown to increase the duration of transcriptional bursts and increase the dwell time of known transcriptional activator proteins at promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Additionally, at high concentrations, N-myc forms phase separated foci with other molecules suggestive of active transcription such as the mediator complex and nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). While regulation of transcription by myc proteins is complex and multi-faceted, it is likely to be driven by protein–protein interactions between myc proteins and regulators of transcription such as general transcription factors.</p><p id="P6">N-myc is an important driver in the childhood neuronal cancer, neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). It was discovered in a neuroblastoma cell line, and its genomic amplification is a prognostic indicator of disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). N-myc can functionally replace c-myc in murine development, suggesting that these proteins are, to a large extent, redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). These conserved functions are likely to be mediated primarily through conserved sequences known as myc boxes. The first three myc boxes (MB0, MBI, and MBII) are contained within the transactivation domain of the protein which comprises the N-terminal ~150 residues of myc family members. This region is essential for both transcriptional transactivation and oncogenic functions of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The TFIIIC complex is a general transcription factor which has been repeatedly demonstrated to interact with both N-myc and c-myc in cells using both affinity capture mass spectrometry and biotin labelling mass spectrometry approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). TFIIIC is a six membered complex which has a well-defined role in the recruitment of Pol III to the promoters of small, structured RNA encoding genes such as tDNA genes. TFIIIC binds to conserved sequences, known as A and B boxes, and recruits another transcription factor complex, TFIIIB. TFIIIB in turn recruits Pol III. TFIIIC is composed of two subdomains, τA and τB, which bind to A-Box and B-box DNA sequences, respectively. The two domains are linked flexibly to account for the variable distance between A and B-box sequences in promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Until recently human τA was thought to consist of 3 subunits: TFIIIC3, TFIIIC5, and TFIIIC6. τB was thought to be composed of TFIIIC1, TFIIIC2 and TFIIIC4, with TFIIIC1 acting as the flexible linker between the sub-complexes. However, recent cryo-EM structures of human TFIIIC bound to promoter DNA, and yeast TFIIIA-TFIIIC-TFIIIB complex bound to promoter DNA, both showed that TFIIIC1 contributes domains to both subcomplexes and as such should be considered a constitutive member of both τA and τB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Other constitutive members of the τA complex include TFIIIC3, a ~100 kDa protein with two large and nearly contiguous tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. These TPR domains act as a hub for protein–protein interactions, for example in recruitment of the TFIIIB complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). In addition, it has been shown to extensively bind promoter DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p><p id="P9">TFIIIC5 contains two domains. There is an N-terminal dimerization domain which forms a heterodimerization β-barrel domain with TFIIIC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). TFIIIC6 consists only of this domain and lacks the histidine phosphatase domain that its yeast homologue has. The C-terminal domain of TFIIIC5 is a DNA binding domain which connects via an acidic low complexity sequence to a C-terminal helix, termed the acidic plug, which packs back into the DNA binding surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>).</p><p id="P10">N-myc acts in concert with TFIIIC primarily on Pol II (mRNA) transcription rather than Pol III transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). The complex plays a role in transcript quality control facilitating the recruitment of BRCA1 and the nuclear exosome complex to stalled transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). How N-myc interacts with the TFIIIC complex is a work in progress. We have previously shown that the transactivation domain of N-myc (1-137) interacts directly with the τA sub-complex of TFIIIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). We have additionally shown that TFIIIC competes with Aurora-A kinase for N-myc binding, <italic>in vitro</italic> using pull-downs with recombinant bait proteins and HeLa lysate, and using proximity ligation assays in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Here we demonstrate that the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of TFIIIC5 is a major interaction site for N-myc, determine the crystal structure of the human DBD, and elucidate the molecular basis of the interaction using an integrated biochemical, biophysical and computational approach.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Plasmids</title><p id="P11">Protein sequences including vectors and tags used in the study are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>. pCDFDuet-1, pETM6T1, and pET30TEV were the vectors used for <italic>E. coli</italic> expression. pCDFDuet-1 are both commercially available vectors from Cytiva and Merck, respectively. pETM6T1 is a modified version of pET44b producing a TEV NIa cleavable 6xHis-NusA fusion protein. This has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). pET30TEV is a modified pET30a plasmid with a TEV Nia site added after the NspV replacing a large part of the S-tag and all of the enterokinase cleavage site. pCDFDuet-1 monomeric ultra-stable GFP (muGFP) fusion clones were made in a two-step process. Firstly, an <italic>E. coli</italic> codon optimized DNA sequence was synthesized by GeneArt, this coded for an N-terminal 6xHis tag followed by a short linker and an muGFP sequence. This was followed by another short linker and then a TEV Nia site. The TEV site was followed immediately by an in-frame BamHI restriction site which was followed by a 51 base pair sequence and an EcoRI site. The N-terminal start codon was within an NcoI restriction site. NcoI and EcoRI sites were used to ligate the sequence into pCDFDuet-1 (Novagen). <italic>E. coli</italic> codon optimized sequences were ordered from Twist Biosciences and GeneArt for TFIIIC3 TPR1 (residues 143-578; Uniprot-Q9Y5Q9), TFIIIC3 TPR2 (residues 578-886; Uniprot-Q9Y5Q9), TFIIIC5 DNA binding domain (residues 212-519; Uniprot-Q9Y5Q8). These were designed to have a 5′ BamHI site and a 3′ EcoRI site for cloning into the pCDFDuet-1-muGFP vector described above. In the case of the TFIIIC5|6 dimerization domain a DNA cassette was ordered from Twist biosciences which enabled co-expression of these two proteins in the pCDFDuet-1-muGFP vector. The sequence contained a 5′ BamHI site followed by an <italic>E. coli</italic> optimized TFIIIC5 dimerization domain sequence (residues 1-130; Uniprot-Q9Y5Q8) this was followed by an EcoRI site, and then the sequence of pCDFDuet-1 until the NdeI site in the second Multiple cloning site. The ATG sequence of the NdeI site was the start codon in an <italic>E. coli</italic> codon optimized TFIIIC6 sequence (residues 1-213; Uniprot-Q969F1). This coding sequence was followed by a 3′ XhoI site. The BamHI and XhoI sites were used to clone this entire cassette into the pCDFDuet-1-muGFP vector. A TFIIIC5 DNA binding domain (DBD) construct was created to optimize expression of the domain. This construct, referred to as TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ, begins at 208 and truncates a large loop within the domain, removing residues 345-366 inclusive. The C-terminus of the protein was also truncated back from 519 to 470. This removed a large intrinsically disordered region, including a low complexity acidic region, as well as a C-terminal helical region known as the acidic plug. The construct was synthesized by GeneArt, and codon optimized for <italic>E. coli</italic>. Flanking 5′ BamHI site and 3’ EcoRI and XhoI sites were used for cloning. BamHI and EcoRI were used for cloning into pCDFDuet-1-muGFP. BamHI and XhoI sites were used for cloning into pET30TEV. A TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ was also produced which built back the acidic plug region of the protein, referred to as ΔΔ+AP. This construct contains the same protein sequence up to residue 470. Instead of truncating at this point it continues to the authentic C-terminus at 519, with a deletion of the low complexity acidic sequence from 487-500 inclusive. This construct synthesized by GeneArt to have the DNA sequence as ΔΔ for the regions with identical protein sequence. It also contained the same flanking sequences for cloning into pET30TEV. The genes were cloned into pET30TEV as outlined previously. N-myc (UniProt P04198) fragments were expressed from the following plasmids: pET30TEV N-myc 1-137, pETM6T1 N-myc 1-137, pETM6T1 GB1-N-myc 18-72 C27S, and pETM6T1 N-myc 64-137. The GB1 fusion tag construct has been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Protein expression</title><p id="P12">Proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, typically BL21(DE3)-RIL cells. 35 μg/mL chloramphenicol was used to select for the RIL plasmid. 50 μg/mL of kanamycin and spectinomycin was used to select for pET and pCDF vectors respectively. 10 mL of an overnight culture was added to each litre of LB media. The cells were grown at ~200 RPM and 37 °C until mid-log phase (OD<sub>600</sub> ~0.6) followed by chilling at room temperature for approximately 30 min. Expression was then induced by addition of 0.6 mM final IPTG. The cells were grown overnight (16-19 h) at ~200 RPM and 20 °C prior to harvesting at 6,000 xg for 15 min. Pellets were stored at -80 °C prior to processing. Expression of NMR labelled protein was performed exactly as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Protein purification</title><p id="P13">All steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. A detailed list of buffers at each stage of purification, and for each protein purified, are outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> pellets were resuspended in initial purification buffer (IPB) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>) that had been spiked with ~10 mg of lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich), 750 U Benzonase nuclease (Merek), and 1 tablet of Roche cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, for each 30 mL of lysis buffer. Typically, 15 mL of lysis buffer was used per litre of LB media used in expression. Initially pellets were disrupted by pipetting and then by sonication at 60% amplitude for 3-4 min total sonication time, typically using a pulse regimen of 10 s on 20 s off. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 xg for 20 min. Clarified lysate was applied to buffer equilibrated His-select Cobalt affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich). Eluted protein was collected and dialysed overnight against 4 L of dialysis buffer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>) using either 3.5 kDa or 10 kDa molecular weight cut off SnakeSkin dialysis tubing (Peirce) as appropriate. For all but the 6xHis-muGFP tagged proteins, TEV Nia was used to remove the His-tag during dialysis. 0.45 or 0.9 mg of His-tagged TEV Nia was added to the protein, depending on the yield, and incubated overnight during dialysis. Post-dialysis TEV Nia-processed proteins were further purified by cobalt resin subtraction. Typically, this involves applying the, now untagged, protein to the same volume of washed resin as used to purify the protein. The flow is collected, and resin washed with IPB containing low concentrations of imidazole. For N-myc the untagged protein was typically in the 0 mM, 5 mM and 10 mM fractions. For TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ proteins there was some affinity for cobalt resin even without the His-tag so up to 30 mM imidazole was used to release the untagged protein. Only two proteins in the study were purified by ion-exchange chromatography prior to size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The first was 6xHis-muGFP tagged TFIIIC5 DBD, as the initial affinity purified protein contained a contaminant of similar molecular weight. The post-dialysis protein was loaded into a 5 mL Q fast-flown column. The flow was collected and a linear gradient of low NaCl (25 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol) to high NaCl buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol) applied over 60 mL. The contaminant and 6xHis-muGFP tagged TFIIIC5 DBD eluted at different conductivity values, which were approximately 18-26 and 27-35 mS/cm respectively. The second protein for which ion-exchange was performed was pETM6T1 expressed N-myc 1-137. This was performed very similarly to that previously outlined with the exception that the buffers were as follows. Low salt: 25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol; High salt: 25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 537 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol. In this case N-myc eluted over a wide range of fractions. These were pooled prior to cobalt resin subtraction. SEC was performed as a final polishing step on all purified proteins. This was performed using a HiLoad Superdex 75 16/60 column connected to an ÄKTA Prime FPLC. Pure fractions were pooled and concentrated in centrifugal concentrators of appropriate molecular weight cut off. Protein concentrations were determined using absorbance at 280 nm and protparam calculated extinction coefficients. Proteins were aliquoted into 30-50 μL volumes and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Proteins were stored at -80 °C. The only major exceptions to the protocol described above was for pET30TEV expressed N-myc 1-137 the protein is not soluble and needs to be recovered from the insoluble fraction using a series of urea re-solubilization steps on the first day of the purification. This purification has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>His-tagged based pull-down assays</title><p id="P14">37.5 μL of mix buffer equilibrated His-select cobalt affinity resin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for each pull-down. 6xHis-muGFP tagged TFIIIC domains (TFIIIC3 TPR1; TFIIIC5 DBD; TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ, TFIIIC5|6 dimer) were used as bait. Untagged N-myc 1-137 was used as prey. Bait and prey proteins were combined with mix buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.064 % Tween-20) to a final volume, excluding resin, of 425 μL. Final bait and prey concentrations were 10 μM and 15 μM, respectively. Bait protein, bait protein buffer, prey protein and mix buffer were mixed so that the final concentration of each component was identical across all pull-downs. The mixture was rotated slowly at 4 °C for 60 min. 10 μL of mix was taken for analysis. The slurry was centrifuged at 5,000 xg for 30 s at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the resin washed with 425 μL of mix buffer this was centrifuged at 5,000 xg for 30 s at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the resin washed twice more as previous. Protein was eluted by addition of 60 μL of mix buffer spiked with 250 mM imidazole. The resin was centrifuged at 16,100 xg for 60 s and the supernatant taken as the elution fraction. 7 μL (including 3.5 μL 2x SDS loading buffer) of both mix and elution fractions were run on SDS-PAGE gels for Coomassie stained gels. 2 μL were run for western blot analysis. For western blots transfer was performed to 0.2 μM nitrocellulose. Blocking was performed with PBST (PBS spiked with 0.1% Tween-20) spiked with 5% w/v dried low-fat milk. The blot was blocked by slow rotation at room temperature over a period of 30 min with three changes in blocking buffer. Anti-N-myc antibody (Santa Cruz - sc-53993) was diluted for 1/1000 in blocking buffer. This primary antibody was incubated with the blot for 60 min by slow rotation at room temperature. The blot was washed with PBST by slow rotation at room temperature with 3 changes of PBST over 30 min. The secondary antibody was a HRP conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Cytiva - NA931). This was diluted 1/2000 in blocking buffer and applied to the blot by slow rotation at room temperature for 60 min. The blot was then washed twice for 10 min with PBST. ECL substrate was applied for detection and blots were imaged using an iBright 1500 imager (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>NMR titrations</title><p id="P15"><sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC experiments were used to monitor N-myc chemical shifts upon titration into TFIIIC5 DBD. These were performed using an Oxford Instruments 750 MHz magnet equipped with a Bruker TCI cryoprobe and ADVANCE III HD console. The temperature was 288 K. Two different <sup>15</sup>N labelled N-myc proteins were used; an N-terminal fusion of GB1 with N-myc 18-72, and tagless N-myc 64-137. N-myc 18-72 has a conservative substitution; C27S. Unlabelled TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ was used as the titrant. Proteins were all in a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES pH 6.9, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol. 5% D<sub>2</sub>O was used as lock signal.

The N-myc peptides included the following 1-25, 26-50, 51-75, 62-89, 76-100, 101-125 and 117-141.

Seven aliquots containing 40 μL bed-volume of NeutrAvidin agarose resin (Thermo-Fisher Scientific), was equilibrated by a single wash with pull-down buffer, prior to the addition of 450 μL of each respective peptide at 20 μM concentration. One peptide was used for each resin aliquot. After incubation of this slurry for one hour, the resin was pelleted and the supernatant removed. The beads were then washed three times by the addition of 500 μL pull down buffer, centrifugation to pellet the resin, followed by removal of the supernatant. 460 μL of 12.5 μM TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ prey protein was then added to the resin and left to incubate by slow rotation for two hours. Following this incubation period 10 μL of mix was taken for analysis. The slurry mixture was washed three times, exactly as per pre-prey protein addition. The beads were then stripped by addition of 50 μL of 2x SDS loading buffer. SDS-PAGE was used to analyse both mix and bound fractions. Gels were stained with Coomassie stain.

Experiments were performed with both components alone, or with both proteins mixed. Buffers were exactly matched in the mixed experiment. To initiate the HDX reaction, 95 μL of deuterated buffer (8.09 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 1.47 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, pD 7.4) was transferred to 5 μL of protein-containing solution, and the mixture was subsequently incubated at 4 °C for 0.5, 5 or 30 min.

This current work aims to extend this by mapping the interaction further using a combination of molecular biology, biophysics and structural biology approaches.</p><p id="P23">To map the interaction to a domain of τA we decided to take a divide and conquer approach, purifying each of the domains that make up τA individually. To define the domain boundaries within the τA subcomplex we used the EBI AlphaFold protein structure database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/">https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/</ext-link>) and the yeast τA cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). τA is made up of between three or four domains, depending on the structural arrangement of the largest subunit, TFIIIC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). The yeast homologue of TFIIIC3 (τ131 - <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) has two tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains which pack against each other in the τA cryo-EM structure. The AlphaFold predictions for human TFIIIC3 suggest that TPR1 (143-571) and TPR2 (620-886) pack tightly together creating a single long TPR domain. TFIIIC5 comprises two domains. Its N-terminus (1-130) forms a β-barrel heterodimerization domain with TFIIIC6 (1-213). The C-terminus of TFIIIC5 (212-519) forms a DNA binding domain (DBD). These domains were produced through recombinant expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>, but we could not purify any protein for TFIIIC3 TPR2. The three successfully purified domains were used as bait in a pull-down with purified N-myc (1-137), and only the TFIIIC5 DBD was observed to interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Protein engineering for yield optimization</title><p id="P24">For more complex biophysical and structural biology experiments we wanted to produce TFIIIC5 DBD protein without the large tag and with higher yield than the 0.2 mg/L of LB that was the case for the muGFP fusion protein.

We instead engineered the domain to make it more like the equivalent domain in <italic>S. pombe</italic> which yielded a crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). This meant truncating a long internal loop that connects two β-sheets in the C-terminal half of the domain. This deletion (Δ345-366) was accompanied by the deletion of the C-terminal 49 resides (Δ471-519). These C-terminal residues contain a long low complexity acidic region followed by an acidic helix, known as the acidic plug, which packs back into the DNA binding interface of TFIIIC5 DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>).

Titration of TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ into both proteins was characterized by residue specific peak intensity changes rather than peak shifts, as would be expected for high affinity interactions with relatively high molecular weight binding partners. Many of these changes were observed early in the titration, with specific peak disappearances observable after addition of 0.1 to 0.3 molar equivalents of TFIIIC5 DBD, consistent with an interaction in intermediate exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>). To quantify these changes, we calculated peak intensity ratios for spectra with 0.1 M equivalents of TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ with respect to the reference spectra. The intensity ratios of GB1 peaks in the 0.1 M equivalent <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC were constant and typically 0.45–0.6 suggesting a uniform decrease in NMR signal intensity upon addition of TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).

These data are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>. And while they provide qualitative insights into the interaction, we wanted to extend these findings to get a more quantitative understanding of the interaction. In order to do this, we first performed fluorescence polarization (FP) assays using N-myc peptides suggested by pull-down assays and NMR titrations. N-myc peptides 16-38 (MB0) and 61-89 were both chemically synthesized with an N-terminal 5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) label. Both peptides bound to TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ and the data fitted well to a one-site total binding model using GraphPad Prism.

While this result is consistent with pull-downs shown previously in that both peptides bind TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ, it is very clear that MB0 binds much more tightly than 61-89.</p><p id="P32">With the exception of its constitutive partner MAX, myc tends to bind to other proteins with affinities in the low micromolar range (<italic>e.g</italic>., GTFIIF 4.9 μM; Bin1 4.2 μM; PNUTS 3.5 μM; TBP-TAF1 5.2 μM; Aurora-A 1 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Therefore, the affinity of MB0 for TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ was tighter than typical for myc interactions. We therefore chose to orthogonally validate this high affinity binding using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The titration of TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ into N-myc 1-137 was performed at 10 °C to prevent precipitation, resulting in an endothermic heat signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).

A F28A-Y29A N-myc 16-38 double mutant bound approximately three-fold less well than the WT peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). A W77A-W88A N-myc 61-89 double mutant had profoundly negative consequences for binding: we could not determine a K<sub>D</sub>, but the K<sub>D</sub> was at least a 25-fold lower in affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Truncations of the MB0 peptide at its N-terminus had modest effects on affinity.

In both ΔΔ+AP and WT predictions the C-terminal acidic plug (<sup>505</sup>DGSENEMETEILDYV<sup>519</sup>) packs back into the DNA binding interface in an almost identical conformation. This is a high confidence prediction because the pLDDT values are relatively high (WT full-length pLDDT MAX 82.7, pLDDT mean 63.8; ΔΔ+AP pLDDT MAX 84.0, pLDDT mean 65.8).

The effect of the addition of the acidic plug to the ΔΔ was to reduce affinity of TFIIIC5 DBD for both MB0 and 61-89 peptides. For MB0 the affinity was reduced approximately 8-fold from 60 nM to 490 nM, while for the 61-89 peptide the effect was closer to 20-fold from 1.1 μM to 18.2 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C-D</xref>). This suggests both binding sites at least partially overlap with the acidic plug interacting site of TFIIIC5.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Modelling the N-myc:TFIIIC5 interaction</title><p id="P35">We tried several approaches to determine a crystal structure of an N-myc peptide with TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ but only obtained crystals of the TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ alone. The structure was determined to 2.6 Å resolution, and is very similar (average backbone RMSD 1.1 Å) to the crystal structure of the equivalent domain in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). We modelled N-myc 19-38 and 75-89 peptides with TFIIIC5 DBD ΔΔ and TFIIIC5 DBD FL using AlphaFold2-Multimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A-B</xref>). Twenty models were calculated per complex. The complexes were judged on two criteria. Firstly, maximum and median interface predicted template modelling (ipTM) scores, and secondly how consistent the predictions are across the total of forty models predicted for each N-myc peptide sequence. For N-myc 19-38 calculations with the full-length DBD and the ΔΔ mutant the maximum ipTM score was 0.717 and 0.651 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). The binding mode was consistent across models binding to the DNA binding surface of TFIIIC5, in the case of the full-length DBD in all predictions the acidic plug was displaced by the N-myc peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C-D</xref>). For N-myc 75-89 the max ipTM scores were 0.737 and 0.516 for the full-length and ΔΔ domains respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). N-myc peptide was also predicted to bind to the DNA binding interface of TFIIIC5. However, the predicted binding modes were highly variable across models, there were two binding sites with several predicted binding modes at each. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E-F</xref>). As the maximum ipTM score for both 19-38 and 75-89 peptide complexes was greater than 0.7, they both should be taken seriously as plausible models for the interaction. However, given the consistency of the prediction for the 19-38 peptide we think this model is more likely to be correct. For the highest ipTM models of the N-myc 19-38 TFIIIC5 interaction the peptide extends over a large proportion of the DNA binding surface of TFIIIC5 traversing diagonally across and down the interface. The C-terminus of the motif (<sup>33</sup>DDFYF<sup>37</sup>) forms a single helical turn. The hydrophobic <sup>37</sup>YF<sup>38</sup> are packed into a hydrophobic pocket in the winged helix fold at the N-terminus of the domain. This pocket is lined by the side chains of F218, Y290, and W300. The acidic patch of N-myc (<sup>31</sup>DEDD<sup>34</sup>) makes several electrostatic contributions to the binding interface, the close interaction of E32 with R266 and K270 likely being the most important. Other notable residues in the interaction include F28 which packs against Y404 of the DBD and F21 which packs into a hydrophobic pocket at the C-terminal helix of the domain. This pocket is lined by the sidechains of R404, L170, I229 and I115.</p><p id="P36">Mapping the HDX data on to the models generated by AlphaFold suggests a good level of agreement with the N-myc 19-38 TFIIIC5 model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Four TFIIIC5 peptides which are protected by addition of N-myc (208-218, 226-238, 255-267, and 394-407) are predicted to directly contact N-myc 19-38. The latter two peptides are the ones with the highest levels of protection observed in the HDX experiment. A further two peptides (223-233 and 238-253) are close in space to the predicted N-myc 19-38 binding site. These peptides additionally interact directly with peptides predicted to bind to N-myc 19-38. The only outlier in the HDX data from the N-myc 19-38 TFIIIC5 model, is TFIIIC5 peptide 430-446, which is far from any predicted binding site. In contrast, the models of N-myc 75-89 interact with fewer HDX identified peptides. In the model with the highest ipTM score for ΔΔ N-myc 75-89 contacts three peptides at the winged helix part of the domain, but do not contact the C-terminal 226–238 peptide, which had very high levels of protection in the HDX experiments. By contrast N-myc 75-89 in the WT DBD model with the highest ipTM scores interacts with only the C-terminal peptides and not the winged helix peptides. We therefore conclude that the modelled binding site for N-myc 19-38 to the acidic-plug binding site of TFIIIC5 is more likely to be correct, consistent with it being the higher affinity site that competes with the acidic plug for the pocket on the TFIIIC5 DNA binding domain surface.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P37">The myc family of transcription factors are important oncoproteins that regulate genes involved in metabolism, cell proliferation and other critical processes in cancer cells. The function and regulation of myc proteins involves many protein-protein interactions, but the interplay of these factors and molecular mechanisms that underpin them are poorly understood. Here we characterize the interaction between N-myc and the DNA binding surface of TFIIIC5 DBD, an interaction that is thought to play an import role in N-myc driven regulation of Pol II transcription and mRNA quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).</p><p id="P38">The finding that N-myc binds to the DNA binding domain of TFIIIC5, and in particular to the DNA binding surface, was surprising to us. The TPR domains of TFIIIC3 are thought to be hubs for protein–protein interactions. In the yeast cryo-EM structure of TFIIIC (in the context of TFIIIA, TBP, and 5S promoter DNA) the yeast homologue of TFIIIC3, τ131, acts as a central scaffold mediating many of the critical interactions holding the complex together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). In addition, τ131 has been shown to interact with B double prime 1 (BDP1), a core component of the TFIIIB complex which recruits Pol III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). However, the TFIIIC5 DBD:N-myc interaction is robust because it was observed using a variety of orthogonal approaches including NMR, pull-down assays in both directions, biophysics experiments, and HDX experiments.</p><p id="P39">From the point of view of N-myc, our findings are consistent with previous data. Pull-down experiments from HeLa lysate suggest that Aurora-A competes with TFIIIC for N-myc 1-137 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The primary peptides involved in the Aurora-A interaction are N-myc 19-47 and 61-89, which is very similar to the peptides we have shown bind to TFIIIC5 DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). In addition, BioID proximity labelling experiments using BirA tagged c-myc have resulted in the biotinylation of TFIIIC1, TFIIIC3, TFIIIC4 and TFIIIC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Deletion of MB0 resulted in the loss of biotinylation of TFIIIC4 and TFIIIC5, consistent with its role in direct binding to TFIIIC5. Because we took a divide and conquer approach, we cannot rule out the possibility that the interaction is more extensive and may involve other regions of N-myc outside of the transactivation domain or TFIIIC domains which were not part of this study (such as the C-terminal TPR domain of TFIIIC3).</p><p id="P40">In addition to mapping the interaction on both N-myc and TFIIIC5 DBD, we present AlphaFold models of the interaction. Despite the relatively high ipTM scores (&gt;0.7 for the best models) we would urge caution in their interpretation. We believe that a high-resolution experimental structure of the complexes will be required to accurately describe the molecular basis of these interactions. We are acutely aware of this at this moment because X-ray crystal structures are beginning to be published which contradict previously published AlphaFold models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). However, we are confident of the location of the MB0 binding site on TFIIIC5 because all of the models were similar and displaced the acidic plug, consistent with our experimental data.</p><p id="P41">The role of the TFIIIC5 DBD domain remains poorly defined, even in the context of the well-studied Pol III promoters. It has long been postulated that TFIIIC5 is the primary DNA binding node of τA. In part this is because it has a large DNA binding surface, which in part is made up of a well characterized DNA binding fold, a canonical winged helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). In yeast it has been shown to crosslink with DNA in a region close to the A-box sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Although structural biology of the holocomplex of TFIIIC in the context of promotor DNA and other transcription factors has begun to emerge, the precise role of the TFIIIC5 DBD is still poorly defined. In the human TFIIIC-tDNA promoter structure the density for the domain is absent. This may not be surprising as DNA is not bound to the τA subcomplex in this structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). However, recent structures of yeast TFIIIC, bound to tDNA and 5S rDNA promoter sequences, density for the T95 (TFIIIC5 homologue) DBD is also absent even though in both structures DNA is bound to τA, predominantly via the C-terminal TPR domain of the TFIIIC3 homologue, τ131 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>).</p><p id="P42">In the case of the tDNA promoter there is evidence that the DBD may be dynamically binding DNA close to the A-box sequence, the role of this interaction in TFIIIC function remains to be fully determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). From the evidence thus far, the contacts driving the τA DNA interaction are almost exclusively outside of the DBD of TFIIIC5. However, it should be noted that the observed DNA binding modes of yeast τA was very different for tDNA and rDNA promoters. There may be significant plasticity in how DNA is engaged by τA when different binding partners are present. The other binding partners critical to the function of the N-myc:TFIIIC complex have yet to be fully determined and may play important roles in how τA engages DNA. In this context, ideas on how the N-myc:TFIIIC5 DBD interaction fit into the broader context of Pol II gene expression, or mRNA transcript quality control, must be viewed as speculative. If the DNA binding domain is mostly in the DNA bound state, it may be that N-myc acts as a recycling factor, or avidity trap, keeping TFIIIC close to E-box DNA when it is displaced from A- and B-box DNA through the action of polymerases or other kinetic activities involved in transcription. Alternatively if the DBD is mostly available, even in the DNA bound state of TFIIIC, it may be that N-myc is interacting with the already bound complex and influencing the recruitment of other proteins to the locus, such as the cohesin complex or the nuclear exosome complex, complexes which have been shown to be associated factors in the N-myc:TFIIIC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).</p><p id="P43">MB0 (LEFDSLQPCFYPDEDDFYFG) has the amino acid composition of an acidic “core activator domain”, as described by Sanborn and colleagues, in that it contains a high proportion of acidic residues interspersed with bulky hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). While this approximate configuration of acidic activator sequences has been known for a long time, only recently have systematic mutagenesis screens shown that both the acidic and hydrophobic components are important for transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). MB0 has now been shown to interact with two DNA binding domains, its own DNA binding domain that is formed with MAX and now TFIIIC5. Removal of the MB0 acidic DEDD stretch was highly deleterious for TFIIIC5 binding. It has been postulated that the acidic sequences in transactivation domains are primarily for solubilising the hydrophobic sequences which are the primary binding sequences facilitating transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). However, at least in these cases the acidic patches seem to be important binding determinants in and of themselves. Given that, c-myc has already been shown to bind to the DNA binding interface of TBP, it could be that binding of DNA binding interfaces is a general feature of myc interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). This may have functions such as facilitation of pre-initiation complex formation as has been proposed for TBP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). It also could help to capture DNA binding complexes which are dynamically removed from the DNA through the action of polymerases or complex disassembly. In effect, myc proteins could help prevent diffusion of these complexes away from E-box sequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS199575-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d89aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS199575-supplement-Supplementary_Table_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d89aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS199575-supplement-Supplementary_Table_3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d89aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Table 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS199575-supplement-Supplementary_Table_4.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d89aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="EMS199575-supplement-Supplementary_Data.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d89aAcEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr Arnout Kalverda and Dr Bob Schiffrin for assistance in NMR data collection and analysis.
