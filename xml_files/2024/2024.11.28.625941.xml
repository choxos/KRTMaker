In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations (11%) associate with a poor-prognosis subtype that is molecularly distinct from β-catenin-mutant HCC (28-40%). How <italic>AXIN1</italic> deficiency drives HCC formation has remained highly debated. Here, we address this issue by introducing HCC-associated <italic>AXIN1</italic> and <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutations in human liver cancer cells and liver-derived organoids. We show that different mutant <italic>AXIN1</italic> classes activate varying degrees of Wnt signaling, although at lower overall levels than <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutations. Strikingly, premature stop codons in 5’ coding regions do not classify as knock-out mutations but drive alternative translation of an N-terminally truncated AXIN1 variant with partially retained suppressor activity. All <italic>AXIN1</italic> variants endow liver progenitor organoids with the capacity to grow in the absence of R-spondin and Wnt, indicative of aberrant Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation. Additionally, induced Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation inversely correlates with YAP/TAZ-mediated signaling, thus leaving higher residual YAP/TAZ activity in <italic>AXIN1</italic>-mutant versus <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-mutant cells. We conclude that <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations drive physiologically relevant Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HCC, while providing a permissive environment for YAP/YAZ signaling, thereby distinguishing <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations from those in <italic>CTNNB1</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>AXIN1</kwd><kwd>CTNNB1</kwd><kwd>Wnt/β-catenin signaling</kwd><kwd>YAP/TAZ signaling</kwd><kwd>hepatocellular carcinoma</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent form of liver cancer and the third deadliest malignancy worldwide, accounting for over 800.000 deaths per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Although HCC is a heterogeneous disease, mutational alterations that affect core components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway are identified in a prominent fraction of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In the healthy liver, the evolutionary conserved Wnt/β-catenin pathway governs development, homeostasis, injury-induced regeneration, and zonation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, levels of Wnt/β-catenin signaling determine metabolic identity and correlate with proliferation rates of hepatocytes that constitute the majority of liver parenchyma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The primary outcome of Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation is stabilization of the transcriptional co-factor β-catenin, which promotes its nuclear entry and complex formation with TCF/LEF to mediate the transcription of Wnt target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In the absence of Wnts, cytosolic β-catenin levels are constitutively targeted for proteolysis by a multiprotein β-catenin destruction complex. AXIN1, the principal coordinator of this complex, brings together the scaffold APC and kinases GSK3 and CK1 to orchestrate efficient phosphorylation, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of β-catenin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Upon binding of Wnts to their receptors at the cell surface, the destruction complex is inactivated, resulting in β-catenin accumulation and the activation of gene programs linked to stem cell maintenance and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">For HCC, the most frequent alterations in Wnt pathway components comprise activating mutations in β-catenin (gene name: <italic>CTNNB1</italic>, mutated in 28-40% of cases) and inactivating mutations in <italic>AXIN1</italic> (mutated in 11% of cases)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Historically, <italic>AXIN1</italic> and <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutations in HCC were considered functionally equivalent, as cell lines harboring mutations in either gene displayed increased complex formation between β-catenin and TCF/LEF, indicative of Wnt pathway activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Recent studies however linked <italic>CTNNB1</italic> and <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations to molecularly distinct HCC subtypes, each with divergent pathological implications. <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutations generally result in a Wnt-high expression profile, and are predominantly found in the class of ‘non-proliferative’ tumors that associate with better prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. By contrast, <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations are linked to the ‘proliferative’ Wnt-low class of more aggressive HCC tumors, hallmarked by poor differentiation. To what extent <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations activate Wnt signaling in HCC, remains a highly debated issue. AXIN1-deficient mice were reported to develop liver tumors without indications of Wnt pathway activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Instead, these tumors displayed elevated levels of YAP/YAZ signaling, NOTCH pathway activation and fetal gene expression. In line with these findings, a recent study showed that YAP/TAZ-mediated signaling is indispensable for liver tumor formation in AXIN1-deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, overexpression of YAP promotes expansion of progenitor-like murine hepatocytes, further linking YAP/TAZ signaling to the ‘proliferative’, dedifferentiated HCC subtype associated with <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">In contrast to these reports, we and others established a connection between <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations and elevated Wnt signaling. For instance, HCC tumors harboring <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations displayed upregulation of a subset of Wnt target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Furthermore, several cancer-associated <italic>AXIN1</italic> missense mutations in the N-terminal RGS domain of AXIN1 were found to induce Wnt signaling and drive hyperplastic growth in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Recent studies further showed that various <italic>AXIN1</italic> missense and truncating mutations promote Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation and, moreover, signaling levels directly correlated with tumorigenic potential in the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">In summary, <italic>AXIN1</italic>-mutant liver tumors depend on both β-catenin and YAP/TAZ signaling, however the relative contributions of these pathways remain disputed. While <italic>AXIN1</italic>-mutant HCC cell lines are generally considered Wnt-low compared to <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-mutant cells, a comprehensive comparison between both mutation types in HCC cells with a similar genetic background is lacking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it is unclear whether <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations endow niche factor-independent growth in the liver, as observed for other Wnt pathway mutations in various tissues, such as the colon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">To address these issues, we introduced a variety of HCC-associated <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations as well as activating <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutations in the liver cancer cell line Huh7, HEK293T cells and mouse liver progenitor organoids. We observe that missense and truncating <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling, although to varying degrees and less pronounced than <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutations. Unexpectedly, we found that the insertion of premature stop codons in the 5’ exonic regions of <italic>AXIN1</italic> do not result in knock-out but rather promote alternative translation of N-terminally truncated AXIN1 variants that display partially retained suppressor activity. Mouse liver progenitor organoids harboring <italic>Axin1</italic> alterations could be propagated in the absence of Wnt and R-spondin (RSPO) ligands, indicating that <italic>Axin1</italic> mutations enable niche-independent Wnt pathway activation in the liver. Notably, we uncover an inverse correlation between the degree of mutation-induced Wnt pathway activation and the capacity of cells to activate YAP/TAZ signaling. Our findings thus provide an explanation for why Wnt-high, <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-mutant tumors generally lack YAP/TAZ activity while Wnt-low, <italic>AXIN1</italic>-mutant tumors associate with enhanced YAP/TAZ- mediated gene transcription and a more clinically aggressive phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Missense mutations within the RGS domain of AXIN1 drive Wnt/β-catenin signaling</title><p id="P7">To assess the roles of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> and <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we examined mutational patterns in these genes as listed in the cBioPortal database (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. For <italic>CTNNB1</italic>, the majority of missense mutations (88%) locate to the N-terminal degron motif of β-catenin and thus interfere with its phosphorylation, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. By contrast, genetic alterations in <italic>AXIN1</italic> are primarily truncating and missense mutations that are scattered throughout the gene. We previously demonstrated that cancer-associated single amino acid substitutions within the RGS domain of AXIN1 promote unfolding and the formation of soluble nano-aggregates, leading to impaired AXIN1 polymerization, loss of APC binding and reduced destruction complex activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. We set out to assess the functional consequences of all <italic>AXIN1</italic> missense variants reported in the TCGA HCC database, using a β-catenin-dependent luciferase reporter assay (TOPFlash) in HEK293T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Most AXIN1 variants carrying a mutant RGS domain induced ligand-independent activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway upon overexpression (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Concomitantly, these mutations disrupted AXIN1 polymerization and stability, as shown by loss of cytosolic puncta formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>) and diminished overall protein expression levels (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), in line with the previously reported L106R variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. AXIN1 A120D formed the only exception, as for this variant β-catenin-mediated reporter activity was induced while puncta formation and protein levels remained unaltered (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1a</xref>), in line with its decreased propensity for aggregation in comparison with the other RGS missense variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The AXIN1 A120D mutation likely interferes with APC binding directly, given its position in the APC interaction interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Notably, introduction of missense mutations in the AXIN1 DIX domain did not lead to ligand-independent activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in this model system, even though polymerization was perturbed (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1a and d</xref>). In a previous study, we showed that such variants display impaired suppressor activity when expressed at lower, endogenous concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, indicating that these more subtle defects may be overcome by increased AXIN1 concentrations due to overexpression.</p><p id="P8">To evaluate the functional consequences of RGS cancer mutations at the endogenous level, we introduced homozygous AXIN C121F and L106R mutations in HEK293T cells using prime editing and CRISPR/Cas9-assisted knock-in, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a and c</xref>). All clones harboring these HCC-associated mutations displayed hyperactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the absence of Wnt supplementation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2b and d</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed loss of interaction between AXIN1 L106R and APC in these clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2e-f</xref>), substantiating the previously observed loss of structural integrity of the RGS domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Together, these data suggest that cancer-associated AXIN1 RGS mutations promote Wnt/β-catenin signaling by disrupting destruction complex assembly and function.</p><p id="P9">Next, we examined how AXIN1 RGS missense cancer mutations impact Wnt/β-catenin signaling in a liver cancer background, using Huh7 cells. This cell line carries no mutations in core components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and is responsive to treatment with Wnt-3a and RSPO1, indicating that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling route is intact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Furthermore, Huh7 cells were not sensitive to treatment with the Wnt secretion inhibitor LGK974, demonstrating that these cells do not depend on Wnt ligands for their growth and survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). We employed prime editing to introduce AXIN1 C121F mutations in Huh7 cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We obtained heterozygous and homozygous mutant clones, for which activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the absence of Wnt ligand directly correlated with their mutant allele frequency (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). In line with these findings, expression of the Wnt target genes <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>LGR5</italic> was elevated in a stepwise manner in heterozygous and homozygous AXIN1 C121F clones (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). Together, these data provide compelling evidence that AXIN1 RGS missense mutations induce Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation in liver cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Frameshift mutations in 5’ coding regions yield an N-terminally truncated AXIN1 variant with partially retained functionality</title><p id="P10">The majority of <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations in HCC are frameshift mutations that, in case nonsense mediated decay is inefficient, may drive formation of truncated AXIN1 variants (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Frameshift mutations that locate to 5’ regions of the coding parts of the gene, are predicted to lead to an AXIN1 deletion phenotype, either due to nonsense-mediated decay or loss of most functional domains in case of truncation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In line with this assumption, Cre-mediated excision of <italic>AXIN1</italic> exon 2, encoding for amino acids 1 to 292, was used previously to generate conditional <italic>AXIN1</italic> knock-out mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. We next aimed to assess the functional consequences of frameshift mutations in <italic>AXIN1</italic> close to the translation start site by using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in Huh7 cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. In line with loss of AXIN1 suppressor function, these mutations induced basal Wnt/β-catenin signaling and the effects correlated with <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutant allele frequency (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Unexpectedly, however, Western blotting revealed that these Huh7 clones retained expression of an AXIN1 fragment with a lower molecular weight, as shown by an antibody recognizing the central region of AXIN1 (AF3287) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, lower arrow). This AXIN1 variant could also be detected using an antibody directed against the AXIN1 C-terminus (C76H11), indicating this concerned an N-terminally truncated variant (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, lower arrow). In corroboration, an overexpression construct encoding for mutation R22* also resulted in an AXIN1 variant with reduced molecular weight, which was detectable using a C-terminal V5 epitope tag, both on Western blot and by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5a</xref>). Furthermore, these N-terminally truncated AXIN1 variants maintained their capacity to form cytosolic puncta, confirming that their C-terminal DIX domain remained intact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5a</xref>). Truncations resulting from frameshift mutations downstream of AXIN1 position R146 could not be visualized via the C-terminal V5 tag, while these variants were still detected by the AF3287 antibody, recognizing the central part of AXIN1 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5a</xref>). Thus, while stop codons downstream of R146 generate C-terminally truncated AXIN1 variants, introduction of stop codons in the 5’ region of <italic>AXIN1</italic> exon 2 result in AXIN1 truncations that lack the N-terminus (ΔN) but still harbor the C-terminal DIX domain. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that ΔN AXIN1 variants may be generated by alternative translation initiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. To examine this assumption, we eliminated potential alternative start sites by mutating methionines M173, M181, M193 and M253 in exon 2 to leucine within AXIN1 R22* variants (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Indeed, combined mutation of M173 and M253 disrupted expression of the AXIN1 R22* variant, indicating that these start sites are utilized for alternative translation initiation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To test whether alternative translation initiation is physiologically relevant in the context of liver cancer, we evaluated AXIN1 expression in the HCC cell lines JHH5 and JHH6 that both harbor 5’ truncating mutations in exon 2 (Q6Rfs*22 and E5Dfs*2, respectively) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>). Indeed, these cell lines expressed an AXIN1 variant at a similar molecular weight as our CRISPR/Cas9-modified Huh7 cells with 5’ truncations in <italic>AXIN1</italic> exon 2 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>). Importantly, due to these alternative translation initiation sites, a robust AXIN1 knock-out (KO) line would require truncating mutations downstream of the initiation sites M173 and M253. Indeed, introduction of frameshift mutations immediately downstream of M253 led to loss of detectable AXIN1 expression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2i</xref>; S4c). Of note, Huh7 AXIN1 KO cells displayed strongly increased levels of basal Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity in comparison to Huh7 AXIN1 ΔN cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2j</xref>). In agreement, AXIN1 KO HEK293T cells also displayed increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling compared to AXIN1 ΔN HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5b-d</xref>). Together, these results reveal a previously overlooked class of <italic>AXIN1</italic> 5’ frameshift mutations that drive expression of an N-terminally truncated protein with partially retained functionality.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>AXIN1</italic>-mutant HCC cells display moderate Wnt/β-catenin signaling, while <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-mutant cells are Wnt-high</title><p id="P12">While activating <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutations have been associated with Wnt/β-catenin hyperactivation in HCC, <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations were linked to low or even completely absent Wnt/β-catenin signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. To directly compare both mutation types in Huh7 cells, we introduced an in-frame deletion of β-catenin degron residue S33 using prime editing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4d</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Clones carrying homozygous β-catenin ΔS33 mutations displayed higher Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation compared to different classes of AXIN1-mutant clones (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). At the transcriptional level, <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-mutant Huh7 cells displayed increased expression of Wnt target genes <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>LGR5</italic> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). In line with the luciferase reporter data, these genes were upregulated to a lower extent in <italic>AXIN1</italic>-mutant lines (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>).

No significant difference in β-catenin accumulation between WT and <italic>AXIN1</italic>-mutated Huh7 clones was observed, corroborating the notion that β-catenin is an insensitive marker for Wnt pathway activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Next, we queried the TCGA liver carcinoma database to examine the expression of <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>LGR5</italic> in HCC patient samples (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). <italic>AXIN2</italic> expression was slightly (but not significantly) upregulated in <italic>AXIN1</italic>-mutant HCC, while this Wnt target gene was significantly elevated in <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-mutant HCC. In agreement with our observations in Huh7 cells, <italic>LGR5</italic> expression displayed a significant upregulation in <italic>AXIN1</italic>-mutant HCC and these effects were more pronounced in <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-mutant HCC samples. Together, our results show that both <italic>AXIN1</italic>-mutant and <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-mutant HCC display elevated Wnt/β-catenin signaling, although levels of pathway activation are more moderate for <italic>AXIN1</italic>-mutant cells.</p><p id="P13">AXIN2 normally acts as safeguard that curbs Wnt signaling in the absence of AXIN1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

To perform a more comprehensive investigation of the relationship between Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity and Hippo signaling, we examined how varying levels of β-catenin-mediated transcription affect YAP/TAZ-dependent reporter activities in a large set of <italic>AXIN1</italic>-or <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-mutant Huh7 clones (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). The results clearly revealed an inverse correlation between levels of Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation and YAP/TAZ transcriptional activity (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). In an earlier study, the liver-specific Wnt target gene TBX3 was reported to repress YAP/TAZ signaling, providing a potential mechanism for the negative correlation between both pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. We however did not detect upregulated levels of TBX3 in either AXIN1- or CTNNB1-mutant cells, excluding this possibility as an explanation of our results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7c</xref>). To further investigate how both pathways are interlinked, we treated control Huh7 cells with Wnt-3a conditioned medium (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). Wnt-3a supplementation negatively regulated YAP/TAZ activation in a reporter assay, suggesting that there is crosstalk between both pathways that is not exclusive to <italic>AXIN1</italic>- or <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-mutant Huh7 cells. Next, we used different small molecules to modulate Wnt/β-catenin and YAP pathway activity.

In this study, we aimed to examine the differences in downstream signaling events of each mutation type in HCC.

Importantly, our findings therefore challenge the claim that <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations drive HCC development independent of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Notably, <italic>Axin1</italic>-mutant organoids that were treated with the Wnt secretion inhibitor LGK974 still displayed a reduction in Wnt target gene expression, suggesting that <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations do not lead to complete uncoupling of the signaling cascade from the Wnt receptor complex. Thus, <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations likely provide a low level of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that is sufficient for survival and proliferation, and still allows for regulation by upstream signaling events. These findings are reminiscent of an earlier report describing that residual levels of MAPK signaling in colon organoids carrying a KRAS mutation were sufficient to evade apoptosis in the absence of EGF ligand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. In line with our findings, optimal Wnt signaling levels for HCC formation were estimated to be lower than those required for intestinal tumors, further supporting the view that <italic>AXIN1</italic> mutations facilitate ‘just-right’ levels of Wnt signaling to enable HCC development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">The majority of AXIN1 mutations found in HCC are truncating and missense mutations.

Here, we confirm that RGS-associated AXIN1 missense mutations are capable of driving Wnt/β-catenin signaling in liver cancer cells. In addition, we found that truncating mutations near the canonical start site of <italic>AXIN1</italic> result in alternative translation initiation and, consequently, expression of an N-terminally truncated variant with residual tumor suppressor function.

Cells were resuspended in 5 mL lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM sodium, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, 10 μg/mL leupeptin and 100 μM sodium vanadate. Cells were lysed for 1 hour at 4 °C and subsequently centrifuged for 20 minutes at 21130 x g at 4 °C. 45 μL of lysate was collected as total cell lysate. For AXIN1 IP, per sample 1 µg of goat anti-AXIN1 antibody was added, followed by incubation overnight while tumbling at 4 °C. 20 μL of equilibrated protein G-coupled beads (Millipore) was added to each sample, followed by a 2-hour incubation at 4 °C while tumbling. Beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, after which proteins were eluted in 2x Sample buffer (SDS, β-mercaptoethanol, glycerol, Tris pH 6.8, bromophenol blue) and boiled for 6 min. For AXIN1 immunoprecipitation in Huh7, JHH5 or JHH6 cells, the same protocol was applied as for HEK293T cells, except that cells were seeded in eight 15 cm dishes (Corning) and resuspended in 500 μL RIPA buffer containing 25 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 1% deoxycholate, 0,1% SDS supplemented with 1 mM DTT and 50 mM sodium fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/mL), leupeptin (10 μg/mL) and sodium vanadate (100 μM).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Western blotting</title><p id="P32">Proteins were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels and separated on molecular weight. After separation, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon-F) (Millipore). After membrane blocking by Odyssey Blocking Buffer (Li-Cor) diluted 1:1 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), membranes were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C in TBS containing 0.05% Tween (TBS-T). After washing with TBS-T, membranes were incubated with secondary antibody for 60 min at RT in TBS-T. After additional washing steps with TBS-T and a final wash with TBS, membranes were scanned by a Typhoon Biomolecular Imager (GE Healthcare).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p id="P33">Huh7 cells and organoids were lysed in the dish by addition of 350 μL RLT buffer containing 1:100 β-mercaptoethanol. RNA isolation was performed following the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) protocol, with an additional step to remove genomic DNA by the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). Next, cDNA was made from RNA using the iScriptTM cDNA synthesis kit (Biorad). qRT-PCR was performed on a Biorad CFX96 using iQ SYBR Green (Biorad) with primer concentrations of 0.4 nM.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental document S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS201676-supplement-Supplemental_document_S1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d140aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the laboratory of MM Maurice for discussions and suggestions.
