While Mucoromycotina AM fungi are globally distributed, there is currently no understanding of the genomic basis for their symbiosis or how this symbiosis compares to that of other mycorrhizal symbionts.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><p id="P2">We used culture-independent metagenome sequencing to assemble and characterise the metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) of a putative fine root endophyte, which we show belonged to the family Planticonsortiaceae within the order Densosporales. The MAG shares key traits with Glomeromycotina fungi, which indicate obligate biotrophy, including the absence of fatty acid and thiamine biosynthesis pathways, limited enzymatic abilities to degrade plant cell walls, and a high abundance of calcium transporters. In contrast to Glomeromycotina fungi, it exhibits a higher capacity for degradation of microbial cell walls, a complete cellulose degradation pathway, low abundances of copper, nitrate and ammonium transporters, and a complete pathway for vitamin B6 biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P3">These differences highlight the potential for contrasting interactions between Mucoromycotina and Glomeromycotina AM fungi with their host plant and the environment which could support niche differentiation and complementary ecological functions.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mucoromycotina</kwd><kwd>Fine Root Endophyte</kwd><kwd>Metagenome-Assembled Genome</kwd><kwd>Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi</kwd><kwd>Planticonsortiaceae</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S4" sec-type="intro"><title>Background</title><p id="P4">Mutualistic symbioses with microbes are exhibited by the overwhelming majority of plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] with mycorrhizas by far the most widespread and well-described association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. While mycorrhizal symbioses have evolved multiple times across plant and fungal taxa, they share the common characteristic of the fungus trading nutrients assimilated from the soil, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen, in exchange for carbon from the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Additionally, mycorrhizal associations can confer a range of secondary benefits to the plant host, including disease resistance and stress tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Because of these profound impacts on plants, mycorrhizal associations are considered to be major determinants of ecosystem productivity and diversity and to play key roles in directing terrestrial biogeochemical cycling processes. There are four main groups of mycorrhizal associations: arbuscular (AM), ecto- (ECM), ericoid (ERM), and orchid (ORM) mycorrhizas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], which are distinguished by a number of features including the specific plant and fungal taxa involved, the ecosystems they inhabit, the way in which the fungus colonises and grows within root tissues, and the functional traits of the fungi involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P5">As a function of time and niche specificity, mycorrhizal symbionts appear to have evolved along a saprotrophy to symbiosis continuum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. This directional transition from free-living saprotrophs to obligate symbionts is believed to be driven by the provision of carbohydrates and vitamins from plants in nutrient-poor environments and the subsequent evolutionary success of a symbiotic lifestyle. As a result, key genomic signatures associated with this transition can be identified across this continuum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. As fungal symbionts shift away from primarily saprotrophic lifestyles to mutualisms, their genomes typically possess a reduced repertoire of the enzymatic machinery involved in the degradation of soil organic matter (SOM) and plant cell walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. The two youngest mycorrhizal symbioses, ERM and ORM, with origins c 75-90 and 112 mya, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], involve symbionts with genomic repertoires capable of simultaneously facilitating a saprotrophic and symbiotic lifestyle. However, fungi forming the older AM (origin 450 mya, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]) and ECM symbioses (origin c 200 mya) possess a much more fine-tuned enzymatic toolkit, noted for a reduced suite of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDE) along with the presence of specific genes involved in regulating nutrient transport and host plant signalling and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P6">AM are considered the most common and widespread plant-microbe symbiosis on Earth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], and their presence in fossil roots of the earliest land plants suggests that they were a significant factor in the evolution of land plants. Fungi forming AM have traditionally been placed into the Mucoromycota sub-phylum Glomeromycotina. These fungi are obligate symbionts; as fatty acid auxotrophs they depend on the exchange of plant-derived fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. As a result of long-term host dependence, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) present hallmark traits such as limited ability to break down cellulose, biosynthesise thiamine, or metabolise vitamin B6 derivatives. The genomic inability to express these hallmark traits represent Missing Glomeromycotan Core Genes (MGCGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P7">Until recently, all AMF were believed to belong to the Glomeromycotina (G-AMF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. It has long been recognised that there are two broad groups of arbuscular mycorrhiza based on morphology, with the ‘coarse endophyte’ G-AMF being the focus of the vast majority of research on the biology and ecology of AMF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Glomeromycotina comprises four orders, the Glomerales, Diversisporales, Paraglomerales, and Archaeosporales, which likely diversified when plants evolved onto land [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. The second morphological group of ‘fine root endophytes (FRE)’ arbuscular fungi are distinguished from coarse endophytes by their small spores, fan-shaped or palmate entry points, diverging thin hyphae (&lt;2 μm diameter) which in intercellular spaces often form hyphal ropes, as well as intercalary and terminal ‘vesicles”, approximately 5–10 μm in diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, the arbuscules of FRE appear very similar in structure to those of coarse endophytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Recent evidence has placed FRE within the sub-phylum Mucoromycotina (M-AMF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], indicating that AM symbioses may have evolved independently several times, as is the case for ectomycorrhizal symbioses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p><p id="P8">To date only one species of M-AMF, Planticonsortium tenue, has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. However, similarly to G-AMF, root systems are colonised by diverse Mucoromycotina taxa, communities of which are typically comprised of a small number of abundant and common taxa and a high diversity of rare low-abundance taxa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, distinctive morphologies of FRE have been recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] based on a variety of characteristics, including the roughness, diameter, and branching of hyphae and the size and shape of vesicles. While fungi within the Glomeromycotina are all assumed to be plant symbionts, fungi residing within the Mucoromycotina also include saprotrophs and putative ectomycorrhizal symbionts. Those Mucoromycotina sequences found associated with roots and rhizoids of vascular and non-vascular plants appear to have similar phylogenetic ranges and occur within clades alongside taxa with saprotrophic and putative ectomycorrhizal lifestyles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].</p><p id="P9">M-AMF have been detected across multiple continents, spanning a wide range of ecosystems, environmental conditions, and hosts, although in contrast to G-AMF they may be missing from tropical and sub-tropical biomes, and may be favoured by agricultural management practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. While the benefits of G-AMF to the host, particularly for phosphorus nutrition, are well documented, the functional significance of M-AMF within ecosystems is poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. G-AMF and M-AMF typically co-occur and intermingle within root systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], but they appear to occupy distinct but overlapping ecological niches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], with their distribution at the landscape scale differentially determined by temperature, pH, and plant richness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Unlike G-AMF, nutrient availability was found to be an important determinant of M-AMF abundance, which increased with fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><p id="P10">Furthermore, in contrast to G-AMF, experimental evidence suggests that M-AMF may favour providing the host with access to soil nitrogen, indicating a potential complementary functionality between the two arbuscular symbioses and an explanation for the parallel evolution of symbiotic traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>].</p><p id="P11">Comparative genome analysis has emerged as a powerful tool to understand microbial evolution, function, and ecology. However, these approaches largely rely on the availability of cultured microbes or voucher specimens for whole genome sequencing (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]). Importantly, culturing microbes can prove time-consuming and problematic as microbial populations have great complexity and many microbes have specific nutritional requirements which cannot be met in culture. This is particularly the case for obligate biotrophs such as symbionts which rely wholly or in-part on the host for their nutritional requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. As obligate symbionts, G-AMF require a host plant to complete their lifecycle. Despite this, pure cultures of G-AMF have been obtained using root organ cultures, and these have been used to produce inoculum for genome sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. The challenges in obtaining and maintaining root cultures have meant that direct genome sequencing of G-AMF cultures has been limited to date. Recently, asymbiotic mycelium and spore production of the G-AMF Rhizophagus clarus has been achieved by supplementing its growth medium with palmitoleic acid, and this could provide a boost to rates of culture-based sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. An alternative approach to obtain fungal genomes is sequencing of nuclei extracted from spores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], although most G-AMF taxa appear to sporulate infrequently, if at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>].</p><p id="P12">M-AMF are also putatively obligate symbionts, but because they have only recently been recognised as a distinct group of symbionts, culturing efforts lag behind those of G-AMF. Recently, monoxenic cultures of a Mucoromycotina fungus associated with the clubmoss Lycopodiella inundata have been obtained and shown to form FRE colonisation in a vascular plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. However, while genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis of a number of saprotrophic and putative ectomycorrhizal Mucoromycotina has been achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>], there is no understanding of the genome of M-AMF fungi and how their functional repertoire and mutualistic signatures compare to those of G-AMF, other mycorrhizal symbioses, and saprotrophic and putatively ectomycorrhizal Mucoromycotina. To further complicate the matter, initial comparative analysis of the sister clades indicate that some widely considered hallmark traits of mycorrhizal symbioses may instead represent ancestral markers as opposed to adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P13">Recently there has been great progress in the development of computational tools for the culture-independent assembly of ‘dark’ microbial genomes from metagenome sequencing datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Such ‘Metagenome Assembled Genomes’ (MAGs) have been widely used to identify the metabolic capabilities and ecological roles of specific prokaryotes in diverse habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. MAG construction of eukaryotic microbes is more challenging because of a range of issues including their large sizes, high genome heterozygosity, low abundance in metagenome datasets, and a lack of well-annotated reference genomes for gene annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. As a result, few studies have constructed eukaryotic MAGs from metagenomes, and these have typically been performed in low-diversity communities (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]). A further particular issue with analysis of plant symbionts in situ is their intimate association with plant tissue. This results in co-extraction of host DNA, increasing the sequencing depth required to assemble symbiont genomes.</p><p id="P14">The aim of the current work was to use culture-independent metagenome sequencing to assemble and characterise the genome of an FRE-forming M-AMF fungus for the first time and compare its genomic repertoire to glomeromycotan fungi and other fungal symbionts. Roots of Trifolium subterraneum were first enriched with FRE using a selective soil sieving technique. Root samples were used for metagenome sequencing, from which a MAG of the FRE was constructed. We compiled a database of 274 fungal genomes across the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mucoromycota, and assigned these to G-AMF, ECM, ERM, OCM, saprotroph, pathogen, parasite, endophyte, lichenic, and mixed lifestyles. Comparative analysis showed that the MAG shares key distinctive characteristics with G-AMF. This includes overlaps in some MCGCs, presence of abundant calcium transporters, and an overall reduced set of plant cell wall degrading enzymes. However, we found a relatively high abundance of microbial cell wall degrading enzymes and evidence of complete cellulose degradation capability, as well as low numbers of nitrogen transporters, suggesting a distinctive niche relative to G-AMF and the other mycorrhizal lifestyles.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S6"><title>Soil collection and sample preparation</title><p id="P15">For the metagenome sequencing, plants with the root AMF community enriched in M-AMF were produced following the methods of Orchard et al.

To determine FRE depth and breadth of coverage, the filtered metagenome reads were mapped, again using bwa mem and samtools, against the FRE4583 ribosomal operon and the resulting alignment files processed with custom Python scripts. To be sure that a high mean coverage was not an artefact of conserved regions, breadth of coverage was visually inspected. Sample P72 was predicted to have the highest Mucoromycotina abundance, possessing the majority of the operon with a coverage depth of over 100 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>); the missing regions are likely due to repeats as we filtered ambiguous mappings. We therefore focused on this sample in our efforts to reconstruct an M-AMF genome, assembling it using the SPAdes assembler v3.14.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>] with option -meta. This produced a catalogue of contigs with an N50 of 446 and total length of 1.3 Gbp. We then computed coverage depth profiles for these contigs across all samples by mapping reads with bwa mem, samtools, and bedtools v2.30.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. This improves the discriminatory power of genome binning through multi-sample coverages whilst keeping the best quality single sample assemblies. The contigs were then binned using these coverage profiles and composition with the binning software CONCOCT v1.1.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] and a minimum contig length of 1000 bp.</p><p id="P23">The putative M-AMF genome was identified based on a consensus of multiple lines of evidence, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>. Initially, we searched for the reference M-AMF ribosomal sequence FRE4583 in our dataset by mapping it to the assembly. A total of 12 unitigs were found with high similarity (&gt;98%) and spanning 75% of the operon without overlap. Since the assembly is fragmented, we decided to explore the assembly graph and more particularly the context of these small unitigs. Out of the 12, only 4 had a context, i.e., they were linked to other unitigs in the assembly graph. The idea behind this approach is that ignoring any miss-assemblies, all genomes have a distinct path in the assembly graph and in particular the M-AMF genome should include a path which passes through those unitigs labelled as ribosomal sequences thus allowing identification of M-AMF. We could not assemble a complete FRE4583 operon in a single contig, which is likely due to strain diversity. Using custom scripts available on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Sebastien-Raguideau/Graph-tools">https://github.com/Sebastien-Raguideau/Graph-tools</ext-link>) we extracted a subgraph encompassing all 10 Kbp around these 4 unitigs, and then visualised all contigs binned by CONCOCT on this subgraph using Bandage v0.8.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>], see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>. In this figure, the 4 unitigs are in red, un-binned unitigs are in gray, and all other colored unitigs are related to different CONCOCT bins. While this figure looks complex, it only corresponds to 0.05% of the whole assembly and refers to a limited radius of 10 kb nucleotides around the ribosomal unitigs, showing a clear proximity of multiple numbered bins.</p><p id="P24">A total of 12 bins were found in close proximity to M-AMF unitigs. However, on assessing quality, only bin 17 was found to have any marker genes, giving it a completion of 83.7% using the BUSCO v5.2.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>] general fungi_odb10 scheme with a size of 37.37 MBp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). In particular, while contigs from bin 70 were directly co-located with FRE ribosomal sequences, this bin did not possess any marker genes and was distinctly different in terms of coverage from bin 17. It may be that bin 70’s location in the graph is due to a miss-assembly, or it could be that this is due to strain diversity and that bin 70 is strain-specific part of the pan-genome of the FRE which would result in it having a different coverage profile to the core genome represented by bin 17.</p><p id="P25">To provide additional QC for this putative FRE MAG (bin 17) we used varScan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] to detect SNVs on all the contigs assigned to it.

There are a large number of SNVs throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>) but these are distributed evenly in frequency suggesting that they are likely generated by strain diversity rather than multiple haplotypes. We also computed the distribution of coverage depths of all ORFs predicted by prodigal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). While not sufficient to correctly detect all ORF from a eukaryotic genome, it still suggests that most genes are in a single copy despite the strain diversity.</p><p id="P26">We used phyloFlash v3.4.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>] to quantify abundances of all the SSU rRNAs in the SILVA database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>] and also our 42 target nanopore amplicon 18S rRNA consensus sequences. Filtering any taxa with less than 10 reads mapping across all samples yielded a total of 251 entries including the 42 consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). These were normalised by the total sequencing depth of each sample. To compare to these, the coverage depth of bin 17 was calculated for each sample by taking the sum of all nucleotides mapping to all contigs of bin 17 and dividing by the total length of the contigs, followed by normalisation as above. Using Pearson’s correlation, the coverage of bin 17 was compared to the coverage of all 251 taxa detected with phyloFlash. The strongest correlation (r = 0.97 and an adjusted p value of 4.5e-11, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>) was with one of the FRE consensus sequences (consensus_all_seqs_0_16), thus enabling us to provide finer scale phylogenetic information for bin 17, unambiguously linking it to this M-AMF sequence. The regression coefficient of 63 between coverage profiles (consensus_all_seqs_0_16 and bin 17) provides an indication of the number of ribosomal operons in the genome, a quantity consistent with other fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Reference genome access and ecological lifestyle annotation</title><p id="P27">To compare the MAG to known fungi, a database of reference fungal genomes was constructed from JGI MycoCosm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>).

This MAG was identified as a putative M-AMF through two lines of evidence. First, the contig bin was colocated on the assembly graph with unitigs that we could assign to the 18S rRNA gene of a known M-AMF reference (FRE4583). Secondly, its abundance correlated across the 12 samples in the study with an 18S rRNA sequence ‘consensus_all_seqs_0_16’, which we showed to be very closely related to FRE4583 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The bin itself did not contain a complete 18S rRNA sequence. This is unsurprising as this gene is well known for failing to assemble, largely due to it being comprised of strongly conserved regions that repeat throughout the genome, failing to assemble into substantial contigs. The MAG measured 37.37 Mbp with a genome coverage varying between 1x and 568 depending on the sample. The N50 was found to be 4928 with a GC content of 41.1%. Finally, its completion was assessed to be 83.7% with only 1.5% contamination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). We identified a total of 10,872 proteins. Of these proteins, we were able to assign 3,358 proteins with a functional annotation, comprising 218 CAZymes, 121 lipases, 280 proteases, 13 small secreted proteins, and 2,726 transporters.</p><p id="P36">While we acknowledge that the revised phylogeny of the Mucoromycotina subphylum produced in Tedersoo et al. (2024) lacks type specimens and is grounded in part on dark taxa, as a poorly captured branch of the fungal tree of life, we deem this an appropriate basis to apply the phylogeny of our MAG. 18S rRNA analysis placed consensus_all_seqs_0_16, and by proxy the MAG, within the order Densosporales of the Mucoromycotina, corresponding with the Densosporaceae sensu Desirò et al. (2017) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). This order is associated with FRE morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Further to this, strong support values allow us to confidently place the MAG in the newly proposed family Planticonsortiaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>]. Within this family, the MAG was placed with very high similarity to the known M-AMF reference sequence, FRE4583 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The MAG was closely related to three other Mucoromycotina 18S rRNA sequences obtained from the root samples (consensus_all_seqs 0105, 0122, and 0260) and to environmental sequences obtained from the thalli of early diverging plant sequences, e.g., MH174585 and MH174471. The wider Planticonsortiaceae clade included further sequences from the thalli of non-vascular plants, sequences not annotated beyond the phylum level associated with soil from across Europe (EUK sequences), and one sequence associated with the rhizosphere of Populus tremuloides (EF23703), a known arbuscular mycorrhizal host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis therefore placed the MAG apart from other members of the Mucoromycotina with putative ecology from the order Endogonales, including the putative ectomycorrhizal Mucoromycotina member Jimgerdemannia spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] and the saprotrophic Endogone sp. and Vinositunica sp. which have a putative saprotrophic or ectomycorrhizal lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>].</p><p id="P37">Similarly, the protein marker alignment placed the MAG within the Mucoromycota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). In our phylogenetic analysis, the MAG forms a sister group to all other Mucoromycotina species except for Calcarisporiella. This placement suggests that the MAG represents an early-diverging lineage within the Mucoromycotina. Due to the lack of available genomes from the order Densosporales, we cannot definitively assign the MAG to this order, but its basal position indicates it may be related to early diverging Mucoromycotina lineages, possibly including the Densosporales.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Genomic Profile of the MAG</title><p id="P38">To contextualize the gene content of the MAG, we compared the CAZyme, protease, lipase, and transporter profiles to genomes within the reference dataset that represented the saprotrophy-symbiont continuum. Due to the MAG’s early-diverging position within the Mucoromycotina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), and the absence of available genomes from some lineages such as the Densosporales, we highlighted the inclusion of five available genomes from the Endogonales for comparative purposes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). While the 18S rRNA and genome-wide analyses indicate that the MAG is a sister group to other Mucoromycotina species (excluding Calcarisporiella), the Endogonales genomes provide the closest available genomic context within this subphylum. This comparison allows us to explore potential functional attributes and evolutionary relationships within the Mucoromycotina. The ecological lifestyle had a significant effect on genome content across all four categories (p &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).

A similar number of CAZymes were found in the MAG compared to Endogonales genomes (149 to 208). The ERM genomes contained by far the largest median number of CAZymes across the lifestyles (629).

Similarly, there was a range of mannanases across the G-AMF genomes with the two Diversisporales genomes containing 11 and 10 counts respectively, more comparable to the MAG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). The MAG again contained a comparatively large set of genes for mannan degradation, with 5 copies of GH92, 3 copies of GH125, and 1 copy of GH76. However, this represents the one substrate-specific group that was not as conserved across the chosen Endogonales genomes.

Only the ERM genomes contained a statistically higher (p = 0.044) number of phosphate transporters than the other genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref>). The MAG contained a relatively low number of phosphate transporters (14), although this was not too dissimilar from the mean of the G-AMF (18) and the same as the mean ECM genome (14). Similarly, the Endogonales genomes possessed low numbers of phosphate transporters (13 to 15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref>).

Of the Endogonales genomes, ‘Jimlac1’ had the second smallest number of copper transporters (7) while the rest ranged from 8 to 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>). The G-AMF had a significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) number of nitrate transporters (7) compared to the other mycorrhizal and saprotrophic lifestyles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>). The MAG contained a low number (2) of nitrate transporters relative to the mean G-AMF, although this was the same as the mean ECM (2) and similar to the ERM (3), OCM (1), and SAP (1). There was considerable variation in the mean number of nitrate transporters within the Endogonales genomes (0-5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>).

As fatty acid auxotrophs, G-AMF have been shown to lack the presence of cytosolic fatty acid synthases required for fatty acid biosynthesis. We found no evidence of proteins directly associated with the fatty acid synthase required to facilitate fatty acid biosynthesis within either the G-AMF genomes or the MAG. We did identify 3-oxoacyl-ACP reductase in all genomes, including 10 within the MAG. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). Additionally, neither the MAG nor the G-AMF genomes possessed the ability to biosynthesis thiamine, a hallmark of G-AMF genomes. Specifically, we found no evidence of the presence of thiamine phosphate synthase or hydroxymethylpyrimidine kinase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>).</p><p id="P53">The ability to synthesis all derivatives of the vitamin B6 pathway was present within the MAG. This included a copy of pyridoxine kinase (2.7.1.35), the most prolific enzyme within the vitamin B6 metabolism pathway. Only one enzyme, pyridoxine 4-dehydrogenase, was missing from the pathway, while an indirect three-step metabolism for the conversion of pyridoxal to pyridoxine was present. Conversely, no G-AMF genome possessed a full vitamin B6 metabolism pathway, with no evidence of pyridoxine kinase being found across the group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P54">In the current work, we assembled the genome of a putative FRE-forming AMF from a root metagenome. Methodologically, this is a relatively unique achievement: fungal MAGs have been obtained previously from host-associated environments and niche environments, but not from complex environments, such as the rhizosphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>], or from similar fungal symbionts. To achieve this, we had to augment standard binning methods with assembly graph visualisations and coverage correlations to known M-AMF 18S rRNA genes. We believe that this method has many advantages over isolation and culturing, in particular, it is less time-consuming and in principle may be more reflective of the actual community present, particularly if multiple species are present.</p><p id="P55">We acknowledge that our assembled genome size of 37.37 Mb may underestimate the actual genome size. Short reads can, at times, have inherent difficulties in resolving repetitive regions and complex structures, especially when the repeats exceed the length of the reads. Consequently, repetitive sequences or duplications may collapse, presenting a smaller genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>]. The early diverging G-AMF Paraglomus occultum genome exhibited a very similar sized (39.6 Mb) genome with very small numbers of repeats, highlighting that a large genome is not a prerequisite of an AM lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>]. Furthermore, many Mucoromycotina genomes of varying ecological lifestyles are represented by genomes of similar size and limited complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>]. There is conflicting evidence as to whether arbuscular mycorrhizal genomes are diploid or simply ‘diploid-looking’ examples of heterokaryosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>]. Since short-read assemblers cannot phase chromosomes, in the event that M-AMF is a diploid organism, while the genome contents will be assembled correctly, it will be as a haploid chromosome.</p><p id="P56">Phylogenetic analysis of the correlative 18S rRNA marker, consensus_all_seqs_0_16, showed that the MAG sits within the order Densosporales of the Mucoromycotina. The MAG represents the first published genome of both the order Densosporales and the family Planticonsortiaceae. Due to the absence of sequenced genomes from the Densosporales—the order to which the MAG likely belongs—the only available genomes from the Mucoromycotina for comparison are those of putative ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi from the order Endogonales. Although these genomes provide valuable comparative insights, the MAG is phylogenetically distinct from these taxa, and a reasonable degree of dissimilarity is evident. The MAG was closely related to environmental sequences from the rhizoids of liverworts, which form arbuscular-like symbioses involving Glomeromycota and Mucoromycotina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>]. To date, understanding of the phylogeny of fungi which form mycorrhizas with FRE morphology in vascular plants has been restricted to short 18S rRNA fragments. Similarly, these studies have confirmed close phylogenetic relatedness with sequences from liverwort thalli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], suggesting these fungi form associations with both vascular and non-vascular plants, with a role in N and P nutrition of the plant host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Mucoromycotina sequences associated with plant roots may span both the Densosporales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] and Endogonales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], and furthermore diverse assemblages of fungi from these orders may be present in roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], although fungi associated with the FRE morphology appear to be phylogenetically distinct from putative ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic Endogonales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p><p id="P57">Comparative genome analysis showed that the MAG’s genome had many features in common with G-AMF. Some of these genomic features, including the low abundance of PCWDE and the absence of thiamine biosynthesis genes, were also seen in the Endogonales genomes and therefore aren’t likely to be specific, hallmark features of an adaptation to a symbiotic lifestyle. However, other signatures the MAG shares with G-AMF, including a high abundance of calcium transporters and the absence of fatty acid synthases, may point to physiological convergence in the way in which the symbioses operate. There were some notable differences between the MAG and G-AMF, with the MAG possessing a high abundance of chitinases, a complete vitamin B6 biosynthesis pathway, and low abundances of nitrate, ammonium, and copper transporters. These features may point to differences between G-AMF and M-AMF in the way they interact with the host plant and the wider environment.</p><p id="P58">It has been suggested that the transition from saprotrophic to mycorrhizal lifestyles involved loss of PCWDE, enabling fungi to exist within roots without digesting them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. The G-AMF symbiosis is estimated to have evolved 450 mya, and Glomeromycotan genomes possess substantially lower numbers of these genes than the fungi forming the more recently evolved ectomycorrhizal, ericoid mycorrhizal, and orchid mycorrhizal symbioses.</p><p id="P59">Furthermore, G-AMF show signatures of dependence on host metabolism that are absent from more recently evolved symbioses, including fatty acid auxotrophy and an inability to synthesise thiamine and metabolise vitamin B6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. These represent the ‘Missing Glomeromycota Core Genes’ (MGCG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P60">Although genomic evidence indicates that G-AMF and M-AMF have independent origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], these symbioses co-occurred in the earliest land plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], and they continue to co-occur in roots of extant plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Additionally, while G-AMF and M-AMF exhibit some niche differentiation, evidence of overlapping ecological presence and similar responses to overarching edaphic and environmental variables have been noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, ultrastructural evidence points to similarities in the way in which G-AMF and M-AMF function at a cellular level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Therefore, similar evolutionary pressures may have acted on these symbioses, which could have resulted in convergence of genomic traits. Indeed, many of the symbiotic genomic features shown by G-AMF were also displayed by the MAG. This included a reduced repertoire of PCWDE and the absence of several MGCG, including those related to thiamine and fatty acid biosynthesis.</p><p id="P61">Our analysis confirms the findings of Rosling et al. (2024) that Endogonales genomes have a low genomic PCWDE count and an incomplete thiamine biosynthesis pathway. Similarly, our MAG, which represents an early-diverging lineage within the Mucoromycotina and is possibly related to the Densosporales, also displays these features. This suggests that these traits may be present in multiple lineages within the Mucoromycotina and may not be exclusive adaptations to biotrophy. However, the Endogonales genomes possess fatty acid biosynthesis genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], whereas both the G-AMF genomes and the MAG lack these genes. This absence in both G-AMF and the MAG could indicate a convergent adaptation to biotrophy, potentially suggesting that host assimilate is provided as fatty acids in both symbioses.</p><p id="P62">The MAG had a number of features which distinguished it from G-AMF genomes. In particular, while there was a shared low abundance of CAZymes, the MAG possessed a greater repertoire of enzymes for degradation of organic substrates than typically seen in G-AMF genomes. This included the full complement of enzymes required for degradation of cellulose, which was absent in all G-AMF genomes. In notable contrast to G-AMF, the MAG had a high count of both chitin and mannan fungal cell wall degrading enzymes. The high chitinase count doesn’t appear to be specific to the M-AMF, with the putative ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic Endogonales genomes showing a similar pattern, attributed to elevated numbers of CE4 and GH18, as seen previously in Rosling et al. (2024). However, the full complement of chitinases was present in the G-AMF genomes as well as in the MAG, so this feature may not have any functional significance. Relative to other mycorrhizal fungi (except ericoid mycorrhizal fungi), the MAG had a notably high count of genes for mannan degradation. These were absent or present in low numbers in most G-AMF genomes and, significantly, were also found in low abundance in the Endogonales genomes, therefore high abundance of mannan degradation genes may represent a distinguishing feature of FRE genomes. However, even within the G-AMF there appears to be some variation, with the Diversisporales genomes containing a higher number of mannan and chitin degrading enzymes than the Glomerales genomes, indicating a substantial range of genomic repertoires.</p><p id="P63">It is important to understand whether these contrasting enzymatic profiles contribute to niche partitioning between G-AMF and M-AMF in nutrient mobilisation from contrasting mineral and organic substrates. For example, high abundance of chitin and mannan degrading genes could indicate a role for M-AMF in the degradation of fungal necromass, while a complete cellulose degradation pathway and high abundance of cellulose and hemicellulose degrading enzymes could suggest involvement in saprotrophic breakdown of plant-derived materials, similar to some ECM fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Alternatively, it could reflect different strategies for enzymatic degradation of plant cell walls as they colonise and grow through host plant tissues and penetrate root cells.</p><p id="P64">Currently, there is no indication that soil organic matter has any influence on the distribution of G-AMF or M-AMF. In contrast to G-AMF, evidence indicates that M-AMF are more abundant in agricultural than natural habitats, indicating a preference for low organic matter soils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. However, these functional differences could support niche partitioning within these habitats.</p><p id="P65">A further distinguishing feature between the MAG and the G-AMF genomes is the presence of a full B6 biosynthesis pathway in the MAG, including pyridoxine kinase, which was missing in all the G-AMF genomes, as demonstrated in earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. B6 is a cofactor required for amino acid biosynthesis, and it also plays a role as an antioxidant.</p><p id="P66">Reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging systems such as B6 may be required by AMF to overcome host defences, allowing intracellular colonisation and the development of arbuscules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>]. Components of the B6 biosynthesis pathway that G-AMF do possess are expressed throughout the fungal life cycle, but they are at the highest expression levels within the root [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>]. Similarly, B6 plays a role in supporting the infection of root tissues by pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>]. Differences in capacity for independent production of B6 between the MAG and G-AMF could point to differences in the way the fungi scavenge ROS, and potentially also differences in the way root colonisation and arbuscule development are regulated by the plant. There could also be implications for the specific mechanisms underlying M-AMF and G-AMF responses to external stressors which generate ROS such as temperature, osmotic stress, and nutrient limitation, and the independence of these responses to the plant’s own response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>].</p><p id="P67">Key physiological traits associated with G-AMF symbioses are the uptake of P from the soil, its translocation through hyphae to the root, and its transfer to the plant in exchange for carbon. Ultrastructural [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] and experimental evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] suggest a similar role for M-AMF. A number of P transporters have been identified in G-AMF involved in P assimilation from soil, storage of P, and exchange of P with the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>]. G-AMF genomes generally showed higher mean numbers of P transporters than ECM, while numbers in the MAG were low relative to other mycorrhizal genomes studied. While the significance of transporters to the functioning of symbionts will depend on a range of factors including their efficiency, our data doesn’t provide genomic support for particular specialisation in P nutrition by M-AMF.</p><p id="P68">Evidence also points to a potential role for G-AMF in N nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>]. Indeed, G-AMF genomes contained higher numbers of nitrate transporters than the other mycorrhizal symbionts, while also sitting towards the higher end of both ammonium and glycine transporters within the genomes we analysed. However, further evidence of inter-group differentiation can be seen across the Diversisporales and Glomerales genomes, with the former containing especially high numbers of ammonium and glycine transporters. The MAG contained a lower number of all three categories of N transporters than all G-AMF genomes. While the MAG contained a typical number of ammonium transporters compared to the other mycorrhizal lifestyles, it contained a low number of nitrate and glycine transporters.</p><p id="P69">Hoystead et al. (2023) suggested that M-AMF and G-AMF have complementary roles in host nutrition, with M-AMF predominantly involved in supply of N to the host and G-AMF in supplying P. Furthermore, Howard et al. (2024) showed a putative M-AMF displaying both a preference for, and increased transfer of, glycine and ammonium derived nitrogen sources. While there is evidence for the ability to transport varying forms of N, our MAG does not provide exceptional evidence for this relative specialism.</p><p id="P70">The very low abundance of Cu transporters in the MAG - the lowest across the entire dataset - is particularly striking. The three ectomycorrhizal Endogonales genomes also contain low numbers of Cu transporters, however the saprotrophic Endogonales sit near the mean. G-AMF may promote Cu uptake by the host plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>] and arbuscules have high demands for Cu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>]. Furthermore, Cu transporters in G-AMF show differential expression profiles across intra- and extra-radical mycelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>]. The extent to which M-AMF are involved in the supply of micronutrients to the host remains to be determined, but the evidence presented here could indicate that in contrast to G-AMF, this may not be an important function for M-AMF.</p><p id="P71">The high number of calcium transporters in both the MAG and G-AMF is a clear point of similarity between them, and of differentiation to all other groups. AMF have been implicated in transport of Ca to host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>], and our data could therefore indicate a role for both G-AMF and M-AMF in this function. However, Ca may also play a key role in the arbuscule lifecycle of both FRE and G-AMF. A clear link between a dramatic increase in calcium accumulation and arbuscule collapse has been demonstrated within G-AMF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>]. A similar trend within FRE has also been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>]. While it is unknown whether the Ca accumulated originates from the host plant or the fungi, the high number of Ca transporters within both G-AMF and the MAG may indicate that Ca accumulation is driven by the fungal symbionts, perhaps depositing Ca to cease the function of the arbuscule once it reaches maturity.</p><p id="P72">We must exercise some caution when interpreting these findings since we have constructed a relatively fragmented genome from a metagenome. However, our predicted level of contamination is only 1.5%, this suggests that we are unlikely to be assigning functions to the MAG that are not really present. In contrast, completion is potentially low at 83.7% so it is a definite possibility that we have missed a significant number of genes but most of the analysis above is at the level of gene families, if the missing genes are randomly distributed through these families we are unlikely to predict the absence of an entire family that is actually possessed by our MAG.</p></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P73">In this study, we assembled and characterized a MAG of a putative fine root endophyte forming Mucoromycotina AMF from samples collected in Australia. Comparative analyses revealed key genomic features shared with related fungal taxa, shedding light on potential functional adaptations to the root-associated lifestyle. Our findings contribute to the growing understanding of Mucoromycotan-AMF diversity and their ecological roles, providing a valuable genomic resource for future research on endophytic symbioses and nutrient exchange in plant-fungal interactions. For both G-AMF and M-AMF, comprehensive analysis of genomic functional gene repertoires across the broad range of taxa found within roots is key to understanding the way that AMF communities support plant health, and the potential for engineering communities to promote beneficial traits.
