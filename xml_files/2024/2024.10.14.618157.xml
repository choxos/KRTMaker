These receptors often form large multimeric complexes that differ in their subunit composition, distribution and signaling properties. Studying individual subtypes in native tissues with subunit stoichiometry resolution remains challenging. This is the case of NMDA receptors (NMDARs), a class of glutamate-gated ion channels playing essential roles in brain development and plasticity. These receptors co-exist as multiple subtypes, with GluN1/GluN2A (GluN2A diheteromers), GluN1/GluN2B (GluN2B diheteromers) and GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B (GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers) receptors prevailing in the adult forebrain. Despite numerous investigations, the relative abundance and subcellular distribution of these subtypes remain contentious. Here, we designed a photochemical tool (Opto2B) enabling specific and reversible modulation of GluN2B diheteromers, while leaving other receptor subtypes unaffected (in particular GluN2A/GluN2B tri-heteromers). Using Opto2B, we established the differential contribution of GluN2B diheteromers to synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR pools during development. In particular, we show that in adult hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, GluN2A-receptors predominate in both pools, with no preferential contribution of GluN2B diheteromers to extrasynaptic currents. Our study clarifies decades of controversial research on extrasynaptic NMDARs and paves the way for interrogating NMDAR signaling diversity with unprecedented molecular and spatio-temporal resolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NMDA receptors</kwd><kwd>optopharmacology</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>glutamate</kwd><kwd>extrasynaptic receptors</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">With their ability to convert a chemical message – the presence of the neurotransmitter – into an electrical signal – a change in membrane potential – neurotransmitter receptors are the linchpin of neuronal communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). They also constitute therapeutic targets of prime importance against neurological and psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Neurotransmitter receptors assemble as large macromolecular complexes formed by the association of multiple subunits, usually encoded by large multigenic families. The combinatorial association of constitutive subunits into functional receptors generates a vast diversity of receptor subtypes differing in their molecular composition, localization and functional properties. For instance, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, which mediate the bulk of inhibitory neurotransmission, associate into pentamers from no less than 19 different subunits giving rise to tens of different GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes in the CNS(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Similarly, ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), which mediate the bulk of excitatory neurotransmission, assemble as tetramers from a repertoire of several different subunits resulting into a wide variety of receptor subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Individual neurons or synapses may assemble distinct receptors subtypes across spatial locations, developmental stages, and physiological or disease states. There is little doubt that this large variety allows specific receptor subtype to engage into distinct neuronal function. This diversity also holds strong promise for next generation therapeutics through the development of target-specific precision drugs more efficient and better tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Nevertheless, we currently lack a clear understanding of the physiological and pathological relevance of the large plurality of neurotransmitter receptor subtypes. Current methodologies based on pharmacology and genetic modifications, although powerful, usually have limitations in terms of molecular specificity and spatiotemporal resolution. Therefore, new strategies are required to better discriminate between receptor subtypes and dissect their distribution and associated signaling pathways.</p><p id="P3">By combining the power of light, pharmacology and genetics, optogenetic pharmacology offers means to overcome some of these limitations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). This approach consists in tethering a photoswitchable ligand to a desired receptor subunit. Upon illumination with different wavelengths, the ligand can reach its binding site on the receptor target, or undock from it, resulting in pharmacological modulation of the receptor activity. Optogenetic pharmacology affords exquisite molecular and spatiotemporal resolution, as well as on-demand reversibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P4">NMDA receptors (NMDARs), a subfamily of iGluRs, play essential roles in brain development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Normal NMDAR signaling controls synaptic plasticity, a cellular substrate of learning and memory. Conversely, abnormal NMDAR function is deleterious causing neuronal injury, cognitive deficits and maladaptive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). At the molecular level, NMDARs are obligatory hetero-tetramers containing two GluN1 subunits and two GluN2 or GluN3 subunits of which there are six versions (GluN2A-2D and GluN3A-B). NMDARs can assemble as diheteromers (with two identical copies of GluN2 or GluN3 subunits) or triheteromers (with two different copies of GluN2 or GluN3 subunits) that co-exist in native tissue, with over ten receptor subtypes identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). In the adult forebrain, the GluN2A diheteromers (GluN1/GluN2A), GluN2B diheteromers (GluN1/GluN2B) and GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers (GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B) predominate, at mixtures that differ according to cell type, brain region and developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The GluN2A to GluN2B subunit ratio has been shown to be an essential parameter controlling key neural processes, such as critical periods, bidirectional synaptic plasticity as well as excitotoxic damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Yet the respective contribution of GluN2A and GluN2B diheteromers in respect to GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers in these processes remains controversial. Moreover, the subcellular distribution of these various receptor subtypes, i.e. their distribution between synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments, is also contentious. Genetic manipulation of GluN2A or GluN2B subunits indifferently affects diheteromers and triheteromers. Similarly, available pharmacological agents, such as the ‘GluN2A selective’ inhibitors zinc and TCN-201, or the ‘GluN2B selective’ inhibitor ifenprodil (and derivatives), poorly discriminate between their respective diheteromers and triheteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). These inherent limitations hamper drawing unambiguous conclusions.</p><p id="P5">In this work, using optogenetic pharmacology, we designed a new photoswitchable tool targeting NMDARs with subunit stoichiometry resolution. This tool (coined ‘Opto2B’) allows specific and reversible manipulation of GluN2B diheteromers in complete independence of GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers (and GluN2A diheteromers). Because Opto2B is based on an allosteric, rather than orthosteric (i.e. targeting the agonist binding sites), photoswitchable ligand, it also minimally interferes with the normal pattern of receptor activation, thus preserving endogenous signaling. Using opto2B, we defined the contribution to hippocampal CA1 NMDA currents of GluN2B diheteromers relative to GluN2A-containing receptors (GluN2A diheteromers and GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers), both at extrasynaptic and synaptic sites and during brain development up to adulthood. Our study reveals that, early on in postnatal development, GluN2A subunits are excluded from extrasynaptic sites but incorporate readily in synaptic NMDARs, while in adult CA1 pyramidal cells, GluN2B diheteromers are expressed at low levels at synaptic but also extrasynaptic sites.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Design of photocontrollable GluN2B-NMDARs using optogenetic pharmacology</title><p id="P6">GluN2B-NMDARs are selectively potentiated by polyamines (spermine and spermidine), a class of positively-charged compounds binding at the interface between the lower lobes of GluN1 and GluN2B NTDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Polyamines promote GluN1 and GluN2B NTD lower lobe apposition, a motion coupled to a downstream rolling motion between the two GluN1/GluN2B ABD dimers, which in turn leads to an increase in the receptor channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We decided to target this allosteric site to modulate GluN2B-NMDARs with light. To this aim, we designed a photoswitchable spermine derivative called MASp (for Maleimide-Azobenzene-Spermine), a tri-partite ligand composed of (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Text S1</xref>): (i) a cysteine-reactive maleimide moiety allowing covalent attachment to a cysteine; (ii) an azobenzene group (the photoswitch), which can reversibly alternate between an extended <italic>trans</italic> and a bent <italic>cis</italic> configuration depending on the illumination wavelength; and (iii) a spermine moiety (the ligand), acting as the pharmacological head-group. MASp was best switched from <italic>trans</italic> to <italic>cis</italic> by 365 nm light illumination, and from <italic>cis</italic> to <italic>trans</italic> by wavelengths of ~500 nm, as revealed by UV-visible spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Hence, thereafter, we used the wavelength of 365 nm to optimally photoswitch MASp from <italic>trans</italic> to <italic>cis</italic>, and wavelengths from 490 to 530 nm to induce <italic>cis</italic> to <italic>trans</italic> conversion. Further characterization of MASp physicochemistry revealed efficient and reversible photoswitching as well as bistability, properties highly suitable for biological use (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Text S1-Spectra S1G,H</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We next searched for a MASp attachment site on the GluN2B subunit for optimal photomodulation. Ideally, MASp tethered to the GluN2B subunit should be inert in one configuration (<italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic>), while inducing receptor potentiation in the other configuration (Fig. 1A). To identify potential MASp attachment sites, we performed individual cysteine scanning mutagenesis targeting solvent-accessible residues of the GluN2B α5-β7 region proposed to participate in the spermine binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C,D</xref>). Screening was performed in Xenopus oocytes expressing GluN1/GluN2B receptors with various cysteine mutants in the GluN2B subunit, and labeled with MASp (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1d</xref>). Because spermine potentiation displays strong pH-dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), functional screening was performed at an acidic pH (pH 6.5) to maximize chances of observing photomodulation.</p><p id="P8">We first tested potential background effects of MASp labeling on wild-type (WT) GluN1/GluN2B receptors. Currents from WT GluN2B diheteromers labeled with MASp were not affected by 365 or 490 nm illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). However, MASp labeling by itself induced a marked (~3-fold) increase in receptor channel open probability (Po), as assessed by measuring the kinetics of current inhibition by MK-801, an NMDAR open channel blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E,F</xref>). This effect was due to conjugation of MASp to the endogenous cysteine C395, located in the short linker segment between the NTD and the ABD of the GluN2B subunit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E</xref>). Indeed, MASp-induced Po increase was fully abolished in mutant GluN1/GluN2B-C395S receptors, in which C395 was rendered non-reactive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1G,H</xref>). To avoid effect of MASp on WT GluN2B-receptors, we subsequently used receptors containing the background mutation GluN2B-C395S (noted hereafter GluN2B*). Importantly, the C395S mutation by itself had no significant impact on GluN2B-receptor channel Po (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1H</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Among the 23 labeling positions tested, significant (&gt;30%) photomodulation was observed for 8 of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Most of these positions were clustered on the GluN2B α5 helix, which occupies a central position at the dimer interface of GluN1/GluN2B NTD dimer in its active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C,D</xref>). Interestingly, at 3 positions located at the ‘top’ (N-terminal end) of the α5 helix, currents under 365 nm light were smaller than under 490 nm light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C,D</xref>, red squares), while at downstream positions the opposite was observed (currents under 365 nm light stronger than under 490 nm light; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C,D</xref> green squares). The strongest photomodulation ratios were obtained for positions GluN2B-Q180C and -R187C, with 2.5-fold UV-induced current inhibition (I<sub>365 nm</sub>/I<sub>490 nm</sub> = 0.39 ± 0.02, n = 27) and close to 4-fold UV-induced current potentiation (I<sub>365 nm</sub>/I<sub>490 nm</sub> = 3.5 ± 0.2, n = 32) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), respectively. As observed with other azobenzene-based photoswitchable ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), the photomodulation showed high reversibility and reproducibility, allowing multiple cycles of illumination without fatigability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). These experiments also confirm that <italic>cis</italic>-MASp is kinetically stable, since no current relaxation was observed upon interruption of the UV illumination (see end of illumination cycle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). The opposite light effects observed at the Q180C and R187C positions are due to opposing effects of MASp <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> configurations. Indeed, at the Q180C position, MASp acts as a <italic>trans</italic>-on photoswitch: it constitutively occupies the spermine binding-site in its <italic>trans</italic> form (under 490 nm light, as revealed by the ~3-fold Po increase after MASp labeling), hence potentiating receptor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). Conversion by UV light to its <italic>cis</italic> isomer withdraws the spermine moiety from its potentiating binding site, allowing the receptor to revert to its basal state (similar Po as the non-labeled receptor). In contrast, MASp conjugated to GluN2B-R187C acts as a <italic>cis</italic>-on photoswitch: there is no effect on receptor channel Po under 490 nm light, while Po is increased by ~3.5-fold under UV-light (<italic>cis</italic> configuration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). We thus have on-hand two complementary optopharmacological tools for remote and reversible photocontrol of GluN2B-NMDARs with either UV (R187C) or green light (Q180C) illumination.</p><p id="P10">We then assessed the extent of MASp photomodulation of GluN1/GluN2B*-Q180C and GluN1/GluN2B*-R187C receptors at physiological pH (pH 7.3). Similarly to what was observed for spermine potentiation of GluN2B-NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), photomodulation at pH 7.3 was lower than at acidic pH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C,D</xref>). The UV-induced current inhibition of MASp-labeled GluN1/GluN2B*-Q180C receptors dropped from ~2.5-fold at pH 6.5 to ~1.2-fold at pH 7.3 (I<sub>365 nm</sub>/I<sub>490 nm</sub> = 0.84 ± 0.08, n = 13; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Photomodulation at pH 7.3 was also lower for MASp-labeled GluN1/GluN2B*-R187C receptors, although it remained robust, with ~2-fold photomodulation of receptor activity (I<sub>365 nm</sub>/I<sub>490 nm</sub> = 1.97 ± 0.17, n = 21; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C,D</xref>). Finally, we evaluated the functional impact of the GluN2B-Q180C and -R187C mutations (together with the C395S background mutation) on receptor activity, as well as on receptor sensitivity to agonists (glutamate and glycine) and endogenous allosteric modulators spermine and protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). The Q180C mutation itself (-MASp condition in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E-I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) had no significant effect on any of the above parameters. MASp binding to Q180C in its inactive (<italic>cis</italic>) form (+ MASp, UV condition) did not either induce any significant change in receptor function, except a decrease in spermine sensitivity, likely because MASp partially occupies (or hinders) the polyamine site. Functional effects of the R187C mutation and its subsequent labeling with MASp were also mild, although more marked than for Q180C. The R187C mutation by itself induced modest effects on receptor activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E-I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), while conjugation of MASp in its inactive (<italic>trans</italic>) form (490 nm PSS, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E-I</xref>) did not further perturb receptor function. It even restored spermine and proton sensitivities to WT levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2H,I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Overall, it appears that R187C combines many advantages, including robust <italic>cis</italic>-on photomodulation at physiological pH, making this site particularly attractive for implementation in native tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Therefore, we focused on receptors containing the GluN2B*-R187C subunit conjugated with MASp (Opto2B tool).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Selective photomodulation of GluN2B diheteromers</title><p id="P11"><italic>In vivo</italic>, NMDARs exist as multiple subtypes that differentially populate brain regions and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). To determine the MASp selectivity towards the different NMDAR subtypes, we first verified the effect of MASp labeling on diheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A receptors, an abundant pool of NMDARs in the adult brain. Currents from Xenopus oocytes expressing MASp-treated WT GluN1/GluN2A receptors displayed only modest photomodulation, with a small (8%) UV-induced inhibition (I<sub>365 nm</sub>/I<sub>490 nm</sub> = 0.92 ± 0.02, n = 22; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Moreover, MASp labeling by itself had no significant effect on GluN1/GluN2A receptor channel Po (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).

For that purpose, we used a previously published approach based on retention signals (hereby named r1 and r2) of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors that allows selective expression of NMDAR triheteromers at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) (see also ref.

No significant photomodulation of MASp-labeled GluN2A/GluN2B*-R187C triheteromers was observed (GluN2A-r1/GluN2B*-R187C-r2; I<sub>365 nm</sub>/I<sub>490 nm</sub> = 1.01 ± 0.01, n = 17; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). This lack of photosensitivity could not be attributed to the insertion of the retention signals since MASp-tethered GluN2B*-R187C diheteromers expressed using the same retention system displayed strong photomodulation similar to their control counterparts (GluN2B*-R187C-r1/GluN2B*-R187C-r2; I<sub>365 nm</sub>/I<sub>490 nm</sub> = 3.07 ± 0.22, n = 9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D,E</xref>). Finally, GluN2B-NMDARs containing only one copy of the mutant GluN2B*-R187C subunit displayed an intermediate level of photomodulation (GluN2B-r1/GluN2B*-R187C-r2; I<sub>365 nm</sub>/I<sub>490 nm</sub> = 1.21 ± 0.02, n = 14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D,E</xref>). MASp therefore discriminates according to subunit copy number. A single GluN2B subunit is insufficient to endow light sensitivity while strong photocontrol is gained when two photosensitive copies of GluN2B are assembled in the receptor, thus allowing selective modulation of GluN2B diheteromers. In that regard, Opto2B is unique, outperforming currently available subtype-specific pharmacological tools, such as the GluN2B-specific inhibitor ifenprodil, or the GluN2A-specific inhibitor zinc, which all poorly distinguish between diheteromers and triheteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Fast on-demand photocontrol of GluN2B diheteromers in mammalian cells</title><p id="P13">We investigated MASp-induced photomodulation in mammalian cells.

Quantitatively however, the extent of photomodulation (~3-fold) was significantly higher than that observed in oocytes at physiological pH (~2-fold). This difference presumably stems from the spherical nature and opacity of oocytes, while HEK293 cells are transparent and flatter, allowing more efficient and broader photoswitching of expressed GluN2B*-R187C diheteromers. Current potentiation by UV illumination was similar whether light was applied during agonist application (active state) or before agonist application (resting state) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C,D</xref>). UV illumination by itself had no (or little, see below) effect on the baseline current (recorded in the absence of agonist), as expected from MASp acting as a genuine allosteric ligand, modulating but not directly activating the receptors.

It furthermore had minimal impact on the intrinsic neuronal electrical properties and excitability, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5H-J</xref>). Taken together, these results show that MASp is operational in intact neuronal networks allowing selective manipulation and detection of GluN2B diheteromers with minimal off-target effects.</p><p id="P17">During the course of our recordings, we systematically observed in MASp-treated slices a large (up to several hundreds of pA) and transient increase of the tonic (i.e. holding) current at the onset of the UV illumination pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). UV-induced increase in tonic current occurred in the ~15 ms time-range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A,B</xref>) but the current relaxed close to basal level with a time constant of ~200 ms despite the continuous presence of UV light (no green light application) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A,B</xref>). However, illumination with green light was necessary to allow subsequent UV-induced potentiation of the tonic current and, similarly to synaptic currents, this process was reproducible over several cycles of illumination without visible photo-fatigue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6C</xref>). This current peak was absent in non-fluorescent neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6C,D</xref>) and was fully abolished by application of 50 μM of the NMDAR-specific antagonist APV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6E</xref>). Thus, we can safely conclude that this transient UV-induced current is mediated by light-sensitive GluN2B diheteromers. In principal neurons of the forebrain, extrasynaptic NMDARs contribute to tonic currents by binding ambient glutamate present at low concentrations in the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Monitoring the large and transient potentiation of NMDA tonic currents should therefore allow us to probe with high sensitivity the presence of GluN2B*-R187C diheteromers at extrasynaptic sites.</p><p id="P18">We hypothesized that the transient nature of the UV-induced potentiation of tonic NMDA currents reflected glutamate dissociation from potentiated receptors. Spermine potentiation of GluN2B diheteromers (but also UV potentiation by MASp, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>) is known to come with a slight decrease in the receptor’s glutamate sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Recordings from cultured cortical neurons transfected with GluN2B*-R187C confirmed that MASp photo-potentiation decayed with time when sub-saturating glutamate concentrations were used, while under saturating agonists, UV light yielded sustained, non-desensitizing potentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A,B</xref>). Thus, in brain slices, the low (i.e. non-saturating) glutamate concentrations likely account for the transient nature of UV potentiation of tonic NMDA currents. To confirm this hypothesis, we artificially raised ambient glutamate extracellular concentration in brain slices by perfusing the glutamate transporter inhibitor DL-threo-β-Benzyloxyaspartic acid (TBOA). As expected, application of TBOA resulted in a strong increase of tonic current levels (average ± s.e.m tonic current at +40 mV of 438 ± 101 pA before TBOA <italic>vs</italic> 1469 ± 108 pA after TBOA treatment, n = 8, p-value = 0.008, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test). Upon subsequent UV-light application, the UV-induced peak did not fully decay, reaching a steady-state current significantly larger than basal levels, and that was reversed by green light (Δ<sub>UV, SS</sub> / Δ<sub>UV, peak</sub> = 0.15 ± 0.02 before TBOA and 0.46 ± 0.08 after TBOA; n = 8; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6F,G</xref>). In some cases, the UV potentiation was sustained with minimal decay of the tonic NMDA currents indicating glutamate concentrations following TBOA treatment high enough to saturate the receptors’ glutamate binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6F</xref>). By comparing the ratio of steady-state over peak of the UV-induced current increase in absence of TBOA (Δ<sub>UV, SS</sub> / Δ<sub>UV, peak</sub> = 0.15 ± 0.02, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6G</xref>) to the values measured in dissociated neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref>), we estimated the basal glutamate concentration to be in the 30 to100 nM range around cortical pyramidal neurons, consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>– <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). Given the low occupancy of extrasynaptic NMDARs by tonic glutamate at these concentrations and the large peak current elicited by UV illumination, our findings indicate that extrasynaptic sites express a high amount of GluN2B diheteromers. Hence, the very fast control of GluN2B diheteromers by light allows separation of the two opposite effects of polyamine modulation: increase of channel Po and decrease of glutamate potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). As MASp is converted from <italic>trans</italic> to <italic>cis</italic> by UV light, it reaches its NTD modulatory site leading to an increase of Po in a ~15 ms time range, which corresponds to the peak of UV-induced increase in tonic current. Subsequent UV peak relaxation reflects glutamate dissociation, with much slower kinetics (~200 ms, see above) that are similar to the NMDA EPSC decay kinetics measured from fluorescent neurons (weighted τ<sub>off</sub> = 198 ± 13 ms, n = 8). In addition, the amount of relaxation makes it possible to estimate the local tonic glutamate concentration around the recorded neuron.</p><p id="P19">Unlike steady-state UV potentiation, peak UV potentiation as assessed on recombinant receptors was largely independent on glutamate concentration, with &lt;10% variation of photomodulation between 0.03 and 100 μM of glutamate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7C-E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Text S3</xref>). Measurement of UV-induced potentiation at the peak therefore allows comparison of the proportions of GluN2B diheteromers between neurons and neuronal compartments regardless of their local glutamate environment.

Opto2B relies on the covalent reaction of a photoswitchable spermine, MASp, to a cysteine-modified GluN2B subunit, GluN2B-R187C. We show that, when bound to GluN2B-R187C, MASp allows fast, reversible and reproducible photo-enhancement of GluN2B diheteromer activity in recombinant systems, cultured neurons and brains slices with minimal off-target effects on basal synaptic transmission. Using this tool, we were able to investigate the evolution of NMDAR subtype composition during postnatal development. We reveal that at hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells both synaptic and extrasynaptic populations undergo synaptic maturation through a GluN2B-to-GluN2A switch mechanism, but that this maturation occurs at a later time for extrasynaptic populations. At adult stage, our works indicates that GluN2A-containing NMDARs, i.e. GluN2A diheteromers and GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers, likely form the majority of NMDAR subtypes in hippocampal CA1 neurons at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites.</p><sec id="S9"><title>Opto2B, a GluN2B-selective PAM with subunit stoichiometry resolution</title><p id="P25">To our knowledge, Opto2B is the first tool allowing the discrimination between NMDAR containing distinct stoichiometries of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits, the two main GluN2 subunits in the adult forebrain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Currently available GluN2A-selective NAMs acting at the level of the NTDs (zinc ions) or GluN2A-selective PAMs, have intermediate effects on GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers. In addition, effects of GluN2A-selective NAMs acting at the LBD level (e.g. TCN-201 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>) or MPX-004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>)) are almost as large on GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers as on GluN2A diheteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). On the other hand, ifenprodil derivatives, commonly used GluN2B-selective inhibitors, have an intermediate effect on GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Polyamines, the only known GluN2B-selective PAMs, have a large potentiating effect on GluN2B diheteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), with minimal potentiation of GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). However, these compounds also produce a non-selective inhibition of all NMDAR subtypes through a pore block mechanism. They furthermore have multiple non-specific effects on various membrane receptors and channels, which might interfere with the GluN2B specific potentiating effect and complicate their use in native systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>). In contrast, the Opto2B tool relies on the covalent binding of a polyamine ligand, MASp, near the GluN2B-specific polyamine potentiating site. After labeling and extensive washout of the free compound, only the bound-MASp remains, hence avoiding off-target pore block of NMDARs, as well as off-target binding to other receptors in native tissues. Accordingly, unlike free spermine, treatment of non-GluN2B NMDARs (GluN2A, 2C and 2D diheteromers) with MASp yielded no light-dependent effect on their activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Interestingly, covalent binding of MASp to GluN2B-R187C in the context of a GluN2A/2B triheteromer did not either photosensitize the activity of this receptor subtype. This is reminiscent of the poor effect of free spermine on GluN2A/2B triheteromers (see above) and is consistent with the GluN2A subunit dominating the biophysical and pharmacological properties of GluN2A/2B triheteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Despite the exquisite selectivity of Opto2B towards GluN2B diheteromers, MASp can conjugate to the endogenous cysteine GluN2B-C395 in recombinant systems (Xenopus oocytes and HEK cells), leading to an increase in channel Po but no light sensitivity. This increase in basal Po explains the smaller UV potentiation observed when MASp was able to react with both cysteines at positions 187 and 395 (GluN1/GluN2B-R187C receptors; 1.75-fold UV-potentiation in HEK cells) than when C395 reactivity was neutralized, allowing conjugation of MASp only at position R187 (GluN1/GluN2B-R187C-C395S receptors) (3 to 3.7-fold UV-potentiation in HEK cells) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8A</xref>). However, in cultured cortical neurons, whether C395 was neutralized or not had no significant impact on the photomodulation ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8B</xref>). Moreover, we obtained large photomodulation ratios in brain slices from Opto2B mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), close to the ones obtained from cortical brain slices electroporated with the GluN2B-R187C-C395S subunit. This suggests that background conjugation of MASp to the endogenous cysteine GluN2B-C395 is not an issue in native systems. The factors underlying the lack of reactivity of GluN2B-C395 in neurons compared to other (non-neuronal) cells remain to be established.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Monitoring GluN2B diheteromers with subcellular precision</title><p id="P27">In addition to its exquisite molecular specificity, the fast and reversible properties of the Opto2B tool allowed us to probe independently, within the same cell, the molecular composition of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs. It is considered that NMDA-EPSCs evoked by single electrical stimulations of presynaptic afferents reflect the activity of the synaptic pool of NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). On the other hand, NMDA tonic currents, recorded in absence of any electrical stimulation, are considered to be mediated primarily by extrasynaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Hence, by measuring in CA1 pyramidal neurons the amount of UV-induced potentiation of NMDA-EPSCs on one side, and NMDA tonic current on the other, we were able to monitor the proportion of GluN2B diheteromers from the CA3-CA1synaptic pool and the extrasynaptic pool, respectively.</p><p id="P28">In many respects, Opto2B outperforms previous methods to investigate the molecular nature of NMDARs. In particular, with its ability to reveal with high sensitivity the presence of extrasynaptic GluN2B diheteromers activated by very low concentrations of ambient glutamate, Opto2B circumvents many limitations of classical pharmacology. Investigation of the molecular nature of extrasynaptic NMDARs has largely relied on classical pharmacology, assessing the extent of tonic NMDAR current inhibition by subunit-specific NMDAR antagonists like zinc or ifenprodil (see, for example, ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>)). NMDAR-dependent tonic currents are usually small (3060 pA) and inhibitors typically take minutes to elicit their effect in brain slices, making the quantification of tonic current inhibitions challenging. In addition, modulation by subunit-specific NMDAR antagonists is usually agonist-dependent, resulting in large variations in the amplitude and direction of modulation depending on agonist concentration. For instance, at low (~100 nM) glutamate concentrations, ifenprodil has a potentiating rather than an inhibitory effect on GluN2B-NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Similarly, the extent of zinc inhibition strongly depends on the occupancy of the glutamate sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>). Thus, the effects of conventional pharmacological agents on tonic NMDA currents, which are activated by ambient glutamate concentrations that likely differ from preparation to preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>), appear to be unreliable readouts for determining the receptor subunit composition.</p><p id="P29">The Opto2B tool also harnesses the power of light and allows temporal segregation of GluN2B diheteromer potentiation (occurring in a 15 ms time range) linked to the increase in channel Po, from a 10-time slower receptor “depotentiation”, reflecting glutamate dissociation due a decrease in glutamate affinity. The time separation between these two opposite effects yields a clear sharp peak following illumination of the NMDA tonic current. The large amplitude of the current peak (tens of pA) and its independence on glutamate concentration allows reliable estimation of the contribution of GluN2B diheteromers at extrasynaptic sites and its direct comparison with the contribution of this receptor subtype at synaptic sites. On the other hand, the amount of UV-induced potentiation of NMDA tonic currents at steady-state, which strongly depends on glutamate concentration, allows estimation of glutamate concentrations at the vicinity of the receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). With its unique properties, the Opto2B tool appears well suited to compare NMDAR subunit composition from different cell compartments and to probe the local glutamate microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Opto2B reveals distinct developmental profiles of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs</title><p id="P30">Decades of research have established that the GluN2B subunit is enriched at embryonic stages while expression of the GluN2A subunit gradually increases following birth, resulting in a GluN2A/GluN2B ratio that increases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>). However, what is still unclear and highly debated is how the GluN2B subunit partitions between GluN2B diheteromers or in GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers during brain maturation. Early studies based on subunit coimmunoprecipitation concluded that, at adult stage, the GluN2B subunit is either incorporated preferentially in GluN2B diheteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>), or, in contrary, in GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>) (see also ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>)). At adult CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapses, several studies have indicated that the majority of receptors are GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers (and thus that GluN2B diheteromers are a minority) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>). Yet, more recently, super-resolution microcopy data on cultured hippocampal neurons revealed a maximum of ~30% of GluN2A and GluN2B subunit colocalization at synaptic sites, suggesting preferential incorporation of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits into diheteromers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>). In absence of tools with subunit stoichiometry resolution, functional investigations of NMDAR subunit composition is challenging (see above). The Opto2B tool solves this issue in a large part by allowing direct probing of GluN2B diheteromer content.</p><p id="P31">We generated a knock-in mouse expressing the mutated GluN2B-R187C subunit to allow the investigation of the developmental regulation of GluN2B diheteromers at synaptic and extrasynaptic sites, while keeping endogenous levels of GluN2B subunit expression. Using Opto2B mice, we observed an increase of NMDA-EPSC amplitude under UV light at all ages, demonstrating that GluN2B diheteromers are present at CA3-CA1 synapses throughout. However, we also observed a clear decrease of the extent of photomodulation with age reflecting a decreased contribution of synaptic GluN2B diheteromers during development, so that this population becomes a minority at adult stage. Even at early stages, the UV photomodulation remained modest in amplitude (compared to the photomodulation observed on ‘pure’ GluN2B diheteromers), indicating a scarcity of GluN2B diheteromers. Combining the Opto2B mouse line with the GluN2A-KO mouse line revealed that GluN2A-NMDARs (GluN2A diheteromers and/or GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers) are indeed already present with GluN2B diheteromers at early postnatal ages (&lt;P12) at the CA3-CA1 synapse. Therefore, following birth, GluN2A-NMDARs readily access synaptic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). For the youngest age tested (P5), the low photomodulation could additionally be linked to the contribution of residual (spermine-insensitive) GluN2D-containing receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>), with the GluN2D subunit being highly expressed at embryonic stages before rapidly declining during the first postnatal week in CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>). Altogether our results demonstrate a gradual disappearance of GluN2B diheteromers at CA3-CA1 synapses during development in favor of GluN2A-containing NMDARs (either GluN2A diheteromers or GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), in line with the previously described GluN2B-to-GluN2A developmental switch. They also add the new information that CA3-CA1 synaptic sites do not favor the clustering of GluN2B diheteromers, but rather of GluN2A-containing receptors, even at early postnatal stages when GluN2B expression still dominates that of GluN2A. This poses key questions that remain to be addressed about the rules governing NMDAR subunit assembly and their specific targeting to distinct neuronal compartments.</p><p id="P32">In contrast to synaptic receptors, we observed that GluN2B diheteromers form the vast majority of extrasynaptic NMDAR subtypes in CA1 pyramidal neurons at young postnatal ages (&lt; P12), which is consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). At these juvenile ages, our results on Opto2B/GluN2A-KO mice show that GluN2A-NMDARs do not contribute or minimally to NMDA tonic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). However, we also observed that the contribution to tonic current of GluN2B diheteromers decreases drastically through development, Opto2B/GluN2A-KO mice revealing a growing contribution of GluN2A-NMDARs at extrasynaptic sites. At adult stage, our results show that GluN2B diheteromers form only a minor population of extrasynaptic NMDARs, while GluN2A-NMDARs predominate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). At first glance, this result challenges the commonly admitted view that GluN2A-NMDARs and GluN2B-NMDARs segregate in synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>). Several studies, however, do not support such a strict differential repartition, with equivalent GluN2A and GluN2B contents in both compartments (92– 95). This discrepancy likely originates from different methodological approaches, various preparations (neuronal culture or brain slices), brain regions and developmental stages of the studied systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). The limitations of classical pharmacological agents to study extrasynaptic receptors and their complex effects at low agonist concentrations (see above) add to the lack of consensus. Leveraging the unique attributes of Opto2B, we here establish that, similarly to synaptic NMDARs, extrasynaptic NMDARs also undergo a marked GluN2B-to-GluN2A switch in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. The comparison between synaptic and tonic photomodulations also reveals a previously unknown shift in the developmental profile of NMDAR molecular composition between synaptic and extrasynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>): GluN2A is incorporated earlier at the synapse but surprisingly constitutes a major part of all NMDARs in the adult mouse at both sites (see model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). These results challenge the prevailing idea of an enrichment of extrasynaptic receptors in GluN2B diheteromers throughout development. Given the robust expression of GluN2B subunit in the adult forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>), we propose that a substantial pool of synaptic but also of extrasynaptic NMDARs is constituted by GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers. Establishing the molecular identity of the various pools of NMDARs, each of which presumably triggers distinct signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), remain of prime importance to untangle the complex effects of subtype-specific NMDAR signaling on brain circuits and behavior. It also provides valuable information for the design and biological understanding of precision pharmaceutics targeting NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p id="P33">In conclusion, we have engineered, validated and implemented a new tool, Opto2B, that enables fast and selective interrogation of native GluN2B diheteromers in isolation form other coexpressed NMDARs. Using Opto2B, we established the developmental sequence that shapes the distribution of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits at synaptic and extrasynaptic sites in CA1 pyramidal neurons, while clarifying a long-standing contentious issue, that of the relative abundance of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing receptors between both locations. We foresee broad applications of Opto2B and other optopharmacological tools targeting NMDARs to study their molecular and functional adaptation to contextual experience and disease states.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="P34">Salts, buffers, glucose, D-serine, DTPA (diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid), glucose, L-glutamate, glycine, spermine, Mg-ATP and Na-GTP were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Oocytes were then thoroughly washed in 4 mL of Barth solution during 10 min in the dark, on ice, under mild shaking (90 rpm), during three consecutive times (30 min total wash time). Oocytes were transferred to a new well containing 4 mL Barth between each washing step. Increasing the labeling step to 30 min instead of 15 min did not increase the amplitude of photomodulation. On the other hand, we observed strong non-covalent association of MASp with NMDARs and/or the oocyte membrane, so that increase of MASp concentration in the labeling solution (to 6.6 μM) or decrease of the wash time resulted in incomplete washout of the non-covalently bound compound. This was evidenced by a slow inhibition of WT GluN1/GluN2B or GluN1/GluN2A receptor currents by UV light, which was slowly reversed by green light. This effect slowly washed away as the cell was submitted to several illumination cycles. We attributed this slow and non-specific effect on NMDAR currents to a high affinity, photo-dependent pore block.

Cells were maintained in the dark between illumination steps. Except for <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6C</xref>, calculations were performed on the average current trace from the 5 or 10 illumination cycles. APV was systematically applied in the dark after the 5 or 10 cycles of illumination to allow calculation of photomodulation ratios, and the illumination protocol was repeated in presence of APV to check for proper inhibition of all NMDARs, including the photodependent receptors. Since APV was applied in the dark and after green light illumination, the APV-sensitive current (I<sub>APV</sub>) represents the basal NMDA tonic current in the dark or under green light (I<sub>APV</sub> = I<sub>530 nm</sub>). Under UV light, NMDA tonic current is calculated as Δ<sub>UV, peak</sub> + I<sub>APV</sub> at the time of peak, with Δ<sub>UV, peak</sub> representing the UV-induced increase in tonic current at its peak (~ 35 ms after the onset of UV light, mean around the peak over a windows of 0.30 ms to avoid bias from nonspecific noise) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>). The photomodulation ratio was calculated as (Δ<sub>UV, peak</sub> + I<sub>APV</sub>)/I<sub>APV</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Rising and decaying phases of the UV-induced current peak were fitted with single exponentials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Subtype-specific pharmacology on NMDA-EPSCs</title><p id="P67">For Ro 25-6981 or MPX-004 experiments, slices from Opto2B animals were labeled with MASp but not the ones from WT animals. NMDA-EPSCs were isolated by adding to ACSF 10 μM NBQX, 100 μM picrotoxin, 10 μM strychnine but, contrary to photomodulation experiments, no glycine was added to maximize the effect of MPX-004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). A baseline of NMDA-EPSCs was recorded for at least 5 min before adding the pharmacological agent. Ro 25-6981 was applied at 1 μM and MPX-004 at 30 μM. NMDA-EPSCs were recorded for at least 5 min after the effect of the inhibitors has reached steady state (total duration of ~30 min). Cells were maintained in the dark. Only cells with stable EPSCs before application of the inhibitor were analyzed. For each drug, percentage of inhibition effect was calculated as the ratio between the average of EPSC amplitudes over 3 minutes before drug application and the average of EPSC amplitudes over 3 minutes once stability is reached after drug action.</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Data analysis and Statistical analysis</title><p id="P68">Electrophysiological data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.3 (Molecular Devices), Prism (GraphPad software), Igor (Wavemetrics) and a built-in Python script.

orientation="portrait" position="float"><caption><title>Significance Statement</title></caption><p>Pharmacological and genetic approaches, the gold standards for investigating receptor diversity, cannot easily distinguish between receptor populations containing one or more copies of the same subunit. For NMDARs, discriminating GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers (containing one copy of GluN2A and one copy of GluN2B) from their diheteromeric counterparts (containing two copies of GluN2A or GluN2B) remains difficult. Here, we designed the first tool (Opto2B) allowing selective modulation of GluN2B diheteromers, leaving GluN2A/GluN2B triheteromers unaffected. Using Opto2B, we show that GluN2B diheteromers form a minor population in both synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments of the adult CA1 hippocampus, refuting the common belief of an enrichment of GluN2B diheteromers at extrasynaptic sites. This study should inform future drug discovery programs and studies on NMDAR molecular physiology.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Engineering light-sensitive GluN2B-NMDARs.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic of a dimer of GluN1 and GluN2B subunits.
