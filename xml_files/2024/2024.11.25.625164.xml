Here we reveal a novel interaction between eosinophils and monocytes in the bone marrow, indirectly controlled by the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2. We demonstrate that ACKR2 maintains eosinophil levels within the bone marrow by scavenging CCL11. In the absence of ACKR2, elevated CCL11 leads to increased egress of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. As a result, eosinophil and monocyte interactions are reduced within the bone marrow niche, leading to changes in monocyte gene expression. Monocytes from ACKR2-/- mice are recruited to the tissues but are fundamentally altered in their ability to differentiate into macrophages, in the lung, peritoneal cavity and cavity wall. Bacterial elimination is impaired in ACKR2-/- mice during peritoneal infection. ACKR2 is therefore a key regulator of eosinophil-driven monocyte education in the bone marrow, required for full monocyte differentiation and macrophage function within the tissues.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Macrophages are key cells within the immune system, protecting the body by phagocytosing pathogens, helping to repair and remodel tissues after injury, and maintaining tissue homeostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Macrophages in the tissues can be broadly divided into resident or recruited cells. Resident macrophages are seeded embryonically and derive from yolk sac and foetal liver progenitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Recruited/inflammatory macrophages are derived from bone marrow monocytes which differentiate into macrophages following recruitment into tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Monocyte and macrophage movement within the body is largely orchestrated by members of the chemokine family <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Chemokines are a family of proteins characterised by a conserved cysteine motif and the large chemokine family is subdivided according to cysteine distribution into CC, CXC, XC and CX3C subfamilies. Chemokines act through G-protein-coupled receptors to direct cell migration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Monocyte mobilisation and recruitment is predominantly regulated by the CC receptor 2 (CCR2), and CX3C receptor 1 (CX3CR1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In addition to signalling chemokine receptors, there is a subfamily of atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs), that lack classical signalling responses to their ligands <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. ACKR2 is a promiscuous scavenger receptor which binds, internalises and targets inflammatory CC-chemokines for degradation within the cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. By modulating the availability of chemokines, ACKRs can regulate chemokine gradients and alter cell recruitment and activation. Together, signalling chemokine receptors and ACKRs coordinate leukocyte migration within the tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">We, and others, have demonstrated an essential role for ACKR2 in resolving CC-chemokine driven inflammatory responses and in controlling the development of inflammation dependent cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, we have demonstrated that ACKR2 plays key roles in development, scavenging chemokines in the placenta, embryonic skin, and the pubertal mammary gland <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In embryonic skin, ACKR2 is expressed by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and scavenges CCL2 to control the proximity of CCR2-expressing macrophages to developing vessels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. In the developing mammary gland, ACKR2 is expressed by fibroblasts and scavenges CCL7 to control CCR1-expressing macrophages and epithelial branching <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Eosinophils are granulocytic immune cells derived from haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the bone marrow <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. They are classically associated with the immune response in allergy or parasitic infection, but more recently, their roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis and shaping development in the thymus have been identified <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Here we report a previously unknown role for eosinophils in educating monocytes within the bone marrow, indirectly controlled by the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2. We demonstrate that in the absence of ACKR2 scavenging, the concentration of CCL11, a ligand shared with the dominant eosinophil chemokine receptor CCR3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, is increased. We show that elevated eosinophil egress from the bone marrow to the blood in ACKR2-/- mice, results in reduced eosinophil/monocyte interactions within the bone marrow niche, and changes in monocyte gene expression. Monocytes from ACKR2-/- mice are recruited to the tissues but are fundamentally altered in their ability to differentiate into macrophages. Furthermore, in the absence of ACKR2, bacterial killing is impaired during peritoneal infection. Our data therefore demonstrate that ACKR2 is a key regulator of eosinophil-driven monocyte education in the bone marrow, which is required for full monocyte differentiation and ultimately macrophage function during infection.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Macrophage numbers are decreased in the peritoneal cavity, cavity wall and lungs of ACKR2-/- mice</title><p id="P6">In the peritoneal cavity, there are two main macrophage populations, small peritoneal macrophages (SPMs) which differentiate from CCR2 expressing Ly6C high monocytes, and resident large peritoneal macrophages (LPMs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. These populations were identified using the flow cytometry gating strategy shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>. In the absence of ACKR2, the number of SPMs were reduced in the peritoneal fluid and the cavity wall of 8 week old female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). We saw the same reduction in female mice of different ages, 4 and 12 weeks, and in male 8 week old mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). There was no effect on the number of resident LPMs in ACKR2-/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). Upon depletion using clodronate liposomes, SPMs were replaced in WT mice but remained at lower levels in ACKR2-/- mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). Together these data suggest that the SPM defect in the ACKR2-/- peritoneal cavity is stable and recapitulated following replenishment of the macrophage population.</p><p id="P7">In the lung, there are resident alveolar macrophages, and diverse populations of recruited interstitial macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrate that in the absence of ACKR2, there was again no difference in resident macrophages, but there were reduced numbers of the monocyte derived MHCII negative interstitial macrophage population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, gated as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). No differences were observed in macrophages from the pleural cavity, spleen, omentum, skin, or bone marrow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Importantly, in the absence of ACKR2, the number of monocytes were unchanged in peritoneal fluid but modestly reduced in the peritoneal cavity wall. Monocyte numbers remained unchanged in all other tissues investigated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Peritoneal immune response is impaired in ACKR2-/- mice during <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> infection</title><p id="P8">Next, we investigated whether reduced macrophage numbers as a result of ACKR2 deficiency had functional consequences during peritoneal infection with <italic>E.coli</italic>. Mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p) with 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> colony forming units (CFU) of the uropathogenic isolate CFT2073. Weight loss was comparable between WT and ACKR2-/- animals 18h after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). However, the number of bacteria was increased in the peritoneal fluid and spleen of ACKR2-/- mice indicating that bacterial elimination was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2bi-ii</xref>). Bacterial burden was unchanged in the peritoneal cavity wall and liver during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2biiii-iv</xref>). In the absence of ACKR2, there was increased recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes to the peritoneal cavity during infection, consistent with the increased bacterial burden observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2ci-ii</xref>). The formation of mesothelia-bound multilayered cellular aggregates is an important component of bacterial elimination during peritoneal infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Here, we see the characteristic macrophage disappearance/ adherence reaction 18h after infection in WT and ACKR2-/- mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, with a reduction in both SPMs and LPMs in the peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2ciii-iv</xref>). However, in ACKR2-/- mice, increased numbers of SPMs and LPMs remain within the peritoneal cavity during infection, compared with WT, suggesting that the adherence reaction is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2ciii-iv</xref>). In the peritoneal wall there is no change in SPM number between WT and ACKR2-/- mice during infection. However there are reduced numbers of LPMs in the wall of ACKR2-/- mice during infection, suggesting that the adherence reaction has been diminished, which may contribute to insufficient bacterial clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2dii</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Next, we looked at the ability of macrophages to phagocytose pHRODO <italic>E.coli</italic> particles (ECP), which detect acidification after uptake. When particles are destroyed within the cell, fluorescent signal is no longer detected. Initially, we challenged WT and ACKR2-/- mice i.p with 200 μg of ECP. We found no difference in the percentage of peritoneal macrophages which phagocytosed particles 1h and 18h post challenge, indicating there was no defect in initial binding or uptake <italic>in vivo</italic> between WT and ACKR2-/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2ei, iv</xref>). When we investigated the total number of macrophages which had phagocytosed particles, we found fewer ECP+ macrophages after 1 h in ACKR2-/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2eii, v</xref>), likely due to decreased levels of SPMs in the peritoneal cavity, prior to infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1aii</xref>). Later, we detected increased numbers of ECP+ macrophages in ACKR2-/- mice, suggesting that 18h after challenge, destruction of the particles is impeded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2eiii, vi</xref>). To study particle uptake without the macrophage disappearance/adherence reaction, we also carried out ECP challenge of all cells within the peritoneal lavage in <italic>vitro</italic>. We observed no change in the percentage of ECP+ macrophages after 1 h, but an increased proportion of ECP+ macrophages after 18h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2fi-ii</xref>), further suggesting that while binding and initial uptake are unaffected, breakdown of pHRODO particles is reduced in the macrophages from ACKR2-/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). We also generated bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) from WT and ACKR2-/- mice and challenged with ECP <italic>in vitro</italic>. There was an increased percentage of ECP+ macrophages in BMDMs from ACKR2-/- mice, revealing the destruction of particles is again impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2fiii</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>ACKR2 has no detectable effect on chemokine levels in the peritoneal cavity</title><p id="P10">Next, we investigated the expression of ACKR2 by cells in the peritoneal cavity. ACKR2 expression has previously been demonstrated on peritoneal B1 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. As ACKR2 antibodies are known to be unreliable, we employed our well validated, functional chemokine uptake assay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Uptake of AF647 labelled ligand, CCL22, by peritoneal lavage cells, was compared between WT and ACKR2-/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). We confirmed that ACKR2 is expressed by B1 cell subsets, B1a, b, c and d, in the peritoneal cavity using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> CCL22 uptake assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). ACKR2 expression by macrophages in the peritoneal cavity was not detected using the CCL22 uptake assay (data not shown). ACKR2 expression in the peritoneal cavity wall was detected using RNAscope <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. ACKR2 expression was co-localized with Lyve-1+ stromal cells, indicating that ACKR2 is expressed by LECs in the cavity wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>). Expression of ACKR2 by LECs in other tissues has been extensively characterized <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">Next, we looked at the effect of ACKR2 deficiency on ACKR2 ligands. We carried out Luminex protein analysis of supernatants from peritoneal lavage, and lysates from total peritoneal cells and the peritoneal cavity wall. Surprisingly, in the absence of ACKR2 we were unable to detect any defect in scavenging of any of the ACKR2 ligands investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). We found a decrease in CCL2 in the peritoneal lavage of ACKR2-/- mice, likely caused by decreased numbers of SPMs in the peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1aii</xref>). Similarly, 18h after challenge with live <italic>E.coli</italic> or ECP, there are notable changes in ACKR2 ligands such as CCL3, CCL5, CCL12 and CCL22 but there was no defect observed in scavenging by ACKR2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). These data imply that the SPM defect in ACKR2-/- mice relates to mechanisms operating outside the peritoneal cavity.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Monocyte differentiation into macrophages is reduced in ACKR2-/- mice</title><p id="P12">As we were unable to detect local effects of ACKR2 scavenging in the peritoneal cavity, or a reduction in monocyte numbers, we next investigated whether the reduced number of macrophages in the naïve ACKR2-/- peritoneal cavity was due to altered differentiation from monocytes. We investigated the ability of bone marrow monocytes from WT and ACKR2-/- mice to differentiate into macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic>, by adoptively transferring either CD45.1 or CD45.2 monocytes, and tracking differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4ai</xref>). To assess the ability of monocytes from WT mice to differentiate into SPMs in an ACKR2 deficient environment, we injected WT (CD45.1) monocytes i.p into either WT (CD45.2) or ACKR2-/- (CD45.2) mice. Monocytes isolated from WT mice were fully able to differentiate in the ACKR2-/- peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4aii</xref>). Next, we looked at the ability of monocytes from WT (CD45.2) or ACKR2-/- (CD45.2) mice to differentiate into SPMs in a WT (CD45.1) environment. We found that monocytes from ACKR2-/- mice were less able to differentiate into SPMs, irrespective of being within a WT environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4aiii</xref>). Again, these data point to a monocyte/macrophage-autonomous dysfunction, rather than a peritoneal dysfunction, underlying the observed phenotype.</p><p id="P13">We next studied the ability of monocytes from WT and ACKR2-/- bone marrow to differentiate <italic>in vitro</italic>. In unstimulated BMDMs generated from ACKR2-/- mice, we observed a decreased proportion which express MHCII compared with WT, after 6 d in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4bii</xref>). Upon stimulation, BMDMs from WT and ACKR2-/- mice had equivalent levels of CD80 expression, the classical activation marker, in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4ci</xref>). However, we observed diminished CD206 expression by macrophages generated from ACKR2-/- bone marrow, at rest or in response to LPS or IL-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 cii</xref>). Notably, we also observed lower CD206 expression in the key populations in naïve adult ACKR2-/- mice i.e. SPMs and MHCII negative interstitial macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Monocytes and macrophages are transcriptionally distinct in the absence of ACKR2</title><p id="P14">RNA sequencing of FACS sorted monocytes from the bone marrow, gated as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>, was carried out to investigate whether ACKR2 deficiency leads to fundamental transcriptional differences in monocyte development. Transcriptional analysis revealed substantial changes in monocytes from ACKR2-/- mice, with 113 genes upregulated and 39 downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). Pathway analysis revealed a number of changes associated with the NFKB1 pathway, including reduced TGFB1, which is known to play an important role in alternative macrophage activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5aiii</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

We also carried out RNA sequencing of FACS sorted SPMs from the peritoneal cavity of WT and ACKR2-/- mice. In mature macrophages, ACKR2 deficiency led to limited but distinct transcriptional changes. 16 upregulated and 15 downregulated genes were identified in SPMs from ACKR2-/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5bi</xref>).

CCL22 uptake was increased in WT, compared with ACKR2-/- CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages, and B1b cells, indicating ACKR2 expression by these cell types in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>). A previous study showed transcription of ACKR2 by HSC progenitors in the bone marrow <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, our functional uptake assay does not show ACKR2 expression by LSK or CMP cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). Luminex analysis of bone marrow cell lysates and plasma from WT and ACKR2-/- mice, revealed increased levels of the ACKR2 ligand, and eosinophil chemoattractant, CCL11, suggesting that ACKR2 actively scavenges this chemokine in bone marrow and/or blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6bi-ii</xref>). Flow cytometry revealed that in the absence of ACKR2 scavenging, the number of eosinophils was reduced in the bone marrow and increased in the blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6ci-ii</xref>). This is consistent with deficient scavenging of CCL11 in ACKR2-/- mice, leading to increased egress of eosinophils, from the bone marrow to the blood. It has been established previously that CCL11 mobilises eosinophils within the bone marrow to enter the blood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. We also demonstrated that increased CCL11 in the bloodstream leads to eosinophil egress from the bone marrow, by injecting 1 μg CCL11 intravenously (i.v) into WT mice, and measuring levels of eosinophils in the blood and bone marrow after 2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>). Notably, during <italic>E.coli</italic> infection, the number of eosinophils within the bone marrow increased in WT mice, suggesting an important role for eosinophils in anti-bacterial immunity. In the absence of ACKR2, eosinophils do not accumulate in the bone marrow during infection, likely due to increased eosinophil egress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Eosinophils promote monocyte to macrophage differentiation</title><p id="P16">We have shown that eosinophil retention in the bone marrow is ACKR2 dependent, via scavenging of CCL11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).

Here we describe, a previously unknown role for eosinophils, classically known as mediators of type 2 immunity, in educating monocytes within the bone marrow, prior to recruitment into tissues.</p><p id="P19">We demonstrate a novel interaction between eosinophils and monocytes in the bone marrow, indirectly controlled by the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2. ACKR2 regulates eosinophils within the bone marrow by scavenging CCL11, a ligand shared with the dominant eosinophil chemokine receptor CCR3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. CCL11 is a potent chemoattractant for eosinophils, and its role in the mobilisation of eosinophils from the bone marrow to the blood, has long been known <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. In the absence of ACKR2, CCL11 is not scavenged in the bone marrow or the blood, and increased eosinophil egress is observed. As a result of this, eosinophils and monocytes interact less within the bone marrow, leading to changes in monocyte gene expression. Monocytes from ACKR2-/- mice are able to travel to the tissues in equivalent numbers, but their ability to differentiate into macrophages is fundamentally altered, in the lung, peritoneal cavity and peritoneal wall. This mechanism has been illustrated as a schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>. In this study, we did not observe changes in any of the other tissues we investigated, such as the skin, omentum, or the spleen. Surprisingly, we also did not observe any reduction in pleural cavity SPMs, which are similar to peritoneal SPMs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, suggesting that these cells have an altered differentiation pathway. Importantly, BMDMs generated from ACKR2-/- mice exhibit the key differences observed in tissue specific macrophages, such as reduced MHCII expression, impaired breakdown of pHRODO <italic>E.coli</italic> particles, and diminished CD206 expression. This suggests that the effect on monocyte derived macrophages observed in ACKR2-/- mice at rest is stable ex <italic>vivo</italic> and may not be limited to the peritoneal cavity and lung.</p><p id="P20">Reduced differentiation of monocytes to macrophages in the peritoneal cavity of ACKR2-/- mice has clear functional implications, exemplified by increased bacterial load in the peritoneal cavity during infection. Our transcriptional analysis of SPMs revealed highly specific gene changes, which may contribute to the reduced functionality of macrophages from ACKR2-/- mice during peritoneal infection. SPMs from ACKR2-/- mice have reduced transcription of CTSE and Chil1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5bi</xref>). CTSE-/- macrophages have decreased bacteriocidal activity, and CTSE-/- mice are highly susceptible to infection with <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Similarly, Chil1-/- mice are more susceptible to <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Additionally, the formation of cellular aggregates of resident macrophages and mesothelia within the peritoneum is important for bacterial killing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Here, we observed reduced numbers of resident macrophages in the wall of ACKR2-/- mice during infection, which may contribute to insufficient bacterial elimination. ACKR2 has previously been shown to be important during infection with <italic>Mycobaterium tuberculosis</italic>, attributed to increased chemokine and cytokine production in ACKR2-/- mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Here we reveal a lung macrophage defect in ACKR2-/- mice, which may have contributed to increased pathology. In a caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis model there is also evidence of a protective role of ACKR2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">Previously, expression of ACKR2 by osteoclasts and osteoblasts has been demonstrated during bone remodeling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Here we show for the first time, ACKR2 expression by macrophages and B1b cells in the bone marrow, at rest. Previously, ACKR2 expression has mainly been identified in stromal populations, such as LECs and fibroblasts, throughout the body, or by peritoneal B1 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Notably, several human GWAS studies have revealed SNPs in the ACKR2 gene, which are associated with monocyte (rs2228467, rs1366045, rs136046, rs219224, and rs2228468) and eosinophil counts (rs2228467, rs7433284, rs9872570), lending further support to the idea that ACKR2 plays an important role in controlling human monocyte and eosinophil interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">Several studies have revealed a role for eosinophils in polarizing macrophages towards an M2 or alternatively activated phenotype <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. The transfer of eosinophils during collagen induced arthritis increased the proportion of CD163+ macrophages and TGF-β production in arthritic joints <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. In adipose tissue, alternative macrophage activation was impaired in the absence of eosinophils <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Here, we show that eosinophils and monocytes are located in close proximity within the bone marrow, and eosinophils transcriptionally alter monocytes, which is necessary for full CD206 expression in response to stimulation with IL-4. We also provide a novel ACKR2-dependent control mechanism through CCL11 scavenging. Notably, co-culture of eosinophils and monocytes was sufficient to recapitulate transcriptional changes observed in ACKR2-/- monocytes. We have shown that this process does not require direct contact between the cell types, which suggests that secreted factors or degranulation products may mediate the effect. Future work will be important to determine the nature of the factor(s) responsible. During bacterial infection, we observed an increase in eosinophils within the WT but not ACKR2-/- bone marrow. Taken together with the increased bacterial load in ACKR2-/- mice, eosinophil/monocyte interactions appear to represent a key component of the anti-bacterial immune response.</p><p id="P23">Thus, ACKR2 is a key regulator of eosinophil-driven monocyte education in the bone marrow which is required for full monocyte differentiation and macrophage function within the tissues.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Study design</title><p id="P24">The objective of this study was to reveal how ACKR2 regulated the numbers of macrophages in different tissues, and the response to bacterial infection.
