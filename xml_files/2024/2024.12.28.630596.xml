TLMs express multiple inhibitory receptors and lack response to soluble antigens. However, their origin and the mechanisms driving their expansion in HIV infection remain unclear. By using bulk BCR sequencing of memory B cell subsets from elite HIV controllers and an ART-controlled cohort, we revealed that TLMs (CD21<sup>-</sup> CD27<sup>-</sup> B cells) were significantly less mutated but also less diverse than other MBCs, suggesting an enrichment for innate-like B cells or that they belong to a less mature subset. Subsequent detailed multi-omics study of an immune response in an elite controller to a transient HIV viraemia demonstrated a functional increase in Env-reactive IgG and MBCs with non-TLM phenotype. Single-cell RNA/BCR sequencing of PMBCs enriched for B cells revealed an orchestrated TNF-alpha response followed by interferon alpha and gamma response across all B cells subsets. We noted an emergence of innate-like extrafollicular PLD4+ plasmablasts and previously undepreciated heterogeneity of a stable TLM population. We identified two distinct TLM subsets: TLM1 (T-bet<sup>low</sup>) and TLM2 (T-bet<sup>hi</sup>) that differed in their differentiation stage, isotype use and mutational burden. Surprisingly, both subsets (TLM1 more than TLM2) were enriched for IGHV4-34 segment use (associated with self-reactivity) and displayed a persistent activation and BCR signalling signature, indicating (with other BCR indices) a strong presence of innate-like B cells. However, pseudotime analyses revealed that TLMs contained not only innate-like B cells but also cells from the conventional memory B cell lineages, further highlighting the complexity of the whole TLM compartment. This study provides a new insight into multifaceted functional B-cell response to transient HIV viraemia as likely happens during the early phase of anti-retroviral therapy cessation, highlighting the TLM heterogeneity and the contribution of innate-like B cells which might have important clinical implications for anti-HIV vaccine and therapy design.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">B cell dysfunction in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH) has been widely described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Moir and Fauci 2009</xref>) and is associated with suboptimal B cell responses to both infection and vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Malaspina, Moir et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Titanji, De Milito et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Touizer, Alrubayyi et al. 2023</xref>). Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) has proven effective in reducing the viral load in PLWH to undetectable levels and generally restores CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts, B cell homeostasis is never fully restored even in those who have maintained ART and supressed viral loads for multiple years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Morris, Binley et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Moir, Buckner et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pensieroso, Galli et al. 2013</xref>). Some of the key changes associated with HIV-mediated B cell dysfunction include hypergammaglobulinemia and the dysregulation of certain B cell subsets, including increased numbers of immature transitional B cells, activated memory B cells, tissue-like memory B cells (TLMs) and plasmablasts, whilst resting memory B cell numbers are typically reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Moir and Fauci 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P3">TLMs were first described in 2008 by Moir et al. and can account for &gt;50% of the memory B cell population in untreated chronic HIV infection compared to ~5% in HIV-negative individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Moir, Ho et al. 2008</xref>). Their name refers to their enriched expression of surface FcRL4, similar to the tissue B cell population previously identified in human tonsils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ehrhardt, Hsu et al. 2005</xref>). TLMs lack expression of the typical memory B cell markers CD21 and CD27 and are CD10<sup>-</sup> CD19<sup>Hi</sup> CD20<sup>Hi</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Moir, Ho et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Muellenbeck, Ueberheide et al. 2013</xref>). They have also been shown to be enriched for expression of the Th1-associated transcription factor T-bet and the integrin CD11c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Moir, Ho et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Knox, Buggert et al. 2017</xref>). However, the most defining feature of this subset is their high expression of a variety of inhibitory receptors (alongside FcRL4), including CD22, CD85j and CD72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Moir, Ho et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Knox, Buggert et al. 2017</xref>). Further, TLMs typically display a chemokine receptor profile suggestive of homing to sites of inflammation, with increased expression of CXCR3 and CCR6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Moir, Ho et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Knox, Buggert et al. 2017</xref>). Functional analysis of TLMs initially indicated that they were significantly less responsive to soluble stimuli and appeared to have undergone fewer rounds of proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to classical memory B cells, resulting in the hypothesis that these were an exhausted B cell subset driven by chronic antigen exposure during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Moir, Ho et al. 2008</xref>). This hypothesis was further supported by the evidence that a knockdown of inhibitory receptor expression (including FCRL4, SIGLEC6 and CD85J) on these subsets using siRNA could partially restore the ability of TLMs to respond to soluble stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kardava, Moir et al. 2011</xref>). However, recent data has suggested that TLMs can respond to complex antigens, suggesting they may not be as functionally inert as first thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ambegaonkar, Kwak et al. 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Expanded populations analogous to TLMs have been described in various other chronic inflammatory settings, such as Hepatitis B infection, Malaria infection, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Portugal, Tipton et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Burton, Pallett et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jenks, Cashman et al. 2020</xref>). Although a different label is used for this B cell subset in each of these conditions (e.g., “atypical” B cells in malaria or “double negative” B cells in SLE), the cells appear to share several hallmark characteristics, including the expression of inhibitory receptors, T-bet and a CD21<sup>lo</sup> memory B cell phenotype. Malaria-associated atypical memory B cells are amongst the most studied, they expand during chronic infection forming up to 51% of total mature circulating B cells. Extensive scRNA sequencing analysis on TLM, atypical and DN cells from HIV, Malaria and SLE respectively, revealed remarkably similar transcriptional profiles for these clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Holla, Dizon et al. 2021</xref>). Overall, this suggests that there is a potential common mechanism behind the induction and expansion of these cells during chronic inflammation arising from different disease states.</p><p id="P5">To date the mechanisms driving the development of TLM/atypical B cells have not yet been fully defined. Recent data from murine models has shown that the IFN-γ dynamics associated with chronic LCMV infection can induce an epigenetically distinct B cell subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cooper, Xu et al. 2024</xref>) whilst data from individuals who acquired malaria suggested an important role for IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Obeng-Adjei, Portugal et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Ambegaonkar, Nagata et al. 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Holla, Dizon et al. 2021</xref>). In contrast, a previous study in PLWH with uncontrolled viraemia, found the majority of HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env)-reactive memory B cells were T-bet<sup>+</sup>, a marker which has been linked to TLMs, suggesting that there may be a role for antigen-driven effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Moir, Ho et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kardava, Moir et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Knox, Buggert et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Burton, Pallett et al. 2018</xref>). However, as TLMs can account for ~50% of the class-switched memory B cell population during chronic HIV infection and antigen-specific &lt;1% it is likely that generic inflammatory stimuli are involved in the induction of TLMs irrespective of their antigen specificity.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we explored the mechanisms underlying B-cell dysfunction in chronic HIV infection, focusing on TLM B cells, which are associated with inhibitory receptor expression and impaired antigen responsiveness. Using bulk B-cell receptor (BCR) sequencing, we analyzed memory B-cell subsets in elite HIV controllers and individuals taking ART. Our findings revealed that TLMs in HIV, characterized by a CD21-CD27- phenotype, exhibit reduced mutational complexity and diversity compared to other memory B cells, suggesting an enrichment of innate-like or less mature cells within this population. A multi-omics investigation of an elite controller during an episode of transient HIV viraemia, that models early viral outgrowth such as occurs after ART interruption, uncovered dynamic immune responses. These included the emergence of non-TLM Env-reactive memory B cells, IgG targeting the HIV Env protein, and activation signatures across B-cell subsets. Single-cell analyses highlighted TLM heterogeneity, identifying two distinct subsets (TLM1 and TLM2) with varying differentiation states, IGHV4-34 usage, and mutational burdens. Additionally, pseudotime analyses suggested that TLMs comprise both innate-like and conventional memory B cells, underscoring their complexity. These findings provide novel insights into B-cell responses during HIV infection, with potential implications for vaccine and therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>TLMs are significantly less diverse and mutated than other MBC subsets in PLWH</title><p id="P7">We first sought to understand if TLMs may be blocked in their ability to undergo antigen-driven evolution of their BCRs. We selected a variety of PLWH (with or without concurrent ART), including those in an elite control cohort and phenotyped their circulating B cells by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1 supplement</xref>). There was inter-donor variation irrespective of whether the donors were in the ART or the Elite control group. However, the majority of memory B cells were consistently of a resting memory B cell phenotype and there was no obvious enrichment for a particular memory B cell subset within one group. To capture the inter-donor variability observed across both groups, we randomly selected five donors (two from the ART control group and three from the elite control group) and bulk-sorted resting (CD21<sup>HI</sup>CD27<sup>HI</sup>), activated (CD21<sup>HI</sup>CD27<sup>LO</sup>) and TLM (CD21<sup>LO</sup>CD27<sup>LO</sup>) MBCs based on their isotype (IgG versus IgM). These cells then underwent bulk BCR sequencing to assess their BCR affinity maturation, diversity and evolution. We observed that resting IgG MBCs were significantly more diverse than the other subsets, and that the diversity of IgG TLM and activated MBCs was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). A similar trend was observed for IgM MBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>), however this was not found to be statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05) and may reflect their wider responsiveness to a range of antigens and distinct temporal germinal centre outputs.</p><p id="P8">Next, we sought to ascertain the mutational burden of these BCR sequences across MBC subsets. Firstly, the V<sub>H</sub> mutation percentage was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). In accordance with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Meffre, Louie et al. 2016</xref>), TLMs were significantly less mutated than the other MBC subsets (p = 4.86×10<sup>-20</sup>, p = 4.45×10<sup>-20</sup>, p = 8.16×10<sup>-9</sup>, p = 2.76×10<sup>-4</sup> for IgG activated vs TLM, IgG resting vs TLM, IgM activated vs TLM, and IgM resting vs TLM respectively). This may suggest that TLMs are less able to undergo antigen-driven activation and BCR mutation. To further characterise the mutation landscape of these cells, the proportion of unique (<italic>de novo</italic>) AA mutations between and within each subset was compared. The median unique mutation frequency was calculated per MBC subset for each lineage, and the mean average was taken per donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). This data illustrates that mutation sharing is significantly greater between TLMs than between other subsets and suggests that they are less able to undergo continued BCR diversification than other MBC subsets since they contain fewer unique mutations overall.</p><p id="P9">Next, directed phylogenetic networks were created to better understand the evolutionary trajectories of the different MBC subsets. These networks allow evaluation of evolutionary importance of each node (cell) using the hub score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>) and the out-degree to in-degree ratio (degree ratio; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F</xref>). The hub score estimates the value of each node’s connections to other nodes within the network, i.e., the score is higher if a cell connects to another cell that is highly connected. We observed significantly lower hub scores for TLMs than other subsets, regardless of isotype (IgG; Activated p = 5.5×10<sup>-7</sup>; Resting p = 7.1×10<sup>-5</sup>, IgM; Activated p = 2.3×10<sup>-7</sup>, Resting p = 4.4×10<sup>-6</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>). This illustrates that TLM are less able to undergo continued BCR evolution than other subsets. Similarly, the degree ratios (ratio of outgoing connections divided by incoming connections) were significantly lower for TLMs across both isotypes than the other subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F</xref>, IgG; Activated p = 0.0011; Resting p = 0.0308, IgM; Activated p = 0.0147, Resting p = 0.0005). Taken together, TLMs contained significantly fewer mutations, were less diverse, and were less well connected in each B cell network. Such data suggests that TLMs could be subject to additional activation/maturation controls as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ambegaonkar, Kwak et al. 2020</xref>), a precursor population to other subsets, or produced via extrafollicular responses that undergo weaker affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Elsner and Shlomchik 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Minor transient spike in HIV viraemia triggers a potent antibody response with expanded neutralisation breadth</title><p id="P10">Our BCR analysis of MBCs from PLWH showed that the TLM subset may have impaired capacity for BCR mutation and diversification. To address how and when TLMs arise, we focussed further study on one donor where elite HIV control was interrupted by a transient viral load and where longitudinal samples (pre-, during and post viral blip) were available. Access to such timepoints allowed us to gain a unique insight into B cell dynamics during a relatively acute and low viral blip as may be seen during ART cessation. This ART naïve individual (referred to as “index participant”) had a low/undetectable viral load (&lt;50 copies/mL) at the time of recruitment to the elite controller cohort (month 0 – Pre Blip) in October 2013. However, when sampled at month 41 a viral load of 603 copies/mL was detected (Blip). This viral blip was associated with a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell count decrease from 950 cells/μL to 650 cells/μL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). Following the viral blip CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts remained largely stable through to month 65, although they never fully recovered to the pre-blip levels. Similarly, the viral load returned to low levels of ~100 copies/mL at month 52 (Post Blip).</p><p id="P11">Analysis of the integrated HIV <italic>envelope (env)</italic> gene sequences by single genome amplification (SGA) from genomic DNA revealed a high degree of sequence variation within the index participant across pre-blip, blip and post-blip timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). While certain branches of the phylogenetic tree were enriched with sequences from specific time points, the sequences from the post-blip time point were dispersed throughout the tree, suggesting limited selective pressure across the assessed timepoints. Interestingly, in contrast to diverse <italic>env</italic> sequences from the viral blip (index participant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>), as anticipated sequences recovered from a different PLWH who was on ART (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>) were largely clonal, likely driven by the proliferation of infected T cell clones rather than viral outgrowth and diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bozzi, Simonetti et al. 2019</xref>). Of note, the sequence diversity of the index participant viral quasi-species during the Blip may have been underestimated because of the limited RNA recovery at low viral load (&lt;1,000 copies/mL).</p><p id="P12">To profile the B cell response to the viral blip we first determined the anti-Env plasma IgG titre. Env is the only viral antigen exposed on the surface of the HIV virion and is thus the major target for the B-cell mediated antibody response, including neutralising antibodies against HIV that are the goal of many HIV vaccine candidates. Three <italic>env</italic> sequences representative of the sequence variation and glycosylation features present in the index participant were selected, cloned and expressed as stabilised soluble recombinant proteins (1A3, 1D5 and 2E4) by utilising SOSIP mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sanders, Derking et al. 2013</xref>). The stabilised Env proteins were used to quantify the autologous anti-Env IgG titre and compared with the binding response against two non-autologous Env SOSIP proteins: BG505 N332 (Clade A) and B41 (Clade B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sanders, Derking et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Pugach, Ozorowski et al. 2015</xref>). Strikingly, the anti-Env IgG response of the index participant rose to &gt;1 mg/mL at the viral blip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>). As expected, the titre against autologous Env proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>) was higher than that against heterologous proteins and no response was observed in HIV-negative control plasma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig 2 Supplement A</xref>). Interestingly, the IgG titre against the heterologous proteins peaked at the viral blip, suggesting that the small viral load increase was capable of boosting both the autologous and heterologous IgG titre.</p><p id="P13">Subsequently, plasma neutralisation was assessed using a pseudovirus assay as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Sarzotti-Kelsoe, Bailer et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gupta, Abdul-Jawad et al. 2019</xref>). The inhibitory dilution 50 (ID<sub>50</sub>) values highlight that plasma neutralisation was broadest and most potent against autologous pseudoviruses at the viral blip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>), in line with the ELISA readings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>). This is in contrast to weaker and less broad responses at the pre blip and post blip timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>). Interestingly, the viral blip timepoint plasma was unique in neutralising a heterologous pseudovirus; B41, albeit at a low level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig 2 Supplement A</xref>). Overall, the neutralisation profile of the index participant appeared to be the weakest in terms of breadth and potency against autologous pseudoviruses prior to the viral blip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>), followed by a ~5-10 fold increase in potency and increased breadth associated with the viral blip, before the response appears to partially return to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Taken together, these data show that in an elite controller, even a minor spike in viral load (603 copies/mL) can induce a potent but short-lived neutralising plasma antibody response against HIV. This makes the index participant a suitable case for studying B cell response to HIV viraemia, including TLM development with particular relevance in the acute setting of ART cessation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Transient viral blip induces expansion of Env-reactive IgG<sup>+</sup> memory B cells</title><p id="P15">After characterising the humoral response to this minor viral blip, we next examined potential changes in the MBC compartment. We used fluorochrome-tagged autologous 1A3 and 1D5 recombinant Env proteins to detect antigen-specific memory B cell at the blip and post-blip timepoints. Unfortunately, limited PBMC availability precluded such analysis in the pre-blip sample. Env<sup>+</sup> IgG+ MBCs formed almost 1% of MBCs at the blip timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A-B</xref>). However, this population proportion contracted by 75% at the post-blip timepoint as the index participant regained viral control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), mirroring our ELISA and neutralisation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E-F</xref>). Surprisingly, the flow-cytometric phenotyping of all IgG<sup>+</sup> memory and Env<sup>+</sup> IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells at both timepoints demonstrated a marked similarity to an HIV-negative donor MBC phenotype and not a donor with chronic viraemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>), with resting subset representing &gt;75% and TLM &lt; 10% of MBCs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Although there was no enrichment of TLM cells in the Env<sup>+</sup> subset as has been previously reported for PLWH with high chronic viraemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Meffre, Louie et al. 2016</xref>), we did observe a more than doubling of the activated Env<sup>+</sup> subset proportion compared to activated cells in the Env<sup>-</sup> subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Moir, Malaspina et al. 2008</xref>). As expected, the donor with chronically high HIV viraemia had a clear expansion of TLMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Next, we used FACS to isolate IgG+ cells from all three memory subsets (resting, activated and TLM) and also Env-reactive IgG+ MBCs for single-cell RNA/BCR sequencing to assess their transcriptomic similarity. UMAP clustering showed TLM as a distinct population, whereas there was a significant overlap between the resting and activated MBC subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>). Interestingly, the Env reactive cells largely clustered with the resting and activated subsets but not TLMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>), mirroring their flow-cytometry phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). TLM population identity/annotation was confirmed by their expression of bona fide TLM marker genes such as FCRL5 and ITGAX and low expression of CD27 when compared to the resting and activated subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3E</xref>). We subsequently used the automated annotation tool Celltypist to quantify the transcriptional similarity of the Env-reactive cells to MBC subsets. This confirmed that the vast majority of Env-reactive cells were transcriptionally most similar to resting memory B cells, with only a small proportion of cells resembling TLMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3F</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Finally, we compared the differences in the use of IgG subclasses and levels of SHM among MBCs. In line with our earlier data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>), TLM cells have significantly lower levels of SHM than resting and activated memory B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3H</xref>). TLM cells also displayed decreased usage of downstream IgG subclasses such as IgG2 and IgG4, suggesting a less mature or more innate-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3G</xref>). Again, Env-reactive MBCs had a BCR profile (SHM, IgG subclasses) more similar to resting/activated memory B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3G, H</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Overall, these data confirm that the viral blip was accompanied by an expansion of activated Env-reactive IgG memory B cells. However, this discrete viral blip was not large enough to induce the global memory B cell dysfunction typically associated with chronic HIV viraemia nor dysfunction within Env-reactive memory B cells. Instead, the antigen-specific memory B cells observed (presumably precursors of anti-Env antibody-secreting cells) resembled resting/activated memory B cells both phenotypically and transcriptionally. Although TLM cells were present, their frequency was significantly lower than in chronically infected individuals and more in keeping with healthy (uninfected) donors.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Transient viral blip induces a complex response across both B- and non-B cell immune subsets</title><p id="P19">To examine the transcriptomic changes in the whole B-cell and non-B-cell immune compartment of the elite controller across all three time points in an unbiased approach, we performed single-cell RNA/BCR sequencing of MACS-selected circulating B cells spiked with all PBMCs at 3:1 ratio (favouring B cells). This generated total 48,602 single-cell transcriptomes (post-QC) with 13 distinct cellular clusters identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 4A-C and E</xref>).

This was unexpected as increased viral load typically correlates with decreased helper T cells due to their direct destruction by the HIV-1 virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">McCune 2001</xref>). However, it is plausible that the relatively minor viral blip was sufficient to stimulate helper T cells expansion without causing their widespread depletion. Interestingly, in the post-blip phase, we observed a marked expansion of cytotoxic T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) that likely played a dominant role in regaining viral control.</p><p id="P21">In the B cell compartment, we annotated eight distinct cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>) based on their marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>) and CITE-seq panel expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>): Naive1, Naive2, PLD4+ plasmablasts, TLM1, TLM2, IgM memory, switched memory, and plasma cells. Notably, we identified two distinct TLM populations, both expressing canonical TLM markers although with a different intensity. TLM2 cells had higher expression of ITGAX, TBX21 (T-bet), LILRB1, and CD86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). A similar expression pattern was also observed at the surface protein level by CITE-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>). This suggests that TLM1 may be a precursor to the TLM2 population, which resembles previously described TLM populations more closely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Moir, Ho et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Holla, Dizon et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P22">The analysis of the changes in the B-cell compartment across timepoints revealed an increase in naïve B cells and PLD4+ plasmablasts during blip and their persistence post blip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). The emergence of PLD4+ plasmablasts may potentially explain the neutralisation observed at the viral blip timepoint. The expansion of naïve B cells during and after the viral blip may result from their enhanced generation and/or recruitment to combat the viral blip. In line with our previous flow cytometry and Smart-Seq2 data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), the proportion of TLM cells remained stable during the viral blip but contracted post-blip. However, within TLMs, TLM1 clearly expanded during the blip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>), suggesting their active role in responding to the viral blip and supporting the idea that TLM1 and TLM2 cells may have different roles.</p><p id="P23">The active coordination of antiviral immune response during the blip was further evidenced by the increased total number and strength of predicted cell-cell interactions accounting for all annotated immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4J-K</xref>). Of note, PLD4+ plasmablasts had one of the lowest number of predicted interactions at the blip timepoint, which may, together with predominant IGHM expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J</xref>) and lower levels of SMH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4K</xref>), indicate their extrafollicular differentiation pathway, allowing for a rapid anti-viral IgM response.</p><p id="P24">Similarly, TLM1 cells predominantly expressed IGHM and had lower SHM burden compared to TLM2 that were mostly switched to IgG subclasses, indicating that TLM1 cells are less mature than TLM2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J-K</xref>). However, TLM2 were in turn less mature than switched memory as evidenced by more restricted SHM. During blip and post-blip, TLMs (unlike switched memory subset) increased their proportion of unswitched cells with a small drop in median SHM, consistent with an influx of new (less mature) B cells in response to viraemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J-K</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Analysis of Hallmark gene signatures across the whole B-cell compartment across timepoints revealed a significantly enriched TNF-α signature during the blip, which declined post-blip, when an enhanced interferon-α and -γ signature emerged instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4L</xref>). This temporal signature pattern was seen across all B cell subsets, although with variable intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4M</xref>): Naïve1 subset displayed the strongest TNF-α and inflammatory response during blip, while PLD4+ plasmablasts were the top expressor of both interferon signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4M</xref>). Unexpectedly, this global blip-induced interferon response was not accompanied by the usually observed TLM expansion, for which persistent viraemia might be required. Surprisingly, TLM1 and TLM2 were the most active B-cell subset in terms of BCR signalling, activation and differentiation with only slight decrease of these signatures blip and post-blip phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4M</xref>). This persistent TLM activation state might indicate evolving early dysfunction, ultimately leading to reduced responsiveness, as documented in TLMs from chronically viraemic donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Moir, Ho et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kardava, Sohn et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ambegaonkar, Kwak et al. 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Taking together, our comprehensive unbiased single-cell data analysis elucidated dynamic changes in B-cell and non-B cell compartments in response to a transient viral blip. This viral blip induced TNF-α and subsequent interferon response in all B cell subsets, with naïve B cells and newly emerged (likely extra-follicular) PLD4+ plasmablasts being the most robust responders. Surprisingly, TLM2 cells did not expand in response to the transient viraemia but along with TLM1 cells displayed a persistently activated phenotype. Thus, this analysis emphasises the nuanced interplay between viral load and immune modulation in an elite HIV controller.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>TLM subsets are heterogenous and display innate-like B cell characteristics</title><p id="P27">To investigate the clonal relationship and potential differentiation pathway of annotated B cell subsets (in particular, TLMs) we utilised the single-cell BCR-seq data generated in the previous experiment. A principle component analysis based on VJ gene usage revealed that TLM1 cells across all three timepoints clustered together and separate from other B cell subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-B</xref>). This was driven mainly by a high use of IGHV4-34 segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>), which was also observed, albeit to a lesser extent, in the TLM2 subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). IGHV4-34 is often found in self-reactive and lymphoma B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pascual, Victor et al. 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Grillot-Courvalin, Brouet et al. 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Parr, Johnson et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Sebastian, Alcoceba et al. 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, TLM1 subset also appeared the most clonal apart from plasma cells, the analysis of which was likely less reliable given their small cell count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Overall, the high frequency of IGHV4-34 segment use, clonal appearance despite a relatively low SHM burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4K</xref>) indicates that TLM1 subset was highly enriched for innate-like B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Schickel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P28">The clonal overlap analysis showed the strongest link between TLM1 and IgM memory B cells, reaching its maximum during blip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Interestingly, TLM2 cells overlapped equally with TLM1, IgM memory and switched memory subsets, suggesting a likely heterogeneous origin of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Indeed, we observed many clones composed of cells from different B cell subsets, although individual clones seemed mostly homogenous in their isotype use (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). TLM2 cells within the clones had the highest VDJ mutation count, suggesting them as the differentiation endpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p><p id="P29">To explore the differentiation pathways of the B cell subsets further, we used the Slingshot package to infer pseudotime and developmental trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5H</xref>). We identified four distinct developmental lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>). PDL4+ plasmablasts differentiated directly from naïve B cells, which is consistent with their proposed extrafollicular origin. Interestingly, the TLM1 subset appeared to be the branching point for three district lineages (IgM memory, switched memory and TLM2). Although TLM1 formed a cluster of transcriptomically similar B cells, they are still heterogenous and poised for different differentiation pathways. These cells likely include innate-like B cells that tend to progress into TLM2, and naïve B cells differentiating into memory cells (either IgM or switched). Although switched memory B cells and TLM2 appeared as two distinct differentiation endpoints, we demonstrated earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>) that switched memory B cells can still progress into TLM2, making TLM2 the ultimate endpoint. Finally, we replicated these GEX-based pseudotime analysis findings also using BCR-seq-based pseudobulk VDJ trajectory analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p><p id="P30">In conclusion, our investigation into the origins and differentiation potential of TLM cells through BCR and 5’GEX data analysis revealed high IGHV4-34 usage, high clonality with lower SHM burden compared to memory B cells, suggesting their particular enrichment for innate-like B cells. However, both TLM subsets also contained cells from IgM memory and switched memory clones, indicating the potential for TLM1 cells to differentiate into conventional memory B cells whilst TLM2 appeared to be the final differentiation endpoint.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">Our study provides crucial insights into B cell function during HIV infection, with a particular focus on the TLMs that have been implicated in HIV-associated B-cell dysfunction. Through bulk BCR sequencing of circulating B cells from multiple PLWH, we consistently observed that TLMs exhibited significantly lower SHM burden but also lower diversity compared to other MBC subsets, indicating either an early differentiation state, a blockage in antigen-driven evolution and/or innate-like phenotype. Hence, while some TLMs may serve as precursors for more mature B cell subsets, some of these cells may be in a terminal differentiation state. We used multi-omics approaches to investigate B-cell/TLM response to HIV viraemia in a unique case of an elite controller who experienced a transient HIV viral blip and show that the TLM population is a heterogenous population with some exhibiting innate-like B cell features, some appear to be a precursor population for activated and resting memory B cells whilst some appear to be a differentiation endpoint.</p><p id="P32">We observed an increase in anti-Env IgG and associated expansion of Env-reactive IgG+ memory B cells without significant changes in the TLM abundance during the viral blip. The Env-reactive memory B cells displayed a predominantly non-TLM phenotype, clustering transcriptionally with resting and activated MBCs. This was in contrast to previous studies of chronic HIV viraemia, where Env-reactive cells were enriched for TLMs and total TLMs were suggested to contribute to overall immune dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Moir, Malaspina et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Moir, Ho et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Moir, Buckner et al. 2010</xref>). The minimal expansion of TLMs during the blip suggests that short-lived increases in viral load may not drive the generation of dysfunctional TLM as seen in chronic infection but instead support the production of functional, antigen-specific memory B cells. This finding is in line with the recent study by Cooper et al. that showed that during acute LCMV infection in mice there are more antigen-specific memory B cells and fever CD11c<sup>+</sup>Tbet<sup>+</sup> DN B cells than in chronic LCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cooper, Xu et al. 2024</xref>). They also found that prolonged exposure to high levels of type I interferon associated with viraemia induced memory B cell dysfunction via epigenetic modifications, which were reversible only in the first few week post infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cooper, Xu et al. 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P33">However, TLMs were present by classical cell surface expression markers and using sc-RNA sequencing, we identified two distinct TLM subpopulations: TLM1 and TLM2. The former were predominantly IgM-biased, less mutated and expressed inhibitory receptors at a lower level than TLM2. Pseudotime analysis suggested that TLM1 is likely a precursor population, with the potential to progress into more mature B cell states (either classical memory or TLM2). In contrast, TLM2 cells, which were predominantly IgG+, appeared to represent a terminal differentiation state. The TLM2 gene expression pattern closely resembled the expanded TLM population described previously during chronic HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Moir, Ho et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Holla, Dizon et al. 2021</xref>) and the double-negative (DN2) population found in healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Stewart, Ng et al. 2021</xref>). In both previous studies, these subsets were proposed to be the differentiation endpoints in agreement with our findings. Although this study was just in one individual the identification of multiple TLM subsets is consistent with previous observations using scRNA sequencing technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Stewart, Ng et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P34">One intriguing observation from our study was the strikingly high use of IGHV4-34 in TLM1 and to a lesser degree in TLM2 population, which is often associated with self-reactive and innate-like B cell phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Schickel, Glauzy et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Ray and Rothstein 2023</xref>). Innate-like B cells are heterogenous unconventional B cells characterised by their innate sensing, T-independent responding capacity and spontaneous production of germ-line encoded natural antibodies that play a role in first-line defence and tissue homeostasis (e.g., apoptotic cell disposal). Natural antibodies are typically of IgM isotype, self-reactive and have low mutational burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gronwall and Silverman 2014</xref>). The prime examples of innate-like B cells are marginal-zone B cells and B-1 cells, the existence of which in humans remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Suchanek and Clatworthy 2023</xref>). Innate-like B cells express negative BCR co-receptors to allow their unique tonic BCR signalling and activation pattern. Indeed, our Hallmark GSEA analysis revealed that, unlike other subsets, TLMs were in a state of persistent activation and BCR signalling across all three timepoints (highest in the pre-blip phase) suggesting an innate-like character. Hence, it is possible that this ongoing activation might be a physiological feature of innate-like TLMs rather than a sign of evolving dysfunction in this particular case which may differ in chronic infection. However, our study clearly demonstrated that TLMs contained not only innate-like B cells but also cells from the conventional memory B cell lineages, further highlighting the complexity of the whole TLM compartment.</p><p id="P35">Another B cell subset with innate-like features identified by this study were PLD4+ plasmablasts, which significantly emerged with the viral blip likely via extrafollicular route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Tull, Pitcher et al. 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Siu, Pitcher et al. 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Al-Aubodah, Aoudjit et al. 2023</xref>). PLD4 is Phospholipase D4 which is an RNA/DNA exonuclease located in endo-lysosomes of plasmocytoid dendritic cells but can be upregulated in B cells upon TLR7/9 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Yasaka, Yamazaki et al. 2023</xref>). Recently, self-reactive PLD4+ plasmablast enrichment was found in patients with SLE and were shown to phenotypically overlap with T-bet+ DN2 B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Yasaka, Yamazaki et al. 2023</xref>). Although this subset had the strongest expression of the type I interferon signature in the post blip phase and likely produced first-line IgM, its significance for regaining viraemia control and its potential for differentiation into TLM remains to be explored during chronic HIV infection.</p><p id="P36">The primary limitation of our study is that our detailed analysis was conducted in a single elite controller experiencing a transient viral blip, which limits the generalizability of our findings. However, the temporal samples from this individual did allow us to investigate the effects of an acute and small HIV viral load increase, as may happen during treatment interruption, and its impact on humoral immunity. Furthermore, while we observed key insights into B cell dynamics, the absence of sustained/increasing viraemia in our index participant prevents us from fully exploring the mechanisms driving TLM expansion and dysfunction seen in chronic untreated HIV infection. Future studies involving larger cohorts and longitudinal data will be crucial to validate these findings and explore the pathways governing TLM development under different viral load conditions. Additionally, our analysis of the viral sequences was constrained by inability to obtain viral RNA during the blip, limiting the investigation of the viral dynamics driving the humoral response. Nevertheless, our use of gDNA was supported by multiple previous studies suggesting that provirus from gDNA does reflect recent viral integration sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brodin, Zanini et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bruner, Murray et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abrahams, Joseph et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P37">Overall, our study demonstrates that TLMs generated in the context of HIV infection are a heterogeneous population significantly enriched for B cells with innate-like characteristics that are interferon not antigen driven. Two distinct TLM subsets (TLM1 and TLM2) can be distinguished: TLM1 (T-bet<sup>low</sup>) cells retain the capacity for further differentiation, whereas TLM2 (T-bet<sup>hi</sup>) cells appear to represent a terminal differentiation state. Our data suggest that such small transient increase in HIV viral load, while capable of eliciting a functional immune response (including PLD4+ plasmablasts), does not drive the expansion of dysfunctional TLMs typically associated with chronic HIV infection which potentially supports on going clinical trials using brief therapy interuptions. Understanding the tipping point between when viraemia promotes functional immune responses versus inducing the emergence of dysfunctional B cell subsets like TLMs and enhanced T cell destruction is essential for developing strategies to enhance vaccine efficacy and therapeutic interventions in chronic HIV infection. Future research should aim to elucidate the molecular signals and pathways that govern B cell differentiation and dysfunction in the context of both acute and chronic HIV infection.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Ethics/Patient information</title><p id="P38">The index participant was classified as exhibiting elite control based upon their largely stable low viral load (&lt;100 copies/mL) over 13 years whilst not on ART (patient preference) prior to the viral blip.

To gain evolutionary information, lineages containing multiple MBC subsets were first identified and phylogenetic trees estimated using IgPhyML. From these trees, distance between tips (sum of branch lengths) was calculated using the distTips function from the adephylo R package (Jombart et al., 2010), and assembled into a square matrix per lineage. To draw edges between related nodes, it was first necessary to define a distance threshold.</p><p id="P61">For this, the smallest tip-to-tip distance was identified for each tree, and a density curve created. For this curve, the lagged differences in y-axis value were divided by the lagged differences in x-axis, aiming to identify the position where the curve was most rapidly changing. This position was identified by taking the apex of the first identified peak (identified using the pracma package (Borchers, 2023)), and this x-axis position was the selected cut-off. By choosing the position where the aggregated tip-to-tip distances were most rapidly changing, we aimed to identify a relevant distance where BCRs were linked to neighbouring BCRs, and not linked to distant BCRs across multiple phylogenetic trees. This threshold was used to derive an adjacency matrix, whereby nodes that had a distance smaller than the calculated threshold were connected. The network was then directed by only allowing connections from nodes that had a smaller distance from the inferred germline node to those with a larger distance from the inferred germline node. Statistics were then calculated for each node in each network, namely the hub score (networkR; (Ekstrøm, 2019)) and the degree-ratio (igraph). Higher hub scores are achieved when a node has many outgoing connections and is further influenced by the quality of these downstream connections. Therefore, in our phylogenetic networks, nodes with higher hub scores reflect nodes with more close evolutionary relationships and indicates antigen driven SHM. The degree-ratio (number of outgoing connections divided by the number of incoming connections) was calculated using igraph and reflects the local environment of each node in the network.

Cells with mitochondrial and ribosomal genes percentage &lt;10% and &gt;5%, respectively, were retained for further analyses (total 48,602 cells post QC) Genes were retained if they were expressed by at least 3 cells. Data were normalized to contain a total count equal to 104 per cell and log + 1 corrected. Top 2000 highly variable genes (HVG) were selected based on Seurat v.3 algorithm (flavor = seurat_v3) with batch key “sample” and refined by removing the following genes ‘^HLA|^IG[HKL][VDJC]|^MT|^A[A-Z][0-9]|^B[A-Z][0-0]|XIST’. The number of principal components used for neighbourhood graph construction and dimensional reduction was set at 20, number of neighbours at 10. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP; v3.10.0)(<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">McInnes, Healy et al. 2018</xref>)</sup> was used for dimensional reduction and visualisation with all parameters as per default settings in scanpy. Clustering was performed using the Leiden algorithm with an initial resolution of 0.4. CellTypist v1.6.2 (model: Immune_All_Low.pkl) with majority voting was used for assisted initial cell annotation. Top 10 differentially expressed genes were calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with minimum log fold change (LFC) set at 2. For detailed B cell analysis, non-B/plasma cells were filtered out and the remaining dataset re-processed from HVG selection step again with the same setting but with Leiden clustering resolution 0.6.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Differential abundance testing</title><p id="P66">The differential abundance of cell types across timepoints was determined using milopy (Milo framework) package (v0.1.0) standard workflow with default settings(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dann, Henderson et al. 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Cell-cell interactions inference</title><p id="P67">Inferred number and strength of cell-cell interactions between all annotated cell subsets during pre-blip timepoint was calculated using CellChat v2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Jin, Plikus et al. 2024</xref>), following the standard workflow (from Anndata object) and keeping the default settings.</p></sec><sec id="S36"><title>Gene set enrichment analysis and scanpy score</title><p id="P68">Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on selected MSigDB v7.5.1 Hallmark and KEGG genesets using the fgsea package (available on Bioconductor v3.18) in R (v4.3.3) and visualised with the GOChord function in the GOplot package.

Lineages containing multiple MBC subsets were selected, and BCR sequences underwent pairwise comparison to identify unique AA mutations (FWR1 - FWR3).

The x axis shows the comparison group, and the y axis the average proportion of unique AA mutations per comparison.</p><p>(E-F) BCR phylogenetic network analysis to ascertain MBC subset evolution. Networks were created for each lineage, with each node representing a BCR (self-linkages excluded). Edges between nodes were drawn if the tip-to-tip distance was below a set threshold, defined as the position of first apex in the rate of change curve for the tip-to-tip distances. The network was by only allowing edges from closer nodes to germline to further nodes from germline. Once these networks were created, the hub score (E) and out-degree to in-degree ratio (F) was calculated (hub score representation, panel E, left hand side), to provide global and local measures of node connectivity, respectively. Throughout, statistical significance was assessed using pairwise Mann-Whitney U tests with the compare_means function from the ggpubr package (p &gt; 0.05 not marked, p &lt; 0.05 *, p &lt; 0.01, **, p &lt; 0.001 ***, p &lt; 0.0001 ****).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS202422-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Minor transient spike in HIV viraemia triggers antibody response</title><p>(A) Dynamics of viral load (V/L, copies/mL) and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell count (per mm<sup>3</sup>) from an elite controller (index participant).
