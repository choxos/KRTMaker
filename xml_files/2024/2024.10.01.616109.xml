These neurotoxic inclusions are especially harmful for dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. The cellular degradation system autophagy can reduce neurotoxicity caused by accumulated α-synuclein, by targeting it for degradation. Previously, we demonstrated that human TBC1D15 inhibits autophagy <italic>in vitro</italic>, resulting in accumulation of neurotoxic protein aggregates. Conversely, lowering the TBC1D15 expression promotes autophagy and degradation of α-synuclein and huntingtin proteins in various cell models. Here we show that knockdown of murine Tbc1d15 <italic>in vivo</italic> activates autophagy, reduces α-synuclein-mediated neurotoxicity, and improves motor performance. Thus, targeting Tbc1d15 expression may be a therapeutic avenue for neurodegenerative diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Background</title><p id="P2">Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one the most common movement disorders that is also associated with cognitive decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. A key finding in the brains of post-mortem PD patients is accumulation of α-synuclein, which forms neurotoxic oligomers and larger protein aggregates termed Lewy bodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra are especially vulnerable to α-synuclein accumulation, and animal models show gradual retraction of neurites that innervates the striatum, and loss of cells in the substantia nigra<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Excess α-synuclein is sufficient to cause PD, as autosomal dominant PD is caused by multiplication of the SNCA gene encoding α-synuclein, which increase its expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Autophagy is cytoplasmic degradation system that breaks down cell organelles, long-lived proteins, lipids, invading pathogens, and neurotoxic protein aggregates by capturing them in double-membraned vesicles called autophagosomes. The autophagosomes ultimately deliver the substrates to lysosomes for degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. LC3-I is a cytosolic protein but upon autophagy activation it is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine and incorporated into nascent autophagosome membranes as LC3-II. LC3-II is associated with autophagosomes from the precursor stage until after fusion with lysosomes and LC3-II levels correlate with cellular autophagosome volumes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The fusion step is orchestrated by the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex, the syntaxin17-SNAP29-VAMP7/8 trans-SNARE complexes, and the Rab GTPase protein Rab7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">TBC1D15 is a Rab GTP activating protein (GAP) that belongs to the TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) protein family. These proteins convert active GTP-bound Rab to inactive GDP-bound Rab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. We previously demonstrated that TBC1D15 inhibits autophagy by inactivating Rab7, resulting in the accumulation of autophagy substrates like the neurotoxic proteins α-synuclein and huntingtin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. We discovered that the microRNA miR1 targets and reduces TBC1D15 levels, which activates autophagy and lowers the neurotoxic burden from huntingtin and α-synuclein <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here, we show that shRNA targeting of murine Tbc1d15 <italic>in vivo</italic> promotes brain autophagy and protects dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra from α-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P5">Measuring <italic>in vivo</italic> autophagy flux in the brain is challenging. Western blotting of brain extracts will only provide a steady state measurement, and it is not possible to determine whether an increase in LC3-II is caused by a blockage or an increase in autophagy. Hence, to validate our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings in a mammalian <italic>in vivo</italic> model, we used transgenic mice expressing mRFP-GFP-LC3, which enables <italic>in vivo</italic> monitoring of autophagy flux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. GFP and mRFP are fluorescent inside autophagosomes but in low-pH lysosomes the GFP signal is quenched. This enables quantification of autophagosomes, which are vesicular structures positive for GFP and mRFP, and autolysosomes which are only mRFP-positive vesicles. Thus, the number of mRFP-only vesicles reflects autophagy flux.</p><p id="P6">mRFP-GFP-LC3 mice were injected in the substantia nigra with adeno-associated virus (AAV) containing shRNA targeting Tbc1d15 (left side) and scrambled control shRNA (right side) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). shRNA expression was regulated by the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter and was co-expressed with a cytosolic BFP reporter. BFP-positive neurons had a significant reduction in Tbc1d15 signal when compared to BFP-negative cells in the brain-half receiving shRNA against Tbc1d15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-D, E</xref>). By contrast, no difference in Tbc1d15 signal was observed in BFP-positive neurons that received scrambled shRNA when compared to BFP-negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-D, E</xref>). Furthermore, BFP-positive neurons (Tbc1d15 knockdown) had increased autophagy flux, as evidenced by an increase in both mRFP-positive vesicles and the mRFP/GFP ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Next, we tested if Tbc1d15 knockdown could limit α-synucleinopathy <italic>in vivo</italic>. Eight-week-old Sprague Dawley rats were injected in the substantia nigra with AAV expressing human α-synuclein under the neuron-specific synapsin-1 promoter. In addition, shRNA against Tbc1d15 was injected in the left-side and scrambled shRNA in the right-side of substantia nigra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Rat motor coordination was tested in a cylinder test both before and three weeks after the injections. The cylinder test evaluates the asymmetric behaviour of rodent front paws. When the rat explores the top of the cylinder, it uses its front paws for support on the cylinder wall, either with both front paws or with a single front paw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The number of right- and left-front paw touches was counted over a 5-minute period. The front paws of the rat are controlled by the contralateral brain hemisphere, meaning that the right front paw is controlled by the left-brain hemisphere and the left front paw by the right-brain hemisphere. Three weeks of human α-synuclein expression in the substantia nigra has been shown to cause neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons, which affects motor coordination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Prior to the α-synuclein overexpression, the rats used both front paws equally and most frequently with two-front paw stands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). After three weeks of α-synuclein overexpression, the rats used their right front paw more frequently, often as a single-front paw stand, suggesting more severe neurodegeneration in the right side of substantia nigra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-D</xref>). This suggests that Tbc1d15 knockdown in the left-side of the substantia nigra alleviated α-synuclein-induced motor defects.</p><p id="P8">Consistent with our behavioural data, we found that tyrosine hydroxylase expression was higher in the left-brain half that received shRNA against Tbc1d15, suggesting better preservation of dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>). This was associated with a decrease in both Tbc1d15 and total α-synuclein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>). The reduced presence of dopaminergic neurons was further validated by immunostaining of the brain, which revealed significantly reduced tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in both the neurite projections into striatum and in the substantia nigra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-E</xref>). Together, these data suggest that reducing Tbc1d15 expression is protective against α-synuclein-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion | conclusions"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title><p id="P9">Here we show that reducing murine Tbc1d15 expression <italic>in vivo</italic> decreases α-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity. Previously we discovered that human TBC1D15 is negatively regulated by the microRNA, miR1, which increases upon interferon-β treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Interferon-β, a type I interferon, is upregulated upon viral infection to elicit an anti-viral immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Viral infections are detected by the cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS), which activates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, that then promotes activity of the transcription factor IRF3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. IRF3 upregulates type I interferons, which bind to the interferon β/α receptor (IFNAR) on cell surfaces. This triggers the phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors, which homo- and heterodimerize and initiate a full anti-viral response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Previously, we discovered that mice lacking the IFN-β gene exhibit pathogenic hallmarks of PD, such as neuromuscular and cognitive decline, as well as accumulation of neurotoxic α-synuclein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. This was due to a blockage in autophagy. Conversely, treating neurons with recombinant IFN-β activated autophagy and prevented α-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity. Hence, we have provided <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that IFN-β activates autophagy via a miR1-TBC1D15-Rab7 axis, and that reducing TBC1D15 levels provides a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative proteinopathies.</p><p id="P10">TBC1D15 has also been shown to be involved in mitophagy. Parkin and PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK1) regulate mitophagy, which is the selective autophagy of mitochondria, and mutations in the parkin and PINK1 genes have been linked to PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Parkin also mediates amino acid flux between lysosomes and mitochondria by providing non-degradative contact sites between the two organelles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This process is dependent on active Rab7, and the parkin mutant C431S destabilizes active Rab7. Intriguingly, lowering TBC1D15 in dopaminergic neurons generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from PD patients (parkin C431S), restored lysosomal-mitochondrial dynamics by facilitating Rab7-dependent mitochondrial and lysosomal tethering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">During mitophagy, Atg9-positive membranes are recruited to mitochondria and contribute with membrane to the autophagosomal phagophore that engulf the mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The recruitment of Atg9 positive vesicles is dependent on active Rab7a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Compellingly, knocking out the two GAPs TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 enhances the co-localization between Atg9 and LC3-positive autophagosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, and coherently, TBC1D15 knockout cells accumulate LC3-positive structures upon mitochondrial damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">TBC1D15 contains a LC3-interacting region (LIR) that interacts with the Atg8 proteins GABARAP, GABARAPL1 and -L2, and can bind to Fis1 at mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Thus, TBC1D15 has the potential to bridge mitochondria to the phagophore. During valinomycin-induced mitochondrial damage, which triggers parkin-mediated mitophagy, TBC1D15 is recruited to mitochondria and Rab7 associates with the phagophore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In contrast to wild type TBC1D15, mutant TBC1D15 (D397A), which lacks TBC domain GAP activity, was unable to restore autophagy upon mitochondrial damage in TBC1D15 knockout cells. This suggests that TBC1D15 inactivates Rab7 to promote mitophagy of damaged mitochondria, which seems contradictory to the above mentioned results.</p><p id="P13">Recently, TBC1D15 was discovered to also play a role in lysosomal membrane repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Small perforations in the lysosome membrane are repaired by the ESCRT complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, whereas more severe damage initiates lysophagy, the selective autophagy of lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. If the damage can be repaired, TBC1D15 is recruited to the damaged lysosome where it serves as a scaffold for assembly of the autophagic-mediated lysosomal reformation machinery. TBC1D15 depletes active Rab7 from the site, which may impede lysophagy, and instead drive autophagic-mediated repair of the damaged lysosome. A similar mechanism may occur in valinomycin-induced mitochondrial damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, where the recruitment of TBC1D15, Rab7, and the phagophore could indicate an autophagosome-mediated membrane repair mechanism, instead of mitophagy. However, this requires further investigation.</p><p id="P14">The roles of TBC1D15 in autophagy and membrane repair mechanisms appear context dependent. Although removing TBC1D15’s inhibitory function on Rab7 is neuroprotective in the context of neurotoxic proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases, as demonstrated here, pharmacological targeting of TBC1D15 should be thoroughly tested in relation to mitophagy and lysosomal repair mechanisms. Hence, a moderate inactivation of TBC1D15 could be a preferable strategy for potential pharmacological intervention.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Experimental animals</title><p id="P15">Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages with free access to standard animal food chow and water, in a climate-controlled room (45-65 % humidity and 20-24 ºC room temperature) with a 12 h light/dark cycle.

Images of the mRFP-GFP-LC3 mice were acquired with a confocal LSM 810 (Carl Zeiss) confocal microscope or a Nikon Ti2 Crest X-Light V3 DeepSIM super-resolution spinning disc confocal using 405 nm, 488 nm, 568 nm, and 633 nm lasers.</p><p id="P26">For tyrosine hydroxylase staining, the whole rat brain was cut coronally at 35mm thick sections and transferred into anti-freeze medium (Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> (1.744g), NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (0.502g), ethylenglycerol (96ml), glycerol (96ml), dH<sub>2</sub>O (128ml). Free floating sections were immunostained with antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (Merck; cat. AB152) following the same procedure as above but using anti-rabbit secondary antibody Alexa fluor 488. Images were acquired in a LI-COR M Odyssey fluorescence scanner for the striatum and a EVOS M7000 microscope for the substantia nigra. Tyrosine hydroxylase fluorescence intensities were measured in masks placed around the striatum and substantia nigra in Image J. For immune-DAB (3, 3′-diaminobenzidine) staining of tyrosine hydroxylase the VECTASTAIN® ABC systems (Vector Laboratories, cat. no. PK-8200) was used according to the manufacturers protocol.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Western blotting</title><p id="P27">Rat brains (n=6) were dissected and divided at the midline into right and left brain hemispheres, then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Proteins were extracted in a dounce homogenizer containing TX-100 lysis buffer (1% TX100, 5M NaCl, 1M Tris-HCl, 10mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1mM EDTA) using 2 times 20 strokes. Cell homogenates were centrifuges at 17,000g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatants were collected, and the pellets centrifuged an additional round at 17,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C, and the second supernatant collected. The protein concentration of the TX100-soluble fraction was measured with Dc Protein Assay (Biorad cat. no. 500-0116), added Laemmli buffer, and boiled at 100°C for 5 minutes. The samples were loaded (20-40 µg per well) on pre-casted 4-12% gels (cat. no. NW04125BOX) and for LC3 detection 16% gels were used (XP00165BOX). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to pre-activated PVDF membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked in 5% milk or 5% BSA, and for α-synuclein the membranes were fixed in 0.4% PFA for 20 minutes prior to 40 minutes in 5% BSA. Membranes were incubated shaking overnight with primary antibodies (AbCam: Tbc1d15, cat. no. ab121396 and α-tubulin, cat. no. ab7291; SIGMA: vinculin cat. no. V9131; Cell Signaling Technology: α-synuclein cat. no. #2642; Novus Biologicals: LC3, cat. no. NB600-1384). The next day membranes were washed 3 times in PBS-T (PBS<sup>-</sup> with 0.5% Tween-20) and incubated with secondary fluorescent antibodies (LiCor: IRDye® 680LT (H + L) and IRDye® 800CW Goat anti-Mouse and -rabbit IgG (H + L) shaking for 1 hour at room temperature. Finally, the membranes were washed 3 times in PBS-T and imaged in a LI-COR M Odyssey fluorescence scanner.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P28">The following statistical analysis were used: Student’s t-test pair and non-paired, two-tailed, and ANOVA with Šídcáokrrection for multiple comparisons.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S13"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful for funding from National Foundation for Medical Research and Innovation (Australia), Parkinsonforeningen (Denmark), Sundhedsdonationer (Denmark), the Nordic Autophagy Society, and the UK Dementia Research Institute, which is principally funded by the Medical Research Council.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="FN1"><p id="P29"><bold>Declaration of interests</bold></p><p id="P30">D.C.R. is a consultant for Aladdin Healthcare Technologies Ltd., Mindrank AI, Nido Biosciences, Drishti Discoveries, Retro Biosciences, and PAQ Therapeutics and Alexion Pharma International Operations Limited.
