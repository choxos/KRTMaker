A prominent principle promoted over the last century is that brain activity consists of electrical field potentials that oscillate at different frequency bands. However, this principle has been challenged on several grounds. Specifically, increasing evidence suggests that in some cases brain oscillations are manifested as transient bursts rather than sustained rhythms. In this paper, we examine the hypothesis that rhythmicity (sustained vs. bursty) is an additional dimension in the organization of brain function. To test this hypothesis, we segmented the neurophysiological spectrum of 859 participants encompassing a dozen datasets across species, recording techniques, ages 18-88, brain regions, and cognitive states in both health and disease, according to a novel measure of rhythmicity. Together with computer simulations and brain stimulation, we found a universal spectral architecture divisible into two categories: high-rhythmicity bands associated with sustained oscillations and novel low-rhythmicity bands dominated by brief oscillatory bursts. This universal architecture reveals stable features of the brain’s mode of operation: sustained bands signify maintenance of ongoing activity, whereas transient bands signify the brain’s response to change. Rhythmicity specifies a powerful, replicable, and accessible feature-set for neuro-technology and diagnosis, as well as cross-species comparisons.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Understanding the organizing principles of the brain’s electrical activity using non-invasive techniques is a major goal of neuroscience, with implications for brain-computer interface (BCI) design, pathology diagnosis, and treatment. A dominant hallmark of the electrophysiological signal is its tendency to oscillate. These oscillations are thought to signify synchronized fluctuations in neuronal excitability, present in neuronal systems from rodents to humans, and can be detected invasively or non-invasively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). According to a current viewpoint, the entire electrophysiological spectrum is composed of oscillatory bands, covering all frequencies from 0.1 to more than 100 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) [the “canonical bands”delta (0.1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), gamma (30-80 Hz), and high-frequency oscillations (80-250 Hz)]. A century of research and thousands of studies suggest that these seamlessly progressing bands form the spectral architecture of the brain, with oscillatory activity in different bands supporting distinct cognitive and physiological states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). This spectral architecture is now considered as one of the fundamental principles of neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). However, several practical, functional, and physiological considerations challenge this viewpoint, calling for a revision of this architecture.</p><p id="P4">On the practical level, band definitions vary widely between research-groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), which limits our ability to compare findings between studies and species. In addition, bands are currently defined and identified by sustained oscillatory activity and, as such, are assumed to progress seamlessly at the group level. However, at the single-subject level, which is vital for individualized neurotechnology, diagnosis, and treatment, these relatively wide bands consist of aperiodic activity and some narrow band oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). With no objective framework for relating non oscillatory activity to canonical frequency bands, the role of activity within these gaps, if any, remains unknown. On the functional level, at least two of the canonical bands (beta and gamma) are thought to contain sub-bands with distinct, and even opposing, roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), indicating the need for a more nuanced characterization of bands. On the physiological level, increasing evidence indicates that some oscillatory responses are not sustained. Rather, they arise as strong, short-lived bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). The bursts raise the possibility that the electrophysiological spectrum segregates into specialised frequency bands according to their persistence, i.e. sustained (referred to hereinafter as high-rhythmicity) versus bursty (low-rhythmicity) bands. To account for these challenges, we develop an objective standard to divide an individual’s electrophysiological spectrum into high-rhythmic and low-rhythmic bands. We then show that the resulting novel architecture of high-rhythmic and low-rhythmic activity is universal and bears functional significance: rhythmic bands signify maintenance of ongoing activity, whereas non-rhythmic bands signify transient events.</p><p id="P5">Our hypothesis is thus that the brain uses both high-rhythmic and low-rhythmic activity. Such organization of spectral phenomena can bridge two prominent views of the brain’s <italic>modus operandi,</italic> namely <italic>phase-coding</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) and <italic>rate-coding</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> panels A-B). These views differ regarding whether the precise timing of neuronal outputs encodes information about neuronal inputs. <italic>Phase-coding</italic> posits that oscillations temporally bias neuronal responses to inputs: synaptic inputs that arrive during the excitable phase of an oscillation are more likely to cause outputs; whereas inputs arriving at the opposite phase get dismissed or curtailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). According to this view, oscillations causally influence the formation, synchronization, and sequence of cell assemblies, communication efficacy, and ultimately, an organism’s behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). In contrast, <italic>rate-coding</italic> proposes that the rate at which neurons “fire” electrical pulses called action potentials contains all relevant information. According to one interpretation of rate-coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), enhancing neuronal firing-rate suffices for assembly formation, deeming oscillations unnecessary. Indeed, we recently showed that momentary neuronal oscillations (bursts) occur together with transient firing-rate changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Combining insights from phase- and rate-coding, we hypothesized that both “sustained” and “bursty” bands exist and together comprise a universal rhythmicity architecture relevant to cognition by serving two modes of operation; sustained oscillations support phase-coding and maintenance of ongoing activity, whereas bursts reflect rate-coding and response to change. This hypothesis of rhythmicity serving as an additional dimension in the organization of brain function yields four testable predictions: (i) There should be defined frequency “sustained bands” that clearly express sustained oscillations. (ii) Additionally, there should be a separate, novel category of bands specializing in transient activity. In these “transient bands”, spectral phenomena should manifest as short-lived bursts. (iii) The architecture is a universal organizing principle of the brain’s operating system; hence it should arise across datasets, recording techniques, brain areas, and species. (iv) The architecture mediates cognition, hence its operation should be sensitive to variations in cognition arising with age and neuropathology, and to different cognitive states, such as input processing.</p><p id="P7">To test these predictions of our universal rhythmic architecture hypothesis, we developed a phase-based tool to measure rhythmicity over the frequency spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1</xref>). Three features characterize brain oscillations: frequency (cycles per time-unit), power (or magnitude), and phase (or angle). The canonical bands are typically identified by measuring spectral power at different frequencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2A-C</xref>). However, estimated power is influenced by both oscillatory activity and non-oscillatory transients. For example, a spectral power peak could result from strong impulses which are not rhythmic. An alternative approach to power is to estimate how sustained the oscillation is by measuring how well, at any moment, the signal’s phase predicts its future phase. This is achieved by computing the coherence, or phase similarity, between the signal and a time-lagged copy of itself. Previous studies measured the rhythmicity spectrum as a function of lag duration, assuming that genuine oscillations should remain sustained for many cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Here, based on large datasets and comprehensive simulations, we found that the relative rhythmicity <italic>between</italic> frequencies of individual subjects remains similar over lags. Hence, with carefully chosen parameters, the rhythmicity spectrum can be derived from a single lag (for further discussion, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Text, parametrical effects on rhythmicity, and fig. S5</xref>). We term this algorithm the <italic>lagged-angle vector index</italic> (LAVI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1, supplementary materials, materials and methods</xref>). Beyond being an order of magnitude faster than previous lagged-coherence approaches, LAVI allows an automatic and statistically inferred detection of frequency bands at the individual subject level, of both increased and decreased rhythmicity. LAVI is therefore uniquely suited to testing our rhythmic-architecture hypothesis.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Universal rhythmic architecture</title><p id="P8">Establishing the rhythmic architecture as a universal phenomenon requires a robust, diverse, and large sample. Therefore, we computed the rhythmicity spectra of data from 12 datasets acquired from 2450 recording sites of 11 rats and 848 humans (with both invasive and non-invasive methods; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Using LAVI to measure rhythmicity, we established that the electrophysiological spectrum is divisible into significantly-high and significantly-low rhythmicity bands. A consistent architecture was found in all datasets, and across ages, species, brain regions, and recording techniques, in health and disease. When examining rhythmicity profiles, we noticed that LAVI values exhibit an evident baseline. The median (across frequencies) remained stable across participants, channels, and datasets, and depended on experimenter-controlled parameters (like lag duration and wavelet width, see details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary text and fig. S5</xref>. With lag=1.5 cycles and wavelet width=5 cycles; non-invasive (datasets I-VIII): mean of medians: 0.41±0.01 SD, range: [0.38-0.45], n=809 participants; ECoG (dataset IX): 0.39±0.01 [0.35-0.43], n=867 electrodes; SEEG (dataset X): 0.40±0.01 [0.36-0.48], n=733 electrodes). Furthermore, median rhythmicity values of recorded data closely resembled median rhythmicity values of simulated data generated to match the power-spectra of recorded data but with random phases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2D and S5F-H</xref>). Leveraging this quality, we defined the median over frequencies as baseline rhythmicity, and the range of rhythmicity fluctuations of simulated (random-phase) data as “noise-ribbon”. With these definitions, we devised an <italic>automated band-border detection algorithm</italic> (ABBA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Frequency bands with significantly high rhythmicity (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, Monte Carlo simulations) varied between individual subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2G</xref>), demonstrating the necessity for an objective band-detection framework. Nonetheless, the distribution of peak frequencies of each rhythmicity band across subjects conformed well with canonical, power-based bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). This indicates that activity in canonical bands, traditionally defined as frequencies with high oscillatory power, indeed reflects rhythmically sustained signals.</p><p id="P9">Having confirmed the existence of sustained bands, we next examined whether transient bands exist. Using ABBA, we invariably found bands with significantly decreased phase-consistency, as expected from transient bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3</xref>). We dub these bands “Delta/Theta (δ/θ)”, “Theta/Alpha (θ/α)”, “Beta1”, and “Gamma1.” To establish that this architecture of sustained and transient bands is universal, we computed the peak frequencies of these bands from a large body of data acquired using both invasive (ECoG, SEEG) and non-invasive (EEG, MEG) techniques. Then, we compared the rhythmicity architecture, expressed as the distributions of peak frequencies, across different datasets (EEG, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>), age groups (MEG, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>), and neuroanatomical locations (ECoG, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>, SEEG, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>). Using ABBA, we detected the canonical bands Theta, Alpha, and Beta2 in virtually all participants. Importantly, in the investigated frequency range (3-45 Hz) we found that transient bands were as common as sustained bands (datasets I-XI: Transient: 2.45 ± 0.03 (mean ± SEM) significant bands per participant, Sustained: 2.28 ± 0.02; dataset XIII: transient: 2.6 ± 0.03, sustained: 2.41 ± 0.03; dataset IX [per electrode]: transient: 2.17 ± 0.04, sustained: 2.31 ± 0.04; dataset X [per electrode]: transient: 2.22 ± 0.05, sustained: 2.44 ± 0.03). Bayes factor analysis (BF) indicated strong evidence for no difference in number of significant bands between the 6 different EEG datasets (BF<sub>01</sub>=10.84). Importantly, our analysis is sensitive to within-bands variability, such as systematic age-related decrease in peak-frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>), thus can serve as a biomarker, consistent with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Leveraging a unique recording setting including both scalp EEG and invasive electrodes in dataset X, we compared peak frequencies in invasive electrodes to peaks in the nearest EEG electrode. We found moderate evidence that scalp and intracranial values are similar (BF<sub>10</sub> &lt; 1/2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>). Furthermore, the invasive recordings from patients’ hippocampi allowed us to compare the human rhythmic architecture to that of rat hippocampi. Similar to human datasets, we detected sustained and transient bands from Theta to Gamma1 in a majority of rats the 11 rats examined. Comparing bands’ peak frequencies of signals recorded in the hippocampi of patients to hippocampal recordings from rats, we report moderate to strong evidence that the frequency distributions of bands from alpha to gamma1 are conserved from rats to humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1L</xref>). Taken together, the neurophysiological spectrum is divided into frequencies characterized with sustained oscillations and other frequencies characterized with transient oscillations. This rhythmicity architecture generalizes across datasets, brain regions, age, levels of invasiveness, and two mammalian species, consistent with the possibility of a universal architecture.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Sub-second manifestations of rhythmicity</title><p id="P11">Our hypothesis posits that the universal rhythmic architecture supports both rate- and phase-coding, by allocating “bursty” activity to transient-bands, and “genuine” oscillations to sustained-bands. Testing this hypothesis requires linking the rhythmicity profiles (measured over minutes) to activity in the sub-second realm. To this end, we carried out two independent analyses and conducted a neuro-stimulation experiment. In the first analysis, we used standard burst detection algorithms (independent from LAVI, see methods) and examined whether bursts are shorter and more frequent in transient-bands compared to sustained-bands. Second, to complement the data-driven correlation between bursts and rhythmicity bands, we used simulations to test how sub-second parameters of the signal, and specifically burst-duration, influence the rhythmicity profile. Last, we sought causal evidence for the effect of bursts on rhythmicity. To this end, we used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to deliver transient, rhythmic, and arrhythmic inputs, and asked how they affect the activity in different bands using a recently-reported time-resolved rhythmicity measure (namely Within-Trial Phase-Lock, WTPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>)).</p><p id="P12">We defined oscillatory “bursts” as peaks in the time-frequency plane exceeding the 90<sup>th</sup> power percentile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), while avoiding overlap in frequency and time between neighbouring bursts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary materials, materials and methods</xref>). We then measured the rate of occurrence and mean duration of bursts in datasets I, III, and IV. Band category (transient or sustained) had a significant effect on both the rate and duration of bursts (ANOVA using category and band as groups, rate: category: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,439</sub>=190.86, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>-35</sup>, η<sup>2</sup>=0.30; BF<sub>10</sub> =8.25*10<sup>32</sup>; band: <italic>F</italic><sub>5,435</sub>=118.9, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>-78</sup>, η<sup>2</sup>=0.58; BF<sub>10</sub>=5.45*10<sup>22</sup>; duration: category: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,439</sub>=123.7, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>-24</sup>, η<sup>2</sup>=0.22, BF<sub>10</sub>=1.66*10<sup>22</sup>; band: <italic>F</italic><sub>5,435</sub>=72.2, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>- 54</sup>, η<sup>2</sup>=0.45, BF<sub>10</sub>=31.26, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, blue vs. green). Post-hoc Tukey Honest Significant Difference tests revealed higher burstrates and shorter burst-durations in all transient bands compared to their neighbouring sustained bands. The increased rate and decreased duration of bursts in lower rhythmicity bands suggests that lower rhythmicity (stable over minutes) relates to transient activity in the sub-second realm (manifested by short-lived bursts).</p><p id="P13">We considered the possibility that the interaction between bands and burst levels results from a frequency-specific effect of random noise in the brain. In general, the power of the neurophysiological signal is inversely proportional to frequency, a phenomenon termed 1/<italic>f</italic>. For each participant, we generated a matching surrogate dataset with random phases that matched their 1/<italic>f</italic> power profiles (methods). Contrasting with recorded data, burst-rates increased linearly with bands’ frequency (BF<sub>10</sub>&gt;10<sup>31</sup>), whereas bands and category had no effect on burst duration (BF<sub>01</sub>=27.8). Consequently, burst-rates in all transient bands of data were higher than their surrogate counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, blue vs. pink). In addition, burst-durations of beta1 and gamma1 were shorter than their surrogates. Conversely, burstrates of the sustained bands alpha and beta2 were lower than simulated noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, green vs. pink), and the durations of alpha longer than expected by chance. Thus, low rhythmicity is associated with a high rate of transient oscillatory events, above and beyond what is expected from random 1/<italic>f</italic> activity.</p><p id="P14">But do bursts systematically affect rhythmicity? To address this, we simulated data and tested how manipulation of bursts’ length affects rhythmicity levels. This <italic>in-silico</italic> approach revealed that bursts shorter than four cycles were associated with rhythmicity levels below what would be expected by chance, and hence can be considered transient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Conversely, bursts lasting more than 6 cycles were associated with rhythmicity levels significantly above chance, a characteristic of sustained activity. For these measures, we leveraged the defined threshold of our rhythmicity index. We simulated baseline neuronal activity as a signal with power in each frequency <italic>f</italic> weighted by 1/<italic>f</italic>, and random phases. This signal’s maximal and minimal rhythmicity values provided the baseline noise range. To mimic oscillatory bursts, we reduced the power in the 14-16 Hz range to 0.5/<italic>f</italic>, and we increased it to 2/<italic>f</italic> for durations varying from 2 to 20 cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). We obtained similar results with repeating rhythmic, but not arrhythmic, pulses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4</xref>) that can be mimicked experimentally with TMS. Therefore, we next turned to ask how single TMS pulses and repeating rhythmic and arrhythmic TMS pulses affect rhythmicity.</p><p id="P15">To causally demonstrate periodic input’s role in rhythmicity, we stimulated six participants’ prefrontal cortices with TMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). In line with the abovementioned computational modelling, we predicted that rhythmic stimulation should increase the rhythmicity measured in the scalp EEG, whereas arrhythmic stimulation might violate the phase consistency over time and thus disrupt ongoing oscillations. Furthermore, we predicted that single impulses should yield transient oscillations (“bursts” or “ripples”) as their spectral fingerprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Based on our hypothesis, these transient ripples should be confined to bands which naturally express burst dynamics. Our TMS approach indeed provided causal evidence that in low-rhythmicity bands transient activity is reverberated, whereas sustained bands are dominated by ongoing oscillations.</p><p id="P16">For each participant, we computed the rhythmicity profile at rest and determined their individual alpha, beta1 and beta2 peak frequencies. Then, for each band we stimulated 60 rhythmic trains of six pulses each with an inter-pulse-interval fixed to the cycle length of the peak frequency of this band. The arrhythmic condition also consisted of 60 trains of six pulses, with the same duration between the first and last pulse as in the rhythmic condition, but with random spacing between the remaining four pulses. In the last stimulation condition, we delivered a single pulse (120 trials, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). We pseudo-randomized the trial types’ order (frequency band, rhythmicity, and whether a single or several pulses were delivered) and measured the stimulation’s effect on rhythmicity at each time point using a time resolved phase locking measure (WTPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>)).</p><p id="P17">Consistent with our hypothesis, singlepulse stimulations elicited reverberations in frequencies corresponding to the transient bands θ/α and beta1, that lasted up to 300 ms post-stimulation (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, cluster permutation test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Moreover, rhythmic pulses increased rhythmicity in all bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, peak frequency in each band marked as “0”). Arrhythmic stimulations, however, induced a band-rhythmicity-dependent effect. On the sustained bands alpha and beta2, arrhythmic stimulation caused a decrease in measured rhythmicity (significant (blue) clusters around peak frequency (0), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>), implying that the arrhythmic stimuli disrupted ongoing oscillations. In beta1, arrhythmic stimulations had the opposite effect: they increased rhythmicity compared to baseline up to 200 ms after the last pulse, possibly due to the ripple induced in response to individual pulses. These results thus support our hypothesis that low-rhythmicity bands consist of transient yet spectrally defined activity, whereas high rhythmicity bands indicate sustained oscillations.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Two modes of operation</title><p id="P18">Thus far, we introduced a spectral architecture incorporating both sustained and transient brain activity as universals. This framework is supported by data and enabled by our new methodology. Our hypothesis raises the possibility that this electrophysiological architecture serves a functional role. For example, this architecture may allow the brain to spectrally segregate two types of processes: change in response to inputs, manifested in oscillatory bursts which are transient, and maintenance of ongoing activity, reflected in sustained oscillations. Our fourth prediction therefore suggests that patterns of activity within the rhythmicity architecture should respond to cognitive states, and particularly those related to inputs. To demonstrate this, we exemplify how rhythmicity profiles and their relations with neuronal firing are affected by the amount of external input, both over the whole session and at the sub-second realm.</p><p id="P19">If activity in sustained bands entails maintenance of ongoing activity as opposed to response to input, then rhythmicity levels in these bands should decrease in the presence of sensory input. To examine this, we compared the rhythmicity profiles of healthy participants while performing a visual task relative to rest with their eyes closed (datasets I and II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Alphaband power is known to decrease when people observe stimuli compared to wakeful rest with eyes closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). As theoretical anchoring, we confirmed that engaging in a task and being subjected to stimuli with eyes open also significantly decreases alpha-band rhythmicity (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, clusterpermutation test). Moreover, the difference in rhythmicity with eyes open compared to eyes closed (measured in LAVI) is highly correlated with the change in alpha power (measured in dB, ρ=0.781, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>-7</sup>). Furthermore, a significant increase in rhythmicity with eyes closed was observed also in the sustained band beta2 but was not observed in the transient band beta1. Notably, in addition to enabling the characterization of beta1 and beta2 as distinct modes of operation, this analysis points to the divergent roles of these modes.</p><p id="P20">We next asked what are the dynamics between neuronal firing and oscillations over the whole session, and how are they affected by visual inputs in the sub-second realm. If sustained band activity supports maintenance of ongoing processes, and transient band activity reflects response to change, then the relationship between oscillatory bands and neuronal firing should depend on the presence of external stimuli. Without inputs, we expect neuronal firing to correlate with activity in sustained bands. With inputs, however, neuronal firing should correlate with transient band activity. To investigate this, we turned to invasive recordings in humans, to enable measurement of the High-Frequency amplitude (HF, 70-150 Hz), a well-known proxy for neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Using ECoG data from patients performing a visual perception task (dataset IX; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), we measured how the amplitude of HF activity covaries with the amplitude observed in each of the lower frequencies (LF, 3-45 Hz). Our framework predicts that as input processing increases, our HF proxy of neuronal activity should increasingly covary with transient band activity. We found that over the whole session, where in general the amount of input is low, HF significantly covaried with activity in sustained bands. In contrast, in response to a visual input, responding channels transiently increased their HF-LF covariance at a transient frequency band.</p><p id="P21">Specifically, the HF-LF covariance of all contacts over the entire session exhibited clear peaks at the sustained bands theta and beta2. When focusing on the time of visual stimulus presentation, however, we observed that HF-LF covariance differed between two subsets of channels. HF-activity clearly separates contacts that show increased HF following visual input versus those that show a decrease in HF (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary material, materials and methods</xref> for further details). We consider the former as positively responding to the input and engaging in its processing (n=346 contacts), and the latter as negatively responding (n=84 contacts), potentially engaged in other, ongoing processes. Based on this interpretation, we predicted that positively responding contacts would exhibit stronger HF-LF covariation within transient bands upon stimulus presentation, reflecting their participation in input processing. In contrast, contacts that are inhibited by the stimulus would exhibit stronger HF-LF covariation within sustained oscillation bands, reflecting their involvement in computations other than the transient input. In line with these predictions, positively responding channels significantly increased their HF-LF covariance in the transient θ/α band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, blue). Conversely, negatively responding channels significantly decreased their HF-LF covariance in the transient θ/α band and increased covariance in the sustained alpha band, supporting a role of alpha in inhibiting stimulus-unrelated regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). We note that the specific responding bands vary between tasks. This indicates that different transient and sustained bands can serve specific functional roles. Nonetheless, our exemplary invasive, non-invasive, and TMS stimulation data, suggest that typically, sustained bands (e.g., alpha, beta2) signify a mode of low engagement with external input, whereas transient bands (e.g., θ/α, beta1) represent engagement with incoming input.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Rhythmicity in health and disease</title><p id="P22">Finally, we tested whether rhythmicity may index variability between individuals, in health and disease. Rhythmicity as presented here can be robustly estimated at the individual participant level and compared against large sample data. For example, in healthy aging, peak frequencies and the range of the rhythmicity values decrease systematically (correlation between age and alpha frequency: Pearson’s ρ=-0.34, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>-17</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>; age and rhythmicity range: ρ=-0.257, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>-10</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). This neurotypical decline agrees with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Critically, this large-scale group characterization can serve as a norm for evaluating individuals’ aging and diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p id="P23">In addition, in Parkinson’s disease (PD), beta power is known to increase. Activity in the low-beta band (12-24 Hz) is believed to be controlled by the level of dopaminergic activity in response to internal and external cues, and following dopaminergic cells’ loss, beta levels are elevated in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). This increase in beta amplitude in the subthalamic nucleus was found to correlate with beta-burst duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), and pathologically long beta-bursts are curtailed in response to medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that medication would specifically affect the transientband beta1, and not the sustained band, beta2, of PD patients. We compared the rhythmicity profiles of PD patients with (i.e., “ON”) and without (i.e., “OFF”) medication, and found a significant increase specifically in beta1 in the “OFF” medication condition (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, cluster permutation test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). This finding suggests that beta oscillopathy is specific to beta1 and demonstrates the importance of characterizing transient bands in spectral analysis. Future brain-stimulation treatments for PD and other diseases can thus benefit from improved functional resolution and band specificity, based on patients’ individual rhythmicity profiles.</p><p id="P24">In conclusion, our findings offer a new perspective on the contribution of brain rhythms to information processing and cognition. We note that our experiments did not aim to resolve the debate about whether oscillations are <italic>necessary</italic> or <italic>consequential</italic> to neural computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Nonetheless, based on our novel framework, which hinges on rhythmicity, we provide compelling evidence to settle the debate regarding the <italic>involvement</italic> of oscillations in neural computation. Rhythmicity-based spectral segmentation reveals twice as many bands as previously described with two divergent modes of operation. This indicates that there is room for both rate- and phase-codes with important complementary roles: activity in transient bands indicates neuronal inputs, whereas activity in high rhythmicity bands signifies maintenance of neuronal activity via sustained oscillations. This duality can conceivably expand the capacity and efficacy of neuronal computations and, with a spectrum spanning several orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), can equip the brain with the flexibility necessary for a wide range of cognitive functions. The practical consequences of these theoretical insights are considerable; an individualized, detailed, and statistically robust spectral segmentation can be harnessed to develop brainstimulation interventions and non-invasive neuropathological diagnostics, and to design novel brain-computer-interfaces.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS201805-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d80aAcJbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S5"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Profs.

(<bold>A</bold>) Phase-code: oscillations synchronise neurons’ firing (inset, wave represents field potential, ticks action-potentials of 3 neurons), thus enable efficient communication, like telecommunication devices exploit electromagnetic waves. (<bold>B)</bold> Rate-code: oscillations represent network’s reverberation following a transient input, like ripples resulting from a drop of water. (<bold>C</bold>) To compute the Lagged Angle Vector Index (LAVI) in each frequency, the phase at each timepoint is subtracted from the phase of a lagged copy of the signal (arrows, colour represents time). LAVI is the vector sum of the differences in all timepoints (black lines, right circles). Rhythmic signals are expected to have consistent phases yielding large LAVI values, wihle non-rhythmic signals will yield lower LAVI values. (<bold>D</bold>) Rhythmicity profile of one subject and output of the Automated Band Border Algorithm (ABBA).

Dots represent the mean and horizontal bars represent the 95% confidence interval per group/ area. Percent number next to each band represents the % of participants (<bold>G, H</bold>) or electrodes (<bold>I, J</bold>) with detected bands. Stars represent significant difference between datasets/ areas/ age-groups within a band (ANOVA; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Note, that from theta to gamma, both transient and sustained bands are detected and predominantly do not overlap with neighbouring bands.

Bayes factor analysis suggests moderate evidence for no difference between species in Alpha, Beta1, Beta2, and Gamma1. Note, that the ~8 Hz band is considered “Theta” in the publication of dataset XII. With LAVI analysis the highest peak was found at ~8 Hz, hence it was assigned to “Alpha” by ABBA. Dots: mean.

(<bold>B</bold>) Oscillatory bursts were simulated by filtering white noise with filters with a 1/f weight profile (thus generateing pink-noise), and setting the filter weight at the frequency of interest (15 Hz) to twice its original weight during burst (with varying length, ordinate), and half the weight elsewhere. Bursts are highlighted with gold background. (<bold>C</bold>) Rhythmicity profile. Colour of traces corresponds to burst length, pink shading corresponds to the noise, estimated as the minimal and maximal LAVI values of the 1/f-noise data (without adjustment, red trace). Inset: LAVI values at the modulated frequency (15 Hz). Note that increasing (decreasing) the rhythmicity in one band decreases (increases) rhythmicity in neighbouring bands. This can be caused by interference. However, peaks and troughs in physiological data are above and beyond this effect (for more details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig.
