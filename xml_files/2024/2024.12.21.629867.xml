NLRP3 activation is associated with many age-related inflammatory diseases, and NLRP3 inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy. We previously performed a DNA encoded library screen to identify novel NLRP3 binding molecules. Herein we describe the characterization of BAL-0028 as a potent and specific inhibitor of NLRP3 signaling. Notably, BAL-0028 is a poor inhibitor of mouse NLRP3 but inhibits human and primate NLRP3 with nanomolar potency. Using cellular and biochemical analyses we demonstrate that BAL-0028 binds to the NLRP3 NACHT domain at a site that is distinct from the MCC950 binding pocket. Using humanized NLRP3 mice we show that a derivative of BAL-0028 inhibits NLRP3 activation <italic>in vivo</italic> in a peritonitis model. Finally, we demonstrate that BAL-0028 inhibits select hyperactive NLRP3 mutations associated with autoinflammatory diseases more potently than does MCC950. BAL-0028 thus represents a new modality for NLRP3 inhibition in inflammatory diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NLRP3</kwd><kwd>Inflammasome</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Inflammaging</kwd><kwd>MCC950</kwd><kwd>CRID3</kwd><kwd>BAL-0028</kwd><kwd>Small molecule inhibitor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Inflammation is associated with many age-related diseases including neurodegenerative conditions, cancer, and metabolic and cardiovascular diseases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Franceschi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Ransohoff, 2016</xref>). Limiting inflammation may thus be an effective therapeutic strategy to reduce or delay age-related diseases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Figueira et al., 2016</xref>). Inflammasomes are protein complexes that have emerged as central mediators of inflammation as they control the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, and lytic inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>). Inflammasomes are formed by a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) or sensor molecule that interacts with the adapter molecule apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). ASC oligomerizes and provides a platform for the autocatalytic activation of the zymogen protease caspase-1. Active caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β and IL-18 into their active secreted forms and mediates pyroptosis via cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Fu et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Amongst the known inflammasome sensors, the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) has emerged a key mediator of pathogenic inflammation in many inflammatory diseases. NLRP3 can be activated by a broad range of molecules and processes and is regarded as a sensor of the disruption of cellular homeostasis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Akbal et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Disease-related molecules such as β-amyloid, α-synuclein, and monosodium urate crystals have been shown to trigger NLRP3 activation. NLRP3-deficient mice are correspondingly protected in models of Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease and gout. There is also a group of rare genetic diseases caused by gain-of-function mutations in NLRP3 called Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) or NLRP3-associated autoinflammatory diseases (NLRP3-AID). NLRP3 inhibition is thus a promising anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategy(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Coll et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mangan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Currently available therapies to inhibit the inflammasome pathway are limited to antibodies such as Anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist) and Canakinumab (anti-IL-1β) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Coll, 2023</xref>). However, specific NLRP3 inhibition could have several advantages over these including preventing IL-18 release and pyroptosis, while maintaining inflammation driven by other inflammasomes like NLRP1 and NLRC4 that may be important for host defense(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Barnett et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, small molecule inhibitors have improved blood-brain barrier crossing, which would be critical for blocking neuroinflammation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Xiong et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Numerous small molecule NLRP3 inhibitors have been described including the sulfonylurea MCC950 (aka CRID3, CP-456,773). MCC950 was developed based on early observations from cell-based screens that identified diarylsulfonylureas such as glyburide could inhibit NLRP3 signaling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Laliberte et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lamkanfi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Perregaux et al., 2001</xref>). MCC950 is the most widely used tool molecule to study NLRP3 inhibition in cells and in animal models of disease(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Coll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Corcoran et al., 2021</xref>). MCC950 is a specific non-covalent inhibitor that blocks the ATPase activity of NLRP3(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Coll et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Tapia-Abellan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Vande Walle et al., 2019</xref>). Its binding site has been resolved at molecular resolution with two reports of NLRP3-MCC950 cryo-EM structures(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hochheiser et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Ohto et al., 2022</xref>) and a crystal structure of NLRP3 with an MCC950 analogue(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dekker et al., 2021</xref>). Notably the majority of NLRP3 inhibitors that have advanced to early stage clinical trials are sulfonylureas or MCC950-derivatives(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Vande Walle and Lamkanfi, 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Several other direct NLRP3 inhibitors with different chemistries and mechanisms of action have been described such as CY-09 which prevents ATP binding, and Tranilast which disrupts NLRP3 oligomerisation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Coll et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). However, many of these compounds have off-target effects and indeed MCC950 has also been shown to inhibit carbonic anhydrase 2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Coll et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kennedy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Walle et al., 2024</xref>). Importantly, in studies of NLRP3-AID mouse models and patient cells it has been observed that MCC950 cannot effectively inhibit NLRP3 activation by certain mutations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cosson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Vande Walle et al., 2019</xref>). There is therefore a need to identify specific NLRP3 inhibitors with novel mechanisms of action that can offer an alternative to MCC950-derived compounds. Herein we describe BAL-0028, a specific inhibitor of NLRP3 with a mechanism that is distinct from MCC950. Remarkably, we find that BAL-0028 potently inhibits primate NLRP3 but has significantly reduced potency for NLRP3 from other mammals, highlighting the importance of drug development efforts focused on human proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P8">Using a DNA encoded library (DEL) screen with recombinant NLRP3 we identified a series of indazole small molecule NLRP3 binders(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hartman et al., 2024</xref>). A high affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> range 104-123 nM) lead compound from this study, BAL-0028 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), was selected for further characterization in cell-based assays(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hartman et al., 2024</xref>). We first examined BAL-0028 in NLRP3 signaling assays using THP-1 macrophage-like cells. Pre-treatment with BAL-0028 potently inhibits NLRP3-dependent IL-1β release from THP-1s simulated with LPS and the pore forming toxin nigericin, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 57.5 nM. In the same assay the IC<sub>50</sub> of MCC950 is 14.3 nM which is consistent with previous reports(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Clenet et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Teske et al., 2024</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). NLRP3 is activated by many molecules including damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) release during sterile inflammation such as ATP, and monosodium urate (MSU) crystals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kapetanovic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mangan et al., 2018</xref>). BAL-0028 also inhibits IL-1β release triggered by ATP and MSU with IC<sub>50</sub>s in the nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C,D</xref>). This confirms the ability of BAL-0028 to block NLRP3-dependent signaling by multiple stimuli in THP-1s.</p><p id="P9">BAL-0028 was further evaluated in a range of more physiologically relevant human cell types. BAL-0028 consistently inhibits nigericin induced IL-1β release in primary monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia (iCell microglia) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> of BAL-0028 is generally higher than MCC950 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-E</xref>), however for iCell microglia the compounds are equipotent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Having established the potency of BAL-0028 we tested it in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) and iPSC-derived macrophages (iMacs). BAL-0028 inhibited nigericin induced IL-1β release in HMDM and iMacs in the nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G-H</xref>). In addition, we examine lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release as a measure of pyroptotic cell death induced by NLRP3. LDH is dose-dependently inhibited by BAL-0028 in iMacs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1A</xref>). Together these data demonstrate that BAL-0028 is a potent inhibitor of NLRP3 signaling in multiple human cell types. Stimulation with LPS is required to induce both transcriptional and posttranslational priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">McKee and Coll, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">O’Keefe et al., 2024</xref>). To examine the effects of BAL-0028 on LPS signaling we measured the release of inflammasome-independent inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6. BAL-0028 does not reduce TNF secretion from HMDM or iMacs in NLRP3 assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 1B</xref>). Pre-treatment with BAL-0028 does not block LPS induced TNF secretion, although there was some reduction in IL-6 release at the highest concentration of BAL-0028 (10 mM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1C-D</xref>). These data demonstrate that BAL-0028 does not appreciably interfere with LPS signaling. We also confirmed that BAL-0028 is not cytotoxic as it does not increase LDH release or reduce cell viability in THP-1s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 1E-F</xref>). Lastly, we compared BAL-0028 and MCC950 in a whole blood NLRP3 assay. As expected, there was a decrease in potency of both BAL-0028 and MCC950 due to plasma protein binding, but both compounds effectively inhibited IL-1β release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>). This confirms that BAL-0028 is a potent inhibitor of human NLRP3 in a clinically relevant assay.</p><p id="P10">We next examined the effects of BAL-0028 on signaling events upstream of IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis. Upon NLRP3 inflammasome activation pro-IL-1β is cleaved into its active p17 form by caspase-1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>). Through Western blotting, we confirmed that both BAL-0028 and MCC950 inhibited pro-IL-1β processing and caspase-1 activation as measured by the appearance of the p20 auto-processed form of caspase-1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). BAL-0028 did not affect the expression of pro-IL-1β or NLRP3, again suggesting NLRP3 priming by LPS is unaffected by BAL-0028 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). To examine whether NLRP3 inflammasome formation is inhibited by BAL-0028 we measured ASC-speck formation by fluorescence microscopy. In THP-1 cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged ASC, nigericin induced ASC speck formation is dose-dependently inhibited by both BAL-0028 and MCC950 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). We next used HEK293T cells expressing BlueFP-ASC and doxycycline-inducible NLRP3 to monitor ASC specks by flow cytometry. In these cells, nigericin stimulation triggers a significant increase in ASC specks, which is dose-dependently inhibited by both BAL-0028 and MCC950 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In addition in iMacs, nigericin-induced ASC speck formation was also potently blocked by BAL-0028 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D,E</xref>). These data confirm that BAL-0028 inhibits the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.</p><p id="P11">To confirm the specificity of BAL-0028 for NLRP3, we assessed the effects of BAL-0028 on other inflammasome pathways. Transfection of the synthetic double stranded DNA Poly(dA:dT) in THP-1s induces IL-1β release via the dsDNA sensor AIM2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hornung et al., 2009</xref>). In this AIM2 assay BAL-0028 and MCC950 did not reduce IL-1β release relative to the vehicle control, while the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wannamaker et al., 2007</xref>) attenuated IL-1β release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). The NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome senses bacterial infection and can be activated by treatment with a needle protein (LFn-BsaL) and protective antigen (PA)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Matico et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). NAIP/NLRC4-dependent IL-1β release was completely blocked by VX-765 but was not inhibited by MCC950 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). BAL-0028 did not inhibit IL-1β release up to 1 μM but did reduce IL-1β at the highest dose of 10 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Cell death induced by AIM2 and NLRC4 was not affected by BAL-0028 or MCC950; at 10 μM VX-765 also did not inhibit cell death, as higher concentrations are required to block LDH relative to IL-1β release(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Schneider et al., 2017</xref>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2A-B</xref>). NLRP1 is highly expressed in human keratinocytes and can be activated by the small molecule dipeptidyl peptidase inhibitor Talabostat (Val-boroPro)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Zhong et al., 2018</xref>). BAL-0028 and MCC950 have no effect on NLRP1-dependent IL-18 release, but it was completely blocked by VX-765 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>). Together these data show that BAL-0028 specifically inhibits NLRP3 but not the AIM2, NLRC4, or NLRP1 inflammasomes.</p><p id="P12">Thus far, our data show that BAL-0028 is a specific inhibitor of NLRP3 in human myeloid cells. However, to advance BAL-0028 into <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in mice we needed to determine its effects in mouse cells. Surprisingly, upon activation of NLRP3 by LPS and nigericin in the mouse macrophage cell line J774A.1 the IC<sub>50</sub> of BAL-0028 for IL-1β release is increased to &gt;6 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). This is a 114-fold increase over the IC<sub>50</sub> for human THP-1s in the same assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), and contrasts with MCC950 whose IC<sub>50</sub> is highly consistent between the two cell lines (5.3 nM and 14.3 nM). We hypothesized that this difference in potency of BAL-0028 could be due to species differences in NLRP3. We therefore examined the effects of BAL-0028 and MCC950 on IL-1β release in NLRP3 activation assays (LPS + nigericin) in a range of mammalian monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-G</xref>). In cells from rat, dog, and rabbit BAL-0028 does not block IL-1β release, whereas MCC950 potently inhibits NLRP3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-D</xref>). We next examined species more closely related to humans. In cells from African Green and Cynomolgus monkeys (<italic>Chlorocebus sabaeus</italic> and <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) BAL-0028 inhibits NLRP3-dependent IL-1β release with a potency similar to that observed for human myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E-G</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 B, E-H</xref>). BAL-0028 thus appears to be a selective inhibitor of primate NLRP3 with significantly reduced potency in other species.</p><p id="P13">To confirm whether the difference in response to BAL-0028 observed in our human and mouse cell assays was due to species differences in NLRP3, we obtained a humanized NLRP3 mouse previously generated by Koller and colleagues where the <italic>Nlrp3</italic> locus is deleted and replaced with syntenic human <italic>NLRP3</italic> DNA including the human promoter region(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Snouwaert et al., 2016</xref>).

As expected in the WT cells BAL-0028 did not significantly inhibit IL-1β or LDH release triggered by LPS and nigericin treatment while MCC950 potently blocked NLRP3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig 3A</xref>). However, in the <italic>NLRP3</italic> cells BAL-0028 inhibits NLRP3 activation, blocking both IL-1β and LDH release with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 14.7 nM for IL-1β release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3B</xref>).

These data indicate that the species specificity of BAL-0028 is determined by inherent differences in NLRP3 protein structure between primates and other mammals. This is a remarkable finding as mouse and human NLRP3 are highly conserved(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Putnam et al., 2023</xref>). To try and identify areas that may distinguish primate NLRP3 we performed a multiple sequence alignment comparing NLRP3<sup>NACHT</sup> from various species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3E</xref>). We focused on the NACHT domain since BAL-0028 was identified via a DEL screen using NLRP3 lacking the N-terminal PYD and was shown to interact with a construct lacking both the PYD and LRR domains in a surface plasmon resonance assay, indicating that BAL-0028 interacts with the NACHT domain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hartman et al., 2024</xref>). While the amino acid sequences are generally conserved, there is a cluster of residues in the FISNA that are distinct between humans and primates relative to mouse and other mammals. Therefore, the FISNA domain may be an important determinant in how BAL-0028 interacts with NLRP3.</p><p id="P14">To examine the mechanism of action of BAL-0028 we next tested its activity in an <italic>in vitro</italic> ATPase assay, as many small molecule NLRP3 inhibitors such as MCC950 have been found to block NLRP3 ATPase activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Coll et al., 2022</xref>).

In contrast, BAL-0028 did not have any inhibitory effect on NLRP3 ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). This confirms that the mechanism of action of BAL-0028 is distinct from MCC950 and does not involve NLRP3 ATPase inhibition.</p><p id="P15">We next examined where BAL-0028 may be interacting with NLRP3. We performed cell-based drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assays with full length human NLRP3 and NLRP3 lacking the LRR domain (NLRP3 amino acids 1-668) using BAL-0028 and MCC950. Both BAL-0028 and MCC950 prevented protease mediated degradation of NLRP3 relative to DMSO control as shown by the stabilization of bands in the immunoblots for NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 4 A-C</xref>). These data support the conclusion that BAL-0028 does not interact with the LRR and instead interacts with the central NACHT region of NLRP3.</p><p id="P16">We further investigated BAL-0028’s interaction with NLRP3 using a nano-differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) approach with recombinant NLRP3 lacking the PYD and LRR domains (NLRP3<sup>NACHT</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Both BAL-0028 and MCC950 increase the apparent melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) of NLRP3<sup>NACHT</sup> indicating that they bind to and stabilize NLRP3<sup>NACHT</sup>. The change in T<sub>m</sub> was ∼11.5ºC for MCC950 and ∼4ºC for BAL-0028 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Interestingly, in a competition assay where MCC950 is prebound to NLRP3<sup>NACHT</sup>, the addition of BAL-0028 further stabilizes the protein with an increase in T<sub>m</sub> of almost 3ºC whereas additional MCC950 increases the melting temperature only by 1.3°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). These experiments demonstrate that BAL-0028 directly binds to NLRP3<sup>NACHT</sup> at a site that is distinct from the MCC950 binding pocket.</p><p id="P17">BAL-0028 has very high mouse plasma protein binding with ∼99.9% of the compound bound to plasma components (Table 1) and is therefore not optimal for use in <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy studies. To address this, we generated a derivative of BAL-0028, BAL-0598 (with improved pharmacokinetic properties that is approximately 16 times less mouse plasma protein bound (98.39% ± 0.49%) and therefore more compatible with <italic>in vivo</italic> administration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 1</xref>). For <italic>in vivo</italic> studies we elected to use 129S6 mice where human <italic>NLRP3</italic> is regulated by the mouse promoter, as they have increased responses to LPS compared to human promoter <italic>NLRP3</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Koller et al., 2024</xref>).

To examine NLRP3 inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic> we performed a well characterized model of peritonitis using intraperitoneal (IP) injection of LPS followed by ATP where IL-1β production in the peritoneal cavity is NLRP3-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 5B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Daniels et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Pan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Perregaux et al., 2001</xref>). We observe a dose-dependent decrease of IL-1β in mice that received an oral dose of BAL-0598 prior to NLRP3 activation with ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). IL-6 levels were not attenuated by any dose of BAL-0598 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). The effective dose (ED<sub>50</sub>) of BAL-0598 to reduce the IL-1β response by half is approximately 28.6 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To better understand how systemic exposure of BAL-0598 correlates to IL-1β release in the peritoneal cavity, <italic>in vivo</italic> potency was determined by plotting the unbound plasma levels of BAL-0598 against the absolute IL-1β concentrations measured in the peritoneal lavage fluid (PLF) of individual mice. Just prior to lavage of the peritoneal cavity, terminal plasma samples were collected, and the total plasma concentrations of BAL-0598 were determined by LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 5C</xref>). The unbound BAL-0598 equivalent for each mouse was then calculated using the mean unbound protein plasma binding value of 1.61% (Supp. Table 1). The <italic>in vivo</italic> dose-response inhibition curve indicates that after oral dosing, the unbound systemic exposure of BAL-0598 required to reduce the IL-1β response by half is approximately 17.9 nM, and by 90% is 30.6 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>).

NLRP3 or NLRP3-AID mutant expression is induced by doxycycline treatment in U937s and NLRP3 is activated by stimulation with LPS and nigericin. We selected eight NLRP3-AID gain-of-function mutations including known mutations shown to be relatively insensitive to MCC950 inhibition (D303H, L353P, G569R) and well characterized constitutively active mutants (A352, K565E, E567G, K568N, Y570C)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cosson et al., 2024</xref>). Pre-treatment of wild-type NLRP3 with MCC950 or BAL-0028 (40-1000 nM) dose-dependently inhibits cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). However, in NLRP3 mutant cells MCC950 fails to inhibit (D303H, L353P) or partially inhibits cell death at 1000 nM (A352V, K565E, E567G, K568N, G569R, Y570C), as expected. In contrast, BAL-0028 potently inhibits A352V, K565E, E567G, K568N, G569R at levels similar to wild-type NLRP3, and partially inhibits D303H, L353P, and Y570C at 1000 nM. These data demonstrate the ability of BAL-0028 to inhibit disease associated NLRP3 mutations, and particularly those that may be insensitive to MCC950-like small molecules.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">Previous efforts to identify NLRP3 inhibitors have largely focused on cell based phenotypic screens in mouse and human myeloid cells. As NLRP3 activation is a highly complex process involving multiple priming and activation mechanisms for different stimuli(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">McKee and Coll, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Swanson et al., 2019</xref>), deconvolving ‘hits’ from such cellular screens can be extremely challenging. We therefore chose an alternative approach and employed a DEL screen to identify compounds that interact with recombinant NLRP3, yielding the lead compound BAL-0028(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hartman et al., 2024</xref>). Here we have characterized the mode of action of BAL-0028 in depth, benchmarking it with the tool molecule MCC950. We observe that BAL-0028 inhibits NLRP3 signaling in a range of human cell types and in response to multiple NLRP3 stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). BAL-0028 is a specific inhibitor of NLRP3 as it does not prevent activation of the NLRP1, NLRC4 or AIM2 inflammasomes and does not affect LPS-induced signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). In these human cell-based NLRP3 activation assays, BAL-0028 effectively phenocopies MCC950 albeit at slightly higher concentrations.</p><p id="P21">Surprisingly, when we examined BAL-0028 in mouse macrophages we noticed a highly significant decrease in its ability to inhibit NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). A recent study also described an NLRP3 inhibitor NDT-0796 that is active in human cells but inactive in mouse macrophages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Smolak et al., 2024</xref>). This difference was because NDT-0796 is a pro-drug that must be metabolized by carboxylesterase-1 (CES-1) into its active form, and mouse macrophages do not express CES-1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Smolak et al., 2024</xref>). As BAL-0028 does not contain a carboxylate this explanation for the species differences observed was unlikely. A molecule termed J114 that inhibits both NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes is also reported to be significantly less potent in mouse macrophages relative to human cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Jiao et al., 2022</xref>). However, the reason for this species difference was not examined. We chose to explore the ability of BAL-0028 to inhibit NLRP3 in other species, and while BAL-0028 could not inhibit rat, dog, or rabbit NLRP3, it potently blocked monkey NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). BAL-0028 is thus active in humans and closely related monkey species, making it the first primate specific NLRP3 inhibitor to be reported. This species specificity is surprising given the high sequence conservation of the NACHT domain in mammalian NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>), but is consistent with the use of human NLRP3 protein in the DEL-screening assay. In line with this, our studies using 129S6 mice expressing human NLRP3 unequivocally show that the potency of BAL-0028 is dependent on the differences between mouse and human NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Thus, even subtle changes in NLRP3 structure between mouse and human can be exploited for drug development. While much of our knowledge of inflammasome biology has been informed by mouse models there are many differences in inflammasome structure, expression, and regulation in humans. For example, NLRP1 biology has significantly advance in recent years due to studies on keratinocytes which express NLRP1 in humans but not in mice. NLRP1 is also structurally distinct in mouse where it lacks a PYD domain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Barry et al., 2023</xref>). There are also two families of regulatory proteins termed Pyrin only proteins (POPs) and CARD-only proteins (COPs) that only arose in the primate lineage. COPs and POPs are known to regulate inflammasome formation and signaling, but functional studies have been relatively limited as they are not expressed in mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Devi et al., 2020</xref>). Our work highlights the importance of performing screens using human proteins and cell systems to capture these important biological differences in the immune system.</p><p id="P22">The species-specific effects of BAL-0028 also reveal a clear difference with MCC950, which inhibited NLRP3 in all species tested. Our mechanistic studies further show that BAL-0028 does not inhibit the ATPase activity of NLRP3 distinguishing it from MCC950 and many other NLRP3 inhibitors such as CY-09 that appear to converge on inhibiting NLRP3 via blocking this ATPase activity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Coll et al., 2022</xref>). We conclusively show that BAL-0028 binds to NLRP3 in the NACHT domain using DARTS and nanoDSF assays. Indeed, our nanoDSF analysis reveal a novel synergistic stabilization of NLRP3<sup>NACHT</sup> by BAL-0028 in the presence of MCC950 showing that they bind at different sites of the protein. BAL-0028 therefore inhibits NLRP3 by a mechanism distinct from MCC950 and many other previously characterized NLRP3 inhibitors. Based on our analysis of NLRP3 sequences we speculate that BAL-0028 may interact in the FISNA subdomain of the NLRP3<sup>NACHT</sup>, although it is not currently understood how this proposed binding interaction is consistent with the computer-aided drug design (CADD) binding site prediction previously published for BAL-0028(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hartman et al., 2024</xref>). While we have not experimentally identified the specific binding site of BAL-0028, this is the subject of ongoing structural biology studies.</p><p id="P23">For the future development of BAL-0028 related compounds establishing <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy is important. As a first step we demonstrated that BAL-0028 is active in <italic>ex vivo</italic> human whole blood NLRP3 assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>); however, we developed an analogue BAL-0598 for <italic>in vivo</italic> studies due to the high plasma protein binding of BAL-0028. In the human NLRP3 129S6 mice in a peritonitis model we show that BAL-0598 dose dependently blocks IL-1β release but not IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Furthermore, our <italic>in vivo</italic> peritonitis studies indicate that <italic>ex vivo</italic> cell-based potency assays performed in peritoneal macrophages underestimated the <italic>in vivo</italic> potency after oral dosing of BAL-0598, based on the <italic>in vivo</italic> dose-response inhibition curve derived from unbound BAL-0598 plasma values and absolute IL-1β in the PLF.</p><p id="P24">Using a cell-based model of NLRP3-AID we show that BAL-0028 can also inhibit gain-of-function NLRP3 mutations. All the mutations we examined are in the NACHT within the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) or helical domain (HD2) causing constitutively active or hyperactive NLRP3 variants. A number of these mutations (D303H, K568N, Y570C) are known to cause the severe NLRP3-AID neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) (Infevers Database) and include several somatic mutations (D303H, K565E, E567G, K568N, Y570C)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cosson et al., 2024</xref>). BAL-0028 was able to fully or partially inhibit these highly pathogenic NLRP3 mutations, suggesting that BAL-0028 or its derivatives can be effective treatments for many NLRP3-AID disease variants. Importantly, for all these mutations BAL-0028 was a more effective inhibitor than MCC950. BAL-0028 or its derivatives may thus be an alternative therapeutic modality for NLRP3-AID patients that may not respond to MCC950-derived molecules.</p><p id="P25">In summary we have characterized a novel small molecule inhibitor that is potent and specific for primate NLRP3.

To prepare protein-free samples (F samples) for unbound determination, an aliquot of the pre-incubated matrix containing BAL-0598 or control compound was transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes (n=2) and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 37°C, 155000×g (35000rpm) for 4 hr. At the end of the ultracentrifugation, F sample aliquots were taken from the second layer down in the supernatant. To prepare the T4.5 samples, the residual aliquot of pre-incubated spiked plasma was placed into the incubator for 4 hr. These samples were then transferred to new 96 well plates and an equal volume of buffer or plasma was added to each well. Stop solution was then added to these samples and the mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for about 20 minutes. After dialysis or ultracentrifugation, compound levels were determined by LC-MS/MS analysis. Dialysis: %Unbound = 100 × F / T; %Bound = 100 - %Unbound; %Recovery = 100 × (F + T) / T0; F = Free compound concentration as determined by the calculated concentration on the buffer side of the membrane; T = Total compound concentration as determined by the calculated concentration on the matrix side of the membrane; T0 = Total compound concentration as determined by the calculated concentration in matrix before dialysis. Ultracentrifugation: %Unbound = 100 × F / Mean of T4.5; %Bound = 100 - %Unbound; %Remaining = 100 × Mean T4.5 / Mean of T0.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>In vivo LPS/ATP-Induced Peritonitis Mouse Model</title><p id="P58">All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of BioAge Labs (Richmond, CA). Female, 4-mo old 129S6-hNLRP3 mice were group housed during acclimation before experiment and randomized to different treatment group cages on the day of experiment. Mice were housed conventionally in a constant temperature (18–26°C) and humidity (30%–70%) animal room with a 12/12 h light/dark cycle and free access to food (5LG4 - LabDiet® JL Rat and Mouse /Irr 6F) and water (M-WB-300A, Innovive) ad libitum. Temperature and relative humidity were monitored daily. The animals were identified by cage card and tail mark during the study to identify the animal individually.</p><p id="P59">In the peritonitis studies, the mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS at 40 μg/kg, followed two hours later by an intraperitoneal injection of ATP disodium salt at 304.4 mg/kg. Animals not treated with ATP (i.e. Group 1) were dosed with the appropriate volume of PBS. BAL-0598 was administered to fed mice once at 3, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg by oral gavage (PO) at 10 μL/g following facility SOPs. Vehicle (20% propylene glycol + 40% PEG-400 + 10% ethanol) only or BAL-0598 was PO dosed one hour prior to ATP IP administration which approximately corresponded to the plasma T<sub>max</sub> of BAL-0598 (data not shown) at the time of ATP administration. Thirty min after ATP administration, submental bleeds were collected to blood collection tube with EDTA-K<sup>2</sup> (BD 365974). Blood samples were centrifuged at approximately 4°C, 13,000 x g for 10 min to collect plasma to determine total plasma BAL-0598 concentrations by LC-MS/MS (Quintara Discovery, Hayward, CA), and then the mice were immediately euthanized with isoflurane and the peritoneal cavity was lavaged with 3 mL of PBS to collect the PLF. Plasma BAL-0598 levels were determined by LC-MS/MS. The level of mature IL-1β and IL-6 in the PLF was determined by ELISA (R&amp;D Systems).</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>In Vivo IC<sub>50</sub> Determination</title><p id="P60">For in vivo IC<sub>50</sub> determinations, the absolute values of IL-1β in the PLF were plotted against the unbound BAL-0598 concentrations (nM) determined at the time of euthanasia (i.e. 1.5 hr after BAL-0598 or vehicle dosing). Unbound BAL-0598 values were calculated from the total BAL-0598 measured in the plasma of individual mice using an unbound value of 1.61% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 1</xref>). Relative IC<sub>50</sub> values (i.e., the unbound BAL-0598 concentration required to bring the curve down to a point halfway between the “Top” and “Bottom” plateaus of the curve) were calculated by non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad PRISM version 10.1.1. The upper plateaus were anchored using the IL-1b values derived from the vehicle dosed mouse promoter 129S6-hNLRP3 mice treated with LPS + ATP with the unbound BAL-0598 set to a default value of 0.002 nM (one order of magnitude below the LLOQ).</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>U937 expressing NLRP3-AID associated mutant assays</title><p id="P61">NLRP3-deficient U937 cells reconstituted with doxycycline-inducible NLRP3 mutants have been previously described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cosson et al. 2024</xref>). 0.3×10<sup>6</sup> U937 cells/ml were platted in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 GlutaMax™-I supplemented with 1X PS and 10% FBS (Gibco).
