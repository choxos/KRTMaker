sequester substantial amounts of carbon and play a significant role in biogeochemical cycles. However, mechanisms underlying the storage and transport of ions essential for calcification remain unresolved. We used ptychographic X-ray computed tomography under cryogenic conditions to visualize intracellular calcium-rich structures involved in the storage of calcium ions in the coccolithophore species <italic>Chrysotila carterae</italic>. During calcification, we observed a range of structures, from small electron-dense bodies within larger compartments, to denser and distributed globular compartments, before returning to small bodies once scale formation is complete. Nanobeam-scanning X-ray fluorescence measurements further revealed these electron-dense bodies are rich in P and Ca (molar ratio of ~4:1). We infer from the dynamic nature of structures that these bodies are part of required cellular calcium ion transport pathways, a fundamental process critical for understanding the response of coccolithophores to climate change.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Coccolithophores are marine unicellular algae that are among the most prolific calcifiers in the oceans. They produce polycrystalline scales made of calcite called coccoliths, displaying a remarkable ability to orchestrate the multi-level assembly of nano-crystalline building blocks into a higher order structure. Coccolith production is of high importance to Earth’s biogeochemical cycle. Their formation is responsible for the sequestration of large amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> within ocean sediments, forming the largest geological sink of carbon from the ocean/atmosphere reservoir and providing an important stabilizing feedback in Earth’s climate system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> The continuous sinking of the scales to the ocean floor not only provides ballast for the transport of organic matter to the deep sea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> but is also important for the vertical gradient in sea water alkalinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and for a stabilizing feedback in Earth’s climate system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Despite the significance of coccolithophore biomineralization for our environment, we still know little about the mechanisms governing the calcification and how they can be affected by changes in ocean chemistry caused by anthropogenic activity.</p><p id="P3">Coccolith production takes place intracellularly, in a specialized compartment called the coccolith vesicle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> Within, calcite crystals nucleate around the edge of an organic template called the base plate to form a ring of rhombohedral crystals called the proto-coccolith ring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Single crystalline units then extend sideways and outwards, mechanically interlocking as they develop. The growth and overall morphology are controlled by coccolith-associated polysaccharides,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> a constrained space for growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and ion gradients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Once complete, coccoliths, with size in the 1-10 micrometer range, are exocytosed and, together with previously formed scales, form an exoskeleton around the cell called the coccosphere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> The cellular mechanisms that control different aspects of coccolith mineralization are still left to be clarified. One particular area that is not well understood is the mass transport of ions across the cell to the mineralization site. A significant quantity of calcium ions are required to produce condensed mineral phases, which raises questions on how coccolithophores, and eukaryotic cells in general, avoid cytotoxicity. Calcium concentration in the cytosol must be kept around 100 nM to prevent toxicity and eventual cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> For calcite to precipitate, concentrations within the coccolith vesicle must be raised to 100-200 µM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> Cellular pathways are therefore required to transport calcium ions to satisfy the demands of calcification, without raising cytosolic concentrations to fatal levels.</p><p id="P4">Several biomineralizing organisms, including corals, foraminifera and sea urchin larvae, source calcium from the surrounding seawater by endocytosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> Once inside the cell, a hydrated amorphous calcium carbonate phase forms within intracellular vesicles, which are transported to the mineralization site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> In the case of coccolithophores, calcium enters the cell via ion channels on the plasma membrane, before being loaded into endomembrane compartments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> For the coccolithophore <italic>Chrysotila carterae</italic>, calcium ions are delivered to the coccolith vesicle in the form of coccolithosomes, which are electron-dense ~25 nm calcium-associated polysaccharide complexes that originate in the Golgi cisternae.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> Once inside the vesicle, they provide calcium ions for nucleating and growing calcite crystals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">It is unclear how calcium ions are transported across the cell into the Golgi network in order for coccolithosomes to form. Large intracellular pools of calcium and polyphosphates resembling acidocalcisomes, which are storage organelles within numerous prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> were identified in coccolithophores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> The role of these structures in calcification is still debated. While they have been initially proposed to be part of a calcium storage and transport pathway involved in coccolith formation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> subsequent fluorescent studies suggest that the composition, their distribution, and calcium content did not change during coccolith production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> These findings led to the hypothesis that such compartments may function more passively as storage organelles to control and equilibrate calcium concentrations inside the cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> However, calcium-rich structures have mostly been characterised from single snapshots taken across cryogenically or chemically-fixed coccolithophore cells or with confocal microscopy techniques that have limited spatial resolution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> As a result, any dynamic changes that may occur while cells are calcifying could remain undetected.</p><p id="P6">To investigate the potentially hidden dynamic pathways that transport calcium through the cell during calcification, we determined how calcium-rich structures change in distribution and density during this process. For this, whole cells of the coccolithophore <italic>C. carterae</italic> were imaged using ptychographic X-ray computed tomography in cryogenic conditions (cryoPXCT). X-ray ptychography is a quantitative 3D microscopy approach, which provides access to the mass density at the sub-micrometer scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> Additionally, nanobeam-scanning X-ray fluorescence (nXRF) was used to determine the calcium content of these dense structures and assess their overall elemental composition. We identified that the distribution of calcium ions in intracellular structures changed across the window in which calcification was taking place. These findings will strengthen our overall understanding of the calcium transport pathways employed by coccolithophore cells to facilitate the demands of coccolith production.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Calcium-rich structures in <italic>C. carterae</italic> cells</title><p id="P7">Actively calcifying cells of the coccolithophore <italic>C. carterae</italic> were treated with 0.1 M EDTA for 5 min in order to remove their external coccoliths, before being incubated in low calcium medium for 24 h to inhibit mineralization. Calcium was then reintroduced to the medium to restart calcification. After 4, 8, 12 and 24 h of incubation, cells were loaded into glass capillaries, plunge-frozen in liquid ethane, and analysed using cryoPXCT at -180 °C. This synchrotron-source based technique provided 3D reconstructions with quantitative electron density information and spatial resolution in the 10-100 nm range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> Data segmentation was achieved based on the electron density of the cellular structures, evidencing extracellular and intracellular coccoliths, along with the intracellular organelles and compartments. The longer cells were incubated in calcium-replete medium, more coccoliths were produced and the coccosphere became more developed. A degree of variability in the rate of formation of the coccosphere was observed at each incubation time, and therefore the cells were categorized according to the stages of formation of their coccospheres, going from stage 1 (only few coccoliths formed) to stage 4 (most of the coccosphere complete). This is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure. 1</xref>, where an example of one cell at each state of formation is shown. In stage 1, few external coccoliths were present (in yellow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a-b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). In stage 2, 15-20 external coccoliths were spread around the cell surface (in yellow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c-d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>). In stage 3, the coccosphere was more complete, with adjacent coccoliths starting to connect (in yellow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Movie 3</xref>). At these three stages of coccosphere formation, the majority of cells contained intracellular coccoliths (coloured as red for sake of clarity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>); indicating calcification was actively taking place within. Finally, in stage 4 large parts of the coccosphere were complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g-h</xref>, yellow). While a forming coccolith can be observed in the cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g-h</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Movie 4</xref>), three cells out of six at this stage contained no intracellular mineral structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Movie 5</xref> depicts the reconstructions of all 6 cells in this stage). In all cases, additional features were visible alongside the intracellular and external coccoliths, including structures with electron density between 0.42 and 0.62 n<sub>e</sub>Å<sup>-3</sup> (dark blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and organelles and compartments with electron density between 0.37-0.40 n<sub>e</sub>Å<sup>-3</sup> that were either empty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, turquoise) or containing the denser structures with electron density between 0.42 and 0.62 n<sub>e</sub>Å<sup>-3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, pink).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Composition of the dense intracellular deposits in <italic>C. carterae</italic></title><p id="P8">As the electron density for most cellular bodies is reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> to be up to 0.35 n<sub>e</sub>Å<sup>-3</sup>, we hypothesize that that the structures with values of 0.37 n<sub>e</sub>Å<sup>-3</sup> and higher contain heavier elements, with calcium being a likely candidate considering that it is stored inside intracellular compartments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> To verify this hypothesis, we determined the elemental composition of the dense intracellular structures by nano-scanning X-ray fluorescence (nXRF). Subsequently, using our cryoPXCT data, we analysed their distribution inside the cells across the different stages of calcification to determine if any dynamic changes in the intracellular localization of calcium during coccosphere formation could be observed.</p><p id="P9"><italic>C. carterae</italic> cells were collected after 4 h in Ca-replete medium, dried on substrate and then imaged by nano-scanning X-ray fluorescence (nXRF). In this approach, the signal is summed along the beam propagation direction, so that the presented image corresponds to an integration of the signal along the cell thickness. Differential phase contrast (DPC) was collected simultaneously with nXRF to provide a reference image of the coccolithophore cell measured (See Materials and Methods). DPC maps of two cells are presented in the first column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a-b</xref> both showing one associated coccolith. In the two subsequent columns are elemental maps of Ca and P (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> shows representative fitting examples for nXRF datasets), which have XRF signals pertaining to coccolithophore cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> shows S Kα XRF signals pertaining to concentrated cellular material observed with DPC). The Ca Kα XRF signal is strongly associated with coccolith materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) but can also be observed in distinct regions of the cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). These regions are also dominated by the P Kα XRF signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) and are comparable in appearance to the roundish structures in cryoPXCT tomograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>), though slightly larger due to flattening effects from drying. Cell 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>) contains many more dense compartments than Cell 1; considering that cells at Stage 2 are characterized by larger numbers of dense bodies that Stage 1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), it suggests that Cell 2 was at a later stage of calcification (e.g., see Stage 2 cryoPXCT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). It is expected that lower electron density features (e.g., 0.37-0.40 n<sub>e</sub>Å<sup>-3</sup>) are less discernible with nXRF and that their structural preservation is likely lost.</p><p id="P10">The semi-quantitative elemental composition (standard reference calibrated, substrate background- and area-corrected signals) of the denser features and the cell background is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>. Most notable is the ~11-fold increase of P and ~4-fold increase of Ca in dense compartments compared to the cell background. Other elements, such as Mn and Fe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), are lower in concentration compared to Ca and P and likely have little contribution to the electron density values measured from cryoPXCT data. In addition to the increase of P and Ca in the compartments, the relative ratio of these quantities changes from a P/Ca of ~1.1 in the cell background to ~3.3, converting mass to eq. moles, mol P / mol Ca of ~4.2. Altogether, this analysis shows that dense compartments in calcifying <italic>C. carterae</italic> cells contain a high concentration of P in addition to Ca.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Stage 1 – Start of coccosphere formation</title><p id="P11">Following the identification of electron-dense structures as Ca-P-rich bodies by nXRF, we analysed in detail their dynamics as a function of development stage of the coccosphere using cryoPXCT. One cell at stage 1 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>. A 2D cross-section across the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>) and 3D visualisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b and c</xref>) highlight the presence of an organellar network (turquoise) with a uniform electron density of 0.40 n<sub>e</sub>Å<sup>-3</sup>, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions were homogeneously distributed inside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d and e</xref>). We postulate that this organellar network corresponds to the endoplasmic reticulum, consistent with its morphology and function in calcium storage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> Juxtaposed to this organellar network was one spherical compartment ~3 µm in diameter, with an electron density of 0.38 n<sub>e</sub>Å<sup>-3</sup>.

It is conceivable that these represent the onset of calcite deposition during the formation of the protococcolith, or a malformed coccolith. A second cell at stage 1, with only one external and no intracellular coccoliths, displayed similar distribution of calcium-rich structures, only with a larger number of dense bodies of electron density of 0.48 n<sub>e</sub>Å<sup>-3</sup> contained within compartments of electron density of 0.37 n<sub>e</sub>Å<sup>-3</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Movie 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Stage 2 – Early stage of coccosphere formation</title><p id="P12">Two cells were analyzed at stage 2 displaying multiple external coccoliths, as well as intracellular ones being formed.

The morphology and distribution of the electron-dense Ca-P-rich bodies were vastly different compared to those present at stage 1: they were significantly more abundant, had globular shapes, and were clustered into a network-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>, arrow, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b and c</xref> in blue), resembling those described by cryo-X-ray tomography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> The size of the bodies varied, with some as small as 350 nm, while others reached up to 1.7 µm. Their electron densities had also significantly risen compared to stage 1, with maximum values now between 0.57 and 0.61 n<sub>e</sub>Å<sup>-3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure. 4d and e</xref>).

Electron density values in these bodies were within the same range as those freely distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4h</xref>).

A similar distribution of intracellular structures and Ca-P-rich bodies was present in other cells imaged at the same time point, both with and without intracellular coccoliths (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Movies 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">5</xref>).</p><p id="P15">From the electron density distribution in the intracellular compartments across the different stages of formation of the coccosphere, we infer that calcium ions were distributed in intracellular structures in two different forms across the time window in which cells were actively calcifying. At the start (stage 1) and towards the end of the formation of the coccosphere (stage 4), calcium ions were dispersed in an organellar network (turquoise in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). We posit that this network corresponds to the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, they were being concentrated in small bodies contained within larger compartments that were in proximity with the endoplasmic reticulum network. Between these time points, calcium storage switched to being heavily concentrated exclusively inside globular, electron-dense bodies. This transition indicates that ion concentrations can be dynamically altered in the calcium-rich structures to fulfil the demands of coccosphere formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">The changes in the morphology, intracellular distribution and electron density of the calcium-rich bodies and compartments during coccosphere formation reported in this study demonstrates the dynamic nature of these structures in the coccolithophore <italic>C. carterae</italic>. At the start of the formation of the coccosphere – when the first coccoliths are being produced – calcium ions were homogeneously dispersed in the endoplasmic reticulum and concentrated in ~300 nm sized Ca-P-rich bodies located within spherical compartments. As the formation of the coccosphere proceeded, the Ca-P-rich bodies increased in size, electron density and number, resembling those reported in <italic>C. carterae</italic> cells in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> The endoplasmic reticulum was no longer distinguishable, indicating it had electron density values similar to those of the adjacent cellular structures, likely because of decreased calcium ion content. As the coccosphere neared completion, the distribution of dense bodies resembled the state of the earliest stage.</p><p id="P17">For the cryoPXCT measurements, individual capillaries were prepared containing cells that were harvested after spending different periods in calcium replete medium: 4h, 8h, 12h and 24h. Notably, the capillaries frozen after 8h and 12h contained cells at different stages of formation of the coccosphere: one cell at stage 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) and one at stage 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) were found after 8h; one cell at stage 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>) and two cells at stage 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>) were present after 12h. These observations show that each cell likely started calcifying at different rates after being transferred from calcium-deplete to calcium-replete medium. Importantly, the distribution of calcium ions between the endoplasmic reticulum and Ca-P-dense bodies was related to the activity of the formation of the coccosphere, rather than the time spent in calcium-replete medium. Therefore, we attribute the distribution of calcium in these structures, as well as their sizes and morphologies, to not be primarily influenced by external ion concentrations. Instead, we suggest calcium distribution across the endoplasmic reticulum and Ca-P-rich bodies correlates to the calcification process, namely the mobilization and transport of calcium ions to the coccolith vesicle for coccolith formation. Calcium ions enter the cell via voltage-gated channels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> where they are proposed to be partitioned directly into endomembrane-derived organelles, among them the endoplasmic reticulum, to avoid cytosolic concentrations interfering with calcium signalling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> The association of the endoplasmic reticulum, rich in calcium ions, with the 1-2 µm spherical compartments containing the dense Ca-P-rich bodies suggests a connection between these two organelles. It is conceivable that calcium ions are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the spherical compartments where they form complexes with polyphosphates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> to form dense bodies with a P to Ca molar ratio of ~4:1, according to our nXRF measurements, enabling high concentration storage of calcium ions. The dynamics between these two organelles changes as a function of coccosphere formation, likely in response to the high demand for calcium ions for coccolith formation. In this case, the Ca-P-rich bodies increase in size and number, consuming calcium ions stored in the endoplasmic reticulum, from where they are further mobilized for coccolith formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> As the coccosphere nears completion, coccolith production slows down, decreasing the demand for calcium ions which accumulate again in the endoplasmic reticulum. This model is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p id="P18">It has been suggested that calcium-rich compartments and Ca-P-rich dense bodies are present in coccolithophores independent of calcification activity, possibly providing an alternate function to the cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> Spectroscopic studies, however, indicate that ions from the dense bodies become incorporated into the coccolith crystal lattice, which requires a mechanism to transport calcium from the Ca-P-rich bodies into the coccolith vesicle. Our study shows that the dense bodies fluctuate in electron density and number across coccosphere development, supporting the hypothesis that they alter their ion capacity and function as dynamic calcium reservoirs in response to the demands of biomineral formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>This dynamic function could facilitate the transfer of calcium from the dense bodies to the coccolith vesicle. This pathway requires the transport of ions through the Golgi cisternae, where coccolithosomes – 25 nm calcium-polysaccharide complexes that deliver calcium ions to the coccolith vesicle – originate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> The presence of these particles could not be confirmed by cryoPXCT as they are below the resolution limit of this imaging technique.</p><p id="P19">Due to their resemblance to acidocalcisomes, it appears that calcium-rich pools existed prior to coccolithophore calcification and may have been adapted to store and transport the large quantities of calcium to facilitate mineral formation. Intracellular calcium pools are not a common feature of the biomineralization process, absent in most mineralizing organisms, with ions instead transported alongside carbonate in ACC-containing vesicles derived from the endocytosis of seawater.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> Calcium-rich pools have been reported in dinoflagellates, which, like coccolithophores, transport calcium ions into the cell via gated channels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> In dinoflagellates, the calcium-rich bodies are generally associated with extending the mineral front, similar to the ACC-vesicles in other biomineralizing organisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> It is possible that alternate transport pathways may have developed in coccolithophores as a result of crystallization occurring in an intracellular environment. It is also possible that several undetected pathways for ion delivery might exist, varying from species to species, with possible influence from the external cellular environmental conditions.</p><p id="P20">In conclusion, the findings reported in this study reveal new insights into the role of intracellular calcium-rich structures in coccolithophore calcification. By characterising the calcium distributions during <italic>C. carterae</italic> calcification, we have determined that calcium-storage compartments and Ca-P-rich bodies act as dynamic reservoirs which are able to fluctuate the quantity of ions contained within. These observations indicate that such structures are integral components of the transport pathways responsible for shuttling calcium ions across the cell during calcification. They therefore play an important role in the storage and mobilization of these ions without posing a risk of cytotoxicity.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="S11"><title>Culturing</title><p id="P21">Cultures of <italic>Chrysotila carterae</italic> (944/6) were obtained from the Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa (CCAP), Oban, Scotland.
