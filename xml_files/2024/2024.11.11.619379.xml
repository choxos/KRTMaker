Any particular motif model has potential flaws due to shortcomings of the underlying experimental data and computational motif discovery algorithm. As a part of the Codebook/GRECO-BIT initiative, here we evaluated at large scale the cross-platform recognition performance of positional weight matrices (PWMs), which remain popular motif models in many practical applications. We applied ten different DNA motif discovery tools to generate PWMs from the “Codebook” data comprised of 4,237 experiments from five different platforms profiling the DNA-binding specificity of 394 human proteins, focusing on understudied transcription factors of different structural families. For many of the proteins, there was no prior knowledge of a genuine motif. By benchmarking-supported human curation, we constructed an approved subset of experiments comprising about 30% of all experiments and 50% of tested TFs which displayed consistent motifs across platforms and replicates. We present the Codebook Motif Explorer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mex.autosome.org">https://mex.autosome.org</ext-link>), a detailed online catalog of DNA motifs, including the top-ranked PWMs, and the underlying source and benchmarking data. We demonstrate that in the case of high-quality experimental data, most of the popular motif discovery tools detect valid motifs and generate PWMs, which perform well both on genomic and synthetic data. Yet, for each of the algorithms, there were problematic combinations of proteins and platforms, and the basic motif properties such as nucleotide composition and information content offered little help in detecting such pitfalls. By combining multiple PMWs in decision trees, we demonstrate how our setup can be readily adapted to train and test binding specificity models more complex than PWMs. Overall, our study provides a rich motif catalog as a solid baseline for advanced models and highlights the power of the multi-platform multi-tool approach for reliable mapping of DNA binding specificities.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P3"><fig id="F6" position="anchor"><label>Graphical Abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS200091-f006"/></fig>

Thus, knowledge of DNA patterns, the “motifs”, specifically recognized by TFs, is essential for annotating gene regulatory regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, interpreting regulatory variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, and deciphering the logic learned by deep neural networks from genomics data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The traditional and most widely used representation of a motif is the position weight matrix (PWM). It has few independent parameters (usually, 3 multiplied by the binding site length) and relies on a simple assumption: independent (additive) contributions of neighboring nucleotides to the overall binding energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Beyond PWMs, there are many advanced models of DNA sequences specifically recognized by TFs that account for interdependent nucleotide contributions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Yet, despite the rapid progress of advanced machine learning applications in TF binding sites (TFBS) modeling, PWMs remain in the bioinformatics toolbox for studying gene regulation, and the databases providing TF binding motifs as PWMs, including CIS-BP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, JASPAR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and HOCOMOCO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, are actively accessed and cited.</p><p id="P5">To construct a motif model such as a PWM, it is necessary to solve the motif discovery problem, i.e. perform pattern recognition in collections of related DNA sequences, such as those bound by TFs. A plethora of experimental approaches have been developed to identify TFBSs in random sequences, complete genomes, or their fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and each of the approaches has its advantages and limitations. For example, the current high-throughput gold standard method for identifying TFBSs genome-wide <italic>in vivo</italic>, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq), has limited resolution and relies on computational analysis to delineate bound regions. While better resolution is achieved with ChIP-exo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> or CUT&amp;RUN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, these methods still require motif modeling to pinpoint the exact binding site locations. Beyond specific interactions of a protein with particular nucleotide patterns, TF binding <italic>in vivo</italic> e.g., revealed by ChIP-Seq, is influenced by many cell type-specific factors: chromatin accessibility, availability of transcription cofactors, or competition with other proteins for the same binding regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Isolating the contribution of the DNA sequence from features of the cellular or genomic contexts is challenging, especially when considering genomic <italic>in vivo</italic> data only. Data obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> avoids these issues and, with synthetic sequences, it is possible to explore the sequence space more uniformly. However, these methods also have their own technical biases, for instance, high-throughput SELEX (HT-SELEX)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> saturates quickly with the strongest binding sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, the binding specificity of a TF ideally should be studied both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> with both synthetic and genomic sequences, using multiple experimental platforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Until now, there have been very few systematic studies evaluating the performance of different motif discovery tools on the outputs of different experimental assays. The well-known large-scale benchmarking of motif discovery algorithms conducted by Tompa <italic>et al</italic>. in 2005<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> took place in the low-throughput era, and did not include any of the current experimental assays. A focused competition organized by Weirauch <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> using <italic>in vitro</italic> protein-binding microarray (PBM) employed ChIP-seq as an external control but did not include motif discovery from experiments other than PBMs. Other studies either compared the performance of motif discovery tools only on simulated data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> or evaluated only pre-existing PWMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Here we present the results of the Gene Regulation Consortium Benchmarking Initiative, GRECO-BIT, an offspring of the GRECO/GREEKC consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> dedicated to building and benchmarking algorithms for DNA motif discovery and TFBS modeling. Here, in collaboration with Codebook, we performed a large-scale motif analysis of newly generated human TF binding data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> obtained through five different experimental assays, using a variety of motif discovery tools followed by systematic benchmarking. Through comparative assessment of the resulting motifs, we developed the Codebook/GRECO-BIT Motif Explorer (Codebook MEX), an interactive catalog of motifs for 394 putative TFs that were analyzed in the Codebook dataset. This resource provides an overview of the efficacy of various tools for PWM-based motif discovery across different experimental platforms and highlights the PWMs with the highest overall rankings, thus laying the foundation for future benchmarking studies and paving the way for improved computational protocols for generating high-quality DNA sequence motifs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P8">In this study, we relied on the data from five experimental platforms used by the Codebook initiative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> to assay the binding specificity of 394 proteins (see ‘Workflow overview’ in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>). The platforms included Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>) and high-throughput SELEX with genomic DNA (GHT-SELEX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>) to delineate genomic locations of TFBSs. The other three methods, standard high-throughput SELEX (HT-SELEX), selective microfluidics-based ligand enrichment followed by sequencing (SMiLE-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>), and protein binding microarray (PBM), were used to assess TF binding to synthetic DNA fragments with random sequences (e.g. 40N random inserts for HT-SELEX or pseudo-random probes in the case of PBMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>). For HT- and GHT-SELEX, there were three variants differing in the protein production method: GST-tagged <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription with <italic>E. coli</italic> extracts (-IVT), GFP-tagged IVT with wheat germ extracts (-GFPIVT), and whole human cell lysate (-Lys). Counting the variants of (G)HT-SELEX separately, at least two types of experiments were performed for 391 TFs. (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplementary Table ST1</xref>, and<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>). The experiments covered many previously unexplored or incompletely profiled TFs, thus complementing existing databases, as well as a number of well-studied TFs (positive controls). To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a large collection of TFs has been assessed in such a diverse set of experiments in parallel. This setup provides a unique opportunity for a cross-platform assessment of the performance of motif discovery tools with motifs derived from one experiment type tested with the data from other types of experiments.</p><p id="P9">For clarity, in this study, we use the term “motif” to refer to a DNA binding specificity pattern, and “PWM” to refer to a motif model with one of two interchangeable representations: (1) a matrix of normalized nucleotide frequencies (also called the Position Frequency Matrix, PFM) or (2) a log-odds position weight matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. We adopted a systematic approach for motif discovery and benchmarking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) starting with uniform preprocessing of the data, such as peak calling (for GHT-SELEX and ChIP-Seq data) and normalization (for PBMs), and splitting results of each experiment into training and test sets (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>). Then, in the first round of motif discovery, we applied nine software tools to the training data of all experiments. We used classic MEME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> software, popular bioinformatics tools from the era of high-throughput data (HOMER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, ChIPMunk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, Autoseed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, STREME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, and Dimont<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>), and advanced methods (ExplaiNN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and, for selected datasets, RCade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and gkmSVM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>). Not all tools were compatible with all data types, e.g., RCade was exclusively used for zinc finger TFs, and a specialized adaptation of Dimont for HT-SELEX (DimontHTS) was used for HT-SELEX data.</p><p id="P10">With the diverse set of platforms and different motif applications, it is not trivial, if at all possible, to select a single universal benchmarking metric of motif performance. Thus, to evaluate the classification performance of all PWMs across the test data from all platforms, we employed multiple dockerized benchmarking protocols from<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, with additions from<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, and adapted methodology for PBMs from<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>). Technically, to scan a DNA sequence with a given motif, most of the employed benchmarking protocols use the sum-occupancy scoring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Specifically for ChIP-Seq and GHT-SELEX peaks, we also ran the HOCOMOCO benchmark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, which considers only a single top-scoring log-odds PWM hit in each sequence, and estimated the CentriMo motif centrality score, which accounts for the distance of the binding site to the peak summits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. To allow for streamlined applicability of existing benchmarking protocols, alternative motif representations from advanced methods were converted to PFMs and PWMs.</p><p id="P11">Many of the TFs were previously uncharacterized, and the initial benchmarking therefore served as the criterion to determine which experiments were successful. To this end, initial benchmarking results underwent human expert curation to approve a subset of successful experiments for detailed analysis. To approve the experiment, we required that either (1) motifs discovered from this experiment were consistently similar between platforms or similar to related known or Codebook TFs and scored highly in different benchmarks or (2) the motifs originating from and high-ranking on other approved experiments scored highly on the test dataset built from the experiment under curation. During curation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>), we took into account known motifs both to validate real cases (positive controls and Codebook TFs from well-studied families) and to exclude artifacts, or “passenger” motifs” besetting multiple independent experiments. As a result, the approved set of experiments encompassed 236 TFs and comprised 1,460 datasets. To expand the motif sets from popular tools (HOMER, MEME, RCade, STREME) and explore another advanced method (ProBound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>), we additionally ran a second round of motif discovery and benchmarking using the “approved” datasets.</p><p id="P12">In total, this effort generated 219,939 PWMs, with 164,350 derived from the approved datasets. Out of these, 158,830 PWMs passed additional automatic filtering for common artifact signals (such as simple repeats and the most widespread ChIP contaminants; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>) and formed the primary motif set for the downstream analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure SF1A, B</xref>). The resulting resource, which includes the train-test sets and 16,812,803 performance estimates, 9,317,269 of which belong to the motifs from approved datasets, is available at ZENODO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Interactive access to both the approved and complete motif collections, alongside the benchmarking results, is provided by the Codebook Motif Explorer (Codebook MEX, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mex.autosome.org">https://mex.autosome.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Motif discovery from diverse experiments requires a diverse toolbox</title><p id="P13">Using the data from approved experiments, we sought to construct a global benchmarking ranking for different motif discovery algorithms across different experimental platforms. To this end, we employed a hierarchical ranking procedure to sequentially identify the top-ranking motifs for each TF and experiment type across multiple individual performance metrics, replicates, and types of experiments, followed by a global TF-level ranking (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We expected that the benchmarking study would reveal different motif discovery tools to be either universally superior or best suited to derive motifs from particular types of experiments. However, these expectations were only partially met. Nearly all software tools contributed to the final collection of the globally top-ranking motifs per TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), i.e., there was no algorithm, in retrospect, that was not worth including (The one possible exception was gkmSVM, which, due to high computational load, was applied only to a subset of ChIP-Seq data, resulting in the smallest initial set of motifs, and was tested here using derived PWMs, rather than its native sequence scanner). Nonetheless, nearly half of the top-ranking motifs in the final collection were generated by a single tool, Dimont. This dominance persisted even when considering the top 20 motifs for each TF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure SF1C</xref>). Furthermore, the proportional contribution of the tools to the collection of top-ranking motifs did not reflect the initial quantity of motifs generated by these tools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, the distribution of experiment types that yielded the top-ranking motifs was more similar to the original composition of the Codebook data: the top-ranking motifs were largely derived from ChIP-Seq and (G)HT-SELEX experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplementary Table ST1</xref>).</p><p id="P15">When considering individual experiment types, we first examined which tool produced the top-ranking motifs across TFs when trained and tested on data from the same type of experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure SF2</xref>). Dimont was the top performer in three categories (GHT-SELEX, ChIP-Seq, PBM), and was competitive for HT-SELEX, which constituted the majority of the data, thus explaining its significant contribution to the global set of top-scoring motifs. ProBound led in HT-SELEX, while ChIPMunk was the second best for many types of experiments, and led for SMiLE-Seq. This comparison highlights tools that excel at capturing experiment-specific motifs, potentially including biases and artifacts in addition to the intrinsic binding specificity of the TF.</p><p id="P16">Next, we conducted a cross-platform analysis, where we assessed TFBS prediction performance for a particular type of experiment using motifs discovered from all other types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure SF2</xref>). Considering top-ranking motifs, Dimont scored highest overall for SMiLE-Seq, HT-SELEX, and ChIP-Seq. Conversely, ChIPMunk excelled with genomic HT-SELEX and MEME with PBMs. Interestingly, ProBound was powerful in predicting PBM and SMiLE-Seq, and to a lesser extent, HT-SELEX, suggesting its ability to capture lower-affinity binding sites common in PBM and SMiLE-Seq data. Analyzing the subtypes of GHT-SELEX and HT-SELEX individually (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure SF3</xref>), the results were similar (Dimont led in GHT-SELEX and ProBound in HT-SELEX), and the observed variability between experiment subtypes likely reflects the differences in the profiled TFs and the signal-to-noise ratios of particular experiments.</p><p id="P17">Summing up, considering overall motif rankings, Dimont excels across the board and particularly at ChIP-Seq, but intra- and cross-platform benchmarking highlight alternative motif discovery tools best suited for TFBS recognition in specific scenarios.</p><sec id="S4"><title>The first motif reported is the best in benchmarking in 75% of cases</title><p id="P18">A single run of a particular motif discovery tool, be it MEME or Dimont, may yield multiple motifs, and ideally it should put the true binding motif at the top of the list. In some datasets, however, the first reported motifs may reflect the binding patterns of a TF cofactor (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. in ChIP-Seq) or even spurious signals such as artificially enriched sequences (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. aptamers in HT-SELEX). Yet, these examples are usually experiment-specific and unlikely to be ranking highly in the overall benchmarking across different platforms. Thus, motifs ranked higher in the overall benchmarking should have a higher probability of reflecting the true binding specificity.</p><p id="P19">For each run of a motif discovery tool on a particular dataset for a particular TF, we took the first three reported motifs (excluding common artifact signals, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>), and located them in the overall benchmarking ranking (that includes motifs from all programs and all datasets for the TF). In about 75% of cases (runs of a particular software using a particular training dataset that yielded more than one motif), in the global benchmarking, the first reported motifs indeed scored higher than the other two (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure SF4A</xref>). However, in the remaining 25% of cases, the highest-ranked motifs from a particular motif discovery run were not the first in the software output, i.e., the internal ranking of the motif discovery tools failed to distinguish what we assume are the proper signals. In real-life scenarios, this percentage could be even higher as <italic>a priori</italic> pre-filtering of common artifacts would not be possible without multi-platform data. Therefore, in practice, secondary motifs reported by motif discovery tools must be considered in downstream analyses. Of note, Dimont and ChIPMunk stood out in this test and for these tools, the first reported motifs were relevant in 90-95% of cases.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Quantitative analysis of motif performance</title><p id="P20">While ranking analysis provides a bird’s eye view, it does not reveal the actual performance difference between the winning and runner-up motifs. To compare the motifs and the motif discovery tools quantitatively, we introduced an overall metric of motif performance across different benchmarks and datasets yielded by a particular experimental platform. Briefly (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref> for more details), for each quadruple of a TF, a dataset, a benchmark (e.g. binary classification of bound and non-bound sequences), and a performance metric (e.g. auROC) we rescaled the values across motifs into the range [0,1], 0 corresponding to the worst and 1 to the best of values achieved by different motifs. The overall performance of a motif is the average of those rescaled values across all metrics and experiments of a particular type. For each TF and each motif discovery tool, we then selected representative motifs achieving the highest overall performance in the intra- and cross-platform analysis with particular target experiment types.</p><p id="P21"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> displays the median and the interquartile range (IQR) of the overall performance of representative motifs across TFs assayed in the intra- and cross-platform fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). In these tests, we expected the tools with wider applicability across TFs to yield a higher median and lower IQR. In the intra-platform comparison, HT-SELEX appeared to be the most agnostic to the motif discovery tool, as the median overall performance was consistently high with low IQR across TFs for all tools. In contrast, the largest differences between tools were observed for SMiLE-Seq data. From the tool-centric perspective, the mean performance of Dimont, ChIPMunk, and Autoseed was stable across TFs and platforms, although MEME and HOMER were not far behind. RCade performance on SMiLE-Seq data is noteworthy, as it was applied only to a small subset of TFs, but the resulting motifs displayed a strong performance. Finally, ExplaiNN could not quantitatively compete with other tools when trained and validated on genomic regions, potentially due to a lower-than-necessary volume of available training data. In the cross-platform setting, the differences between the tools lessened: all conventional tools (MEME, STREME, HOMER, ChIPMunk, Dimont) performed comparably well. We rationalize this outcome by the fact that the representative motifs were collected across platforms allowing each tool to avoid individual within-platform pitfalls, although gkmSVM displayed acceptable median results despite being trained on ChIP-Seq data only. Still, the IQR was high for many specific combinations of tools and experiment types, i.e., depending on a TF, any single tool can fail to properly capture a universally applicable motif even with multiple attempts across platforms, despite performing satisfactorily on average.</p><p id="P22">The scaling used to obtain the overall motif performance estimates conceals the information on the absolute efficacy of a tool. Indeed, even if all the tested motifs are of very high quality and achieve the auROC over 0.9 on a particular dataset, the respective scaled values are still stretched across the [0,1] band. To obtain more interpretable performance estimates, we plotted the distribution of the raw values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC, computed with sum-occupancy PFM scoring as in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>) using top-ranking motifs from each tool. Violin plots illustrate the distribution of raw auROC values across TFs and test datasets for ChIP-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) or GHT-SELEX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) data. The values reached by Dimont are consistently higher than those of other tools and close to those of the best PWMs (selected irrespectively of the tool), with the median auROC across TFs and datasets over 0.85 for both ChIP-Seq and GHT-SELEX. A different performance metric, asymptotic pseudo-auROC (computed with best log-odds PWM best hits as in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>), was less discriminative between tools (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure SF4B</xref>).</p><p id="P23">The diversity of experimental platforms allows for answering another important question: whether protein binding experiments with synthetic oligonucleotides provide motifs suitable for reliable prediction of genomic binding sites. For different TFs, and different datasets, we plotted the distributions of difference between the maximal auROC values achieved with the genomic data (ChIP-Seq and GHT-SELEX) by motifs obtained from the genomic and the synthetic data (HT-SELEX, SMiLE-Seq, PBM), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, B</xref>. Overall, we observed a visible drop of auROC median of -0.1 to -0.2 depending on the tool, meaning that the genomic binding sites remain difficult to predict with motifs from synthetic data even when using multiple motif discovery tools. In extreme cases, for some datasets, the auROC dropped extremely low (ΔauROC &lt; -0.5). However, there were many cases with only a marginal decrease of auROC as the area around ΔauROC near 0.0 is densely populated for many motif discovery tools.</p><p id="P24">A thorough analysis of the overall performance of motifs for all pairs of platforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure SF5</xref>) reveals that there are subsets of motifs achieving very high scores at the training and the test experiment types simultaneously for almost any “training-test” combination of platforms. In particular, there are motifs identified from the synthetic data, which perform equally well on the genomic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). Further, the overall performance at the training and the test data types are highly correlated, suggesting that motif performance measurements with successful experiments from any platform are predictive regarding motif applicability to other data and that high-scoring motifs likely provide a good and generalized representation of the true binding specificity of a TF of interest. We caution, however, that there are multiple outliers; thus, high performance for a single training data type does not absolutely guarantee universal cross-platform transferability.</p><p id="P25">Considering individual tools, their performance generally followed the global trend, except for an unexpectedly good RCade performance when tested on ChIP-Seq but not GHT-SELEX data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). This effect permits a simple explanation: by design, RCade obtained motifs for zinc-finger TFs only. For these TFs the performance ratings at the respective genomic datasets were higher for many other tools (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure SF4C</xref>), and binding sites in ChIP-Seq datasets were easier to predict than those in GHT-SELEX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure SF4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Interpreting the role of flanking regions with motifs from gkmSVM</title><p id="P26">GkmSVM was used in the first round of motif discovery from ChIP-Seq data, covering 45 TFs with approved datasets. As gkmSVM was computationally demanding and its motifs were not top-ranking, we did not apply it to the analysis of the entire Codebook collection. However, gkmSVM motifs trained on the ChIP-Seq data performed competitively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). By examining the motifs of the 45 TFs constructed with GkmExplain from gkmSVM results, we found that it captured long sequence contexts in the vicinity of the binding sites, as seen from the motif length distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Figure SF6A</xref>). Given the good performance of gkmSVM on ChIP-Seq and its acceptable performance for GHT-SELEX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), we concluded that the extended genomic context provided added value, at least for some TFs. Yet, the longer genomic context of binding sites is likely to represent properties of regulatory regions at a larger scale, including binding sites of other interacting TFs, rather than the genuine binding specificity of the protein under study.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Basic motif features are not related to motif scores in benchmarking</title><p id="P27">Basic motif features like motif length, information content (IC), and GC composition were irregular even for motifs derived with the same tool or experiment type. For instance, Dimont and ProBound produced many low-information content motifs, and for many tools, there were discrete spikes in preferred motif lengths arising from technical parameters or other technicalities of the motif discovery procedure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Figure SF6A, B</xref>). The performance metrics were only weakly correlated to these basic motif features, however, as previously observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Considering genomic data, performance metrics were not correlated with GC composition or positional IC but did show a weak correlation with the motif length (Pearson ρ of 0.05 to 0.2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figure SF7A</xref>). This finding could reflect an ability of longer motifs to partially account for the contribution of the genomic context, as motif length was especially beneficial in the benchmark that used only the single best PWM hit per sequence (pseudo-auROC). In this scenario, an extra motif length optimization step could improve the resulting PWM performance for some tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, although there is some risk that the motif does not represent the intrinsic activity of the TF: in benchmarks on artificial sequences, there was no correlation between motif length and performance at all, i.e., longer motifs did not have any advantages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figure SF7B</xref>) and only a very weak correlation (ρ around 0.06) with the positional IC. Focusing on the latter, a large IC spread was found even considering only the top 10 motifs for each TF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figure SF7C</xref>). Moreover, in our cross-platform assessment, the information content was not related to motif performance and instead reflected the motif origin experiment and motif discovery algorithm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Figure SF6</xref>), suggesting that the average information content of a given high-scoring motif depends not only on the experimental platform and specifics of a particular experiment (e.g. sequencing depth, TF concentration, or signal-to-noise ratio) but also on the technical procedure employed for motif discovery.

As evaluating advanced models is more sensitive to biases in the data, we created dedicated train-test datasets with several negative controls, including “shades” (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. peak-neighboring regions as in the main PWM benchmarking), “alien” peaks of non-relevant TFs, and “random” genomic regions. The latter two background sets were built by sampling from available sequences to achieve the same distribution of the GC composition as that of the positive set. Using the random negative set, we trained the Archipelago model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Methods</xref>), a random forest classifier built on top of best hits of a relatively small collection of log-odds PWMs (excluding those discovered from the test data type). Next, we estimated its mean performance with the three alternative negative sets and used PWMs reaching either the highest auROC or auPRC as the respective baselines.</p><sec id="S9"><title>Evaluation within experiment type</title><p id="P30">To avoid information leakage, each time, we excluded PWMs obtained from the test experiment type. Yet, it was still possible to train and test Archipelago with the single experiment type using PWMs from other platforms. In this scenario, Archipelago consistently outperformed individual PWMs, with significant gains in both auROC and auPRC across TFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Figure SF8A-F</xref>, with the average of ΔauROC and ΔauPRC shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), although the random forest model showed only a marginal improvement over logistic regression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Figure SF8G</xref>). In agreement with the primary PWM benchmark, the absolute intra-platform auROC values were high even for individual PWMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Figure SF8A, D</xref>), while achieving high auPRC values was more difficult due to class imbalance. As expected, the negative set made of shades, which had a less skewed class imbalance, has yielded the highest auPRC scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Figure SF8B, E</xref>). Overall, comparing different TFs, the improvement of Archipelago over PWMs did not depend on the size of the positive set or the number of PWMs in the model. Remarkably, only 2-4 PWMs combined were already sufficient for a major quality boost over a single PWM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Figure SF8H, I</xref>).</p><p id="P31">The average performance gain for GHT-SELEX and ChIP-Seq differed for individual TFs and TF families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Some TFs, such as GABPA, which is known to form multimers on DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, showed improvement with Archipelago presumably due to multiple distinct binding sites per peak not being captured by a single best PWM hit. Other TFs with clear improvement had low-complexity or low-information content motifs (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. ZNF772 and ZNF773), likely reflecting complex patterns that are hard to represent by a single fixed-width PWM. A comparable improvement was observed for several PWMs representing overlapping patterns (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. for CREB3L3), which may represent different half-site patterns; the improvement on ChIP-Seq may also fortuitously capture heteromeric sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Finally, some TFs bind several site subtypes, such as C2H2 zinc finger TFs with modular binding specificities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. A strong example is ZNF43 with PWMs representing single and double-box binding motifs which are conveniently taken into account together by Archipelago but not by single PWMs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Evaluating the models’ transferability</title><p id="P32">At first glance, the cross-platform performance of Archipelago (training the RF on the ChIP-Seq and testing on GHT-SELEX and <italic>vice versa</italic>) seems contradictory: ChIP-Seq-to-GHT-SELEX train-test yields a stable performance increase, while the train-test in the opposite direction behaves more randomly and often underperforms even in comparison to the best single PWM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure SF9A-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Supplementary Table ST2</xref>). This can be explained by comparing the training data volume available from ChIP-Seq and GHT-SELEX, with the latter generally providing 2-3 times fewer peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Figure SF9I</xref>). This difference not only made the model training more prone to overfitting but also provided less information on the actual diversity of genomic binding sites. Another issue arises from different motif subtypes preferably represented in ChIP-Seq and GHT-SELEX peaks, e.g., for ZNF770, a longer motif variant is present in ChIP-Seq but is less prominent in GHT-SELEX. Yet, in the end, the top TFs receiving the highest performance gain in the cross-platform evaluation were partly shared with those with the highest performance gain in the intra-platform setup, such as ZNF773, ZNF43, and GABPA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Codebook Motif Explorer</title><p id="P33">The results of this study are presented through the interactive Codebook/GRECO-BIT Motif Explorer (MEX, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mex.autosome.org">https://mex.autosome.org</ext-link>), which provides motifs, performance metrics, ranks, logos, and structured downloads, such as sets of top-performing motifs and related metadata, see an overview in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Supplementary Figure SF10</xref>.

Yet, quantitative assessment of the performance and reliability of motif discovery tools is lagging, partly due to a shortage of uniform data sets for validation between experimental platforms. Thus, forty years after the inception of PWMs and following many advances in the measurement and representation of DNA sequence specificities, it remains controversial how to best measure, derive, use, and test motif models. Further, there was no commonly accepted set of PWMs that could serve as a reliable baseline. This deficit complicates a fair assessment of alternative PWMs or comparison of PWMs to more complex models, able to account for correlations of nucleotides within binding sites, even for widely studied TFs with well-described DNA binding specificities. Particularly, in some applications the complex models can fall behind carefully selected PWMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, but, without the commonly accepted baseline, it remains problematic to provide reliable quantitative estimates of the models’ added value.</p><p id="P35">In our study, we used multiple motif discovery tools and multiple performance metrics across multiple experimental platforms. We identified motifs that were ranked consistently high by all metrics and across multiple replicates and individual test datasets, such as SELEX cycles or test data from alternative PBM normalization strategies. This approach allowed us to avoid prioritizing motifs that received high scores in a single benchmark by chance: different performance metrics were positively correlated but agreed imperfectly and produced different motif rankings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Figure SF11</xref>). Thus, we consider that the Codebook MEX motif set and the underlying data provide a valuable resource for further development of DNA motif discovery tools. Of note, in our study, we employed several advanced motif discovery methods, including gkmSVM, ProBound, and ExplaiNN. However, while testing them against classical tools, we reduced their efficacy by converting their results to simple PWMs. Therefore, it remains of interest to perform a dedicated study of advanced motif models using the MEX PWMs as a baseline.</p><p id="P36">A related problem arises with human curation of the experimental datasets (which in our case was essential) being based on PWM-represented motifs: there might be TFs with intricate DNA-binding specificity that cannot be captured by PWMs, making it impossible to properly assess and approve the dataset. Finally, by design, we did not balance the starting motif sets across tools, allowing multiple candidate motifs to enter the benchmarking pipeline. Although running a conventional tool multiple times and collecting multiple alternative motifs might be a common practical scenario when performing an exploratory analysis of TF-DNA binding specificity, this is not a fully suitable approach in terms of benchmarking. Yet, in our study, larger motif sets did not enable the respective tools to occupy the podium despite having ‘more attempts’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure SF1</xref>).</p><p id="P37">Dimont was the most versatile tool for PWM motif discovery, achieving the best performance on the entire experimental data set, while ChIPMunk and ProBound could, in some cases, compete with Dimont for ChIP-Seq/GHT-SELEX and HT-SELEX. Classical tools such as MEME and HOMER rarely gave the best-performing motifs but often provided stably good results, as the gap in absolute performance from the best motifs was neither borderline nor dramatic. The most notable difference of Dimont compared with most alternative motif discovery approaches is that the PWM model in Dimont is optimized for a discriminative objective function numerically instead of using count-based statistics. Depending on the experimental method, ‘discriminative’ may refer to distinguishing bound from unbound sequences, or to reconstructing a continuous scale of signals related to binding strength. Hence, Dimont optimizes its PWM using an objective function - though on the training data - that is in some sense related to the performance metrics that have been used for evaluation on the test data in the benchmark. Of note, while ChIPMunk, Dimont, ProBound, and ExplaiNN were applied by their authors, other tools including MEME and HOMER were employed not from their creators’ hands, and thus might be technically handicapped.</p><p id="P38">It is important to count failures as well as successes. While most of the tools performed well on average, particular combinations of TFs, tools, and types of experiments could be more problematic, and such cases are difficult if at all possible to detect <italic>ab initio</italic>. Importantly, our study benefited greatly from multiple types of experiments for a single TF, which is quite rare in practice, where researchers usually limit themselves to a single assay. In real-life scenarios, the success rate of motif discovery will be even lower and simultaneously harder to assess, as in our study we discarded more than half of the experiments as “non-approved”, and human curation would have been much more error-prone without the availability of data from multiple experimental platforms.</p><p id="P39">Our large-scale motif discovery and benchmarking efforts also highlighted the widely debated topic of whether innate TF binding specificity or genomic context (e.g., DNA bases flanking the directly contacted binding site) contribute more to the genomic binding profile of a TF. In our observations, the motifs learned from artificial sequences were highly transferable to genomic regions, thus reinforcing the idea that innate DNA binding specificity is localized, highly sequence dependent, and can be efficiently learned and modeled from diverse experimental data including synthetic DNA sequences. The property of many TFs to recognize several motif subtypes can be addressed by “ensembling” PWMs in the Random Forest classifier, which was able to achieve better performance when trained and tested on GHT-SELEX and ChIP-Seq peaks, suggesting that cell type-agnostic, reliable binding profiles can be generated <italic>in silico</italic> from DNA sequence alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, it was significantly more difficult for models to generalize beyond the particular experimental platform, even though the underlying motifs were built from diverse experiments. Thus, we expect transferability and generalization to remain major challenges for machine learning applications in advanced TFBS modeling, and their success will likely depend on creative approaches for data integration from multiple experiment types.</p><p id="P40">Despite the richness of the underlying data and multiple benchmarking protocols involved, we caution against overestimating the potential of the PWM as a model. First of all, many TFs, especially those with multiple zinc fingers, or several DNA binding domains of different classes, can recognize alternative motifs or motif subtypes, which are impossible to capture with a single PWM model. Thus, with PWM-based motif discovery, some motif subtypes can be mixed or missing, and the benchmarking results might be biased towards either primary subtypes or mixtures of alternative patterns. Next, the scoring method is important: as in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, most of our benchmarking protocols used the sum-occupancy scoring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, which effectively accounted for the contribution of multiple binding sites. The ChIP-Seq and GHT-SELEX benchmarks with the best log-odds PWM hits were less sensitive, resulting in smaller differences between tools (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure SF4</xref>), particularly, Dimont lost its edge. In this sense, selecting the best motif discovery tool is less crucial if the goal is to pinpoint the single best binding site within a known binding region.</p><p id="P41">Of note, only 236 of the 394 putative TF proteins examined in our study yielded approved datasets. We explored multiple motif discovery tools but used a deliberately conservative human curation protocol. Thus, we encourage the community to further explore the remaining data with advanced models or more sophisticated preprocessing strategies, as it should be possible to successfully discover motifs from some of the non-approved datasets, as has been shown for SMiLE-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P42">The most recent attempt to rigorously catalog human DNA-binding TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> assigned the respective GO term to 1,435 human proteins, requiring strict experimental evidence of both the role played by the particular protein in transcriptional regulation and its DNA-binding specificity.

The objective function of Dimont (maximum supervised posterior) optimizes the concordance of these soft labels and motif-based scores using gradient-based numerical optimization, i.e., Dimont tries to find the motifs that explain the soft labels best.

The k-mer length was set to the entire probe length for SMiLE-Seq and HT-SELEX experiments. For GHT-SELEX, the probes were centered before extracting 40bp of sequence (20bp up and downstream of the center). Reads shorter than 40bp were discarded. In the case of multi-round SELEX experiments, columns indicating the round of enrichment were added to each count table. Since ProBound requires a sample of probe counts for an unselected input library, models could only be fit to SMiLE-Seq, GHT-SELEX, and HT-SELEX experiments. For SMiLE-Seq, input data was readily available for each experiment. For GHT-SELEX, input libraries were not matched to respective samples. Therefore, all input libraries were pooled and 10,000 unique reads were sampled at random to build a global input count table. For HT-SELEX, a deeply sequenced input library was unavailable. To approximate the input library, the reads from ‘failed’ experiments (those that showed no reliable probe enrichment after incubation with TFs) were combined, and 10,000 unique reads were sampled to create an approximate input count table. Note, that this approach is not recommended in the original publication and may bias motif inference, e.g., the approximate input is nonetheless subject to non-specific binding preferences.</p></sec><sec id="S74"><title>Motif discovery</title><p id="P135">ProBound was used with the following, default optimizer settings: L2 regularizer weight of 0.000001 (<monospace>lambdaL2</monospace> parameter), Dirichlet regularizer weight of 20 (<monospace>pseudocount</monospace> parameter), smallest improvement in likelihood required for a model variation to be accepted of 0.0002 (<monospace>likelihoodThreshold</monospace> parameter). All values were taken from the ProBound documentation of single-experiment transcription factor binding models. Other optimizer settings were left at default values and no custom optimization was performed. Each experiment was analyzed with a single position-specific affinity matrix, which represents the change in binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) for all point mutations with respect to the optimal reference sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup> binding mode with an initial size of 12 base pairs. For each experiment, a pair of models was developed - one incorporating the non-specific binding mode and the other one excluding it.

As in the previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, Autoseed was used to find Huddinge Distance-based local maxima for gapped 8-mers for combinations of a background and a signal cycle and to generate logos for these and heatmaps that display all possible spacing variants.
