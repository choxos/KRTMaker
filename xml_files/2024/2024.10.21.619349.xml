Salmon males require less energy, in the form of adiposity, to mature compared to females and typically mature younger. Maturation age is also influenced in a sex-dependent fashion by the <italic>vgll3</italic> genotype (<italic>vestigial-like 3</italic>), a co-factor in the Hippo pathway. The underlying molecular processes of sex-dependent maturation age, and how they interplay with adiposity and <italic>vgll3</italic> genotypes, have remained unknown. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying sex- and genotype-specific maturation differences, we investigated the association of <italic>early</italic> (E) and <italic>late</italic> (L) maturation <italic>vgll3</italic> alleles and the transcriptional expression of &gt; 330 genes involved in the regulation of the Hippo pathway and sexual maturation, and related to molecular signals in brain, adipose tissue, and gonads. The strongest effect of <italic>vgll3</italic> genotype was observed in adipose tissue for females and in brain for males, highlighting a sex-specific expression difference in the main association of <italic>vgll3</italic> genotype. Genes related to ovarian development showed increased expression in <italic>vgll3*EE</italic> compared to <italic>vgll3*LL</italic> females. Additionally, <italic>vgll3*EE</italic> females compared to <italic>vgll3*EE</italic> males exhibited reduced markers of pre-adipocyte differentiation and lipolysis yet enhanced expression of genes related to adipocyte maturation and lipid storage. Brain gene expression further showed sex-specific expression signals for genes related to hormones and lipids, as well as tight junction assembly. Overall, these sex-specific patterns point towards a greater lipid storage and slower energy utilization in females compared to males. These results suggest that Hippo-dependent mechanisms may be important mediators of sex differences in maturation age in salmon.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Gene co-expression</kwd><kwd>Atlantic salmon</kwd><kwd><italic>vgll3</italic></kwd><kwd>Hippo pathway</kwd><kwd>sex-specific differences</kwd><kwd>sexual maturation</kwd><kwd>adipogenesis</kwd><kwd>lipid storage</kwd><kwd>age at maturity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The timing of sexual maturation can have dramatic effects on survival and reproductive success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Mobley et al. 2021</xref>) and is influenced by environmental cues and genetic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Taranger et al. 2010</xref>).

Therefore, the underlying molecular processes of sex-specific maturation patterns have remained largely unexplored. Recent gene co-expression network analyses have indicated that the effects of <italic>vgll3</italic> genotypes in males on genes playing a role in the reproductive axis, adipogenesis and neurogenesis are exerted through the modulation of various components of the Hippo signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Ahi et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ahi, Verta, et al. 2024b, 2024a</xref>). The Hippo pathway is known for its role in biological functions such as controlling organ size in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Kjærner-Semb et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Kurko et al. 2020</xref>; Sen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Sharma et al. 2019</xref>), regulating adipocyte proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Ardestani et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Halperin et al. 2013</xref>) and high fat diet -induced neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Poon et al. 2013</xref>). In mammals, for instance, YAP1, a major transcription co-factor of the Hippo pathway, is required for adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Ardestani et al. 2018</xref>), whereas VGLL3 functions as an inhibitor of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Halperin et al. 2013</xref>), indicating the significance of this pathway in energy acquisition processes. VGLL3 is thought to compete with YAP1, which acts as an inhibitor of the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Hori et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Kurko et al. 2020</xref>). Moreover, the Hippo pathway has been implicated in responding to environmental cues, such as changes in diet fat and temperature, at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Luo et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Shu et al. 2019</xref>).

Of particular interest among the components of the Hippo pathway is <italic>VGLL3</italic>, which has been identified as a key regulator of sex-biased autoimmune responses in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Liang et al. 2017</xref>). Here, <italic>VGLL3</italic> influences a network of genes involved in various metabolic, developmental, and reproductive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Liang et al. 2017</xref>). This leads to hypotheses about its potential evolutionary significance in maintaining sex-specific metabolic homeostasis under metabolic stress, with implications for autoimmune-related pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Pagenkopf &amp; Liang 2020</xref>).

In the adipose tissue, seven genes (excluding <italic>actb</italic> and <italic>gapdh</italic>) were chosen for normalization as they also exhibited low CV values. For the brain, the same set of reference genes was used, excluding <italic>gapdh</italic> because of its high expression variation across samples in this tissue. The raw count data from the Nanostring nCounter mRNA expression analysis was normalized using an RNA content normalization factor. This factor was calculated based on the geometric mean of selected reference gene counts for each tissue. Following normalization, a quality control check was conducted, and all samples met the default threshold as determined by the nSolver Analysis Software v4.0 (NanoString Technologies). During data analysis, the mean of the negative controls was subtracted, and normalization of the positive controls was performed using the geometric mean of all positive controls. A normalized count value of 20 was set as a background signal threshold. Below-average background signals were detected in 121, 82, and 77 genes across the samples in adipose, brain, and ovary, respectively, and were removed from further analyses. Sex-specific differential expression and Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (see below) were only investigated in the two tissues that are analogous between males and females (brain and adipose). Differential expression analysis was conducted using the log-linear and negative binomial model (lm.nb function) as implemented in Nanostring’s nSolver Advanced Analysis Module (nS/AAM). Sexes and genotypes were selected as predictor covariates in the model, as suggested by nS/AAM. Multiple hypothesis testing adjustment was performed using the Benjamini-Yekutieli method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Benjamini &amp; Yekutieli 2001</xref>) within the software, and adjusted p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA version 1.68) R-package (version 5.2.1) was implemented to identify gene co-expression modules (GCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Langfelder &amp; Horvath 2008</xref>). Since our main interest was the comparison between sexes, all samples from both genotypes (for the adipose tissue and brain, separately) were used as biological replicates, providing sufficient statistical power for WGCNA. To identify sample relationships, hierarchical clustering of samples based on gene expression was conducted. Coexpression networks were constructed via seven steps described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ahi, Verta, et al. 2024b</xref>). Then, a conditional coexpression analysis was conducted as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Singh et al., 2021</xref>). Coexpression networks were constructed for each sex separately to identify the preservation of female modules in the male network and vice versa. A soft power of 8 was used to construct the adjacency matrix. Finally, module preservation statistics were calculated using WGCNA to test how the density and connectivity of modules defined in the reference dataset (e.g., female brain) were preserved in the query dataset (e.g., male brain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Langfelder et al. 2011</xref>).

Specifically, we tested for changes in module GO-association between the sexes as follows. We first identified GO-associations for each module using a gene-set overrepresentation test at a false discovery rate (FDR) of &lt; 0.05, with a specific threshold for Gene Ontology/Biological Process (GO/BP) level 2 inclusion and all protein-coding genes as background. We then compared the GO/BP associations of each module between the sexes. This was performed for each tissue separately. To predict potential gene interactions and identify key genes with the highest number of interactions (interacting hubs), the identified differentially expressed genes in each comparison were converted to their conserved orthologs in humans (providing the highest amount of validated/studied interactome data in vertebrates) and used as input for STRING version 12.0 using the medium confidence level for predicting each interaction/molecular connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Szklarczyk et al. 2023</xref>).

To do this, we first built gene coexpression modules (GCMs) in the brain of each sex and then investigated the preservation of the identified GCMs between the sexes. In other words, we defined the GCM in one sex and then assessed the preservation of its modules in the other sex. We identified five brain GCMs for females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>) of which one GCM (brown) showed relatively high preservation (Zsummary &gt; 2) in males, i.e. most of the genes in this GCM have significant expression correlations in both sexes. Three of the GCMs (yellow, green and blue) showed a low to moderate level of preservation between the sexes (Zsummary = 0 - 2); and the turquoise GCM, containing the highest number of genes (63 genes), showed the lowest level of preservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Next, a gene set enrichment analysis was conducted for the GCM with the lowest level of preservation between females and males (turquoise) in order to provide insights into the biological processes associated with male vs. female differences. The most common biological processes of the genes in the least preserved (turquoise) GCM included regulation of vitamin D biosynthesis, cell-cell junction assembly, Hippo signaling pathway, cellular response to lipid and steroid hormone mediated signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Almost half its genes in this turquoise GCM showed no coexpression preservation in males (genes lacking color in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Removal of unpreserved genes in the turquoise GCM led to loss of significance of three GO terms; Hippo signaling pathway, cellular response to lipid and steroid hormone mediated signaling pathway (non-colored GOs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Knowledge-based interactome prediction using genes within the turquoise GCM was performed in order to identify potential interactions between the genes as well as hub genes with highest number of interactions.

However, among the seven GCMs identified in the females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A and B</xref>), one GCM (yellow) showed a very low level of preservation (Zsummary &lt; 0) in males and it was thus investigated further using gene-set enrichment as above.

We did this by profiling the expression of known components of the Hippo pathway and their interacting partners in brain, adipose, and gonad tissues at a stage when some males begin to exhibit signs of pubertal initiation while other males and all females remain immature. In general, we observed more extensive <italic>vgll3</italic> genotype effects on gene expression in adipose tissue of females compared to the brain and ovary. Compared to the other two tissues, expression differences in adipose tissue seemed to be more linked with Hippo pathway signaling, as several components of this pathway, including <italic>vgll3a</italic> itself, were differentially expressed between alternative <italic>vgll3</italic> genotypes. These results are concordant with earlier research in mammals suggesting the Hippo pathway plays a pivotal role in balancing adipocyte proliferation vs. differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Ardestani et al. 2018</xref>).

Additionally, a major Hippo pathway kinase, encoded by <italic>lats2</italic>, which was differentially expressed in female adipose tissue in our study, is known to promote the lipolysis process in mouse adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">El-Merahbi et al. 2020</xref>). Our recent findings in male Atlantic salmon also imply that <italic>vgll3</italic> and its associated Hippo pathway have extensive effects on transcriptional changes in adipose tissue in relation to sexual maturation, as well as linking adipogenesis and seasonal changes in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ahi, Verta, et al. 2024b</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In contrast to adipose tissue, in the female brain, there were fewer DEGs, and none of the major components of the Hippo pathway were found to be differentially expressed between the <italic>vgll3</italic> genotypes.

However, unlike the brain, major components of the Hippo pathway were differentially expressed, such as <italic>amotl2a, arrb1, tead1a</italic>, and <italic>tead3a</italic>. Recent studies have shown that the core components of the Hippo pathway play important roles in mammalian ovarian physiology, including ovarian development, follicle development, and oocyte maturation (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Clark et al. 2022</xref>). For instance, the higher expression of <italic>arrb1</italic> in the ovary of fish individuals with the <italic>vgll3*EE</italic> genotype could thus indicate enhanced ovarian development, as <italic>arrb1</italic> is involved in cellular responses to hormones and growth factors and is an important marker of developing ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">Zhou et al. 2019</xref>). Among the interacting partners of the Hippo pathway, <italic>snai2b</italic>, a known marker of primordial ovarian follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Amoushahi &amp; Lykke-Hartmann 2021</xref>), also showed higher expression in the ovary of <italic>vgll3*EE</italic> individuals.

These findings suggest potential differences in Hippo pathway-mediated ovarian development between the <italic>vgll3</italic> genotypes in Atlantic salmon, with possibly more advanced ovarian development in <italic>vgll3*EE</italic> individuals.

Such studies should explore not only the expression of the entire components of the pathway but also the changes at cellular-level, offering deeper insights into the regulatory interactions that govern ovarian maturation.</p><sec id="S13"><title>Gene expression differences suggest differences in lipolysis capacity and adipogenesis of females with distinct <italic>vgll3</italic> genotypes</title><p id="P23">We found lower expression of <italic>vgll3a</italic> in the adipose tissue of <italic>vgll3*EE</italic> females, consistent with previous findings in males where we observed differences in lipid content and gene expression patterns in liver and adipose tissues between the <italic>vgll3</italic> genotypes, suggesting <italic>vgll3*EE</italic> males may store larger lipid droplets in the spring/summer (many months before spawning time), whereas <italic>vgll3*LL</italic> individuals store in the autumn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">House et al. 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ahi, Verta, et al. 2024b</xref>). This supports the scenario whereby <italic>vgll3*EE</italic> individuals have a higher adipogenesis capacity in the spring in both sexes. However, a closer examination of the DEGs between the genotypes adds further details to the interpretation of the results. For example, <italic>vgll3</italic> and <italic>TAZ</italic> (<italic>WWTR1</italic>), both of which had reduced expression in <italic>vgll3*EE</italic> individuals, which are described as inhibitors of the terminal stage of adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Halperin et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Jung et al. 2009</xref>). On the other hand, we also found lower expression of initial-stage adipogenesis markers, such as <italic>ppargc, cebpda, ajubab</italic> and <italic>esrra</italic>, in <italic>vgll3*EE</italic> individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Ijichi et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">Yan et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Kusuyama et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Chawla et al. 1994</xref>). Specifically, while pre-adipocyte differentiationmight be at a lower level in <italic>vgll3*EE</italic> individuals (due to reduced <italic>ppargc, cebpda, ajubab</italic> and <italic>esrra</italic> expression), the terminal stage of adipocyte maturation might be promoted (due to reduced <italic>vgll3a</italic> and <italic>taz/wwtr1b</italic> expression) and the opposite may be true for <italic>vgll3*LL</italic> individuals. This complex transcriptional signature suggests that the genotype difference may lie in specific stages of adipogenesis (e.g., heterochrony) rather than in overall adipogenesis capacity. In other words in <italic>vgll3*EE</italic> individuals, the pre-adipocyte differentiation phase has already been completed, and the adipocytes have entered the terminal stage of differentiation. In contrast, in <italic>vgll3*LL</italic> individuals, the pre-adipocytes are still in the early stages of differentiation and have not yet progressed to their final stage. In addition, we found reduced expression of lipolysis factors, including <italic>lats2, foxo1c</italic>, and <italic>pparaa</italic>, in <italic>vgll3*EE</italic> female adipose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Chakrabarti &amp; Kandror 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">El-Merahbi et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Guzmán et al. 2004</xref>).

Interestingly, the crosstalk between the Hippo and PKA signals is known to be mediated directly through the phosphorylation of LATS1 or indirectly through the activation of RhoA by PKA in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">Yu et al. 2013</xref>). These interactions can lead to synergistic activation of both signals in various tissues. Our result here suggests that the sex-specific mechanism predicted earlier (see above), by which females exhibit higher adipogenesis and lower levels of energy expenditure compared to males, might originate from this link between the PKA and Hippo signals that exists only in the female adipose tissue. This may also indicate that while females might store a larger amount of lipid and gain more fat mass, they may delay in utilizing these reserves, leading to later maturation overall.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Gene expression differences suggest higher activity of the Hippo pathway in the brain of females compared to males</title><p id="P26">We found genotype-independent induced expression of <italic>frmd6a</italic>, encoding a major upstream regulator of the Hippo pathway, in the brain of immature females when compared to immature males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). <italic>FRMD6/Willin</italic> expression is tightly co-localized with <italic>GHRH</italic> (growth hormone-releasing hormone) in nerve cells, particularly in the nerves densely populated in the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary of vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Beck &amp; Kressel 2020</xref>). GHRH is one of the earliest discovered hypothalamic factors involved in the sexually dimorphic pubertal timing of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Argente et al. 1991</xref>). However, the regulatory connection between FRMD6 and GHRH during sexual maturation remains to be elucidated. FRMD6 is considered a potent inhibitor of YAP1 and an activator of the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Angus et al. 2011</xref>), suggesting that the Hippo pathway is generally more active in the female brain than in males at this time point. Despite distinct transcriptional signatures between the <italic>vgll3</italic> genotypes, both genotypes reflected higher Hippo pathway activity in the female brain (e.g., increased expression of <italic>lats1b</italic> in females with the <italic>vgll3*LL</italic> genotype, and <italic>tead1</italic> and <italic>tead3a</italic> in females with the <italic>vgll3*EE</italic> genotype) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Another noteworthy gene with genotype-independent induced expression in females was <italic>cadm2a</italic>, which encodes another conserved cell adhesion protein highly expressed during vertebrate brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Hunter et al. 2011</xref>). <italic>CADM2</italic> is also known as a factor linking psychological/behavioral traits and obesity, as well as the brain and adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Morris et al. 2019</xref>). <italic>CADM2</italic> has been indicated to have sex-dependent expression during brain development and function in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Wingo et al. 2023</xref>). Finally, the third gene identified with genotype-independent induced expression in the female brain was <italic>arhgef25b</italic> (known as <italic>GEFT</italic> in mammals), encoding a Rho-GTPase enzyme required for neurite outgrowth, which is responsible for neuronal patterning and connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Bryan et al. 2004</xref>). A study in clownfish found <italic>arhgef25</italic> to be one of the few sex-dependent genes during sexual transition, required during the female stage in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Casas et al. 2016</xref>). These findings suggest a potential molecular axis whereby the brain senses varying energy storage status in adipose tissue and responds in a sex-specific manner. This axis may be triggered by the differential expression of <italic>cadm2a</italic> in response to adipose tissue energy status, leading to changes in cell adhesion dynamics. These changes could activate Rho-GTPase enzymes (e.g., <italic>arhgef25b/GEFT</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Miller et al. 2014</xref>), and the Rho-ROCK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Van Unen et al. 2016</xref>). Activated Rho-ROCK then regulates P53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Shi &amp; Wei 2007</xref>), an apoptosis factor that can induce <italic>frmd6</italic> expression, as observed in mammalian neural cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Park et al. 2024</xref>). The induction of <italic>frmd6</italic> activates the Hippo pathway in the hypothalamus, potentially delaying the onset of puberty in females compared to males. Although speculative, as this proposed regulatory axis is based on observations in mammalian cells, it is worthy of future testing in fishes and other vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Sex-specific links between the Hippo pathway and lipid, hormone, and cell adhesion signals in the brain</title><p id="P27">Our co-expression analysis in the brain showed that there was at least one sex-specific gene co-expression module (GCM) in each sex i.e. gene coexpression was not preserved in the opposite sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This indicates that the majority of gene expression correlations observed within the turquoise GCM in the female brain and the red GCM in the male brain were absent in the opposite sex. This suggests that the functional relationships between these genes were not maintained in the brains of males and females, respectively. In the female brain, the largest identified GCM (turquoise GCM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) was the least preserved in the male brain. The turquoise GCM consisted of genes encoding components of the Hippo pathway and molecular processes including signals mediated by lipid and steroid hormone as well as cell-cell junction and vitamin D biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). The identification of lipid-mediated signals in the brain is not surprising, as the brain is known to sense somatic energy storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Anderson et al. 2023</xref>). While metabolic control of puberty has been studied for decades, the molecular links between fat storage, the brain, and sexual maturation remain underexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Anderson et al. 2023</xref>). Recent studies have emphasized the role of lipid-sensing signals (e.g., insulin, mTOR, AMPK) in triggering puberty and fat-induced precocious puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Thomas Danielsen et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Vazquez et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Estienne et al. 2021</xref>). Interestingly, these signals are known to interact with the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Estienne et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Poon et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Holden et al. 2020</xref>). Moreover, excess lipids can directly modulate the Hippo pathway through physical interactions with TEADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Holden et al. 2020</xref>). Thus, our findings in the turquoise GCM indicate that there are sex-specific transcriptional signatures of the Hippo pathway components (e.g., <italic>tead1</italic> and <italic>tead3</italic>) and factors mediating lipid sensing and hormonal signals in the brain.</p><p id="P28">In the male brain, the red GCM (the least preserved in the female brain) comprised genes encoding components of the Hippo pathway and three other molecular processes involved in hormone-mediated signals, developmental growth, and tight junction assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). The factors underlying tight junction assembly in the brain are crucial for the formation and integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Mullier et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Li et al. 2022</xref>), and sex hormones influence the tightness of the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Segarra et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Dion-Albert et al. 2022</xref>). Importantly, the BBB is vital for brain permeability during puberty, and sex-specific differences in BBB permeability have been demonstrated in mammalian studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Dion-Albert et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Lettieri et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Solarz et al. 2021</xref>). The Hippo pathway is emerging as a key player in BBB formation, homeostasis, and regeneration through the regulation of tight junction proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Gong et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Hong et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Wei et al. 2023</xref>). Therefore, the distinct sex-specific transcriptional signatures of these components observed in the salmon brain suggests potential Hippo pathway-dependent differences in BBB tightness, which may underlie sex differences in BBB permeability and lead to distinct brain responses to maturation-related circulating molecules (e.g., lipids) also in this species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P29">This study provides significant molecular evidence linking Hippo pathway to sex specific differences in the brain and adipose tissue, which may explain how male sexual maturation often occurs earlier in Atlantic salmon. Our results suggest that females may have higher adipogenesis and lower energy expenditure (lipolysis capacity) compared to males, likely due to sex-specific interactions between PKA and Hippo signaling pathways. In males, increased expression of lipolysis markers in adipose tissue may result in greater energy release, which is sensed in the brain. We also found Hippo-dependent differences in expression of genes encoding tight junction proteins, potentially contributing to greater brain permeability in males. This increased lipid release and potential changes in the brain permeability may underlie sex differences in central lipid sensing process, influencing sex-specific pubertal timing. However, further detailed functional assessments are necessary to validate these suggested differences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary file 1</label><caption><title>Expression data and statistical analysis.</title></caption><media xlink:href="EMS199660-supplement-Supplementary_file_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d29aAcFbC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jaakko Erkinaro for providing the salmon fish used for this study, and Pooja Singh for guiding us through the WGCNA data analysis.
