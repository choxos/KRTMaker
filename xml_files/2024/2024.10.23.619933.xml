their related structures. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a complex ciliopathy with varied symptoms, probably due to altered membrane receptor signalling pathways. This study explores the role of <italic>BBS1</italic> and <italic>BBS4</italic> gene deficiencies in receptor trafficking and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in retinal epithelial cells. Deficiencies in these genes, key components of the BBSome complex, led to shorter cilia and disrupted receptor endocytosis. <italic>BBS1</italic> knockout (KO) cells showed delayed transferrin internalisation and increased recycling of TGFBR1, promoting EMT. On the contrary, <italic>BBS4</italic> KO cells had higher receptor degradation but no affected recycling. These disruptions suggest that BBSome regulates both ciliary and nonciliary pathways. Increased EMT markers in <italic>BBS1</italic> KO cells were associated with higher cell migration and reduced proliferation, highlighting the role in receptor trafficking and potential therapeutic targets for retinal degeneration in BBS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>BBS</kwd><kwd>TGF-β signalling</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>vesicular trafficking</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd><kwd>ciliopathies</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Ciliopathies are a group of genetic disorders characterized by abnormalities in the structure or function of cilia and their associated centrosomes or basal bodies. These disorders often arise from defects in the primary cilium, a specialized, antenna-like organelle that extends from the surface of most vertebrate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Satir and Christensen, 2007</xref>). The primary cilium plays a crucial role in detecting and translating external environmental signals into intracellular responses, regulating a wide range of developmental signalling pathways, such as Hedgehog, Wnt, and TGF-β/BMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Anvarian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hilgendorf et al., 2024</xref>). These pathways are essential for proper cellular communication, tissue development, and organogenesis. When the function of the primary cilium is disrupted, it can lead to a variety of clinical manifestations, which include most tissues and organs of the body, underscoring the importance of cilia in maintaining normal cellular and developmental processes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mill et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a multisystemic ciliopathy marked by retinal degeneration, obesity, polydactyly, intellectual disability, cryptorchidism, and renal abnormalities, with retinal disease being the most penetrant feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Denniston et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Forsythe et al., 2018</xref>). BBS is associated with mutations in genes encoding proteins predominantly localised to the primary cilium, centrosome, basal body, and transition zone. Notably, eight of these genes (<italic>BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, BBS9</italic>, and <italic>BBS18</italic>) encode components of the BBSome, an octameric protein complex, which functions as cargo adaptor for the retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery to promote exit of ubiquitinated receptors from the cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Wingfield et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mill et al., 2023</xref>). Consequently, mutations in BBS genes cause major changes in the ciliary membrane proteome to some extent associated with defective Hedgehog (HH) and G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Anvarian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mill et al., 2023</xref>). Specifically, previous research from our laboratory has demonstrated the involvement of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway in ciliopathy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Álvarez-Satta et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Previous studies have established a functional connection between endosomal recycling and the primary cilium. In many cell types, including retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, the base of the primary cilium is situated within a specialized invagination of the plasma membrane known as the ciliary pocket (CiPo). This region is a hub for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), facilitating the formation of early endosomes and driving endocytic recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Westlake et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Benmerah, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Clement et al., 2013</xref>). The close association between the CiPo and these endocytic processes highlights the crucial role of the ciliary pocket in regulating the trafficking of signalling molecules and receptors, thereby influencing ciliary function and downstream cellular signaling pathways such as in Hedgehog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>) and TGF-β/BMP signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Clement et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Mönnich et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, functional connections between the BBSome and the recycling endosome factor RAB11 have been identified. ARL13B, another ciliary protein, is critical for endocytic recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Barral et al., 2012</xref>), underscoring the role of ciliary proteins in the recycling and transport of endosomal cargo. Deficiencies in receptor internalisation, such as Notch, leptin, and insulin receptors, have been documented in cell lines with BBSome dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Seo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Leitch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Starks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Guo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The RPE is a layer of specialized, polarized cells between the choriocapillaris and the neural retina. This layer of cells is crucial for maintaining photoreceptor health by forming a blood-retina barrier, disposing of damaged photoreceptor segments, maintaining the retinoid cycle, and protecting against light-induced and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Strauss, 2005</xref>). Disruptions in these processes, particularly in protein recycling and maintenance of RPE cell polarity, can lead to dysfunction. Among these processes, autophagy and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are particularly noteworthy. EMT in RPE cells can result in impaired tight junctions, accumulation of misfolded proteins, and dysregulation of key pathways, such as TGF-β, Wnt, and extracellular vesicle trafficking, which are also implicated in ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P6">This study aims to investigate the role of plasma membrane alterations in receptor endocytosis pathways that may contribute to the pathological phenotype observed in the retinas of BBS patients.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell culture and treatment</title><p id="P7">Human retinal pigment epithelial cells (hTERT RPE1, ATCC CRL-4000, female) and human embryonic kidney cells (293T, ATCC CRL-3216, female) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium F-12 nutrient mix (DMEM/F-12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S), when appropriate.

This raised the question of whether BBSome-mediated endocytic dynamics differ between quiescent cells and those actively progressing through the cell cycle. Understanding these differences could reveal important insights into how cellular processes are regulated under different physiological states. The IFM analysis of RPE1 cells revealed that under serum-depleted conditions, i.e. quiescent cells, the colocalization of BBS1 with various vesicles in the endocytic pathway decreased compared to cells in full-growth media. Among the vesicles examined, BBS1 showed the highest colocalization with RAB11. This suggests that BBS1 is more closely associated with recycling endosomes (RAB11) in both culture media. In contrast, BBS4 exhibited a significant increase in colocalisation only with RAB7 under serum-supplemented media, indicating a stronger interaction with late endosomes.

In WT cells, TGFBR1 colocalization peaked at 60 min for EEA1, RAB7, and LAMP2, with RAB11 peaking earlier, at 10 min. These observations suggest that in WT cells, TGFBR1 undergoes efficient trafficking through endocytic compartments, balancing recycling and degradation. On the contrary, KO lines exhibit distinct peaks in the recycling and degradative pathways, with the degradative pathway becoming more prominent over time, particularly in <italic>BBS4</italic> KO cells.

These shifts suggest that the loss of BBS proteins disrupts normal endocytic and recycling processes. When comparing transferrin and TGFBR1, differences were observed even in WT cells, indicating that ciliary and nonciliary endocytosis have distinct dynamics. Although TGFBR1 in WT cells maintains a balance between recycling and degradation via the lysosomal pathway, the transferrin receptor is predominantly recycled. However, in <italic>BBS1</italic> KO cells, this balance shifts: most TGFBR1 is recycled, but there is a 5-min delay in its internalisation. As a result, the receptor is presumably degraded and cannot efficiently return to the membrane. On the contrary, <italic>BBS4</italic> KO cells exhibit a predominance of TGFBR1 degradation, with little to no response in transferrin receptor recycling, indicating a disruption in normal receptor trafficking processes.

Western blot analysis of TGFBR1 and autophagy markers during TGF-β stimulation revealed differences only in the negative control using Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), an autophagosome inhibitor. This suggests that TGFBR1 degradation may occur via non-autophagic pathways, such as direct lysosomal degradation following endocytosis, or proteasome degradation.

Both KO lines exhibited a predisposition toward an EMT phenotype, which was confirmed by qPCR and WB for the N-cadherin and β-catenin markers, where higher expression was observed at time 0 min in KO cells, followed by a decrease at 30 min compared to WT. SNAIL and SLUG levels, although not significant, are higher in both KO cell lines at time 0, remain at t 30 min or decrease slightly, while they increase in WT cells. This is in line with what was postulated for N-cadherin levels: KO cells start from a more mesenchymal stage and the pathway is saturated earlier than in WT cells. Although ACTA 2 baseline levels were consistent with qPCR and IFM data, at 30 min, WB showed a decrease that did not align with the qPCR results. IFM at 6 h revealed the highest filament formation in KO cells, suggesting that ACTA2 may have a slower response than other markers. VIM also showed a significant reduction at 30 min, indicating variability in marker response times. However, the most interesting case worth highlighting is that of CRYAB, perfectly in line with the results on gene expression, where it is not detected at all for BBS4 KO but appears to accumulate significantly in BBS1 KO after stimulation.

In <italic>BBS4</italic> KO cells, receptor trafficking remains balanced between recycling and degradation, limiting EMT activation. In quiescent cells with primary cilia, normal cells use the ciliary pocket for controlled internalisation of TGFBR1, ensuring balanced TGF-β signalling. However, in <italic>BBS1</italic> KO quiescent cells, defective primary cilia cause prolonged receptor recycling, leading to hyperactivated TGF-β signalling and increased EMT. <italic>BBS4</italic> KO cells, while also defective in the cilia, show increased receptor degradation, limiting TGF-β signalling and EMT.</p><p id="P66">However, our study has limitations, including the exclusive use of cell lines that may not fully replicate animal models or patient cells, although other studies support our results. Identification of the role in EMT processes across various cell types suggests new therapeutic strategies to slow tissue deterioration.</p><p id="P67">In conclusion, we demonstrate that BBSome, particularly BBS1, is a key regulator of receptor endocytosis and signalling, with implications for EMT. BBS1 deficiency leads to more severe EMT alterations in RPE1 cells. The enrichment of TGFBR1 in the plasma membrane and altered trafficking highlight the broader impact of BBSome dysfunction on the dynamics of the receptor. These findings improve our understanding of BBS pathology and suggest that targeting the TGF-β pathway may offer new therapeutic approaches for retinal degeneration and other complications of BBS. Future research should explore the combination of gene therapy with EMT inhibitors to improve treatment outcomes in BBS patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS199661-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d20aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We would like to thank Alexander von Kriegsheim and Roopesh Krishnankutty from the HTPU and Mass Spectrometry Facility of Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre for their help and efficiency in processing the samples in the mass spectrometer.

In BBS1 KO cycling cells, the accumulation on the membrane and reduced endocytosis disrupt this balance, causing uneven receptor distribution and altered cell polarity, which promotes uncontrolled proliferation and EMT. On the contrary, BBS4 KO cells preserve a balance in receptor trafficking between recycling and degradation, thereby limiting EMT activation. In quiescent cells with primary cilia, normal cells use the ciliary pocket to regulate TGFBR1 internalisation, ensuring balanced TGF-β signalling. However, in KO quiescent cells, defective primary cilia lead to prolonged receptor recycling, resulting in hyperactivated TGF-β signalling and increased EMT. BBS4 KO cells, despite having ciliary defects, exhibit increased receptor degradation, curbing TGF-β signalling and EMT.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199661-f006"/></fig></floats-group></article>
