Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics technologies, such as the CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI), provide the location and abundance of transcripts through multifocal imaging. Optical sections (or Z-slices) form a Z-stack that represents the tissue depth. Transcript dispersion can be observed across these Z-slice and introduce considerable levels of technical noise to the data that can negatively impact down-stream analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Package Functionality</title><p id="P3">NoButter is an R package designed to evaluate transcript dispersion in CosMx SMI spatial transcriptomics data. Using the raw data, the transcript distribution is assessed for each Z-slice of a Z-stack across multiple fields of views (FOVs). To systematically identify transcript dispersion, the percentage of transcripts located outside cell boundaries is calculated. Z-slices exhibiting high levels of transcript dispersion can be excluded, while high-confidence transcripts are preserved.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Usage Scenario</title><p id="P4">To demonstrate the functionalities of NoButter, spatial transcriptomics data was generated using the CosMx SMI for lymph node tissue, a lung sample, and two triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). Use cases illustrate substantial transcript dispersion in optical planes closer to the glass slide. In these Z-slices, on average, an additional 10% of the transcripts were discarded using NoButter. Cleaning such Z-slices with high dispersion rates reduces technical noise and improves the overall quality of the spatial transcriptomics data.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Availability</title><p id="P5">The package can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cancerbioinformatics/NoButter">https://github.com/cancerbioinformatics/NoButter</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S5" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P6">The field of spatial transcriptomics is advancing rapidly, as evidenced by the growing number of sequencing- and imaging-based technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Rao, et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Tian, et al., 2023</xref>). Spatial transcriptomics is used to quantify the expression of transcripts within individual cells of a tissue thereby enhancing our understanding of the molecular phenotypes that shape its architecture. Due to the novelty of these technologies, comprehensive approaches to assess the data quality are lacking.</p><p id="P7">In imaging-based technologies, such as the CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI) (NanoString, Seattle, United States) or Xenium (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, United States), the precise localisation of transcripts is critical to accurately quantify the expression at single-cell resolution and is ultimately crucial for ensuring the reliability of any downstream analyses, including the assignment of cell types. Currently, quality control procedures for imaging-based spatial transcriptomics technologies largely follow those used in single-cell RNA-sequencing. However, imaging-based spatial transcriptomics would greatly benefit from tailored procedures to address their unique challenges.</p><p id="P8">Transcripts detection in imaging-based spatial transcriptomics is done by multifocal imaging. The resulting 3D coordinate system consists of the x- and y-axis, representing tissue width and length, and the z-axis, which directly relates to tissue depth. The CosMx SMI collects optical Z-slices at an 0.8μm interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">He, et al., 2022</xref>). Lower Z-slices (e.g. Z<sub>0</sub>, Z<sub>1</sub>) correspond to the apical plane, which is closer to the imaging objective. In contrast, higher Z-slices (e.g. Z<sub>7</sub>, Z<sub>8</sub>) capture basal planes, positioned closer to the glass slide on which the tissue rests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Transcript dispersion can be defined as the movement of transcripts away from their original location. Assuming an even distribution of cells within the tissue, one would expect a similar number of transcripts in each Z-slice of a given Z-stack. However, upon inspecting data from various tissue types and CosMx SMI instruments, we found this is not always the case. In data from a lymph node, transcripts were more abundant in Z<sub>1</sub>-Z<sub>2</sub> compared to Z<sub>3</sub>-Z<sub>7</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). In contrast, in a lung and a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (TNBC01) sample, transcripts were more abundant in Z<sub>6</sub>-Z<sub>7</sub> compared to Z<sub>-2</sub>-Z<sub>5</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1B and S1C</xref>), whereas in another TNBC (TNBC02), no difference was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1D</xref>). An increase in the percentage of transcripts located outside cell boundaries was also noted in Z-slices closer to the glass slide (i.e. Z-slices with a higher index) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Both these findings suggest transcript dispersion has occurred, which contributes to noise in the data that can negatively impact down-stream analysis.</p><p id="P9">To address this challenge, we developed NoButter, an R package specifically designed to assess transcript dispersion in CosMx SMI data. The package offers tools to visualise transcript distribution across Z-slices and FOVs to facilitate the detection of transcript dispersion, includes functions to discard transcripts in specific Z-slices, and to create the necessary files for downstream analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><sec id="S6"><title>Package Functionality</title><p id="P10">NoButter is created to effectively clean and preprocess CosMx SMI data. After exporting raw data from the AtoMx Spatial Informatics Platform (SIP), the package can import the contents of the ‘<italic>AnalysisResults’</italic> folder. This folder contains raw transcript information, such as the x- and y-coordinates, the Z-slice and the transcript type (i.e. endogenous, system or negative control), which are crucial to assess the quality of the data.</p><p id="P11">The package offers various functions to inspect raw transcript distribution. To systematically detect the presence of transcript dispersion, the percentage of raw transcripts occurring outside the cell boundaries within a given FOV should be assessed. Because transcript dispersion detection relies on the localisation of the transcripts in relation to the cell boundaries, it can be challenging to detect, particularly in FOVs encompassing densely packed cells. Therefore, it is recommended to assess FOVs that are located at the edge of the tissue section, cover gaps or breaks present in the tissue section or are positioned in regions with a distinct tissue architecture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p><p id="P12">After filtering the raw transcripts, a new transcript file can be reconstructed. The package enables the cleaning of the accompanying metadata and polygon files to reflect any necessary changes made in the transcript file. Finally, the package can consolidate these data into a set of ‘flat files’ that are compatible with various analytical tools, such as Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Hao, et al., 2024</xref>), Squidpy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Palla, et al., 2022</xref>), Giotto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Dries, et al., 2021</xref>) and CosMx-Lite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">O’Hora, et al., 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Usage Scenario</title><p id="P13">The applicability and functionality of NoButter are demonstrated on CosMx SMI data obtained from a lymph node, lung and two TNBCs. Slide preparation was conducted following NanoString guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">NanoString, 2023</xref>). The lymph node data was acquired at King’s College London, the lung at the University of Southampton and both TNBCs at NanoString’s Amsterdam CX Lab. Cell segmentation was performed in the AtoMx SIP, utilising an adaption of Cellpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Pachitariu and Stringer, 2022</xref>). Raw transcript files were exported from AtoMx SMI using a custom export function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Griswold and Zhao, 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P14">For the lymph node, 19,132,400 transcripts were detected across 63 FOVs and 10 Z-slices. Only 4.23% of all transcripts were in Z<sub>0</sub> and 3.50% in Z<sub>8</sub>. In Z<sub>9</sub>, only 261 transcripts were detected. The remainder of the transcripts (92.15%) were detected in Z<sub>1</sub> to Z<sub>7</sub>. In the lung sample, 18,451,364 transcripts were detected in 206 FOVs and 13 Z-slices. 90.07% of the transcripts were in Z<sub>-1</sub> to Z<sub>6</sub>. In Z<sub>-4</sub> to Z<sub>-2</sub>, 1.71% of all transcripts were detected; in Z<sub>7</sub> and Z<sub>8</sub>, this was 8.12%. In TNBC01, 3,003,665 transcripts were detected across 13 FOVs and 14 Z-slices. For TNBC02, 4,527,301 transcripts across 18 FOVs and 10 Z-slices were detected. In both samples, the majority (97.00% and 98.50% in TNBC01 and TNBC02 respectively) of the transcripts were detected in Z<sub>0</sub> to Z<sub>7</sub>.</p><p id="P15">In the Z-slices closest to the glass slide (i.e. those with a high index), tissue structure became less defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), and a higher percentage of transcripts were detected outside of cell boundaries. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced in FOVs located at the tissue edge, or in regions with gaps or breaks in the tissue. In contrast, this was less pronounced in densely packed tissue regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). These observations suggest that certain in some Z-slices, transcript dispersion is more abundant, necessitating data cleaning.</p><p id="P16">After assessing the localisation of raw transcripts, those detected outside cell boundaries and transcripts flagged as system controls were discarded, leaving 14,786,502 (77.29%) transcripts in the lymph node, 10,871,694 (58.92%) in the lung, 2,532,656 (84.32%) in TNBC01 and 3,990,287 (88.14%) in TNBC02. In addition, 1,651,132 (8.63%), 810,532 (4.39%), 390,278 (12.99%) and 495,191 (10.94%) of all transcripts were removed after Z-stack screening and cleaning using NoButter. These high-confidence transcripts were used to generate a new expression matrix and to update the metadata and polygons files, for further downstream analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P17">NoButter offers a comprehensive set of functions to detect, quantify and mitigate the effects of transcript dispersion in CosMx SMI data.
