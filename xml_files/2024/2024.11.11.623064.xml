Effective <italic>in vitro</italic> assays and robust phenotypes are crucial for monitoring populations for the emergence and spread of resistance. The recently developed extended Recovery Ring-stage Survival Assay used a qPCR-based readout to reduce the labor intensiveness for <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotyping of ART-R and improved correlation with the clinical phenotype of ART-R. Here, we extend and refine this assay to include measurements of parasite growth and recovery after drug exposure. Clinical isolates and progeny from two genetic crosses were used to optimize and validate the reliability of a straight-from-blood, SYBR Green-based qPCR protocol in a 96-well plate format to accurately measure phenotypes for Growth, Resistance, and Recovery.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><p id="P3">The assay determined growth between 6 h and 96 h, resistance at 120 h, and recovery from 120 h and 192 h. Growth can be accurately captured by qPCR and is shown by reproduction of previous growth phenotypes from HB3 × Dd2. Resistance measured at 120 h continually shows the most consistent phenotype for ring stage susceptibility. Recovery identifies an additional response to drug than parasites that are determined sensitive by Fold Change at 120 h. Comparison of progeny phenotypes for Growth vs Resistance showed a minor but significant correlation, whereas Growth vs Recovery and Resistance vs Recovery showed no significant correlation. Additionally, dried blood spot (DBS) samples matched Fold Change measured from liquid samples demonstrating Resistance can be easily quantified using either storage method.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P4">The qPCR-based methodology provides the throughput needed to quickly measure large numbers of parasites for multiple relevant phenotypes. Growth can reveal fitness defects and illuminate relationships between proliferation rates and drug response. Recovery serves as a complementary phenotype to resistance that quantifies the ability of sensitive parasites to tolerate drug exposure. All three phenotypes offer a comprehensive assessment of parasite-drug interaction each with independent genetic determinants of main effect and overlapping secondary effects that should be further. By adapting our method to include DBS, readouts can be easily extended to <italic>ex vivo</italic> surveillance applications.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ring-stage survival assay</kwd><kwd>Artemisinin resistance</kwd><kwd>Plasmodium falciparum</kwd><kwd>Kelch13</kwd><kwd>Phenotypes</kwd><kwd>Genetic cross</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S4" sec-type="intro"><title>Background</title><p id="P5">Malaria is endemic to most tropical regions with Sub-Saharan Africa bearing the largest burden accounting for 94% of the roughly 249 million cases and 608,000 deaths worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Current front-line drug treatments for uncomplicated <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria rely on Artemisinin (ART) derivatives due to their effectiveness on circulating ring-stage parasites and rapid reduction of patient parasitemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Artemisinin partial resistance (ART-R) spread throughout the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia, largely mediated by mutations in the Kelch propellor domain of the gene <italic>pfKelch13</italic> (K13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Many resistance-conferring mutations have arisen independently and repeatedly in the region making K13 status a reliable marker for resistance surveillance in Southeast Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The recent emergence of ART-R parasites in multiple East African countries with and without K13 mutations raises concerns about the prolonged efficacy of ART on the African continent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Consequently, adequate surveillance for the emergence and spread of ART-R in Africa will require more than knowledge of K13 mutations. Comprehensive measurements of a wider profile of ART-R phenotypes will support more effective surveillance.</p><p id="P6">Clinical and <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements of ART-R are both standardized to important components of assessing rapid clearance the pharmacological hallmark of ART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The clinical phenotype for ART-R, Parasite Clearance half-life (PC<sub>1/2</sub>), is the most direct measurement and is defined as the time needed for parasite load to be reduced by half, and it is measured as part of highly coordinated therapeutic efficacy studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). This approach is instrumental for detecting reduced drug efficacy and the emergence of resistance, but is logistically difficult and expensive, limiting its use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). <italic>Ex vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> assays directly assess and confirm the parasite susceptibility to drug by removing patient factors such as immunity, spleen activity and drug absorption that can confound the <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype of the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). In resource limited areas, <italic>ex vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> assays are a cost-effective way to generate baseline drug susceptibility data to direct efficient implementation of therapeutic efficacy studies. Clinical and <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotypes work in tandem to inform national malaria control programs, emphasizing the need for an improved throughput, information rich <italic>in vitro</italic> assay that can accurately capture quantitative levels of drug resistance and is accessible to resource limited or remote sites for routine surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The Ring-stage Survival Assay (RSA) has been widely adopted as the most effective ART-R <italic>in vitro</italic> correlate of PC<sub>1/2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The RSA mimics the pharmacokinetics of ART by exposing a highly synchronous culture of early ring-stage parasites to a clinically relevant concentration of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) for 6 h. The RSA phenotype is reported as percent survival, calculated by dividing the parasitemia of a drug treated culture by the parasitemia of an untreated culture 66 h following drug removal. The RSA is technical and labor intensive, requiring large culture volumes, parasite synchronization, and determination of viable vs non-viable parasites by either visual inspection of blood smears under a light microscope or highly specialized flow cytometry protocols. The microscopy-based readout increases accessibility of the assay and offers more flexibility for processing experiments but introduces reader subjectivity into the phenotype, impacting results and interpretation. Whereas flow cytometry-based readouts are less subjective but must be completed immediately at the conclusion of the 66 h incubation in RSA and require specialized equipment and expertise on site. Technical difficulties associated with RSA limit throughput of the assay thereby reducing the amount of information gained by <italic>ex vivo</italic> surveillance or <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.</p><p id="P8">Previous studies using Southeast Asian parasites occasionally demonstrate discordant phenotypes between PC<sub>1/2</sub> and RSA with no clear explanation for the discrepancy between the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Identification of parasites with discordant phenotypes have also been observed in a much smaller sampling of African patient samples, although patient immunity is overall greater in African which could influence the relationship between these phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). These inconsistencies highlight an opportunity to expand the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay to capture a broader range of the parasite response to drug. Early investigations to define ART-R examined a variety of approaches to identify a strong <italic>in vitro</italic> correlate with PC<sub>1/2</sub>: 72 h growth inhibition, 48 h growth inhibition, 24 h trophozoite maturation inhibition, trophozoite-stage survival assay, mature-stage survival assay, recovery assay, ring-stage growth arrest assay, quiescence survival assay, and a delayed clearance assay to evaluate ART-induced dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). These various phenotypes captured an array of potential mechanisms that could influence clinical ART-R by broadly assessing physiological characteristics of drug response observed by ART-R parasites. In particular, assays for quiescence and dormancy examined an aspect of ART-R that have been hypothesized to contribute to clinical treatment failures and been recently show to be present in human infections following artesunate therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). However, these phenotypes were not easily quantified into a single measurement and carried challenges to optimization needed for surveillance-scale throughput. None of these assays incorporated an aspect of parasite fitness, a key component of evolutionarily successful resistance with potential to spread. A deeper analysis of parasite phenotypes of ART efficacy may provide better predictors of emergence of resistance and even may provide an explanation for distinct responses among different parasites. This will be especially beneficial in areas of emerging resistance where there is no guarantee ART-R will evolve identically to Southeast Asia.</p><p id="P9">Previously, we used 15 clinical isolates with known PC<sub>1/2</sub> phenotypes to develop and optimize the extended Recovery Ring-stage Survival Assay (eRRSA) to increase the throughput and accuracy of the <italic>in vitro</italic> measurement for ART-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). eRRSA is reported as Fold Change, as the assay employed a straight-from-blood qPCR protocol to measure the fold-change difference in DNA content between DHA-treated and untreated cultures. To best match PC<sub>1/2</sub>, incubation time after drug removal was also extended to 114 h, compared to 66 h in RSA, allowing an additional cycle of active proliferation for all cultures. ART-R parasites in DHA-treated cultures proliferate comparably to the untreated cultures and thus, produce lower fold-change differences than sensitive lines. The requirement for active growth of treated cultures to produce a lower Fold Change ensures a measurement of viable parasites which more accurately measures the true level of ART-R. This refined assay and quantitative readout generates a large separation between sensitive and resistant lines as well as stronger correlation with the clinical phenotype than the traditional RSA percent survival readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). The streamlined qPCR methodology and Fold Change readout increases throughput by eliminating the need for a laborious microscopy or expensive and specialized flow cytometry-based readouts. Samples can also be frozen for long-term storage which offers much more flexibility for later quantification. The ease of sample collection and processing afforded by the qPCR platform allows for expansion of the assay to analyze more phenotypes through the collection of samples at additional timepoints.</p><p id="P10">In the current study we expand on our eRRSA approach to include measurements for innate parasite Growth rate as well as parasite Recovery after drug treatment. The new phenotypic measurements incorporate qPCR values into a single plate-based, semi-high throughput Growth, Resistance, and Recovery Assay (GRRA). Using the Growth, Resistance, and Recovery Assay (GRRA) we show that parasite growth and recovery are quantitative traits that segregate (i.e. are inherited differently) across progeny of the HB3 × Dd2 and NF54(HT-GFP-luc) × NHP4026 genetic crosses. Additionally, we show the ART-R phenotype is readily determined from dried blood spots (DBSs) of DHA-treated and untreated cultures in side-by-side comparison with qPCR from matched liquid samples. Using DBS samples for long term preservation and sample accumulation is an advantage for low-resource clinical or field sites by eliminating the requirement for freezers and qPCR equipment to be on-site. The adaptability, flexibility, methodological ease, relatively low cost, and series of quantitate phenotypes measured in the GRRA will provide a path to new insights into the functional mechanisms responsible for differential parasite responses to ART exposure.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S6"><title>Parasite lines</title><p id="P11">Cloned parasite lines for this study encompass parental parasites of recent experimental genetic crosses (KH004-H9, MAL31, MKK2835, NHP1337, NF54HT-GFP-luc, and NHP4026) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), an additional ART sensitive isolate (NHP4302), two multidrug resistant lines (VN-C1 and VN-E10), as well as select progeny from the NF54(HT-GFP-luc) × NHP4026 cross and select progeny of the HB3 × Dd2 cross.

Liquid culture samples were pipetted carefully drop-wise to keep the circumference of the spot as small as possible, roughly 7mm large, to facilitate uniform and complete excision of the DBS in a single punch. Filter paper samples were dried and stored in a sealed plastic bag at ambient temperature until processing. The 7mm diameter filter paper samples were placed in 0.1 mL PCR strips and 50 μL of Phusion blood direct 2X buffer added to fully submerge to the DBS in buffer. The PCR strips were moved to a shaking incubator platform at 60°C and set to 180 rpm for 30 m. Samples were removed and visually inspected for complete removal of the DBS from the filter paper.

Current phenotypic surveillance of ART resistance relies on the laborious and time-consuming RSA, an assay requiring tight synchronization, time sensitive drug dosing, and expert examination of blood smears using light microscopy to assess live vs dead parasites. Here we have expanded on our earlier development of eRRSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) as a streamlined and quantitative alternative to traditional RSA, to now assay novel phenotypes including rate of recovery after DHA exposure as well as an innate growth rate phenotype. The speed and ease of the qPCR readout relative to microscopy or flow cytometry enables both the throughput and standardization. It also allows for the modification of time points, doses, and other variables to generate new insights into parasites’ responses to drug with minimal additional labor and expense, not amenable to traditional microscopy.</p><p id="P28">By conducting an eRRSA time series experiment we were able to confirm 120 h post-DHA exposure is the optimal time point at which to quantify ART resistance using a qPCR readout, originally benchmarked against PC<sub>1/2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that some ART sensitive parasites as determined by standard eRRSA recover more rapidly after drug treatment. Therefore, we sought to quantify enhanced Recovery as a reproducible phenotype that could be used to detect early or emerging low-level resistance, perhaps as an initial step in the evolution of high-level resistance.</p><p id="P29">The three Southeast Asia ART sensitive isolates in our initial testing panel exhibited an enhanced Recovery phenotype compared to NF54HT-GFP-luc and the African isolate, Mal31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We observed significant differences in Recovery between the parents NF54HT-GFP-luc and NHP4026 for an initial suggestion of a genetic basis for the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We leveraged a subset of progeny from NF54(HT-GFP-luc) × NHP4026 to examine the pattern of inheritance underlying Recovery. NHP4026 is one of the most rapidly recovering parasites with only two progeny with a greater Recovery whereas NF54HT-GFP-luc is centered in the phenotype distribution with 13 progeny phenotyped with a lower mean Recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). A phenotype distribution with progeny showing phenotypes more extreme than the parents is suggestive of transgressive segregation, where alleles from both parents contribute genetic determinants that influence the Recovery phenotype through complex genetic interaction. The progeny used in this proof-of-concept experiment demonstrate that Recovery is a reproducible and quantitative phenotype suitable for association studies and linkage mapping. However, due to the relatively small number of progeny, this screen lacks the statistical power for an unbiased, genome-wide linkage analysis to identify the interactions between loci. The progeny set for this cross has been expanded by additional selection and cloning to now encompass 270 unique recombinant progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) and we eagerly anticipate conducting a large mapping study using GRRA to identify loci underlying Recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Interestingly, NHP4026 does not have a Resistant <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotype by Fold Change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional file 2 and 3</xref>), but does have a slow clearance clinical phenotype (8.37 PC<sub>1/2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) and a previously reported resistant RSA (≥ 10% survival) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). The Resistance and Recovery data provides an opportunity to investigate different features of drug response in this atypical ART-R parasite. NHP4026 has the highest Recovery out of all isolates tested and is nearly at the top of the distribution of Recovery phenotypes for NF54(HT-GFP-luc) × NHP4026. We suggest that a quiescence or dormancy phenotype could explain the discordant <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes for NHP4026. Quantification of RSA and PC<sub>1/2</sub> rely heavily on assessment of the morphology of the drug-treated parasites, and NHP4026 parasites treated with DHA could present morphology of viable ring stage parasites but not be actively proliferating. However, to produce a resistant measured by Fold Change, parasites in treated samples must be actively proliferating in the additional life cycle up to the 120 h timepoint (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional file 2, Additional file 3</xref>). Therefore, GRRA, producing both Fold Change and Recovery results in the same assay could give more refined information to assess “intermediate” parasites that are not strongly ART-R or ART-S but may be critical for monitoring resistance emergence. Interestingly, Resistance and Recovery are not significantly correlated in this progeny set, indicating that a major genetic determinant(s) is not shared between these phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional file 4</xref>), and we anticipate that a large-scale screen of the NF54(HT-GFP-luc) × NHP4026 could provide insights into the mechanisms controlling both phenotype and evolutionary path to ART-R.</p><p id="P31">Temporary growth arrest after treatment with clinically relevant doses of ART derivatives, described as quiescence or ART-induced dormancy, has been hypothesized to contribute to clinical treatment failures of ART monotherapy resulting in recrudescent infections. Assays have been developed to specifically examine quiescence and ART-induced dormancy, but require additional experimental steps post-treatment to remove non-dormant parasites or to track parasite growth by fluorescent imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). These additional steps preclude the throughput required to screen large numbers of parasites and cannot be easily integrated into the GRRA. Recovery as measured by GRRA is distinct from a true dormancy assay in that there is not a second purification of the culture after treatment to remove any parasites that do not enter a dormant state. Instead, the GRRA identifies parasites that recover rapidly after DHA treatment. Parasites with higher Recovery will define a small pool for deeper examination of quiescent or dormant phenotypes.</p><p id="P32">Drug resistant parasites often acquire compensatory mutations to counteract fitness costs of resistance mutations. Well compensated parasites present a greater risk of spreading through a population. Parasite growth rate has been used as a proxy for fitness and is an important initial measure to characterize parasites in areas of emerging resistance. We demonstrated in 8 progeny and parents from the HB3 × Dd2 that PMR can be effectively measured using qPCR and can recapitulate known growth differences between parents and progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Linear regression of PMR with previously measured asexual cell cycle duration shows the two phenotypes are moderately associated, with 46% of variation in PMR explained by asexual cell cycle duration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional file 5</xref>). Nine of 10 parasites fit this relationship well with one, SC01, deviating from the trend line. The low number of total parasites used in the comparison may overestimate the relatedness of the two phenotypes, however SC01 could be an outlier for PMR due to other asexual growth phenotypes shown to be significantly different between HB3 and Dd2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). We anticipate that mechanisms underlying PMR are diverse and specific to an individual parasite or an individual population of parasites. PMR as part of GRRA offers an initial screen to identify resistant, fast-growing parasites that may indicate higher relative fitness to be explored in directed subsequent experiments.</p><p id="P33">Examination of PMR in NF54(HT-GFP-luc) × NHP4026 provided insight into the possible relationships between growth and drug response phenotypes in the genetic background of a recent clinical isolate. Parents of this cross have nearly identical PMRs which could initially suggest the underlying genetic determinants influencing PMR are identical in the parents and would ultimately be an uninformative phenotype to measure in progeny of this cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). However, using only a subset of progeny we identified a range of PMRs including a significant difference between parasites with the highest and lowest PMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). This indicates that progeny at the extreme ends of the phenotype distribution inherited alleles from different loci contributing to higher PMR in each parent which combined as synergistic epistasis in some progeny. The increase in PMR is significant but relatively small and would likely require many progeny to detect the interaction at a statistically significant threshold.</p><p id="P34">Regression of PMR and Fold Change showed a significant linear association with 23% of variation shared between the phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional file 6</xref>). It is generally thought that resistant parasites proliferate more slowly due to the cost of resistance mutations that impact biological processes required for growth. This could explain the significant linear relationship; however, we note that the relatively low predictive power of growth by resistance level suggests that the overlap of determinants controlling each phenotype is partial at best. This is not surprising because many different pathways can impact growth rates regardless of their association with resistance.</p><p id="P35">Importantly, the linear relationship between PMR and Recovery was not significant, suggesting the genetic control of these two phenotypes are independent of each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Additional file 6</xref>). It might be assumed that parasite growth rate would dictate its expansion rate after drug exposure, however, our progeny phenotypes do not support that. Rather, it seems that Recovery as assessing parasite growth only between 120 h to 192 h after drug exposure emphasizes how long it takes parasites to resume normal growth.</p><p id="P36">Linkage studies investigating a phenotype in separate genetic crosses is a powerful approach to dissect the underlying genetic architecture of genes influencing a phenotype of interest. The potential of this approach is highlighted by PMR measured here in HB3 × Dd2 and NF54(HT-GFP-luc) × NHP4026. HB3 and Dd2 are near the extremes of the phenotype distribution, indicative of a progeny set suited to identify loci with large effects independent of non-additive gene interactions. Conversely, NF54HT-GFP-luc and NHP4026 are centered within the progeny distribution with nearly all progeny with higher or lower PMR, indicative of a progeny set suited to identify a complex architecture of multiple and interacting loci with smaller effects. The success of genetic cross experiments rely on prior knowledge of the parent phenotypes to develop informative crossing schemes to test specific hypotheses. The incorporation of PMR into routine surveillance will develop this knowledge about clinical isolates to identify strong candidate parasite isolates for further <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments or as parents of future experimental genetic crosses.</p><p id="P37">While widespread use of GRRA in clinical settings is constrained by the requirement of parasite culturing facilities and freezers, our ability to spot liquid culture samples onto filter paper for long term preservation and sample accumulation will allow for more efficient qPCR. Identical samples measured from liquid and DBS from filter paper correlated strongly (Spearman r = 0.87, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.0002) and obtained consistent interpretation of Resistance for every parasite tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Our observations are consistent with recent reports using a dry-preservation method to store samples from <italic>ex vivo</italic> IC<sub>50</sub>s of multiple drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Importantly the two approaches diverge in important ways with the <italic>ex vivo</italic> IC<sub>50</sub> quantification relying on PfHRP2 ELISA which touts quantification of very low-level parasitemia using inexpensive plate readers. Nevertheless, reagents can be expensive and ART-R parasites with <italic>PfHRP2</italic> deletions are increasing in prevalence in African countries. Comparatively, the qPCR-based method would only require adjustment of primers rather than developing new antibodies, a much less expensive and faster assessment of the level of any single-copy gene. Moreover, filter paper samples can be easily shipped to any site with an adequate qPCR machine for processing and data generation, eliminating the need for equipment on-site. Both methods offer strengths and weaknesses in terms of equipment and cost that can be tailored to the fit needs of individual labs.</p></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P38">Through the design and optimization of the assay, it was determined that phenotypes for Growth, Resistance, and Recovery can all be accurately measured using a qPCR platform and are likely controlled by different genetic mechanisms. Existing genetic crosses can likely be used to elucidate the complex genetic interactions of the phenotypes and articulate how they may influence each other. Finally, ART-R can be effectively and accurately measured in the qPCR platform using experiment samples stored as DBS on filter paper. The methodology presented here will allow semi-high throughput implementation of the Growth, Resistance, and Recovery Assay to identify and track the emergence and spread of artemisinin partial resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Additional Files</label><media xlink:href="EMS200048-supplement-Additional_Files.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d26aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank members of the Ferdig lab for helpful discussions.</p><sec id="S23"><title>Funding</title><p>Funding for this work was provided by NIH grant P01 AI127338 to MTF.
