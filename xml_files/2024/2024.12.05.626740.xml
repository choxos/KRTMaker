Here, we reveal two distinct rumen community types (RCT-A and RCT-B) that are not strongly associated with host phenotype nor genotype but instead linked to protozoal community patterns. We leveraged a series of multi-omic datasets to show that the dominant <italic>Epidinium</italic> spp. in animals with RCT-B employ a plethora of fiber-degrading enzymes that present enriched <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp. a favorable carbon landscape to forage upon. Conversely, animals with RCT-A, dominated by genera <italic>Isotricha</italic> and <italic>Entodinium</italic>, harbor a more even distribution of fiber, protein, and amino acid metabolizers, reflected by higher detection of metabolites from both protozoal and bacterial activity. We reveal microbiome variation across key protozoal and bacterial populations is interlinked, which should act as an important consideration for future development of microbiome-based technologies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The herbivore rumen is a highly specialized organ that has co-evolved in symbiosis with a complex microbiome, made up of thousands of microbial populations whose interactions collectively convert plant material into energy-yielding metabolites for the host. The rumen microbiome acts as an interface between the nutrient potential of the feed and the metabolism of the host animal, and includes members from all domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya (ciliate protozoa and fungi)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. From ingested plant material, cellulose, pectin, xylans, xyloglucans, and other polysaccharides are degraded by microbially encoded carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) down to their component monosaccharide units, which are subsequently fermented into several intermediates. Most importantly, pyruvate is converted to volatile fatty acids (VFAs) such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Along this fermentation pathway, hydrogen (H2) is produced, which predominantly flows into methanogenesis but can also be incorporated into VFAs through alternative hydrogen sinks such as the reduction of fumarate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The rumen epithelial wall is able to transport most of the VFAs directly into the blood, whereas more complex metabolites take a longer path, being assimilated by the posterior gastrointestinal tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Rumen microbiome structure and function is shaped by many dynamic host-associated variables, such as diet, age, health status, animal husbandry, behavior, and breed. Efforts to monitor and predict overall rumen microbiome function for the purpose of improved animal production have mainly focused on recovering isolates and genomes of the various microbial populations. However, the superior amenability of bacteria and archaea to current molecular microbiology techniques has created significant domain-specific information bias, with recovery of greater than 50,000 bacterial and archaeal genomes compared to ~50 for eukaryotic species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The ciliate protozoa, specifically the class Litostomatea, subclass Trichostomatia, have a relatively large biomass in the rumen (up to 50%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>), and are ubiquitous among ruminants. Although single-celled, they have complex organelles and physiological features, such as mouthlike adoral openings that lead to a tongue-like extrusible peristome, which ingests feed particles into an esophagus-like structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. This, combined with their outside being covered with undulating cilia for propulsion, makes many of them voracious predators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. To add to their versatility, they express carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and are able to degrade plant fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Decades of in vitro work have shown that rumen ciliates often act as a microhabitat for archaea and bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, especially <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> spp., which form metabolic mutualisms with several ciliate species by recycling the H2 produced by the ciliates as a main metabolic end product<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Providing <italic>in vivo</italic> context to the wider ecological impacts of rumen protozoal populations has proven immensely challenging but is necessary to advance microbiome-based solutions to animal productivity and sustainability, for example in the context of methane mitigation and improving feed efficiency.</p><p id="P4">Rapid advancement of biotechnological tools has improved the availability of data for resident rumen microbiota, yet information on how species interact within these multidomain ecosystems is still limited. In this study, we applied long-read metagenomics, existing single-cell amplified eukaryotic genomes, and genome-centric multi-omics of both host and its microbiome to improve resolution of inter-domain relationships and the influence they exert at a system level. Two breeds of cattle from a highly controlled experiment were phenotyped for key performance traits, and rumen contents, epithelial, and liver samples were analyzed across all molecular layers—genes, transcripts, proteins, and metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Taxonomic analysis identified two clear rumen microbiome structure types across the entire animal cohort that were not strongly correlated to breed, any of the recorded animal performance metrics, or methane emissions. Deeper analyses across the microbial domains identified two distinct protozoal population types that we hypothesize to drive system-wide microbiome differences, ultimately affecting the interlinked metabolisms that channel the flow of nutrients across the feed-microbiome-host axis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>One controlled animal experiment reveals two distinct rumen microbiome structure types</title><p id="P5">As part of an effort to improve the depth of understanding within the rumen microbiome, we analyzed samples from a controlled feedlot trial of adult beef cattle fed a total mixed ration of forage and concentrate (ratio: 51:49). From an initial 80 animals representing two breeds that commenced the trial, 36 Aberdeen-Angus cross (AAX) and 35 Luing animals completed the experimental period with all planned measurements, including key performance traits (KPTs) such as dry matter intake (DMI), average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and methane yield (g/kg DMI). For microbiome analysis, rumen samples were taken for all 71 animals at five timepoints across the experimental period and subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, with an additional final time point sampled at slaughter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). A subset of 24 animals (12 AAX, 12 Luing), representing the highest and lowest natural levels of methane yield, were sampled across both the host and its microbiome at slaughter. The datasets generated from these 24 animals included long-read metagenomics for metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) reconstruction as well as RNA, protein and metabolite analysis of rumen digesta, rumen epithelia and liver tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). As expected, the recorded KPTs showed breed-dependent differences in animal metrics, such as a higher liveweight and dry matter intake (DMI) in AAX animals, and a trend for higher methane emissions (g/kg DMI) in Luing animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P6">For microbiome characterization, long-read metagenomic sequencing of rumen samples from the 24-animal subset produced a total of 700 high- and medium-quality dereplicated metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs, 656 classified as bacterial, 44 as archaeal; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1a</xref>). These sample-specific MAGs, together with previously published fungal genomes (n=9)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and protozoal single amplified genomes (SAGs) (n=53)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, formed the reference database for metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic analyses. Rumen metatranscriptomics identified 1,669,849 expressed genes (1,299,827 from bacteria, 80,325 from archaea, 252,768 from protozoa, and 9,529 from fungi), whereas metaproteomics identified 35,655 protein groups (16,823 from bacteria, 380 from archaea, 18,000 from protozoa, 137 from fungi, and 315 from the cattle host) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1b</xref>). To further assist our interpretations of host and microbial metabolic activity we generated untargeted metabolomic data from the three different sample types available (numbers of identified metabolites: rumen: 496; rumen epithelium: 517; liver: 859; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1b</xref>). Finally, we performed VFA measurements from rumen fluid, as well as Microarray Polymer Profiling (MAPP) of rumen digesta, determining the composition and relative abundance of glycans available to the rumen microbiome.</p><p id="P7">Microbiome analysis of the 71 animals using the 16S rRNA gene sequence data did not reveal clear associations for any alpha or beta diversity metrics with breed, methane yield, or any of the other measured animal KPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). However, beta diversity plots illustrated two groups of animals whose microbiome structure distinctly clustered together, which could also be captured using probabilistic modeling (Dirichlet Multinomial Mixtures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Surprisingly, these two clusters, hereafter referred to as Rumen Community Type-A and -B (RCT-A and RCT-B), did not correspond to any measured animal KPT nor to any technical grouping that arose from the experimental workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). Furthermore, these community types were stable across time: the animals consistently stayed in the same cluster over the six timepoints sampled during the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). Using genome-scale metabolic models to predict the metabolic reaction abundances of archaea and bacteria, we found little variation in functional potential between RCT-A and RCT-B, supporting the importance of including all microbial domains (e.g. eukaryotes) as well as functional omics beyond genes and genomes in our analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Curiously, RCT-A and -B were detectable across several omic layers in the 24-animal subset that we analyzed in more detail. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of MAG abundances reflected the same pattern that was detected in the 16S rRNA gene sequence data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In Principal Component Analyses (PCA) of digesta and rumen wall epithelium metatranscriptomics as well as digesta metaproteomics, the first principal components (PCs) clearly differentiated RCT-A and -B, thus mirroring the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis results of the entire animal cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-d</xref>). The congruence between the molecular layers affirmed that elements of metabolism are affected by this distinct compositional difference in microbial communities of RCT-A and RCT-B. Untargeted metabolomics of digesta and the rumen wall epithelium also reflected this pattern on PCs 4 and 3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Finally, host proteomics and transcriptomics from wall and liver data showed a trend towards the two community types, although not always statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05 only for PC15 from liver proteomics; 0.1 &gt; p &gt; 0.05 for other host data; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Protozoal patterns associate with rumen community types</title><p id="P9">To further investigate the defined RCT-A or -B types, we extended our analyses to include domains of life present within the rumen samples of this study, incorporating the archaeal and bacterial MAGs as well as the single amplified genomes (SAGs) for protozoal populations. The taxonomic classifications of the transcripts and proteins with the strongest contributions (i.e. loadings) to the significant principal component patterns that were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>) clearly indicated that the RCT-A and -B clustering extended to the abundance profiles of detected protozoal species. Based on these and the differential abundance comparisons of metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic data, animals that exhibited the RCT-A pattern were enriched with families Entodiniinae and Isotrichidae, including high abundances of <italic>Entodinium bursa</italic>, <italic>Entodinium caudatum</italic>, <italic>Entodinium longinucleatum</italic>, and <italic>Isotricha intestinalis</italic>, as well as <italic>Ostracodinium gracile</italic> and <italic>Polyplastron multivesiculatum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Conversely, animals with the RCT-B pattern were enriched with subfamilies Diplodiniinae and Ophryoscolecinae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and typically included the species <italic>Diplodinium dentatum, Epidinum cattanei</italic>, <italic>Epidinium caudatum</italic>, and <italic>Ophryoscolex caudatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Coexistence or exclusion patterns of protozoal species in ruminants have been observed for over half a century, initially in microscopy-based studies suggesting that certain protozoal species are mutually exclusive, both in sheep and cattle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. These early, microscopy-based studies suggested that protozoal populations could be classified into two community types: type A, defined by the presence of <italic>Polyplastron multivesiculatum</italic>, often accompanied by <italic>Diploplastron affine</italic>, and type B, characterized by <italic>Epidinium</italic> and <italic>Eudiplodinium</italic> spp., together or alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The protozoal abundance patterns observed in our RNA and protein data bore remarkable similarities to these community types. A noticeable difference between the classical community types and our results was the coexistence of <italic>P. multivesiculatum</italic> and <italic>Epidinium</italic> spp. in our RCT-B animals. Such coexistence has been suggested to constitute an AB community type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,139,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, and postulated to represent a transitional stage from type B to A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. To explore the interrelationships of these protozoa, we examined the metatranscriptomes and metaproteomes of rumen samples collected from six animals over a period of three to six months. In line with the temporal stability of the bacterial and archaeal community structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>), our data indicated a constant, low but detectable presence of <italic>P. multivesiculatum</italic> together with <italic>Epidinium</italic> spp. in RCT-B animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). This brings to question whether these two protozoal genera are indeed mutually exclusive.</p><sec id="S5"><title>Protozoal community types affect bacterial and archaeal structure and function</title><p id="P11">We sought to better identify the microbial populations driving the observed system-wide variation, as well as its function implications, by further examining the metatranscriptome and metaproteome data. Differential expression analysis and the features with the strongest loadings in our abovementioned PCA analysis both highlighted that specific bacterial, archaeal and protozoal populations were indeed more prevalent in either RCT-A or -B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Collectively, for animals categorized as RCT-A, the metaproteomes from their rumen were largely dominated by <italic>Isotricha</italic> spp, <italic>Entodinium</italic> spp, and the clostridial lineage <italic>Acutalibacteraceae</italic> (RUG762) while transcriptomes for various <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> spp., <italic>Sodaliphilus</italic> spp., <italic>Faecousia</italic> spp. and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> (UBA1066) were also prevalent. In contrast, both the metatranscriptome and metaproteome for rumen samples from RCT-B animals showed far higher detection of <italic>Epidinium</italic> spp., while metatranscriptomics also indicated an enrichment in <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To link biology to these observed structural patterns, we explored the annotated functions of the differentially detected populations more deeply with specific attention to the key functional stages of rumen digestion, namely fiber hydrolysis, fermentation of organic material and production of energy-yielding volatile fatty acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). By far the most active fibrolytic population observed in RCT-B animals was <italic>Epidinium</italic> spp. which contained a plethora of CAZymes predicted to act upon cellulose, arabinoxylans, beta-mannans and arabinogalactan protein glycans commonly found in grasses and grains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Epidinia are the most reputable among the rumen ciliates to actively attach and degrade plant material, as visually confirmed across a series of prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In a scenario where epidinia are more proliferant and engaging in plant material deconstruction, it is reasonable to expect their activity and size will impact the glycan landscape that is available for neighboring microbial populations. Indeed, our MAPP analysis of rumen digesta particles was suggestive of differences in various beta-glucan, xylans, xyloglucans, and arabinogalactan proteins between the epidinia-dominated RCT-B animals and the RCT-A animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In turn, many fiber-degrading bacterial lineages, such as <italic>Sodaliphilus</italic> and <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp., were detected at higher levels in metatranscriptomic data arising from RCT-B animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), supporting our hypothesis that system-wide effects are driven by protozoal activity. While metaproteomic detection of central butyrate-producing enzymes was observed in both RCT’s, we suspect the elevated activity of epidinia species was influential towards higher butyrate levels in RCT-B animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b-c</xref>), which is supported by prior meta-analysis of protozoa that showed defaunation will substantially decrease ruminal butyrate levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">In the absence of elevated epidinia metabolism within RCT-A animals, both PCA and differential abundance analyses indicated the primary responsibilities for digestion was shared more broadly across the protozoal species <italic>Entodinium</italic> spp. and <italic>P. multivesiculatum</italic> as well as bacteria affiliated to family <italic>Acutalibacteraceae</italic> or genera <italic>Faecousia</italic> and <italic>Merdiplasma</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-b</xref>). The <italic>Isotricha</italic> species that dominated RCT-A animals were, as expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, not primarily degraders of plant material, though we suspect their influence still impacted heavily upon bacterial populations. For example, populations affiliated to RUG762 (<italic>Acutalibacteraceae</italic>), had some of the strongest loadings for RCT-A animals within the metaproteomic PCA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>) and similar to <italic>Isotricha</italic> species were consistently enriched in RCT-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Functional annotation suggested that RUG762 populations were engaged largely in protein and amino acid metabolism, and this was supported by metaproteomic and metabolomic enrichment of the enzymes and metabolites for aspartate, glutamine and branched chain amino acid metabolism in RCT-A animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Fermentation end products were predicted to be acetate and possibly propionate and branched-chain volatile fatty acids, which were also detected at higher proportions in RCT-A animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The protein and amino acids for ruminal metabolism could plausibly arise from the grain fraction of the animal’s diet (355 g/kg dry matter in the concentrate component).

If such excretion of amino acids indeed occurs in RCT-A animals dominated by <italic>Isotricha</italic> spp. our observations of elevated RUG762 metabolism are plausibly connected, though we acknowledge this hypothesis must be tested in future experiments that examine cellular proximity and nutrient transfer between these populations.</p><p id="P14">It was interesting to note that for RCT-A animals a grouping of <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic>-affiliated populations were detected at significantly higher abundance and/or with PCA loadings clearly associating them with RCT-A, despite there not being significant differences in measured methane yield across the two groups of animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). The holotrich <italic>Isotricha</italic> species have been repeatedly shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> to associate with different methanogenic populations than entodiniomorphids (e.g. epidinia), and our data also followed this trend with <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> populations in epidinia-dominated RCT-B animals seemingly of distinct strains compared to RCT-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). Functional examination of bacterial populations enriched in RCT-A animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>) also identified several taxa, including <italic>Faecousia</italic> and <italic>Merdiplasma</italic> species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, that were predicted to encode multimeric electron-bifurcating [FeFe] group A hydrogenases (HndABCD) as well as selected features putatively associated with the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WLP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). The WLP potentially facilitates reductive acetogenesis and can act as an alternative hydrogen sink to methanogenesis. While reductive acetogens indeed co-exist with methanogens, under normal rumen conditions they are believed to be outcompeted energetically and thus are often observed in low abundance. However, in a methane-inhibited rumen with elevated hydrogen partial pressure, <italic>Faecousia</italic> and <italic>Merdiplasma</italic> species have been observed to flourish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Indeed, aforementioned RUG762 populations were also suspected to encode a partial WLP as well as the associated energy conservation machinery such as the bidirectional electron-bifurcating hydrogenase (HndABCD), ferredoxin:NAD-oxidoreductase (Rnf) complex, and F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). However, the absence of the acetyl-CoA synthase/carbon monoxide dehydrogenase complex that is required for the complete reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to acetate, leads us to speculate that RUG762 populations are instead producing methionine via a cobalamin-dependent 5-methyltetrahydrofolate–homocysteine methyltransferase. In the context of higher methanogenic features in RCT-A animals, the non-differential methane yield levels observed across the RCT-A and -B animal are fascinating and are likely arising from as-yet undefined hydrogen flow that influences differing methanogen strains and other hydrogenotrophs in the rumen.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Implications for the host animal</title><p id="P15">Despite the distinct systems-wide microbiome shifts that were reconstructed for RCT-A and - B animals, we were surprised to observe only limited effects of these microbial community differences on host biology. Animal performance measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>), microbial and host metabolomic data, and host expression data in gut epithelial and liver tissues showed only minor changes to a small number of features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The clearest difference was the relative composition of several amino acids and VFAs, with propionate and branched chain volatile fatty acids higher in RCT-A animals, while butyrate levels were higher in RCT-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Since VFAs are the major energy source for the host animal and are taken up directly through the rumen wall epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, we further applied a series of network analyses using rumen and epithelial proteomic data to ascertain if underlying expression patterns were indeed evident between metabolically linked microbial and host pathways. From rumen metaproteomes, weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> identified a wide variety of co-expression modules (ME) that contained mixtures of protozoal, bacterial and archaeal proteins; many of these modules were, unsurprisingly, strongly correlated with the RCT variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). In the epithelial proteomics data, WGCNA identified only two co-expression modules, comprised largely of host proteins, that were correlated with the RCT groupings, none of which were enriched with proteins functionally inferred in VFA metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8</xref>). Of note, interlinked patterns of rumen digesta (ME9 and ME13) and epithelial (ME1) modules were enriched in proteins annotated in cysteine and methionine metabolism and RUG762 populations suggesting possible metabolic interplay of amino acids, though this needs future testing for validation. The lack of striking host effects arising from microbiome differences between RCT-A and -B animals highlights the extraordinary plasticity and functional redundancy of the rumen microbiome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">Rumen protozoa are large and complex compared to their bacterial and archaeal neighbors and their presence and distribution within the livestock rumen has been heavily documented for well over 130 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Despite their long-standing history their impact across the total rumen ecosystem remains poorly understood at a molecular level due to technical restrictions that have impeded their study, and which have only recently been overcome with omics methodologies. Herein we were excited to link the molecular patterns and functional interpretations in our data to community types first postulated over 60 years ago via light microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. When first describing protozoal community types in 1962 J. Margaret Eadie explicitly stated: “<italic>It is concluded that inter-relationships of the type described may play an important role in determining the components of a particular rumen microfauna</italic>.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. We show that for the animals in this study, the system-wide rumen microbiome structure indeed extended beyond the protozoal components originally proposed in community types A and B to encompass bacterial and archaeal populations.</p><p id="P17">Advancing the original Eadie hypothesis, our multi-layered omic datasets offered plausible interpretations on how two independent modes of metabolic interactions are interlinked across the rumen microbiome of RCT-A and -B animals. Of particular note was the seemingly direct influence certain protozoal species (e.g. <italic>Epidinium</italic> spp) play at higher trophic levels such as fiber hydrolysis, which likely impacts fiber structural configuration and availability for bacterial fibrolytic populations. On the other hand, protozoal metabolism of <italic>Isotricha</italic> spp. was predicted to indirectly affect how nutrients enter the food chain via excretion of metabolites such as amino acids and hydrogen, which impacted the structure and function of intermediate fermenters. While this study goes some way into explaining the microbiome-wide effects that particular protozoa can exert, major questions regarding the origin of their structural configuration still remain. We speculate the original protozoal seeding took place via animal-animal contact likely during early life transition that started with mother-calf contact and gradually extended to other animals across the greater herd. Unfortunately, behavioral data prior to animal enrolment and pen groupings used in this animal trial were not recorded, though it was clear that grouping of RCT-A and -B animals together in randomized pens had no immediate nor long term influence upon microbiome structure.</p><p id="P18">In this study we show that the acceleration in genome recovery of protozoal populations and their supplementation into rumen microbiome databases has massively impacted our ability to estimate the transdomain microbial trophic cascades that convert complex plant material into energy-yielding nutrients for the host animal. Moving forward, several outstanding knowledge gaps need to be prioritized so that greater microbiome resolution can be routinely gained. Laboratory-based experiments that validate both proximity and metabolic interactions between protozoa, bacteria and archaea will lead to improved interpretations of how protozoa modulate rumen biology and formulate tools to potentially intervene where desired. Finally, more extensive surveys of increased animal numbers, varying diets, breeds and management practices will need to be analyzed at a depth comparative to the present study to ascertain the wider implications of protozoal-bacterial-archaeal interactions, and how that knowledge can be applied to improve microbiome modulation strategies that make meaningful impact.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="P19">The animal experiment was conducted at the Beef and Sheep Research Centre of Scotland’s Rural College (6 miles south of Edinburgh, UK).

All animals were provided a typical basal diet consisting of whole crop barley (300 g/kg DM), grass silage (200 g/kg DM), barley (355 g/kg DM), maize dark grains (120 g/kg DM), molasses (15 g/kg DM) and minerals (10 g/kg DM). For half of the animals, the experimental design originally involved supplementation with <italic>Asparagopsis taxiformis</italic> red algae vegetative tissue (thallus) at 0.3% of the organic mass (OM). <italic>A. taxiformis</italic> is a feed additive which has been shown to reduce methane emissions in past studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, due to adverse effects observed in animals during the planned three-week seaweed adaptation phase, supplementation was terminated after just 15 days.

Temporal 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis of samples collected before and after the seaweed supplementation indicated no long-lasting microbiome effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). Due to this delay, the heaviest 32 animals, balanced for breed, underwent a shorter performance test period of 4 weeks instead of the normal 8 weeks. During performance testing, daily feed intake was recorded using electronic feeders (HOKO, Insentec, Marknesse, The Netherlands). Twice weekly, duplicated samples of each diet component were collected to determine dry matter content and to calculated dry matter intake (DMI). Body weight of each animal was measured weekly to estimate average daily gain (ADG) using a linear regression model including time on test.
