B cell activation via the B cell receptor, CD40 and the IL-4 receptor induced considerable re-modelling of the B cell protein landscape, with a 5-fold increase in total cellular protein mass within 24 hours of activation. Analysis of copy numbers per cell of &gt;7,500 proteins revealed increases in the metabolic machinery that supports B cell activation and nutrient and amino acid transporters that fuel B cell biosynthetic capacity. We reveal that mTORC1 controls activation-induced cell growth and B cell proteome remodelling and inhibiting mTORC1 impairs the expression of amino acid transporters that fuel B cell protein production. We also show that mTORC1 activity regulates the expression of the transcription factor MYC and the transferrin receptor CD71. Blocking MYC activity phenocopied mTORC1 inhibition in many ways including impaired CD71 expression, while limiting iron availability during B cell activation impaired B cell growth and protein synthesis. This work provides a detailed map of naïve and immune activated B cell proteomes and a greater understanding of the cellular machinery that direct B cell phenotypes.

B cell function is critical for maintaining health and as such B cell dysfunction is linked to a broad spectrum of diseases including autoimmunity and immunodeficiency, diseases of the central nervous system and B cell malignancies. B cells sense and respond to their environment using the B cell receptor (BCR) and a range of other cell surface receptors including CD40, which binds to CD40 ligand (CD40L) expressed on the surface of T cells, the pattern recognition Toll-Like Receptors including TLR4, which is triggered by lipopolysaccharide, and cytokine receptors including interleukin 4 receptor (IL4R) and interleukin 21 receptor (IL21R). Immune activation of B cells triggers transcriptional re-programming and elicits changes in metabolism and protein production that in turn drive proliferative expansion and B cell differentiation. Effective B cell activation will give rise to populations of short and long-lived antibody producing plasma cells as well as memory B cells. Thus, activated B cells need to ramp up metabolism and protein production appropriately to sustain these diverse fates.</p><p id="P4">A central metabolic regulator that controls protein synthesis in mammalian cells is the nutrient sensing serine/threonine protein kinase complex mTORC1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Various studies have outlined the importance of mTORC1 in B cell growth and differentiation, placing the nutrient-regulated kinase as a critical regulator of B cell function. mTORC1 is important in B cell class switching, somatic hypermutation, memory B cell formation and the unfolded protein response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. However, the mechanistic details of how mTORC1 regulates B cell activation, metabolism and protein synthesis are still to be fully mapped. Given the cell-type and cell-context specific impacts of mTORC1, a detailed analysis of the role of mTORC1 in B cell activation is needed if we are to fully understand its importance during immune challenge.</p><p id="P5">Quantitative proteomics is a valuable tool to understand immune cell phenotypes and cellular responses to stimulation, stress and the modulation of critical signalling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. A deep characterisation of the protein landscape of the cell may help to bridge the gap between transcriptional changes and metabolic readouts, providing quantitative data on the metabolic machinery and regulators that drive cell phenotypes and function. In this study we have used high sensitivity quantitative mass spectrometry to map the activated B cell proteome. We identify and quantify over 7500 proteins in naïve and activated B cells and provide estimates of absolute copy numbers per cell for each protein. We find that the naïve B cell increases its protein mass 5-fold within 24 hours of activation leading to over 5000 proteins increasing in abundance and a handful of proteins dropping in abundance including regulators of translation and cell cycle. We highlight the core processes and metabolic machinery that are regulated by B cell activation and demonstrate the critical role of the System L large neutral amino acid transporter SLC7A5 in B cell activation. We reveal that selectively blocking mTORC1 activity dramatically impacts activation-induced proteome remodelling and impairs B cell protein production. mTORC1 activity is required for the sustained expression of the transcription factor MYC and for the upregulation of amino acid transporters that fuel B cell protein production, including SLC7A5. mTORC1 also regulates the expression of the transferrin receptor CD71, which is critical for iron uptake in cells. Inhibiting MYC phenocopied many of the effects of mTORC1 inhibition including the reduced expression of CD71, while limiting iron availability during B cell activation impaired B cell growth and protein synthesis. Together this data provides a valuable resource for the immunology community. We provide new insight into how B cells respond to stimulation and modulate their core metabolic processes and machinery for fuelling protein synthesis, shedding new light on the role of mTORC1, MYC and iron during B cell activation. Our proteomics data is freely available and easy to explore on the Immunological Proteome Resource<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.immpres.co.uk/">www.immpres.co.uk</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Activation-induced proteome remodelling in B cells</title><p id="P6">To assess the intrinsic changes driven by B cell activation, high resolution quantitative mass spectrometry was used to characterise the proteomes of primary naïve and immune-activated B cells, identifying and quantifying &gt;7500 proteins. 24hr stimulation of B cells with anti-IgM, anti-CD40 and IL-4 resulted in a considerable increase in B cell size as shown by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>) and a 5-fold increase in total cellular protein mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>). Using the proteomic ruler <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> we estimated the copy numbers per cell of all proteins identified in naïve and activated B cells. Proteins were ranked according to their estimated copy number per cell and plotted against their cumulative contribution to total protein abundance, to evaluate which proteins dominate the protein mass of naïve and activated B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>). In naïve B cells, the 7 most abundant proteins which contribute 50% of the total protein mass of the cell are largely histones and cytoskeleton molecules while in activated cells 147 proteins contribute 50% of the total protein mass and includes ribosomal proteins and translational machinery, revealing that immune activation remodels the core proteome of B cells to drive protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>). To explore this further we analysed the contribution of different cellular compartments to the overall protein mass of the cell. Ribosomal proteins made up ∼3% of the total protein mass of naïve cells which increased to 9% following activation, while mitochondrial proteins rose from 11% to 16% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref>). Some components such as the nuclear envelope and plasma membrane, were present in higher copies following activation but when adjusted against the total cellular protein content, showed little change relative to the total proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To examine protein changes in more detail, differential expression analysis was performed and revealed that &gt;5800 proteins were significantly increased in expression &gt;1.5-fold and with a p value &lt;0.05 in activated B cells as compared to naïve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1e</xref>). The full data set along with fold changes, p values and q values can be found in Supplementary File 1. Among those proteins increasing in abundance were activation receptors CD86, CD69 and CD44 (Supplementary File 1). 56 proteins were found exclusively in naïve B cells and not in activated B cells, suggesting that they may be degraded upon B cell stimulation. These proteins included molecules controlling B cell quiescence such as the transcription factor KLF2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1e</xref>). Only 50 proteins were significantly downregulated upon B cell activation. Among those proteins significantly downregulated upon B cell activation were negative regulators of key processes facilitating protein synthesis and proliferation such as the mRNA translational repressor PDCD4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and the cell cycle inhibitor p27 (CDKN1B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1e</xref>). The loss of p27 was accompanied by an increase in positive regulators of cell cycle such as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK1-4), as well as A-type, B-type, and D-type cyclins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1f</xref>). Subunits of the EIF4F translational complex responsible for mRNA translation also showed an increase in abundance and corresponding the loss of PDCD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1g</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Considering that naïve B cells increased their total protein content 5-fold following 24h immune activation, we performed subsequent analysis on proteins increasing in expression &gt;5-fold to capture changes out-with the overall scaling up of protein mass following activation. We performed GO term enrichment analysis on proteins changing more than 5-fold or present only in activated B cells and found that enriched pathways included ribosome biogenesis, protein folding, mitochondrial translation, and Golgi vesicle transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1h</xref>). Among the proteins enriched in Golgi vesicle transport were components of the coat protein complex II (COPII) involved in anterograde transport, including SAR1B, Sec23p/Sec24p and the Sec13p/Sec31p heterodimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1i</xref>). These data suggest that at 24h hrs of stimulation, B cells already begin to switch on trafficking machinery to support high levels of protein export necessary for antibody secretion. There was also considerable modulation of transcription factor expression upon B cell activation. Over 400 proteins with predicted transcription factor activity were identified within the data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref> and Supplementary File 1). Most of these transcription factors increased in abundance in response to immune activation and some were only detected in activated cells including NFIL3, AHR and JUNB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>). NFIL3 expression is regulated by IL4 and is critical for B cell class switching <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Other transcription factors were considerably upregulated upon activation, including IRF4 which increased from around 4,000 copies per cell in naïve B cells to over 200,000 copies per cell upon activation. EGR2, which controls antigen receptor induced proliferation in B cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, increased from around 200 copies in naïve cells to almost 70,000 copies upon activation. Some transcription factors increased by a much smaller scale including PAX5 (Supplementary File 1), which increased less than 2-fold and which has previously been shown to be important during B cell development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. A small number of transcription factors were downregulated upon activation or were exclusively found in naïve cells including ELK4, CXXC5 and KLF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Immune activation drives nutrient transporter expression and metabolic and mitochondrial remodelling</title><p id="P9">24-hour B cell activation was accompanied by a considerable increase in cell size and total protein content. This rapid increase in cell size is energetically demanding and would require increased uptake of nutrients to fuel anabolic processes. We next asked which nutrient transporters were expressed in response to B cell activation. Several solute carrier (SLC) molecules were upregulated upon activation including amino acid transporters SLC1A5, a glutamine transporter, and SLC7A5 which transports many essential amino acids including methionine, tryptophan and leucine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>). Expression of these transporters was extremely low in naïve B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>). SLC7A5 is critical for antigen-driven T cell responses, T cell differentiation and effector function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. To explore the importance of SLC7A5 in B cell activation we used splenocytes from VavCre x <italic>Slc7a5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. In these mice, VavCre drives deletion of <italic>Slc7a5</italic> in early haematopoietic development. Splenocytes from VavCre x <italic>Slc7a5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were activated using anti-IgM and anti-CD40. The SLC7A5 KO B cells were considerably smaller than cre negative controls after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>). SLC7A5 KO B cells also showed reduced expression of CD98, the heavy chain chaperone which forms a heterodimer with many amino acid transporters, including SLC7A5 and SLC7A6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Additionally, SLC7A5 KO B cells had impaired expression of the transferrin receptor CD71 in response to immune activation. CD71 is essential for iron uptake which fuels multiple metabolic processes in B cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>). Together this data highlights the important role of a single amino acid transporter in fuelling the increase in size and the upregulation of key proteins that fuel B cell immune activation.</p><p id="P10">We next wanted to understand in greater detail the metabolic shift in B cells that occurs upon activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Using estimates of protein copy per cell we mapped glycolytic enzymes and enzymes that drive the pentose-phosphate pathway and one carbon metabolism. Previous studies have questioned the importance of glycolysis in B cell activation, suggesting instead that activated B cells switch on oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) but not glycolysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The proteomic data show that expression of the glycolytic machinery, including rate-limiting glucose and lactate transporters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> as well as glycolytic enzymes are considerably upregulated upon B cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>). Indeed, the glucose and lactate transporters SLC2A1 and SLC16A1 were virtually undetectable in naïve cells but were found in tens of thousands of copies upon B cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref> and Supplementary File 1). The cellular mass of enzymes involved in one-carbon metabolism increased 10-fold in response to B cell activation, suggesting changes in metabolic enzymes that are beyond just scaling with increased cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Activation induced mitochondrial re-modelling has been well documented in B cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Using Mitocarta <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, predicted mitochondrial proteins were annotated within our data set, revealing that total mitochondrial molecules increased approximately 6-fold upon B cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d</xref>). To explore changes in mitochondrial processes that were independent of activation-induced mitochondrial scaling, we adjusted protein copy numbers by the total mitochondrial protein molecules to determine their relative contribution. This analysis revealed mitochondrial proteins and processes that didn’t just follow the scaled increase in mitochondrial mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d</xref>). For example, mitochondrial ribosomes increased 3-fold when adjusted against total mitochondrial molecules, suggesting increased dedication towards mitochondrial protein synthesis in the activating cell. In contrast, molecules involved in oxidative phosphorylation showed a diverse expression pattern with some, including cytochrome C1 and F-type ATPase subunits, remaining at similar concentrations in naïve and activated B cells, suggesting a scaled increase in abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Having noted significant increases in amino acid, glucose and lactate transporter expression upon B cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a and c</xref>) we also found considerable upregulation of the transferrin receptor CD71 (TFRC) from around 3000 copies per cell in naïve B cells to approximately 0.5 million copies upon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e</xref>). Using annotations of iron-regulated proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> we examined the expression profile of iron-interacting proteins in naïve and activated B cells. We detected 151 iron-regulated proteins in our proteomics data. These included proteins involved in Fe-S cluster synthesis, histone modification (Jmjd family proteins, Kdm family proteins), DNA synthesis (Pol family proteins), and OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2f</xref> and Supplementary File 1). To gain a clearer understanding of the cellular requirements for iron, we estimated the total iron-content of the naïve and activated B cells. We assumed that all iron interacting sites were fully occupied and used known values of iron atoms per protein (where possible). Where exact values were not known we used a deliberate underestimation of 1 iron atom for heme or iron ion interaction, and 2 iron atoms for Fe-S cluster interactions, as described by Teh et al <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Using the protein copy numbers from our data, these calculations showed that the iron demand, or requirement, in naïve T cells is approximately 5 million iron atoms per cell. The demand for iron is increased 7-fold to 35 million iron atoms per cell in activated B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2g</xref>). These increased requirements for iron, to drive DNA synthesis, histone modifications and mitochondrial functions, are matched by the increased expression of CD71 (TFRC).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>mTORC1 activity drives protein biosynthesis and the machinery for fuelling B cells</title><p id="P13">Given the central role that mTORC1 plays in regulating diverse cellular responses including lymphocyte growth and differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> we next wanted to explore how mTORC1 regulates the protein biosynthetic capacity of activating B cells and the impact of blocking mTORC1 activity on B cell proteome remodelling. To selectively block mTORC1 during B cell activation, cells were treated with rapamycin and mTORC1 activity monitored through the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, a downstream target of active mTORC1 signalling. Blocking mTORC1 activity with rapamycin during B cell activation reduced S6 phosphorylation to levels similar to those observed in naïve B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>). Rapamycin treated cells were significantly smaller in size and had approximately half the total cellular protein mass when compared to control activated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). Further, B cells activated with rapamycin exhibited a considerable reduction in rates of protein synthesis compared to untreated cells, as measured by the incorporation of an analogue of puromycin into elongating protein chains in the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref>). We sought to understand how the inhibition of mTORC1 was driving the reduction in rates of protein synthesis and consequent decrease in protein mass. Proteomic analysis of cells treated with rapamycin revealed that &gt;4800 proteins had reduced abundance when mTORC1 activity was blocked, while only 40 proteins were found at increased levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4e</xref>). GO term enrichment analysis revealed that mTORC1 inhibition had a profound effect on many of the processes highly upregulated by B cell activation, including ribosome biogenesis, protein folding and mitochondrial translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4f</xref>). A closer examination revealed that ribosomal protein mass and mitochondrial protein mass were both significantly reduced in response to blocking mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4g</xref>). Transcription factors were among some of the most rapamycin-sensitive proteins in B cells. IRF4, a critical regulator of B cell reprogramming during early activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, was found at significantly lower levels in rapamycin treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4h</xref>). IRF8 expression was also significantly impaired when mTORC1 activity was blocked. IRF8 has previously been shown to be important during B cell development and B cell germinal centre responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, although the role of IRF8 during B cell activation remains unclear. Our proteomic data also revealed high expression of AHR exclusively in activated B cells, which was found at significantly reduced levels, along with the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator (ARNT), by rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4i</xref>). AHR deletion has been shown to impact B cell proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Interestingly, several cyclin dependent kinases were found at significantly reduced levels in response to mTORC1 inhibition, notably CDK1, which was found at over 120,000 copies per cell in activated B cells, but only 5,000 copies in B cells activated with rapamycin (Supplementary File 1). Together, this data suggests that blocking mTORC1 with rapamycin significantly impacts activation-induced proteome remodelling, reducing the abundance of key proteins involved in ribosomal and mitochondrial mass, transcriptional regulation, proliferation and cell cycle progression.</p><p id="P14">mTORC1 inhibition also caused reduced expression of solute carrier proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4j</xref>) including the glucose transporter SLC2A1, the lactate transporter SLC16A1 and the System L amino acid transporter SLC7A5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4k</xref>). The transferrin receptor CD71 and the mitochondrial iron transporter ABCB7 were also significantly reduced in abundance in mTORC1 inhibited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4k</xref>). To explore the mTORC1 impact on amino acid transport further we interrogated the System L amino acid transport capacity of B cells using a sensitive, flow cytometry based assay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Uptake of the fluorescent SLC7A5 substrate kynurenine was impaired in B cells activated in the presence of rapamycin, orthogonally validating our proteomics data showing reduced levels of SLC7A5 abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5a, 5b, 5c</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis also revealed reduced abundance of CD98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5d, 5e</xref>) and the transferrin receptor CD71 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5f, 5g</xref>). We next assessed the expression of iron interacting proteins in response to mTORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5h</xref>) and found that many were considerably reduced in abundance including dioxygenase enzymes ALKBH1-8, a selection of cytochromes, NDUF molecules that are critical for oxidative phosphorylation along with components of the DNA replication fork complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5h</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that mTORC1 plays a crucial role in regulating nutrient uptake in B cells, including the regulation of iron transporters and iron interacting molecules.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>mTORC1 regulates MYC expression in B cells</title><p id="P15">We questioned whether mTORC1 driven effects on nutrient transport in B cells could in part be explained by an impact on MYC abundance. MYC is a master regulator of cellular metabolism and growth and controls amino acid transporter expression in T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. MYC is challenging to identify by mass spectrometry, most likely due to its constant turnover. We therefore monitored MYC expression in response to mTORC1 inhibition using a MYC-GFP reporter mouse <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. We found that MYC was upregulated upon B cell activation, but MYC expression was significantly reduced in rapamycin treated cells at 4 hours and 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5i and 5j</xref>), suggesting the mTORC1 activity is required for maximal MYC expression during B cell activation. Having revealed that mTORC1 activity impacts MYC expression in activating B cells we next sought to understand the consequence of directly blocking MYC activity on B cells. To block MYC at the point of activation, B cells were treated with a small molecule inhibitor of MYC, MYCi361, which inhibits the formation of MYC:MAX heterodimers and blocks the ability of MYC to bind DNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Mass spectrometry was used to evaluate the impact of MYC inhibition on the B cell protein landscape while flow cytometry of key surface markers was used for validation. B cells activated in the presence of MYCi361 were reduced in size compared to control cells, according to their forward scatter profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6a</xref>) and total protein copies per cell was also reduced in response to MYC inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6b</xref>). Over 2500 proteins showed reduced abundance when MYC activity was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6c</xref>). Included in those proteins that were reduced in abundance were ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6d</xref>). In activated B cells ribosomal proteins totalled over 1.5×10<sup>8</sup> copies per cell while in MYC inhibitor treated cells this reduced to approximately 0.75×10<sup>8</sup> copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6d</xref>). Components of the DNA replication fork machinery were also considerably reduced in expression upon MYC inhibition, in some cases more than 5-fold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The impact of MYC inhibition on DNA replication proteins was strikingly similar when compared with rapamycin treated cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), highlighting the overlap between mTORC1 and MYC regulated proteins in B cells. Using our proteomics data along with orthogonal validation by flow cytometry, we found that the homing receptor CD62L and the activation marker CD69 were not impacted by MYCi361 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6e-h</xref>), in agreement with observations in activating T cells with a MYC KO <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. However, the transferrin receptor CD71 (TFRC) showed significantly reduced abundance in response to MYCi361 as measured by mass spectrometry along with cell surface staining and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6i and j</xref>). CD71 expression is dependent on MYC expression in CD8 T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> and also in B cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. In addition to reduced abundance of CD71, iron interacting proteins were among those down-regulated upon MYC inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6k</xref>). Interestingly, aside from CD71, nutrient and amino acid transporters were largely unimpacted by MYC inhibition (Supplementary File 1).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Iron availability is essential for B cell growth and protein synthesis</title><p id="P16">Receptor mediated endocytosis through the transferrin receptor CD71 is the primary method by which lymphocytes take up iron from their extracellular environment. Mutations in CD71 are linked with impaired lymphocyte function and immunodeficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Having found that CD71 expression is regulated by SLC7A5 transporter expression along with mTORC1 activity and MYC activity, we next tested whether iron availability regulates activation-induced B cell growth and protein synthesis. Using the iron chelator deferiprone (3-Hydroxy-1,2-dimethyl-4(1H)-pyridone) B cells were activated for 24 hours in iron depleting conditions and monitored by flow cytometry to assess cell size, activation and protein synthesis. Iron chelation impaired the increase in cell size seen upon B cell activation, with increasing concentrations of deferiprone corelating with decreased cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7a, 7b and 7c</xref>). However, B cells were still able to upregulate the activation marker CD69 in iron limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7d and 7e</xref>). Protein synthesis was significantly increased in activated B cells when compared with IL4 maintained cells but dropped with increasing concentration of the iron chelator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7f</xref>). Higher concentrations of deferiprone (100μM and 300μM) brought levels of protein synthesis down to levels seen in IL4 maintained cells. Together this data shows that iron availability is a critical regulator of activation-induced cell growth in B cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">In this work we have mapped the protein landscape of naïve B cells and their response to activation through the B cell receptor, CD40 and the IL4 receptor. Our data reveals the scale of proteome remodelling triggered by B cell activation and the dramatic reconfiguration of cellular compartments including mitochondria and ribosomes. This study aimed to identify the metabolic regulators of B cell activation and protein synthesis. One important biological insight was the identification of the repertoire of amino acid transporters that are expressed upon B cell activation. Deleting one of these transporters, SLC7A5 which transports methionine, tryptophan and leucine, was catastrophic for B cell activation. SLC7A5 has previously been shown to be important during B cell development, with SLC7A5 deletion mice showing reduced B1 B cell numbers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. We now reveal an important role for SLC7A5 during B cell activation. In a complementary study Cheung et al., (personal communication) reveal the importance of SLC7A5 during LPS-mediated B cell activation, with SLC7A5 KO B cells showing impaired activation and proliferation. Together our studies show the fundamental role of a single amino acid transporter in B cell activities.</p><p id="P18">To understand the metabolic regulation of B cells we examined the impact of blocking mTORC1 activity during B cell activation. While mTORC1 is firmly established as a key regulator of metabolism and protein synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, the mechanisms by which it does this in different cell types is yet to be fully mapped. Inhibiting mTORC1 had a considerable impact on protein production during B cell activation, and cells activated in the presence of rapamycin had a reduction in total protein mass of approximately 50% compared to control activated cells. We found that SLC7A5 expression was regulated by mTORC1, with rapamycin treated cells showing reduced abundance of SLC7A5 and reduced SLC7A5-mediated amino acid uptake. We also found that mTORC1 activity regulates the expression of the transferrin receptor CD71. mTORC1 also regulates the expression of transcription factors that direct B cell activation and differentiation including IRF’s, AHR and MYC. In T cells, the transcription factor MYC is required for the expression of SLC7A5, along with a selection of other nutrient transporters including CD71<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Inhibiting MYC activity in B cells phenocopied many of the mTORC1 inhibition effects including a considerable impact on the cell’s DNA replication machinery, ribosomal protein content and the abundance of CD71. Interestingly, while mTORC1 and MYC are considered master regulators of cellular metabolism, their inhibition did not completely block protein synthesis. Much of the B cell protein landscape is not regulated by mTORC1 or MYC and B cells still considerably increased their cellular protein content despite mTORC1 and MYC inhibition. This highlights that the regulatory pathways for protein synthesis and cell growth are complex. Additional hubs are likely to be important and the interplay between hubs or their combinatorial effects may modulate B cell activation and cell growth. In addition, the nutrient environment is likely to be a fundamental driver of B cell responses. Understanding how B cells respond to nutrient stress during activation and how this impacts mTORC1 and MYC driven pathways is an important next step.</p><p id="P19">Iron has been widely shown to be essential for immune cell function. In B cells, iron availability is required for proliferation and antibody responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Our findings show that mTORC1 activity, SLC7A5 expression and MYC activity all regulate CD71 expression during B cell activation. We questioned whether mTORC1 and MYC mediated proteome remodelling could in large part be attributed to iron availability. Indeed, chelating iron during B cell activation impaired B cell growth and protein synthesis. Our data points towards CD71 and iron availability being a key regulatory hub for B cell activation.</p><p id="P20">In conclusion, this study provides in-depth proteomic maps of naïve and activated B cells and the impact of modulating key signalling pathways during B cell activation.

The impact of MYCi361 on CD62L (L-selectin), CD69 and CD71 (TFRC) measured by mass spectrometry (<bold>e, g</bold> and <bold>i</bold>) and flow cytometry (<bold>f, h</bold> and <bold>j</bold>). <bold>(k)</bold> Volcano plot showing the expression profile of iron-interacting proteins in response to blocking MYC activity. For b, d, f, h and j statistical significance was derived from an unpaired two-tailed t test where * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01. For all other experiments differential expression analysis and statistical significance was derived from two-tailed empirical Bayes moderated t-statistics performed in limma on the total dataset where * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01. For all experiments, at least 3 biologically independent samples were analysed. All error bars are mean with s.d.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS202380-f006"/></fig><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Iron availability is critical for activation-induced B cell growth and protein synthesis</title><p><bold>(a)</bold> Flow cytometry forward and side scatter profile of B cells after 24 hours either maintained in IL4 (1ng/ml) or activated with anti-IgM, anti CD40 and IL4 (10ng/ml) +/- the iron chelator deferiprone. <bold>(b and c)</bold> Forward scatter profile of B cells activated for 24 hours as described above. <bold>(d and e)</bold> CD69 expression in B cells after 24 hours either maintained in IL4 (1ng/ml) or activated with anti-IgM, anti CD40 and IL4 (10ng/ml) +/- deferiprone. <bold>(f and g)</bold> The impact of deferiprone on B cell protein synthesis. B cells were activated for 24 hours and protein synthesis measured by OPP incorporation and labelling with Alexa 647-azide using a copper-catalysed click-chemistry reaction.
