The Target Of Rapamycin (TOR) complex 2 is a protein kinase that acts as a central regulator of PM homeostasis, but the mechanisms by which it monitors and reacts to membrane stresses are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we characterized a family of amphiphilic molecules that physically perturb PM organization and in doing so inhibit TORC2 in yeast and mammalian cells. Using fluorescent lipid associated reporters in budding yeast, we show that these small molecules first cause a transient increase in the amount of biochemically accessible ergosterol at the PM. Contemporaneous TORC2 inhibition stimulates a rapid removal of accessible ergosterol from the PM by the PM-ER sterol transporters Lam2 and Lam4, necessary for TORC2 reactivation. Thus, we show that TORC2 acts in a feedback loop to control active sterol levels at the PM and introduce sterols as possible TORC2 signalling modulators.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>TOR complex 2</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane</kwd><kwd>sterols</kwd><kwd>sterol transport</kwd><kwd>membrane tension</kwd><kwd>small amphipaths</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The plasma membrane (PM) is an interface between the cell and its surroundings. It serves both as a selectively permeable barrier and as a signalling platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Leonard, Loose and Martens, 2023</xref>). The involvement of the PM in a large collection of cellular processes is enabled by its lateral compartmentalization into functional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Honigmann and Pralle, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Lu and Fairn, 2018</xref>). This is dependent on the biophysical properties of the PM, and thus on its complex protein and lipid composition and configuration. To maintain optimal PM properties, cells actively regulate their lipid repertoire. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">van Meer, Voelker and Feigenson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Harayama and Riezman, 2018</xref>) Sterols, such as ergosterol in yeast, are a good example of such regulation. Sterols are major modulators of physical membrane properties, such as rigidity and phase behaviour, and they are especially enriched at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dufourc, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Doole <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Varma and Deserno, 2022</xref>). As important factors in membrane microdomain organization(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kefauver <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>), most sterol molecules in membranes are cloistered by phospho- and sphingolipids, and only the excess fraction is free and accessible for biochemical processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Ohvo-Rekilä <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Sokolov and Radhakrishnan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lange <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Das <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Lange and Steck, 2020</xref>). Sterol levels in internal membranes vary and require tight regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">van Meer, Voelker and Feigenson, 2008</xref>). The redistribution of sterols between cellular membranes depends on various vesicular and non-vesicular transport routes, of which cytosolic and membrane-contact-sites lipid transport proteins are the most efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kaplan and Simoni, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baumann <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dittman and Menon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Wong, Gatta and Levine, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Steck, Tabei and Lange, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Target Of Rapamycin Complex 2 (TORC2) is one of two functionally and structurally conserved protein complexes containing the essential protein kinase TOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Heitman, Movva and Hall, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Loewith <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Wullschleger, Loewith and Hall, 2006</xref>). While specific inhibition by rapamycin has facilitated characterization of TORC1, TORC2 is rapamycin-insensitive and thus its characterization has relatively lagged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Loewith <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gaubitz <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Recent studies have positioned TORC2 as a central regulator of PM homeostasis which reacts to changes in the biophysical properties of PM: the application of various orthogonal stimuli that cause an increase in membrane tension and/or other stress - i.e. hypo-osmotic shock, sphingolipid biosynthesis inhibition - also cause an increase in TORC2 activity, while those that reduce membrane tension - hyper-osmotic shock and treatment with palmitoylcarnitine (PalmC) - rapidly inactivate TORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Berchtold <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Riggi <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). TORC2 regulates several processes that affect turgor pressure and/or plasma membrane properties, via its primary effector, the AGC family kinase Ypk1, (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Roelants <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Thorner, 2022</xref>)). The retrograde PM-ER sterol transporters Lam2 and Lam4 are amongst the downstream effectors regulated by Ypk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Roelants <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Topolska <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), reinforcing TORC2’s role in PM biophysical homeostasis. Consistent with this role, acute chemical inhibition of TORC2 increases PM tension, while Ypk1 hyperactivation decreases it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Riggi <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Collectively, these data have recently led us to propose that TORC2 functions in a mechanosensitive feedback loop to maintain the biophysical homeostasis of the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Riggi, Kusmider and Loewith, 2020</xref>). This role of TORC2 is likely conserved in higher eukaryotes, as evidenced by reports showing that the major mTORC2 substrate Akt is regulated downstream of changes in membrane tension and that mTORC2 signalling feeds back to control PM properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kippenberger <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Diz-Muñoz <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Roffay <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Ono, Matsuzawa and Ikenouchi, 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P5">How TORC2 monitors PM status and adapts signaling to react to different stresses remains poorly understood. In budding yeast, TORC2 stimulation by PM stress is dependent on the tension dependent release of the regulatory proteins Slm1 and Slm2 from the eisosomal compartment, a stress sensitive PM domain scaffolded by BAR domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Berchtold <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Appadurai <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lanze <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Sakata <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kefauver <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Counterintuitively, TORC2 inhibition seems to be independent of Slm1/2 relocation and instead correlates with the formation of PI(4,5)P2-containing PM invaginations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Riggi <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). In neither case are the molecular mechanisms of TORC2 regulation well understood. During hyperosmotic shock, transient TORC2 inhibition is paired with a transient activation of the Hog1 MAPK cascade. These changes in TORC2 and Hog1 activities converge on the production and efflux of the osmolyte glycerol to mitigate the offset of cell volume and turgor and ultimately restore homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Muir <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Riggi <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">de Nadal and Posas, 2022</xref>). We previously identified the small amphiphile palmitoylcarnitine (PalmC) as an indirect TORC2 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Riggi <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). PalmC inserts into the PM, and like hyperosmotic shock, reduces PM tension and transiently inhibits TORC2, but, surprisingly, does not activate Hog1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Riggi <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). This suggests that PalmC triggers a PM stress that is mechanistically distinct from hyperosmotic shock stress, and likely requires different adaptive mechanisms to resolve. Building on this observation, we sought to use PalmC as a tool to better understand the physicochemical properties of the PM that are sensed upstream of TORC2. We found that exposure to small amphipaths causes a transient increase of free sterol molecules at the PM, which correlates with TORC2 inhibition. This in turn stimulates a rapid removal of free PM ergosterol, dependent on the START-domain proteins Lam2 and Lam4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gatta <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Murley <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Topolska <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), which is necessary for TORC2 reactivation. Thus, our data describe a feedback loop between TORC2 activity and free sterol levels at the PM, highlighting TORC2’s role in regulating PM biophysical properties and domain organization.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>PalmC partitions into the PM to inhibit TORC2</title><p id="P6">We have previously reported that the small amphipathic molecule PalmC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, grey panel) acts as an indirect inhibitor of TORC2 by directly interacting with the PM.

Indeed, previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have revealed that PalmC virtually completely partitions into lipid bilayers in aqueous solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Requero, Goni and Alonso, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Goñi, Requero and Alonso, 1996</xref>). We observed that the kinetics and magnitude of PalmC effect correlated closely with the absolute amount rather than the concentration of PalmC administered to a population of cells, and thus with culture density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). This difference cannot be attributed to differences in culture stage, or secreted factors, since it is observed in cells from the same logarithmically growing culture, which were pelleted and resuspended to different culture densities (OD<sub>600nm</sub>) in fresh media. Thus, controlling culture density offers a way to fine-tune PalmC effect at sub-CMC levels. We conclude that the effect of PalmC must be a consequence of its propensity to partition directly into cell membranes, in our case most probably the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>A family of small amphipaths with similar properties recapitulates the effect of PalmC</title><p id="P8">To characterize which molecular features of PalmC are necessary for its effect on the PM and TORC2, we performed a Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) analysis. We screened a panel of derivatives, differing from PalmC in either the length (or saturation) of their fatty acyl chain, or in their headgroup moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), for their ability to recapitulate the PalmC effect.</p><p id="P9">First, we tested if any of these derivatives were able to cause PM invaginations both in live yeast cells expressing the PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> FLARE (fluorescent lipid-associated reporter) GFP-2xPH<sup>PLCδ</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kavran <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), and in a high throughput microscopy screen with fixed cells expressing mCherry-2xPH<sup>PLCδ</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Both approaches showed that a carbon tail of at least C14 was necessary to induce PM invaginations, and the effect was more substantial and lasted longer in carnitine derivatives with a carbon tail length of C16 or greater. In general, a cationic (choline, LCBs) or zwitterionic (carnitine, PAF (as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kennedy <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>)) headgroup was necessary for induction of PM invaginations, while amphipaths with uncharged headgroups had no effect.</p><p id="P10">Next, we checked the effect of our derivatives on TORC2 activity. Substances that caused PM invaginations also inhibited TORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Ypk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) (but not TORC1 phosphorylation of Sch9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>)). The inhibitory effect correlated with the effect size and duration of PM invaginations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>). The inhibition of TORC2 by small amphipaths is conserved in mammalian cells, where PalmC (in a dose dependent fashion) and derivatives that were effective in yeast trigger the loss of mTORC2 mediated phosphorylation of Akt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D,E</xref>). We continued to characterize the effects of small amphipaths in budding yeast.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The effects of small amphipaths are independent of metabolization</title><p id="P11">In our SAR screen, we had also included the long chain sphingoid bases (LCBs) dihydrosphingosine (DHS) and phytosphingosine (PHS), which resemble PalmC in structure and effect, but unlike PalmC are metabolites naturally found in yeast. It had been reported previously that the addition of PHS leads to TORC2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Lucena <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>); however, in this previous work, it was postulated that processing of long chain base into more complex sphingolipid species was required for TORC2 inhibition, a model at odds with our proposition that these amphiphiles act directly on the PM to trigger TORC2 inhibition. To challenge these models, we exploited a non-physiological / non-metabolizable enantiomer of DHS – L-<italic>erythro-</italic>DHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Watanabe <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel).

Thus, LCBs (and likely other amphipaths) directly act on the PM and inhibit TORC2 without the need to be metabolized. For the remainder of the study, PalmC was used as a PM targeting drug, since it gave us the most robust effect in the SAR screen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Small amphipaths cause selective redistribution of PM ergosterol</title><p id="P12">Perturbation by PalmC results in PM remodelling, with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> accumulating transiently in giant PM invaginations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Riggi <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>).

Indeed, we could observe that immediately after addition of PalmC, the PM signal of yeGFP-D4H increased in some cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). However, this effect was clearly visible only in cells that had little to no yeGFP-D4H at the PM before treatment (and thus a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> colocalization coefficient around 0). Only a very small fraction of cells falls into this category in steady state conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), rendering this very transient effect difficult to measure across a population in WT cells. Instead, we opted to use Rapamycin (30min) pretreated <italic>AVO3-ΔCT TOR1-1</italic> cells, where PM yeGFP-D4H localization is drastically reduced across the population without direct perturbation of the PM.

Unlike PalmC, hyperosmotic shock doesn’t directly alter PM composition by addition of exogenous lipid.

Wishing to challenge our previous hypothesis, we expanded our investigation to monitor the behaviors of other membrane lipids, leading to a new model: small amphipaths act as surfactants that perturb membrane lipid organization, leading first to an increase of free ergosterol at the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, ➁a</xref>).

Images of the equatorial plane were taken at the indicated timepoints on a Leica TCS SP5 gatedSTED CW microscope with a 63.0x1.40 oil immersion objective and LAS AF (Ver. 2.7.3.9723) software. The effects of LCBs were extremely variable under these conditions, thus D-DHS and PHS were instead added to 5 µM to shaking yeast cultures, cells were concentrated by brief centrifugation at the indicated timepoints, mounted onto glass slides, and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 800 microscope with a 63x1.40 oil immersion objective and Zen Blue (Ver. 2.6) software.

TB50A WT cells expressing mCherry-2xPH<sup>PLCδ</sup> from the HIS3 locus were grown logarithmically and set to OD<sub>600nm</sub> 0.6. The culture was split into subcultures of same volume, agitating at 30°C, and substances were added to 5 µM from prewarmed stocks. At indicated timepoints, culture aliquots were taken and mixed 1:2 with Paraformaldehyde 3% Glutaraldehyde 0.35% In 0.1M Sodium Cacodylate Buffer pH 7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Cells were fixed for 30-60 min at RT and diluted in low fluorescence media. C14-C invaginations could not be preserved in fixed cells. Images of the equatorial plane were taken on a Molecular Devices™ ImageXpress Micro HTai C® High-Content Imaging System equipped with a 60x 1.25 NA water immersion objective. Single cell and PM invagination segmentation and analysis was performed with custom module editor from MetaXpress software (Ver 6.7.0.211). Briefly, individual yeasts were segmented on a log filtered transmitted light image. The PM invaginations were segmented on the mCherry-2xPH image after top hat deconvolution. The area sum of PM invaginations was normalized to the cell area and averaged for each condition and timepoint. These average values where then normalized to the value determined in vehicle treated cells at the same timepoint for each experiment. Calculations were performed in Microsoft Excel, and data was plotted using GraphPad Prism (10.2.3).</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Live cell microscopy of Fluorescent Lipid Associated Reporters</title><p id="P40">WT or mutant yeast cells expressing FLAREs from genomic loci (mCherry-2xPH<sup>PLCδ</sup> + GFP-D4H) or from plasmids (all other combinations) were grown to mid log phase in low fluorescence media and imaged at room temperature on a Leica STELLARIS 8 FALCON FLIM Microscope with a 63x1.4 Oil immersion objective and LAS X (Ver. 4.6.1.27508) software. For vehicle, PalmC, Rapamycin and 1 M sorbitol treatment, cells were mounted onto Concanavalin A-coated VI 0.4 µ-Slides (Ibidi) primed with media. The channel was gently flushed with media once to obtain a single layer of cells. Several positions were selected proximal to the “+” channel opening, and equatorial plane images of the same positions/cells were taken at t0, and at 1 min intervals or at the indicated timepoints post treatment. For treatments, media supplemented with indicated substances were added to the “+” channel opening while the excess was absorbed with a paper tissue inserted into the “-“ channel end. To test the effects of C16-Glycerol, C16-Choline and PHS on yeGFP-D4H localization, 5 µM of these substances were instead added to mid log phase liquid cultures to avoid the previously observed substance absorption to the slide. Before the indicated timepoint, cells were concentrated by short centrifugation and mounted onto high precision glass coverslips for imaging. Images were processed using FIJI (ImageJ 1.54f). Before the generation of kymographs, timelapses of selected cells were stabilized using the Image Stabilizer plugin for ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Li, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>FLARE colocalization analysis</title><p id="P41">In flow chambers, we typically observed different and more variable small amphipath kinetics than in liquid culture.
