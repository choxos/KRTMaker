characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition within the lung. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have identified unique populations of epithelial cells lacking KRT5 while expressing KRT17; fibroblasts characterized by high collagen production, and the expression of CTHRC1; as well as a distinct subset of SPP1 positive macrophages. However, the precise interactions among these and potentially other cells that lead to the formation of fibrotic niche remain unclear.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P2">Using spatial transcriptomics and Hyperion imaging mass cytometry we compared the cellular populations in formalin fixed paraffin embedded fibrotic lesions (n=9 patients) with control lung (n=9), and using CellChat we investigated the cellular interactions.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results</title><p id="P3">Spatial transcriptomic analysis identified 180,067 cells which demonstrated three unique fibrotic niches enriched for KRT5-/KRT17+ epithelial cells, SPP1+ macrophages and collagen producing fibroblasts as well as a unique DCN+ expressing plasma B cell. Ligand receptor analysis inferred that most fibrotic cells interacted with ATII cells, with the exception of KRT5-/KRT17+ epithelial cells which interacted primarily with macrophages. Hyperion Mass Cytometry identified 55,979 cells, which identified similar cell populations clustered into two unique fibrotic niches a stromal fibrotic niche characteritied by CTHRC1+ fibroblasts interacting with fibrotic associated plasma cells, and a second niche containing KRT5-/KRT17+ cells and SPP1+ macrophages.

IPF is rare under the age of 40, and incidence rates are rising with an estimated 1-13 cases per 100,000 population globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. IPF is due to the accumulation of environmental risk factors such as environmental pollution and smoking in people with a genetic predisposition to fibrosis. Despite advances in our understanding of pathogenesis and improved treatment options, IPF remains a condition with high morbidity and mortality with median survival rates from 3 to 5 years afer diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have accelerated understanding of the diverse cellular populations contributing to IPF pathogenesis. A distinct population of Keratin 17 positive (KRT17+) but Keratin 5 negative (KRT5-) epithelial cells has been identified in fibrotic regions of the lung. These KRT17+ cells also express markers such as Vimentin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP7), tumour protein p63 (TP63), and SRY-box2 (SOX2), indicating their progenitor-like nature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Similarly, a unique population of collagen-producing fibroblasts characterized by increased production of type 1 collagen and the expression of collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (CTHRC1+)have been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Finally, macrophages that express Secreted Phosphoprotein 1 expressing macrophages (SPP1+)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and secrete osteopontin, which promotes extracellular matrix production and activates fibroblasts into myofibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, have been detected.</p><p id="P7">Whilst these cell populations have been identified, their precise location, cellular interactions and function within the fibrotic niche remains to be defined. Spatial multi-omics provide powerful tools for understanding cellular heterogeneity by combining high-dimensional molecular profiling with spatial context. Spatial transcriptomics permits gene expression mapping within intact tissue sections by revealing the spatial distribution of mRNA transcripts, helping to elucidate cellular interactions and microenvironmental influences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, high-multiplex tissue imaging enables the simultaneous imaging of multiple proteins at the single-cell level <italic>in situ,</italic> providing further detailed information about cellular phenotypes and states while preserving spatial information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Combining both technologies enables a deep molecular phenotyping of the cellular heterogeneity in IPF and how these cells interact to contribute to the fibrotic niche.</p><p id="P8">In this study, spatial transcriptomics was combined with Hyperion imaging mass cytometry to comprehensively assess the fibrotic niche within human lung tissue obtained from patients with IPF. We confirmed the presence of previously reported fibrotic-associated cellular components KRT17+/KRT5-epithelial cells; high collagen producing fibroblasts; and SPP1+ macrophages. Intriguingly, we also identified a novel population of fibrotic-associated transitional B lymphocytes within a decorin enriched fibrotic niche. Furthermore, <italic>in situ</italic> colocalisation analysis and cellular communication analysis revealed complex, pathway-dependent cell-cell interaction networks among these fibrotic cell populations which suggest that bronchial basal cells may contribute to the origin of fibrotic epithelium. These intricate networks identify the unique fibrotic niches within IPF lung.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Human tissue collection and tissue microarray construction</title><p id="P9">Human lung tissue blocks from IPF patients were sourced from the Nottingham NIHR Biomedical Research Centre under ethical approval (REC 08/H0407/1). Non-IPF tissues were freshly collected from Clinical Research Facility (CRF) Respiratory Biobank, Royal Brompton Hospital under the ethical approval (NRES 20/SC/0142). Lung tissue was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded prior to their use in constructing a tissue microarray (TMA) block. For the TMA construction, the core size was standardized to 1 mm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Slides preparation and Data acquisition</title><p id="P10">Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks were sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm. Sections were mounted on the label side of the VWR® SuperFrost® Plus slides which have been validated for compatibility with both CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager and Hyperion Helio CyTOF imaging system. To enhance tissue adherence, slides were baked at 37°C overnight after sectioning and were stored in a sealed box with desiccants at 4°C to maintain dryness and prevent degradation. All prepared slides were used within two weeks for optimal results.</p><p id="P11">For the CosMx Molecular Imager, overnight baking at 60°C was performed to promote optimal tissue adherence, followed by target retrieval at 100°C, protease digestion at 40°C. Post-fixation in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (NBF) and blocking with N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-Acetate were conducted to stabilitie tissue morphology and reduce non-specific binding. Overnight hybridization with the Human Universal Cell Characterization Panel (1000-plex RNA, NanoString, USA) at 37°C was performed prior to stringent washing and DAPI nuclear staining (NanoString), the application of PanCK/CD45 (NanoString), along with segmentation markers (CD298/B2M, NanoString), which delineate cellular boundaries for image analysis. Assembled flow cells were loaded into the CosMx SMI, followed by the addition of enzymes and Ribonuclease (RNase) Inhibitor to the imaging tray.</p><p id="P12">For Hyperion imaging mass cytometry, carrier-free antibody metal conjugation was performed using the MaxPar antibody labeling kit following the manufacture protocol (Standard BioTools, USA). All labelled antibodies were eluted in antibody stabilizer (Candor Bioscience, Germany) supplemented with 0.05% sodium azide. FFPE sections were baked for 2 hours at 60°C. Dewaxing was performed using fresh Histo-Clear (A2-0101, geneflow) for 20 minutes, followed by a hydration sequence through descending ethanol concentrations. The antigen retrieval was performed in Citrate Buffer (ab93678, abcam) at 96°C for 20-minutes. Following phosphate buffered saline (PBS) wash, tissue sections were blocked with 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in PBS for 60 minutes at room temperature. An antibody cocktail, prepared according to specific concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplement table1</xref>) was applied and sections were incubated overnight at 4°C. Following washing tissue sections were incubated with Intercalator-Ir in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Data processing and single cell Data Analysis</title><sec id="S10"><title>CosMx SMI data processing and analysis</title><p id="P13">Machine learning-driven single cell segmentation was performed using AtoMx Spatial Informatics Platform (SIP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. For data quality control (QC), cells with negative probe greater than 0.5 and or features less than 20 were filtered out. In total, 180,067 cells were profiled, and raw counts of all cells were exported as a Seurat object from AtoMx SIP for downstream analysis. SCTransform-based normalization was applied using default parameters in Seurat v5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Following normalization, principal component analysis (PCA) and the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm were performed for dimension reduction.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title><italic>In situ</italic> cell typing</title><p id="P14">The Insitutype algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> for semi-supervised cell typing of our CosMx dataset was used for cell type annotation. Briefly, Human cell atlas annotation (level3) was used as reference matrix to identify “anchor cells”, namely cells with confident reference cell type assignments. The mean profiles of these anchor cells were then used to refine our reference matrix, ensuring a more accurate representation of cell types in the CosMx context. To enrich the analysis further, cells were organised into “cohorts” based on immunofluorescence values of the morphology markers using fastCohortìng function within Insitutype package. Differential gene expression per cluster was analysed using the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat package. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis was performed to identify significant biological themes within the gene sets.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Inference of cell-cell communication using CellChat V2</title><p id="P15">CellChat V2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> was used to infer spatially proximal intercellular communication for CosMx datasets. Leveraging CellChatDB, a curated database with over 1000 interactions, interactions between control and IPF human lung tissues were compared. CellChat objects were created separately from the Seurat object. CellChat DB V2 was used as the ligand-receptor (L-R) interaction database. A total of 358 L-R pairs were extracted from the NanoString 1000-plex RNA probes panel and used for further analysis. Both control and IPF CellChat objects were then merged and compared for total interaction number and strength using the compareInteractìons() function. Interactions between cell populations were visualized in circle plots using the netVisual_diffInteractìon() function, with red or blue-coloured edges representing increased or decreased signalling between the control and IPF datasets, respectively. The cell-cell communication network of key fibrotic cell types was visualized separately.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Global cell-cell communication pattern analysis</title><p id="P16">To understand the global cooperation among various cell groups and signalling pathways, a pattern recognition approach was performed using CellChat. The selectK() function was utilised to determine the optimal number of patterns for downstream analysis.</p><p id="P17">This function uses the Cophenetìc and Silhouette metrics to assess pattern stability through hierarchical clustering of the consensus matrix.

Briefly, raw.mcd files were first converted into.ome.tiff files using the imctools Python package. A random forest-based image pixel classification was performed using ilastik. Pixels classified as “cytoplasm”, “nucleus”, and “background” were input for probability assessments and then thresholded using the CellProfiler pipeline to generate segmented cell masks. Features including the mean pixel intensity per cell and channel, cell morphological features, and locations were extracted using a customised CellProfiler pipeline for downstream analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Single-cell spatial analysis of IMC data</title><p id="P19">Image based single cell spatial analysis of the IMC data was performed using imcRtools and cytomapper R package. Briefly, SpatialExperiment object was created using imcRtools while multi-channel images and cell masks were loaded using cytomapper. Unsupervised cell clustering was performed using Rphenograph. Graph based clustering was used to generate shared nearest neighbour (SNN) graphs. Cell type classification was carried out based on predefined markers, with fibrotic epithelial cells as KRT17+/KRT5-, fibrotic fibroblasts as CTHRC1+, fibrotic macrophages as SPP1+, and fibrotic B cells as CD20+/DCN+. To identify fibrotic associated cellular niches, cellular neighbourhood analysis was performed to compute the 20-nearest neighbours and kmeans=5 for clustering cells into 5 cellular niches.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S18"><title>Single cell spatial transcriptomics analysis provides <italic>in situ</italic> cellular landscape in control and IPF human lung tissues</title><p id="P20">Tissue sections from nine IPF patients and nine controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 A &amp; B</xref>) were assessed, and 180,067 cells (141,070 IPF and 38,997 controls), averaging 100 transcripts per cell were analysed. 27 well-characterized human lung cell populations and four disease-enriched populations with posterior probabilities &gt;0.8 were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C &amp; D</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Overall, a reduction of alveolar cells with a concomitant increase level of basal epithelial cell populations was observed in IPF lung tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C &amp; D</xref>). Specifically, an IPF-enriched epithelial cell population (“c”) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1D</xref>), spatially lining the fibrotic regions was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) that was very rarely observed in non-diseased tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis revealed reduced expression of the basal marker KRT5 while maintaining high KRT17 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplement Figure1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure3C</xref>) consistent with previously described unique populations of fibrotic epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Elevated levels of transcripts including metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7), type I collagen (COL1A1), transgelin (TAGLN), a direct downstream target of TGFβ/SMAD3 signalling as well as other basal markers including keratìn8, 18 (KRT8, 18), were also observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplement Figure 1A</xref>). These cells exhibited minimal expression of alveolar type 2 (ATII) markers, including lysosomal-associated membrane protein 3 (LAMP3) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A, B</xref>), and rarely colocalitied with ATII cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>).

These cells exhibited transcriptional similarities to myofibroblasts with increased levels of collagens including COL1A1, COL3A1, COL5A1, and COL6A1-3, as well as fibronectin 1 (FN1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplement Figure 1C, D</xref>). Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses indicated a role in ECM organitiation, integrin binding, and collagen binding activities, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplement Figure 2B</xref>). Fibrotic macrophages (“d”) were located primarily in the lumen of the cystic lesions lined by fibrotic epithelium, rather than within the dense matrix associated with fibrotic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). These macrophages were transcriptionally related to alveolar macrophages with high expression levels of SPP1, cystatìn B (CSTB), and glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB), with gene ontology enrichment analysis emphasizing their involvement in ECM structural constituent interactions, integrin, and collagen binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplement figure4 A, B</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Interestingly a novel B cell population located deep within fibrotic regions was identified, adjacent to fibrotic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Beyond the classic B cell markers such as CD19 and CD22(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplement Figure5C, D</xref>), this population exhibited an elevated expression of decorin (DCN) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplement Figure 5E</xref>), encoding the extracellular matrix protein decorin, typically under-expressed in normal B cell populations.

Fibrotic fibroblasts showed limited autocrine interaction but substantial interaction links with fibrotic macrophages and ATII cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Fibrotic macrophages displayed enhanced autocrine interaction, while maintaining robust communications with ATII cells and alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Fibrotic B cells, predominantly located near the fibrotic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1E</xref>), revealed limited autocrine interaction but demonstrated strong interactions with alveolar macrophages, fibrotic macrophages, and alveolar type II (ATII) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Profiling key cellular interactions reveal distinct fibrotic niches</title><p id="P26">To further elucidate the intercellular communication networks involved in IPF, we utilized centrality measurements to examine how different cell populations coordinate signalling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. In control lung tissues, three distinct signalling patterns emerged. First, an immune-associated pattern (pattern 1) was inferred within the CosMx SMI dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), consisting mainly of B cells and dendritic cells in proximity to bronchial and vascular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, two epithelial patterns were observed a “bronchial” pattern (pattern 2), predominantly including basal, goblet, and ciliated bronchial epithelial cells, and an “alveolar” pattern (pattern 3), comprising alveolar type I (ATI) and type II (ATII) cells alongside stromal cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells) and immune cells (macrophages, alveolar macrophages) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure3A</xref>).</p><p id="P27">In IPF lung tissues, distinct fibrosis-associated niches were identified. A “fibrotic epithelial niche" (pattern 4) comprised KRT5-/KRT17+epithelial cells, basal cells, ATII cells, and plasma B cells, actively engaging in signalling pathways such as Growth Differentiation Factor (GDF) and Carcinoembryonic Antigen-related Cell Adhesion Molecule (CEACAM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, a “fibrotic immune niche" (pattern 5) was identified, primarily involving SPP1+ fibrotic macrophages and alveolar macrophages located within the fibrotic honeycomb cysts (Figures 1E), with key pathways including CCL, CXCL, and TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B</xref>). A third fibrosis-related niche, the “stromal fibrotic niche" (pattern 6), was dominated by fibrotic fibroblasts, fibrotic B cells, and myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), with primary pathways centred on Collagen, FGF, and Thrombospondins (THBS). Finally, two additional patterns, 7 and 8, devoid of fibrotic cells were observed, comprising predominantly vascular and immune cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Proteomics Analysis identify more restricted alveolar niches.</title><p id="P28">To determine whether the transcriptional profiles of the fibrotic niches could be identified by protein markers, Hyperion Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) was performed on parallel tissue sections, utilizing a customized panel to guide in situ cell typing. The single-cell segmentation of the Hyperion IMC dataset uncovered 55,979 cells from both IPF and control human lung tissues. Unsupervised clustering of the single-cell data revealed 15 distinct cell populations, including the four IPF-enriched cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). These included the epithelial population characterized by KRT5-/KRT17+ expression (cluster10), a fibroblast population expressing CTHRC1+ (cluster7), a macrophage population with elevated SPP1 expression(cluster5), and a CD20 positive B cell population in decorin (DCN) enriched regions(cluster3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure4A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplement Figure7A</xref>). Eighteen markers were shared between the CosMx SMI 1000-gene panel and the Hyperion IMC marker panel. A high percentage of cells expressed at least one of the shared markers in both datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplement Figure 6A, B</xref>), with enrichment mainly observed in fibrotic-associated cell populations when using the shared fibrotic markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplement Figure 6C, D</xref>). To further investigate the spatial interactions and identify tissue restricted niches, we performed cell neighbourhood analysis as previously described [20, 21]. Cell aggregation, based on cophenetìc and silhouette metrics, revealed five distinct patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplement Figure7B</xref>). In non-diseased lung these revealed an alveolar pattern predominantly consisting of SFTPC+ alveolar type II cells and AQP4+ alveolar type I cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B</xref>) was observed, with additional participation from immune cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7B</xref>). The bronchial pattern primarily included basal (KRT5+/KRT17+) and goblet (MUC5B+) epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). An additional stromal pattern was identified with αSMA+ cells as the major component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) consistent with the spatial transcriptomics results described above.</p><p id="P29">Fibrotic cell populations were spatially localised to similar regions as identified in the CosMx SMI dataset. Specifically, KRT5-/KRT17+ epithelial cells were found lining the fibrotic regions and were located close to KRT5+/KRT17+ basal cells in the bronchial niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A &amp; H</xref>). In control tissue sections, KRT5+/KRT17+ basal cells were only located in the airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly, these KRT17+ cells are also found adjacent to aquaporin-4 (AQP4) positive ATI cells, while notably lacking surfactant protein C (SFTPC) expression throughout regions of the fibrotic lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). SPP1+ macrophages were also positioned near these fibrotic epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Meanwhile, CTHRC1+ fibroblasts were primarily located within the fibrotic stromal niche, exhibiting high levels of collagen I expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). CD20+ B cells were also present within these collagen-rich fibrotic regions, in proximity to CTHRC1+ fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). These cells formed two fibrotic patterns Fibrotic niche 1 predominantly featured SPP1+ macrophages, KRT5-/KRT17+ epithelial cells, and basal epithelial cells while Fibrotic niche 2 was characterised by fibrotic fibroblasts (CTHRC1+/COL1+) along with fibrotic B cells, with a notable absence of KRT5-/KRT17+ epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplement Figure 7B</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">This study used bi-level spatial multì-omics to elucidate the complex cellular environment within IPF lung tissue. Leveraging CosMx Spatial Molecular Imaging and Hyperion Imaging Mass Cytometry, we have comprehensively mapped the spatial distribution and interactions of key cellular constituents implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF to precisely define the fibrotic niche. Three distinct fibrotic niches were identified in the CosMx dataset a fibrotic epithelial niche characterised by KRT5-/KRT17+ epithelial cells alongside alveolar cells, a fibrotic immune niche dominated by SPP1+ macrophages, and a fibrotic stromal niche marked by high-collagen-producing fibroblasts and a B cell population. Hyperion IMC analysis confirmed the presence of the same stromal niche, as well as a combined fibrotic epithelial and immune niche, indicating a dynamic interaction among these cell populations in pulmonary fibrosis.</p><p id="P31">These niches emphasize the cooperative roles of different cell types in driving fibrotic progression. The immune fibrotic niche highlights the central role of SPP1+ macrophages in fibrotic remodelling. SPP1+ macrophages have been shown as a key driver of tissue remodelling and collagen deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. These macrophages secrete pro-fibrotic cytokines and growth factors that drive fibrosis progression by recruiting myofibroblasts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Our analysis identified a unique B cell population, similar to plasma cells, expressing immunoglobulin genes, CD74, HLA-DRB, DCN and present within decorin-rich region, indicative of an adaptive role in fibrotic environments. The presence of increased DCN mRNA in B cells found with regions of decorin rich matrix suggests the B cells may be responsible for depositing the decorin, although given the close anatomical association to fibrotic fibroblasts we cannot exclude the possibility that fibroblast are secreting the decorin. B cells have been noted for their roles in fibrosis, capable of contributing to this process by amplifying inflammatory responses and engaging in cell-cell interactions that stimulate ECM production <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Interestingly interaction analysis revealed that these plasma-like cells primarily interact with fibrotic CTHRC1+ cells and ATII cells. Given the known role of plasma cells generating antibodies and HSPA1A/B in suppressing autoimmunity along with the known loss of ATII cells it is tempting to speculate that these fibrotic plasma cells may be responsible for the ATII cell loss observed in IPF. Moreover, therapeutic modulation of B cell activity suggests a promising avenue for managing fibrosis by altering the B cell-mediated pro-fibrotic environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P32">In contrast, the mesenchymal fibrotic niche predominantly consisted of high-collagen producing CHTRC1+fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, with some involvement of fibrotic immune cell populations in the same regions supporting previously identified fibrotic fibroblast profiles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. These fibroblasts are transcriptionally involved mainly in collagen-related pathways indicating their significant role in matrix remodelling and fibrosis progression. Notably, they engage in dynamic interactions with fibrotic plasma cells within the mesenchymal niche. Previous research has demonstrated that activated B cells from IPF patients contribute to fibrosis by releasing inflammatory cytokines, which in turn induce fibroblast migration and amplify collagen production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Collectively, these findings suggest a reciprocal communication between fibroblasts and immune cells, potentially creating a feedback loop that further drives the fibrotic process.</p><p id="P33">Several single-cell RNA sequencing studies have identified a fibrotic epithelial population characterised by high expression of KRT17 and p63 and absent KRT5 expression. These data confirm the presence of this KRT5-/KRT17+ fibrotic epithelial population, which lines the fibrotic epithelial niches supporting prior studies. However, the origin of these cells remains inconclusive. A previous study has demonstrated that airway basal cells, through dedifferentiation, may contribute to the development of this KRT17+ fibrotic epithelial population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. However, trajectory analysis from murine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and human <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> studies have suggested that they may be transitional cells derived from ATII cells that are ‘stuck’ in this state unable to become ATI cells. In this study, KRT17+ cells were found to lack SFTPC expression, and spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed minimal spatial association between LAMP3 and KRT17. Intriguingly, these KRT5-/KRT17+ cells were spatially interspersed between AQ4+ ATI cells and KRT5+/KRT17+ basal cells, which were also highly enriched in IPF lung tissues. KRT5<sup>+</sup> basal cells have been previously identified as self-renewing stem cells capable of differentiating into various airway epithelial cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. This observation suggests that KRT5+/KRT17+ progenitor basal cells may also serve as a source for the KRT17+ fibrotic epithelium, supporting the hypothesis that small airways could play a central role in the pathogenesis of IPF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, we propose the hypothesis that basal cells transmigrate to generate fibrotic epithelium to compensate for the loss of ATII cells that can no longer transdifferentiate to ATI cells following injury.</p><p id="P34">The centrality analysis identified that the fibrotic epithelial niche was closely associated with plasma cells and the CEACAM signalling pathway. Dysregulatìon of CEACAM signalling has previously been documented in modulating immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> and promoting tumour invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and CEA has been identified as a biomarker associated with IPF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. The CEACAM pathway’s ability to regulate cell adhesion, invasion and immune cell recruitment support the hypothesis that basal cells migrate to promote fibrosis and could be a potential therapeutic target to exploit, promoting the ATI transition and epithelial repair in IPF.</p><p id="P35">CosMx SMI offers high-resolution, single-cell spatial transcriptomic analysis focused on targeted gene panels, making it particularly suited for studies requiring detailed cellular insights. Recent studies using the Visium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> or GeoMx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> platform provides broader whole-transcriptome coverage at a coarser resolution. Xenium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> platforms, which, despite covering fewer genes than CosMx, have also identified similar disease-enriched fibrotic cell populations. These include KRT5-/KRT17+ fibrotic epithelial cells, SPP1+ macrophages, and CTHRC1+ fibroblasts. Consistent with our findings, a fibrotic niche marked by interactions between KRT5-/KRT17+ epithelial cells and SPP1+ macrophages has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. However, unlike the fibrotic stromal niche in our study which is characterized by a dynamic interplay between CTHRC1+ fibroblasts and fibrotic B cells, previous studies placed these fibrotic fibroblasts within the same niche as fibrotic epithelial cells and macrophages, with a separate lymphocyte-enriched niche bordered by vascular endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. These observed differences are likely due to the limited sample size, which may not fully capture the highly heterogeneous nature of IPF pathogenesis. This limitation underscores the complexity of in situ cell interactions within fibrotic regions.</p><p id="P36">In conclusion, this study identified three distinct fibrotic niches epithelial; immune; and stromal, each potentially contributing uniquely to fibrosis pathogenesis. By integrating CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager and Hyperion Imaging Mass Cytometry, we confirmed the spatial locations of SPP1+ macrophages, fibrotic B cells, and high-collagen-producing fibroblasts, highlighting their cooperative interactions in IPF progression. Furthermore, the enrichment of normal basal cell and abnormal fibrotic epithelial, including KRT5-/KRT17+, populations in IPF located in between normal basal epithelial and ATI cells, support the hypothesis that the basal cell could be a major source of fibrotic epithelium. Finally, the identification of plasma cells, potentially a7empting to suppress auto-immunity while interacting with ATII cells, may imply a role for B cells in promoting ATII cell loss in IPF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS202031-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d47aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors acknowledge the Noffingham Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) for their facilitation of sample transfer.
