Among eukaryotes, BGCs are most common in plants and fungi, where they ensure the co-expression of the different enzymes coordinating the biosynthesis of specialised metabolites. Here, we report on a newly identified withanolide BGC in <italic>Physalis grisea</italic> (ground-cherry), a member of the nightshade family (<italic>Solanaceae</italic>). A combination of transcriptomic, epigenomic and metabolic analyses, revealed that, following a duplication event, this BGC evolved two tissue-specifically expressed sub-clusters, containing eight pairs of paralogs that contribute to related but distinct biochemical processes; this sub-functionalisation is tightly associated with epigenetic features and the local chromatin environment. The two sub-clusters appear strictly isolated from each other at the chromatin structural level, each forming a highly self-interacting chromatin domain with tissue-dependent levels of condensation. This correlates with gene expression exclusively in either above- or below-ground tissue, thus spatially separating the production of different withanolide compounds. By comparative phylogenomic analysis, we show that the withanolide BGC most likely evolved before the diversification of the <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family and underwent lineage-specific diversifications and losses. The tissue-specific sub-functionalisation is common to species of the <italic>Physalideae</italic> tribe but distinct from other, independent duplication events outside of this clade. In sum, our study reports on the first instance of an epigenetically modulated sub-functionalisation within a BGC and sheds light on the biosynthesis of withanolides, a highly diverse group of steroidal triterpenoids important in plant defence and amenable to pharmaceutical applications due to their anti-inflammatory, antibiotic and anti-cancer properties.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Plants produce a plethora of specialised metabolites that typically serve as protectants, repellents, attractants, or signalling molecules in ecological interactions. Some have growth-stimulating or -inhibitory properties. Among the 200,000 to one million different compounds that plants are estimated to produce, triterpenoids are one of the largest and most diversified groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cárdenas et al. 2019</xref>). Withanolides, in turn, are highly diverse steroidal triterpenoids that are prominent in <italic>Solanaceae</italic> but have also been detected in some species outside the nightshade family (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Yang et al. (2011)</xref>). The name-giving plant species, <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> (commonly referred to by its Sanskrit name “ashwagandha”), has been used as a medicinal plant in traditional Indian medicine for several thousand years; modern pharmaceutical research is investigating several withanolides for their anti-inflammatory properties and their potential use in treatments of cancer and autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Huang et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Zhang et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cigler et al. 2024</xref>). Besides in <italic>Withania</italic>, withanolide analogues occur in many but not all <italic>Solanaceae</italic>; they are present in different <italic>Physalis</italic> and <italic>Petunia</italic> species but are notably absent in the majority of <italic>Solanum</italic> species such as tomato and potato. Currently, more than 600 compounds belonging to this class are known, differing in the configuration of their side chains and the positioning of double bonds in their structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dhar et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Xia et al. 2022</xref>). This diversity makes withanolides, which act as herbivore repellents and antibiotics in the plant, a promising source for novel pharmaceutical agents.</p><p id="P3">The biosynthesis of withanolides branches off the phytosterol pathway. The first dedicated step towards withanolides is mediated by a sterol Δ<sup>24</sup>-isomerase (24ISO) that catalyses the isomerization from 24-methylenecholesterol to 24-methyldesmosterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Knoch et al. 2018</xref>). 24ISO is a homolog of DWARF1 (DWF1), with two paralogs, SSR1 and SSR2 (for Sterol Side-chain Reductase), in <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> (tomato) and <italic>S. tuberosum</italic> (potato). SSR1 catalyses the synthesis of campesterol from 24-methylenecholesterol, an intermediate in brassinolide biosynthesis, while SSR2 plays a role in the production of cholesterol and hence steroidal glycoalkaloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Sawai et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Akiyama et al. 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P4">While 24ISO is the starting point of the withanolide biosynthesis pathway, several enzymatic steps, particularly those typically involving cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs), have been hypothesised as being necessary to complete the biosynthesis from 24-methyldesmosterol to the withanolides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Knoch et al. 2018</xref>). Potential gene clusters containing genes encoding CYP450s and 2ODDs and located in the same genomic region as <italic>24ISO</italic> were identified in related solanaceous plants, suggesting a larger withanolide biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Knoch et al. 2018</xref>). Several BGCs of plant specialised metabolites have been identified in recent years, e.g. encoding the biosynthesis of diterpenes in rice and barley, or benzoxazinoids in maize and other grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Polturak and Osbourn 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Polturak et al. 2022</xref>). A BGC encoding withanolide production, although hypothesised in the past, has not been identified to date.</p><p id="P5">Here, we present the discovery of a withanolide BGC in the <italic>Solanaceae</italic> species <italic>Physalis grisea</italic>, a close relative of <italic>W. somnifera</italic>. Our data show that the genes in the cluster play an essential role in the synthesis of withanolides. The cluster architecture revealed a tandem duplication, resulting in a sub-functionalization into two distinct sub-clusters, each containing a set of core genes required for withanolide biosynthesis. Through the combined analysis of transcriptomic, epigenomic and metabolic datasets, we show that sub-cluster expression and withanolide formation are tissue-specific, and that sub-cluster differentiation is associated with tissue-specific epigenetic configuration and higher-order chromatin organisation. Through phylogenomic analysis, we show that this sub-functionalisation is not specific to <italic>P. grisea</italic> but is common to the <italic>Physalideae</italic> tribe. In sum, our study uncovers how biosynthesis of plant specialised metabolites can diversify via duplication and differential organisation of the chromatin environment.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The putative withanolide biosynthetic gene cluster in P. grisea underwent tandem duplication</title><p id="P6">At the time Knoch <italic>et al</italic>. identified 24ISO as the enzyme catalysing the first dedicated biosynthesis step in withanolide production, only a few <italic>Solanaceae</italic> genomes had been assembled and annotated. Nonetheless, the authors had already noticed that the gene encoding the 24ISO ortholog in <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic>, <italic>Solanum melongena</italic> (in which it appeared pseudogenic) and <italic>Petunia inflata</italic> was flanked by genes encoding CYP450s (CYP88 subfamily, among others) and 2-oxoglutarate dependent (2-ODDs) dioxygenases that might be involved in the metabolization of the withanolide-intermediate 24-methyldesmosterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Knoch et al. 2018</xref>). We set out to study the possibility that withanolide biosynthesis was organised in a BGC. In absence of a <italic>W. somnifera</italic> genome assembly, we referred to the most closely related available assembly and gene annotation, that of <italic>P. grisea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">He et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Huang et al. 2023</xref>).

Its members produce withanolide analogs, known as physalins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Huang et al. 2020</xref>). Given this close phylogenetic and biochemical relationship between the genera <italic>Physalis</italic> and <italic>Withania</italic>, we hypothesised that the <italic>P. grisea</italic> genome could harbour orthologs of <italic>Ws24ISO</italic> and could serve as a proxy to study putative BGCs, particularly since <italic>P. grisea</italic> is currently being established as a new genetic model in the <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Van Eck 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dale et al. 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Using the <italic>W. somnifera</italic> 24ISO amino acid sequence as a query for BLAST, we identified two <italic>24ISO</italic> copies in the <italic>P. grisea</italic> genome, localised at the end of chromosome 1 and separated by ~350 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Closer inspection of this genomic region revealed aggregation of several genes encoding enzymes putatively involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In line with the observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Knoch et al. (2018)</xref> in <italic>C. annuum</italic>, <italic>S. melongena</italic> and <italic>P. inflata</italic>, we found nine genes that encoded CYP450s belonging to different families and subfamilies (<italic>CYP87G1</italic>, <italic>CYP749B2</italic>, <italic>CYP88C8</italic>, <italic>CYP88C7</italic> and <italic>CYP88C10</italic>), and six <italic>2-ODD</italic> genes surrounding the <italic>24ISO</italic> orthologs, suggesting the existence of a putative withanolide BGC in <italic>P. grisea</italic>. Additionally, we also identified two genes (one of them appearing pseudogenic) encoding Short-Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductases (SDRs), two for <italic>S</italic>ulfotransferases (Sulf), and one encoding an acylsugar acyltransferase (ASAT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We noticed that eight genes appeared to be duplicated within a 376 kb region, such that overall, the locus exhibited signals of a tandem duplication that had resulted in two groups of genes. Remarkably, each group encoded core paralogs of a putative withanolide biosynthetic pathway (24ISOa and b, respectively, CYP87G1a/b, CYP749B2a/b, CYP88C7a/b, CYP88C10a/b, 2ODD3a/b, Sulfa/b, and SDRa/b), and was separated from the other group by an intermediate gene-depleted region of approximately 50 kb in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Sequence analysis of the respective gene and protein copies corroborated the notion that these gene pairs were paralogs that most likely had arisen from a duplication, with pairwise nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities ranging between 84.4-94.6% and 80-95%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">In sum, our data showed that <italic>P. grisea</italic> has two <italic>24ISO</italic> paralogs that are embedded in a putative withanolide BGC and which appeared to have undergone a partial tandem duplication. This raised the questions whether this cluster architecture was specific to <italic>P. grisea</italic> or widespread in the <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family, and whether the tandem duplication had any functional consequences.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Withanolide production is organised by two differentially regulated sub-clusters</title><p id="P9">A key feature of BGCs is the co-regulation of expression of the genes that form the cluster, which is thought to ensure the faithful spatio-temporal production of a given metabolite, also in response to different elicitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Nützmann and Osbourn 2015</xref>). To test whether the members of the putative withanolide BGC were co-regulated, we performed whole-genome transcriptomic analysis via mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) across two sets of samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Dataset 1</xref>). The first consisted of nine different tissues and developmental stages: shoot and root tissue of two-week-old seedlings; young leaf, mature leaf, flower, stem, petiole, calyx, and fruit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). For the second set, we extracted RNA from roots and shoots of two-week-old seedlings treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), which is known to trigger withanolide production in <italic>W. somnifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Rana et al. 2014</xref>). We further included treatments with the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA), which induces expression of the withanolide analogue transport protein PDR2 in <italic>Petunia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Sasse et al. 2016</xref>), and the bacterial elicitor flagellin 22 (Flg22) to explore their respective impact on the gene cluster expression.</p><p id="P10">We combined the data from both RNA-seq experiments in a co-expression analysis using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Zhang and Horvath 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Langfelder and Horvath 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Russo et al. 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Instead of the expected co-regulation of all the genes in the putative BGC, the two groups of paralogs showed distinct and contrasting tissue-specific expression: the first 14 collinear genes, containing the first set of core paralogs in the BGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), were exclusively expressed in root (expression module M2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, the second set of eight paralogs were all placed in module M1, which grouped genes with high expression in shoot and aerial tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>). Based on these expression profiles, we named these sub-clusters ‘root-expressed sub-cluster’ (RESC) and ‘shoot-expressed sub-cluster’ (SESC), respectively.</p><p id="P11">In the treatment data, the expression of each sub-cluster was elicited by MeJA. Genes from the SESC responded in both shoot and root tissue, while the RESC genes responded exclusively in root tissue, indicating that the expression of the RESC is tightly repressed in shoot tissue. In contrast, ABA repressed the expression of both the RESC and the SESC in roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2F</xref>); neither sub-cluster responded to flg22. Our data indicate that the tandem duplication resulted in contrasting expression patterns of the two sub-clusters, which seem to be regulated tissue-specifically not only in their respective constitutive expression but also in their response to external stimuli.</p><p id="P12">Duplication of enzymes in specialised metabolism often leads to neofunctionalization and, in turn, the production of novel metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Smit and Lichman 2022</xref>). We hypothesised that the sub-division and tissue-specific regulation of expression could indicate the sub-functionalization of the putative withanolide BGC and result in qualitative differences in withanolide production in the respective tissues. To test this hypothesis, we performed untargeted metabolomics on the tissue samples used for the RNA-seq. After several filtering steps to select features potentially derived from withanolides in the MS/MS spectrum, we compiled a list of withanolide-associated features (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Material and Methods</xref> for details). We observed a distinct pattern of tissue-specific accumulation of different withanolide-related features in roots and diverse aerial tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). To further confirm the role of the BGC in withanolide biosynthesis, we employed virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). Since VIGS can only be applied in leaves but not in roots, we targeted genes from the SESC. The silencing of <italic>24ISOa</italic>, <italic>CYP87G1a</italic> and <italic>Sulfa</italic> led to an overall decrease in the abundance of leaf-specific withanolide features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). Silencing of <italic>CYP88C7a</italic> had similar effects, but we also noted higher levels for some features, which potentially reflects an accumulation of certain intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Lastly, silencing of <italic>CYP749B2a</italic>, <italic>CYP88C8a</italic> and <italic>CYP88C10a</italic> led to the reduction of few withanolide features and the general accumulation of other, potentially intermediate, products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Taken together, these results provide support for the existence of two functionally distinct sub-clusters that produce a distinct array of withanolides in a tissue-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The withanolide sub-clusters are functionally isolated from each other and display distinct levels of tissue-specific chromatin compaction</title><p id="P14">The presumed tandem duplication resulted in two neighbouring gene clusters with highly distinct expression profiles, raising the question how such a functional division could be organised and maintained at the regulatory level. Given the size of the sub-clusters and the number of genes (14 and 8, respectively) that were coordinately expressed, we hypothesised that canonical transcription-factor-mediated regulation might insufficiently explain the observed pattern. Several recent studies have highlighted that local chromatin accessibility and higher-order organisation at the three-dimensional (3D) level can play an important role in the coordinated regulation of gene expression of BGCs in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Nützmann et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Yang et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Li et al. 2023</xref>). BGCs are located within topologically associated domains (TADs), self-interacting chromatin regions with suppressed interaction with neighbouring chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Doğan and Liu 2018</xref>), or within regions with TAD-like features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Nützmann et al. 2020</xref>). This topological organisation facilitates precise spatio-temporal co-expression of the genes within the cluster, enabling long-range interactions between genes and between genes and their <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Zhao et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Li et al. 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To test whether the distinct expression patterns of the RESC and SESC are regulated at the chromatin level, we first performed Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) of <italic>P. grisea</italic> root and leaf tissue, in four biological replicates per tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figures 4-6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Dataset 2</xref>). Our data clearly showed that local chromatin accessibility in the RESC was high in root tissue, but that the chromatin in the same sub-cluster was inaccessible in leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). We observed the opposite for the SESC: while the ATAC-seq showed many open chromatin regions in leaf tissue, the same region was less accessible in roots. Together, these results corroborated our hypothesis that the chromatin landscape differed between tissues; in general, each sub-cluster was more accessible in the tissue in which it was expressed. Additionally, we observed that most of the peaks in both tissues and sub-clusters were located in intergenic regions, suggesting a role of distal <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and long-range chromatin contacts to the tissue-specific regulation of each sub-cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To gain further insights into the chromatin configuration at this genomic locus, we captured whole-genome chromatin-chromatin interactions in <italic>P. grisea</italic> roots and leaves using Hi-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Dataset 3</xref>). We hypothesised that each subcluster would exhibit distinct patterns of chromatin interactions in a tissue-specific manner. We obtained a total of ~103 million valid unique read pairs, combining data from two independent biological replicates for each tissue (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Material and Methods</xref> for details; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 7A</xref>). We first examined the genome packaging of <italic>P. grisea</italic> at the chromosomal level with a Hi-C contact map at 1 Mb resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The Hi-C map revealed prominent interactions along the main diagonal, attributed to the increased likelihood of interactions among neighbouring linear genome segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 7B</xref>). We also detected intense intra- and interchromosomal interactions at the chromosomal ends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 7B</xref>), where gene density is highest in the <italic>P. grisea</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 7C</xref>). In an A/B compartment annotation of each chromosome, which generally classifies open, euchromatic vs. more compacted, heterochromatic regions, those gene-rich regions at the distal chromosome ends were distinct from the large central region, where transposon density is highest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 7C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">He et al. 2023</xref>). Consequently, we annotated the distal ends as A (accessible) and the central part as B (inaccessible) compartments. This chromosomal organisation was highly similar to that observed in tomato (<italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dong et al. 2017</xref>). We next explored the withanolide BGC locus, located at the end of chromosome 1 (114.71-115.12 Mb), by generating normalised Hi-C maps at 20 kb resolution. In both root and shoot tissue, chromatin interactions between the RESC and SESC were rare, indicating that both subclusters were isolated from each other at the chromatin level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Such a spatial separation may contribute to the regulation of tissue-specific expression, allowing each sub-cluster to interact with specific cis-elements. In contrast, the RESC and, to a lesser extent, the SESC exhibited frequent intra-sub-cluster chromatin interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We further noticed that the RESC exhibited more frequent interactions with itself in the shoot compared to the root; a weaker, opposite trend applied to the SESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This became more obvious when considering the differential chromatin interactions between tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We noticed that the entire withanolide BGC locus displayed very few interactions with the neighbouring euchromatic region, visible as a banded area in the Hi-C map, which was more pronounced in the shoot than the root (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 7D,E</xref>). This led us to hypothesise that the local chromatin state of the whole BGC might differ from that of the neighbouring regions. Global euchromatic regions (A compartments) and heterochromatic regions (B compartments) can be further classified into local A/B compartments, i.e, local regions within the A or B compartments that can be either euchromatic or heterochromatic at a smaller scale and that correlate with activating or inactivating epigenetic marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Dong et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, we annotated local A/B compartments within the euchromatic region containing the cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). In leaf tissue, the BGC clearly stood out from the neighbouring chromatin, suggesting that it preferentially interacted with heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). This was less prominent in root tissue, where the cluster seemed to interact with the downstream euchromatic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Collectively, the ATAC-seq and Hi-C results suggested that the local 3D organisation of the chromatin contributes to the regulation of the tissue-specific expression of each subcluster.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The tissue-specific gene expression of each subcluster is associated with higher levels of asymmetric DNA methylation</title><p id="P19">Local epigenomic configurations are emerging as a key regulator of plant specialised metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Conneely et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Méteignier et al. 2022</xref>). The tissue-specific chromatin organisation at the withanolide BGC locus, revealed by our ATAC-seq and Hi-C data, led us to hypothesise that distinct epigenetic states might be contributing to the regulation of the bipartite sub-cluster-architecture of the withanolide BGC. Cytosine methylation at the 5th carbon (5mC, or often more generally referred to as DNA methylation) is an important epigenetic mark involved not only in gene expression regulation and the silencing of transposable elements but also in modulating chromatin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Zhang et al. 2018</xref>). Moreover, recent studies showed that the expression of biosynthesis genes in several specialised metabolism pathways are negatively correlated with DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Li et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">de Bernonville et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kim et al. 2020</xref>). We therefore hypothesised that the withanolide BGC sub-cluster architecture might be associated with distinct DNA methylation patterns. We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of shoot and root tissue of 2-week-old seedlings, from the exact same biological samples as for the RNA-seq and untargeted metabolomic analyses. We sequenced three biological replicates per tissue, with a mean sequencing depth of 23-40X and bisulfite conversion rates &gt;99.3% in every sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Dataset 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figures 8 and 9</xref>). We called differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between shoot and root samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hüther et al. 2022</xref>). In a principal component analysis (PCA) of mean methylation rates in context-specific DMRs, samples clustered by tissue in all three contexts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 8A</xref>). In total, we identified 322 CG-, 183 CHG- and 9,522 CHH-context-specific DMRs. The withanolide BGC region contained 0 CG-, 1 CHG-, and 20 CHH-DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Contrary to our expectation, in each sub-cluster hypermethylated CHH-DMRs correlated with the active/expressed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Of the 20 CHH-DMRs in the withanolide BGC, 4 and 2 were located in the putative promoters (2 kb upstream) of RESC and SESC genes, respectively. Another CHH-DMR was located in the intron of the RESC gene <italic>CYP87G1;</italic> contrary to the trend, this gene was hyper-methylated in shoot tissue.

While we did not observe a noticeable pattern for CHG methylation, CG methylation followed the opposite, albeit less pronounced trend than CHH methylation: in the RESC, CG methylation was negatively correlated with expression in the respective tissue. In sum, our data showed a marked shift in tissue-specific DNA methylation occurring along the genomic region that separates the two sub-clusters.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The withanolide BGC in Solanaceae underwent lineage-specific gene duplications</title><p id="P21">Withanolides are widespread across <italic>Solanaceae</italic> (Misico et al., 2011).

BGCs have also been proposed to facilitate the formation of metabolons, i.e., temporary complexes composed of the sequential enzymes of a biosynthetic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Nützmann and Osbourn 2015</xref>).

VIGS-mediated suppression confirmed the contribution of several genes to withanolide production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

This is noteworthy, since it has been postulated that the biosynthesis of steroidal glycoalkaloids (prominent in tomato and potato and presumably in many related species) and that of withanolides, which branch off the same precursors, usually do not co-occur in the same species. Few exceptions to this have been reported to date, including <italic>D. stramonium</italic>, which produces both steroidal glycoalkaloids and diverse withanolides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Pan et al. 2024</xref>), and in which we identified an orthologous withanolide BGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

In particular, the proximal set of 14 genes (the RESC) showed a strictly root-specific expression that was also maintained upon stimulating elicitors such as MeJA. The expression of the eight distal genes (the SESC) was most prominent in the aerial tissues, albeit less tightly restricted than the RESC. In line with this finding, we detected tissue-specific accumulation of different withanolide compounds. This suggests that the expression of the respective paralogs in either root or shoot might lead to the production of slightly different withanolide compounds and raises the question about the physiological and ecological function of this compartmentalisation. Since withanolides play a role in organismic interactions and act as antibiotics as well as in the repelling of herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Huang et al. 2020</xref>), one can speculate that root-specific and shoot-specific withanolides could play respective roles in the defence against niche-specific microbes, nematodes, or insects.

Such tissue-specific local chromatin accessibility allows TFs and other DNA-binding proteins to bind and to specifically activate gene expression. The next step in elucidating withanolide BGC expression will therefore be to identify the respective TFs and their binding sites. Our motif search of accessible regions returned bHLH and MYB TF binding motifs in root, and C2H2 zinc-finger binding motifs in shoot tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), which will serve as an anchor for the future search of regulating TFs. An alternative approach is to search for TFs that are co-expressed along with either the RESC or SESC. Using our RNA-seq data across tissues and treatments, we identified, among others, two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs in the corresponding expression modules. Members of this TF family are generally known to regulate specialised pathways through jasmonate (JA) signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Goossens et al. 2017</xref>). <italic>Phygri08g015540</italic> was co-expressed with the SESC in module M1.

Recent studies have shown that plant BGCs can be organised in TADs or TAD-like structures, i.e., in regions with extensive 3D chromatin-chromatin interactions, and that the configuration of the TAD influences the (co-)expression of the genes located within the BGC. For example, in leaves of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, the thalianol cluster is contained in a condensed B compartment and transcriptionally inactive, while in roots it is located in a relaxed-chromatin A compartment and transcriptionally active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Liu et al. 2020</xref>).

The withanolide BGC described in our study exemplifies how a duplication of parts of a BGC can result in the formation of two tandemly arranged sub-clusters that end up being isolated from each other at the chromatin level: the two sub-clusters are arranged in two separate TAD-like domains. Their condensation levels differed between tissues and negatively correlated with expression; especially the RESC showed more intense interactions in leaves than in roots. Since the RESC was not expressed in the shoot (and <italic>vice versa</italic> the SESC was only lowly expressed in roots), the Hi-C, along with the ATAC-seq data, suggest that both sub-clusters adopt a more compacted conformation in the tissue in which their expression is suppressed. Such a compaction likely restricts the accessibility for TFs and the primary transcriptional machinery.
