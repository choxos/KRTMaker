There are no vaccines available for protection and only one drug approved for treatment that has limited eKicacy. A major barrier to developing new therapeutics is a lack of foundational knowledge of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> biology, including which parasite genes are essential for survival and virulence. Here, we iteratively improve the tools for genetically manipulating <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> and develop a targeted CRISPR-based screening method to rapidly assess how the loss of individual parasite genes influence survival <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using this method we examine the parasite’s pyrimidine salvage pathway and a set of leading <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> vaccine candidates. From this latter group we determined the parasite gene known as Cp23 to be essential for survival, which was confirmed through inducible knockout <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Parasites deficient in Cp23 were able to replicate within and emerge from infected epithelial cells, yet unable to initiate gliding motility which is essential for the reinfection of neighbouring cells. The targeted screening method presented here is highly versatile and will enable researchers to more rapidly expand the knowledge base for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infection biology, paving the way for new therapeutics.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Diarrhoeal related infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Troeger et al., 2017</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Troeger et al., 2018</xref>). Cryptosporidiosis is consistently found to be one of the leading causes of a moderate-to-severe diarrhoeal disease in infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">KotloK et al., 2013</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">KotloK et al., 2019</xref>). Unlike other diarrheal diseases that are attributed with high incidence rates, such as rotavirus or <italic>Shigella</italic>, there are no eKective drugs or vaccines for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>. Nitazoxanide, the only Food and Drug Administration approved drug for treatment, is not eKective in immunocompromised individuals, only partially eKective in adults, and not approved for use in children, the patient population that needs intervention the most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abubakar et al., 2007</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Amadi et al., 2009</xref>). One reason for this scarcity of therapeutics is a historic lack of eKective systems to study the parasite. While there have been recent improvements in genetic manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Vinayak et al., 2015</xref>), drug target identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Caldwell et al., 2024</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Manjunatha et al., 2024</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ajiboye et al., 2024</xref>), and animal models of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Sateriale et al., 2019</xref>), our comprehension of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> biology remains very basic. Specifically, there is a limited understanding of the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> genes that contribute to parasite fitness and survival, genes that would be the most suitable targets for therapeutic intervention.</p><p id="P3">Reverse genetic approaches have been instrumental in identifying parasite genes that influence survival and convey fitness in other Apicomplexan parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Young et al., 2019</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bushell et al., 2017</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Butterworth et al., 2023</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, which has historically served as a facile model for Apicomplexa, has benefited from a high transfection eKiciency coupled with non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to be at the forefront of Apicomplexa CRISPR screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). Like <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite lacks NHEJ pathways, so CRISPR-Cas9 driven double stranded breaks can only be fixed by homologous repair. This lack of NHEJ can be leveraged to implement precise CRISPR screening, yet to date, no such screening method exists in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>. Here, we overcome the current technical barriers for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> genetic manipulation to develop a reproducible method for pooled <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR screens.</p><p id="P4"><italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> has a highly streamline genome and lacks many basic metabolic pathways. Because of this, it is thought to be heavily reliant on its host cell for nutrients. This is particularly evident in the nucleotide salvage pathway, where <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is believed to be capable of scavenging both nucleotides and nucleotide precursors from the host enterocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Pawlowic et al., 2019</xref>). Despite a compact genome, both purine and pyrimidine salvage pathways show evidence of redundancy. The purine salvage pathway has been well studied in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, revealing that many genes in the pathway can be independently eliminated, resulting in little or no deficit in parasite growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Pawlowic et al., 2019</xref>). Surprisingly, this includes inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), a gene once considered to be a crucial drug target based on metabolic mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Striepen et al., 2004</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">JeKeries et al., 2015</xref>). The absence of a growth defect in parasites that lack IMPDH suggests that <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> can not only synthesise purine nucleotides, but also take them up directly from the infected host cell. Less is known about the pyrimidine salvage pathway in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, however, there is still evidence of redundancy. Thymidine kinase (TK) and dihydrofolate reductase-thymidine synthase (DHFR-TS) both convert their respective substrates (deoxythymidine or deoxyuridine monophosphate) to deoxythymidine monophosphate. For this reason, TK and DHFR-TS are both independently non-essential for DNA synthesis and parasite growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Vinayak et al., 2015</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Pawlowic et al., 2019</xref>). Using our <italic>in vivo</italic> pooled CRISPR screen, we discovered that most of the pyrimidine salvage genes significantly contribute to parasite fitness within the intestine.</p><p id="P5">It is widely accepted that protective immunity can be acquired to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, as incidences of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infections decrease with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Haque et al., 2009</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">KotloK et al., 2013</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Sow et al., 2016</xref>), and experimental infection with attenuated parasites leads to protection in calves and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jenkins et al., 2004</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Sateriale et al., 2019</xref>). Considering the success of the vaccination campaign for rotavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Yen et al., 2014</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">O’Ryan, 2017</xref>), a diarrheal pathogen with a similar patient population and pathogenesis, a <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> vaccine is predicted to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality in children. Numerous protein antigens have been associated with protection in humans and several prominent surface proteins have been suggested as vaccine candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gilchrist et al., 2023</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Manque Patricio et al., 2011</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Askari et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, if and how many of these proteins contribute to parasite fitness is unclear. Here, we assess the relative fitness contributions during infection for a panel of proposed <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> vaccine candidates (collected from the literature). As Cp23 (also known as the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> immunodominant antigen 23) is one of the leading vaccine candidates, and strongly correlated with protection in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gilchrist et al., 2023</xref>), we investigated how this protein specifically contributes to parasite virulence and fitness.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Iterative improvements to improve <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> genetic manipulation</title><p id="P6">To develop CRISPR screening, we first sought to improve <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> transfection eKiciency. To transfect <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, dormant oocysts are treated with bile salts and warmed to body temperature to simulate the conditions of a human intestine. Under these conditions, the environmentally hardy oocysts ‘excyst’, releasing four motile and transfectable sporozoites that readily invade intestinal epithelial cells. To optimise transfection, we transfected <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> parasites with a vector that contained both luminescent (NanoLuciferase) and fluorescent (mCherry) reporters under constitutive expression and allowed the transfected parasites to infect an intestinal cell (HCT8) monolayer. Numerous electroporation programs were trialled using transient expression, with FL115 demonstrating the highest luminescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 1a</xref>). Furthermore, various combinations of bile salts and incubation media were tested for their eKect on parasite transfection. Notably, incubation in sodium taurocholate led to higher transfection eKiciency compared to the deoxy form, sodium taurodeoxycholate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 1b</xref>). Combined, these adjustments resulted in more than a 50-fold improvement in transfection eKiciency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 1c &amp; d</xref>).</p><p id="P7">As <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> parasites lack NHEJ, CRISPR driven injury of the genome is required to drive homologous recombination for genetic manipulation. Although this represents a significant barrier to high-throughput screening, the parasite’s lack of NHEJ very likely contributes to its uniquely high level of genetic editing specificity. Indeed, an ‘oK-target’ genomic insertion has yet to be reported by <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> researchers. Further, the parasite predominantly exists in a haploid state during its life cycle and has a minimal requirement of homology for eKicient editing. To determine the smallest reliable allowance for eKicient repair, we tested the eKiciency of editing using diKering length homology arms to integrate a nanoluciferase gene into the dispensable TK locus. A positive correlation between the length of the homology arms and the eKiciency of repair was observed, with 50bp (the longest length tested) being the most eKicient, while no integration was observed in the absence of CRISPR driven injury of TK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To allow for pooled genetic knockout screens, we reasoned that a one-plasmid approach would be required, where a single plasmid delivers the Cas9-expression vector, a target specific gRNA, and a segment of DNA to be inserted at the target genomic locus (repair DNA). The repair DNA contains homologous flanks surrounding an expression cassette with the selectable marker and a genetic barcode for identification. Further, to enable high-throughput creation of targeted libraries, we developed a two-step Golden Gate assembly method, where first a 300bp segment containing all gene-specific (unique) DNA is integrated into the Cas9-expression vector. In the second step of the assembly, a non-unique expression cassette is inserted that will integrate into the genome, enabling the use of virtually any combination of selection markers or reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To fit all unique DNA into a 300bp oligonucleotide, we used a 50bp gRNA which simultaneously serves as one of the homology sites for genomic integration. To test the feasibility of this approach, we generated a vector targeting TK, a gene that is known to be dispensable for parasite growth. The TK targeting vector was transfected into <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum)</italic> sporozoites that were used to infect genetically immunocompromised (interferon gamma deficient <italic>Ifnγ<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice and luminescence was measured in mouse faecal material 7 days post transfection, comparable to what is observed when using a separate DNA repair template and a Cas9-expression vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). As we redefined the method to generate <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> transgenics, we confirmed the approach’s specificity via whole genome sequencing, and as expected, the only genome alteration observed was at the targeted site within the coding region of the TK gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>CRISPR KO screen of the pyrimidine salvage pathway</title><p id="P9">To assess the feasibility and reproducibility of a recombination-based <italic>in vivo</italic> screen, we designed a pilot screen targeting 11 genes in the parasite’s pyrimidine salvage pathway (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table. 1</xref>). We ran parallel screens employing either 1 or 2 targeting vectors per gene, hence 11 or 22 gRNAs, respectively. Targeted KO vectors were transfected into <italic>C. parvum</italic> sporozoites, which were propagated in <italic>Ifnγ</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice under paromomycin selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Luminescence from the integrated nanoluciferase reporter was detected in mouse faecal material 8 days post transfection, in both the 1 and 2 KO vector per gene pyrimidine salvage screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). From the output, faecal material from the infected mice, parasites were purified, their DNA extracted, and the barcodes amplified via high fidelity PCR. From the input, transfected parasites used to infect the mice, DNA was extracted and the barcodes amplified via high fidelity PCR. Both the output and input barcodes were sequenced and used to calculate fold enrichment scores for each gene. Fold enrichment scores serve as a measure of relative fitness, genes whose barcodes show a negative enrichment are presumed to be important to parasite survival and therefore highly fitness conferring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Importantly, fold enrichment scores between the 1 and 2 KO vector screens were strongly correlated, achieving an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.842 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Of the 11 genes included in the pyrimidine salvage screen, only 3 were low fitness conferring: dihydrofolate reductase – thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) (cgd4_4460), thymidine kinase (TK) (cgd5_4440) and dCMP deaminase (cgd2_2780). As mentioned previously, TK and DHFR-TS play redundant roles in synthesis of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> dTMP, making them independently non-essential for DNA synthesis and parasite growth. Thus, the results of our pilot screen eKectively mirror those of previous experiments attempting individual knockouts of these genes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Vinayak et al., 2015</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Pawlowic et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Refining diCRE-mediated genetic editing in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic></title><p id="P10">To validate our results from the pyrimidine salvage screen, we sought to use an inducible Cre-recombinase system to remove genes at their genetic locus. This method has been previously adapted for use in <italic>C. parvum</italic>, employing the conditional split recombinase (diCRE), which dimerises upon rapamycin addition and excises DNA between loxP recombination sites, one of which is embedded within an artificial intron introduced into the target gene’s coding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Tandel et al., 2023</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Shaw et al., 2024</xref>). This system demonstrated high eKiciency, but low-to-moderate activity in the absence of the rapamycin induction (i.e. leakiness). To refine this system, we tested a validated intron from the male gamete fusion factor HAP2 (cgd8_2220). Insertion of this intron within the nanoluciferase reporter with and without the loxP recombination site did not aKect the measured luminescence during <italic>in vitro</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 2a</xref>). Using this validated intron/loxP combination, we generated a stable <italic>C. parvum</italic> diCRE parasite line targeting TK with the diCRE subunits, FRB-Cre60 and FKBP-Cre59, expressed under the same promoter, separated via a self-cleaving T2A skip peptide (TK-T2A-diCRE) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 2b</xref>). However, when investigating the excision dynamics of this <italic>C. parvum</italic> TK-T2A-diCRE line, by infecting HCT8 monolayers in the presence or absence of rapamycin, we noted a high level of excision in the absence of rapamycin, similar to what has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 2c</xref>). We reasoned that the T2A skip peptide may not be functioning properly and causing background induction in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>. Consequently, we generated a stable transgenic parasite line targeting TK where the diCRE segments were under independent aldolase and tubulin promoters (TK-diCRE) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 2d</xref>). When investigating the excision dynamics of this TK-diCRE line, we observed complete excision of the loxP-flanked TK segment at 24 hours post rapamycin induction, and no measurable excision in the non-induced controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 2e</xref>). Using these TK-diCRE parasites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 3a</xref>), we performed a time course to measure the dynamics of knockout at both the DNA and protein level (via a C-terminal HA tag). DNA excision had not occurred by 8 hours post rapamycin treatment but was complete by 24 hours, and no excision was detected in the non-induced control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 3b</xref>). Likewise, protein levels started to decrease by 12 hours post rapamycin treatment and were approximately 95% reduced compared to the non-induced controls by 24 hours. In contrast, the protein levels remained high throughout the time course in the non-induced controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 3c &amp; d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ribonucleotide reductase is required for parasite DNA replication and survival</title><p id="P11">Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) catalyse the conversion of nucleotides to deoxynucleotides, an essential step for DNA synthesis in all organisms. In our pyrimidine salvage screen, RNR showed the lowest fold enrichment score, indicating a high eKect on parasite fitness. Our first attempt to create RNR-diCRE parasites was unsuccessful, likely due to the addition of a C-terminal HA epitope tag. It has been suggested that the C-terminus of RNR is required for its function in other organisms and this may hold true for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cohen et al., 1986</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dutia et al., 1986</xref>). The second attempt to generate RNR-diCRE parasites, without the C-terminal HA epitope tag, was successful (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 3e</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, rapamycin induced DNA excision of both TK- and RNR-diCRE parasites appears to follow similar dynamics, although we note some partial excision in the RNR-diCRE parasites at later timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a &amp; b</xref>). Further, functional deletion of both TK and RNR was confirmed using 5-ethynyl2´-deoxyuridine (EdU), a thymidine analogue. Thymidine kinase is required for EdU phosphorylation and incorporation, and it has been shown before that loss of the TK gene in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> leads to a failure to incorporate EdU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Vinayak et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, RNR deletion will not block EdU phosphorylation, but rather incorporation, as DNA synthesis cannot occur without other deoxynucleotides. We observed a complete lack of EdU incorporation in rapamycin treated TK and RNR-diCRE parasites, while EdU incorporation was observed in the non-induced and wildtype controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 3f</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, deletion of TK led to no growth defect, whereas deletion of RNR strongly attenuated parasite growth by 24 hours post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Similarly, rapamycin treatment of TK-diCRE infected mice lead to no growth defect, but rapamycin treatment of RNR-diCRE infected mice completely inhibited parasite growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), demonstrating that RNR is indeed essential for parasite survival, further underlining the reliability of the <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR screening method.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>CRISPR KO screen of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> vaccine candidates</title><p id="P12">Both the 1 and 2 KO vector per gene pyrimidine salvage screens were reproducible, but to circumvent potential low eKiciency gRNAs, we chose to screen the leading <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> vaccine candidates with 2 KO vectors per gene. In total, 11 vaccine candidates (22 KO vectors) were chosen due to their reported surface location and implication of immunogenicity and/or immune protection in the literature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table. 2</xref>). Luminescence from the nanoluciferase reporter was detected in mouse faecal material around 7 days post transfection in both screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). As before, parasites were purified, DNA extracted, and barcodes were amplified via high fidelity PCR. The sequenced barcode counts were used to calculate fold enrichment scores for each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), and importantly these scores were comparable, achieving an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.611 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Of the 11 genes in the vaccine candidate screen, only 2 were low fitness conferring: cgd6_1660 (thrombospondin repeat protein 11 (TSP11)) and cgd6_32 (apical glycoprotein 1 (AGP1)). The remaining 9 genes appeared to confer some level of fitness. Akey et al., recently demonstrated that AGP1 was dispensable for parasite survival, while apical glycoprotein 2 (AGP2) (cgd7_4330) was likely essential, both phenotypes that our pooled <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR screen recapitulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Akey et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To gain more insight into growth and competition of pooled KO parasites, we conducted an additional 1 KO vector per gene vaccine candidate screen, where instead of amplifying DNA barcodes from parasites purified around the peak of infection, we amplified barcodes directly from individual faecal collections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). This alternative method oKered greater temporal and spatial resolution of infection where fold enrichment scores could be easily and non-invasively be monitored throughout the experiment from either pooled collections or individual mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e &amp; f</xref>). Individual mice demonstrated considerable heterogeneity at day 8 of infection, which decreased over time and became more uniform by day 12. Again, this screen found that AGP1 and TSP11 were low fitness conferring relative to the other genes within the cohort.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Immunodominant antigen 23 is required for host cell invasion</title><p id="P14">Immunodominant antigen 23 (Cp23) (cgd4_3620) is one of the leading <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> vaccine candidates, having been originally discovered in 1986 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Ungar &amp; Nash, 1986</xref>). Despite nearly 40 years of research, there is very little known about Cp23’s role and function during <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infection. In our vaccine candidate screen, Cp23 displayed a low fold enrichment score, indicating a moderate-to-high eKect on parasite fitness. To investigate the function of Cp23, we generated Cp23-diCRE parasites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 4a</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, the rapamycin induced DNA excision had started by 6 hours and was complete by 24 hours, with no excision observed in the uninduced controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a &amp; b</xref>). Loss of Cp23 was confirmed at the protein level using a commercially available monoclonal antibody. <italic>In vitro</italic>, rapamycin treatment caused a significant decrease in parasite growth after 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) and rapamycin treatment of Cp23-diCRE infected mice completely blocked parasite growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>), demonstrating that Cp23 is indeed essential for parasite survival.</p><p id="P15">Cp23 has been reported to be on the surface of the sporozoite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Mead et al., 1988</xref>), in the sporozoite trails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Arrowood et al., 1991</xref>), and is predicted to localise to the micronemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Guérin et al., 2023</xref>). To localise Cp23 at high resolution, we used a commercial antibody that we genetically validated with our Cp23-diCRE parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), coupled with expansion and super-resolution microscopy. This revealed Cp23 was expressed at the parasite’s pellicle throughout the life cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). To resolve the location further, we carried out transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with the immunogold labelled Cp23 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). In excysted and unexcysted sporozoites, Cp23 again appeared to primarily localise to the parasite pellicle, either at the plasma membrane or inner membrane complex (IMC). The immunogold-TEM also revealed that even in unexcysted sporozoites, Cp23 was not present in the parasite’s micronemes. Further, we found no evidence that Cp23 was present in sporozoite trails (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 4b</xref>). When permeabilised with Triton X-100, sporozoites demonstrated faint staining with the Cp23 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). Without permeabilisation, <italic>C. parvum</italic> sporozoites, surprisingly, demonstrated either a complete lack of Cp23 signal or a heighted intensity of signal throughout the parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). In these high intensity parasites, we can detect the internal control antibody (CpTrpB - <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> tryptophan synthase beta) at low levels. This suggests that 1) high intensity Cp23 parasites are weakly permeabilised, 2) permeabilisation with Triton X-100 aKects Cp23 localisation, likely by disrupting its membrane association, and 3) Cp23 is likely not exposed on the surface of the sporozoite.</p><p id="P16">Within our synchronised <italic>in vitro</italic> model of infection, <italic>C. parvum</italic> parasites egress from their infected cell and re-invade nearby epithelial cells around 18 hours post infection, starting another round of asexual reproduction. By 22 hours, this reinvasion event is mostly complete. To determine the biological function of Cp23, we examined our Cp23-diCRE parasites in the context of this reinfection event, when DNA excision and depletion of Cp23 has started. At 22 hours, Cp23-diCRE parasites without rapamycin treatment were mostly newly invaded life stages (1n or 2n = 81% of parasites observed, n = 356/438). When Cp23 was ablated by rapamycin, fewer parasites observed were newly invaded life stages (1n or 2n = 45%, n = 77/173) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 4c &amp; e</xref>).

We hypothesised that the reduced percentage of newly invaded parasites when</p><p id="P17">Cp23 was ablated might be due to a defect in reinvasion. To examine this more closely, live microscopy was carried out in the presence and absence of rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j &amp; k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary videos S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">4</xref>). When Cp23 was ablated, merozoites could egress, but were then unable to move to another cell to initiate reinvasion. Apicomplexan parasites, such as <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, are known to use a method of locomotion called gliding motility, where parasites secrete proteins that are then bound by their own surface receptors, allowing for forward propulsion using an actomyosin-based complex (referred to as the glideosome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Keeley &amp; Soldati, 2004</xref>). Loss of Cp23 in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> appears to specifically block this gliding motility that is essential for reinfection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">Reverse genetic screens play an important role in molecular biology and have transformed the field for many pathogens. Here, we overcome the current technical barriers to develop a pooled <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR KO method that allows for reverse genetic screening in <italic>Cryptosporidium.</italic> As <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> lacks the molecular machinery for NHEJ, our method had to employ homologous recombination to create stable transgenics. We leveraged two important features of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> genetics: 1) the parasite spends nearly all of its life cycle in a haploid form, thus requiring only one recombination event, and 2) there is a minimal length requirement for homologous recombination, in fact 30bp of DNA flanking the Cas9 cut site appears to be suKicient in our experiments. Our two-step cloning approach for generating these targeted KO vectors is designed to be versatile, allowing for an unlimited range of selection markers and reporters that can be inserted into the genome, which will allow researchers to develop new and innovative screens.</p><p id="P19">Within an infected host, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> undergoes multiple rounds of asexual reproduction before diKerentiating into sexual forms (male and female) that unite to allow for genetic recombination. During the sexual cycle, transgenic parasites in these CRISPR screens can mate and this has the potential to influence results. This risk is partially mitigated by two factors: 1) the parasite must complete at least three rounds of asexual replication prior to sexual diKerentiation and potential recombination. This gives ample time for any genes that are detrimental to parasite fitness to exert their eKect; 2) <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> has a relatively high rate of recombination, which should allow for genes, even those in close proximity, to segregate in a nearly random fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kimball et al., 2024</xref>). In both the pyrimidine salvage and vaccine candidate screens, we identified high and low fitness conferring genes in close proximity to each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 5a</xref>). Despite these mitigating factors, there is the potential for sublethal gene knockouts to exert synergistic or antagonistic eKects and this possibility must be considered during the design process and while analysing and interpreting results.</p><p id="P20">Another important factor to consider is the amplifying eKect of relative fitness screens within an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of infection. Genes that have a mild eKect on parasite survival and fitness can be outcompeted within a larger pool. This appears to be the case for uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT, cgd1_1900), which catalyses the conversion of uracil and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate to uridine monophosphate. UPRT has recently been shown to be non-essential to parasite survival, yet the authors noted that their UPRT KO <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> parasites appeared to have a growth defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kimball et al., 2024</xref>). In our <italic>in vivo</italic> screens, UPRT had a negative fold enrichment, indicating that UPRT contributes highly to parasite fitness and this likely reflects the observed growth defect. In contrast to UPRT, dCMP deaminase (cgd2_2780) had little eKect on parasite fitness. dCMP deaminase catalyses the conversion of deoxycytidine-monophosphate (dCMP) to deoxyuridine-monophosphate (dUMP), which is then transformed into deoxythymidine-monophosphate (dTMP) by DHFR-TS. Thymidine kinase can also produce dTMP, likely explaining why the loss of dCMP deaminase had little eKect on parasite fitness.</p><p id="P21">Most of the genes in the vaccine candidate CRISPR screen were identified as fitness conferring, with the exception of apical glycoprotein 1 (AGP1) and thrombospondin repeat protein 11 (TSP11). Akey et al. previous showed AGP1 was dispensable for parasite survival and AGP2 was likely essential, both phenotypes that were recapitulated within our screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Akey et al., 2023</xref>). Recently, it has been suggested that there may be redundancy in the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> thrombospondin protein family (TSPs), as there are 12 members, many with similar domain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">John et al., 2023</xref>). Although the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> TSPs currently have an unknown function, orthologous Apicomplexan TSP genes play a role in adhesion and motility. We included two TSPs in the vaccine candidate screen: 1) TSP8 (cgd6_780, also known as MIC1) and 2) TSP11 (cgd6_1660). TSP8/MIC1 is a known micronemal protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Putignani et al., 2008</xref>) and was identified as high fitness conferring. In contrast, TSP11 was dispensable, demonstrating that there is at least some redundancy within the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> TSP protein family. We also confirmed GP40 (cgd6_1080, also known as GP60) and GP900 (cgd7_4020), antigens that are associated with protection from reinfection in humans, influence parasite fitness <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gilchrist et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Cp23 is one of the leading cryptosporidiosis vaccine candidates, and here we demonstrated that it is highly fitness conferring, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Cp23 was first identified in 1986 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Ungar &amp; Nash, 1986</xref>), and recent studies have revealed Cp23 recognising IgA and IgG are correlated with protection against <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infection in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gilchrist et al., 2023</xref>). Until now, the function and precise localisation of Cp23 has been unclear. Here we validate a commercial Cp23 monoclonal antibody using diCRE mediated excision of the target gene, then use a combination of ultrastructure expansion, super-resolution, and transmission electron microscopy, to describe the localisation of Cp23 throughout the parasite life cycle at high resolution. Although our localisation agrees with previously published studies that detects Cp23 at the pellicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Enriquez &amp; Riggs, 1998</xref>), our data suggests that Cp23 may not be exposed at the surface of the sporozoite. Cp23 has no detectable signal peptide, transmembrane domain or GPI-anchor, yet was recently demonstrated to be both myristoylated and palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Haserick et al., 2017</xref>). Myristylation is a non-reversible lipid modifications that is commonly found in proteins that are anchored to internal membranes in other Apicomplexan parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Schlott et al., 2018</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Broncel et al., 2020</xref>). There are, however, some exceptions to this rule. TgMIC7 is a micronemal protein in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> that is myristoylated prior to traKicking to the parasite surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Broncel et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, TgMIC7 contains a transmembrane domain that likely facilitates entry into the secretory pathway, whereas Cp23 does not. While we cannot rule out traKicking of Cp23 to the outer membrane of the parasite, our data supports an internal localisation.</p><p id="P23">Despite this internal localisation, it is clear Cp23 IgA and IgG have both been correlated with protection in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gilchrist et al., 2023</xref>). One interpretation of this correlation is that antibodies recognising Cp23 arise from severe <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infection(s) where cell-based adaptive immunity against the parasite has developed. Controlled experiments using a natural murine model of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> suggest that antibody-based immunity is dispensable for resolution of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Sateriale et al., 2019</xref>). Further, we found that the genetically validated Cp23 antibody used in this study was unable to block parasite attachment or invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Sup. 6a - b</xref>). However, it has been reported that antibodies to Cp23 may have a protective eKect <italic>in vivo</italic>, thus we cannot definitively rule out the possibility of Cp23-directed protection, whether through antibody or cell-based immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Enriquez &amp; Riggs, 1998</xref>).

To do so, the samples were quenched with PBS/glycine for 2 minutes three times and then blocked with 1% BSA/PBS for 5 minutes at RT. A 1:10 dilution of the primary Cp23 antibody was incubated in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 hour and then samples were washed twice with 0.1% BSA/PBS. A 1:50 dilution of the protein-A gold bound to 10nm gold particles (PAG-10) was incubated with the sample in 0.1% BSA/PBS for 20 minutes and then washed twice with PBS. A post fixation step was carried out with 1% glutaraldehyde for 5 minutes and samples were washed with Milli-Q H<sub>2</sub>0 for 1 minute 6 times in total. Samples were incubated in 1% uranyl acetate for 10 minutes and air dried. Transmission electron microscopy was carried out on the 120-kV JEOL JEM-1400Flash Electron Microscope (JEOL Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, UK) with a JEOL Matataki Flash camera.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Live microscopy</title><p id="P37">At 18 hours post-infection, phase contrast imaging was performed using an Eclipse Ts2R microscope (Nikon) with a 40X/0.55 NA Ph1 ADL objective (Nikon), digital sight 10 camera (Nikon) and a TPi-TCSX (Tokai Hit) heated stage set at 37°C. Images were acquired at 25fps for 1 hour to capture egressing merozoites. Images were imported into ImageJ2 Version 2 and the number of gliding merozoites was manually observed. Image sequences were converted to movies to acquire short videos of egressing merozoites.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Permeabilisation assay</title><p id="P38">Coverslips placed in 24-well plates were coated with 0.1mg/mL poly-D-lysine for 1 hour and washed twice with 1X PBS. Excysted sporozoites in serum free RMPI-1640 were allowed to adhere for 10 minutes at 37°C. Adhered sporozoites were fixed with 1% PFA/PBS for 20 minutes at RT. For the permeabilised condition, 0.1% Triton X-100 was used to permeabilise for 10 minutes at RT. For the non-permeabilised condition, 1X PBS was instead incubated for 10 minutes at RT. Both conditions were blocked with 4% BSA/PBS overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies were incubated in 1% BSA/PBS for 2 hours at RT. The coverslips were washed 5 times and secondary antibodies were incubated in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 hour at RT. All coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and visualised using a VT-iSIM.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Attachment assay</title><p id="P39">Coverslips placed in 24-well plates were coated with 0.025mg/mL poly-D-lysine for 1 hour and washed twice with 1X PBS. 60,000 oocysts per well were excysted and sporozoites were added and spun at 80g for 1 minute to adhere.

Sporozoites were fixed using 8% PFA/PBS leak in resulting in 4% PFA/PBS/Ringer’s fixation for 15 minutes at RT. Sporozoites were washed 3 times in total with 1X PBS and blocked with 4% BSA/PBS overnight at 4°C. Sporozoites were stained with 1:5000 Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA) in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 hour at RT. The BioTek Cytation5 (Agilent Technologies) was used to visualise the attached sporozoites. Images were exported as TIFs into ImageJ2 Version 2 and the below macro was used to analyse the data:</p><p id="P40">run(“Subtract Background…”, “rolling=50”);</p><p id="P41">setAutoThreshold(“Default dark”);</p><p id="P42">//run(“Threshold…”);</p><p id="P43">setAutoThreshold(“Triangle dark”);</p><p id="P44">setOption(“BlackBackground”, true);</p><p id="P45">run(“Convert to Mask”);</p><p id="P46">run(“Median…”, “radius=2”);</p><p id="P47">run(“Analyze Particles…”, “size=50-10000 circularity=0.00-1 display summarize overlay”);</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Neutralisation assay</title><p id="P48">HCT8 cells were seeded to confluency in 96-well clear bottom tissue culture-treated plates (Corning).

Post antibody incubation, the sporozoites were added to the 96-well plate containing HCT8 cells in 1% RPMI-1640. At 24 hours post-infection, cell monolayers were washed with 1X PBS, fixed with 4% PFA/PBS (Alfa Aesar) for 15 minutes, permeabilised with 0.25% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 10 minutes and blocked with 4% BSA/PBS (Merck) overnight at 4oC. Parasites were stained with 1:4000 Vicia villosa lectin (VVL) and host nuclei were stained with 1:10,000 Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 hour at RT. Cell monolayers were washed and visualised on the BioTek Cytation5 (Agilent Technologies). 2x2 tiled images per well were acquired with the 20X objective.

The first Golden Gate reaction occurs between a Cas9 expression plasmid and a 300bp unique segment (containing the two 50bp homology arms (one of which serves dual function as the gRNA), a unique DNA barcode, BsmBI restriction enzyme sites and the tracrRNA). The second Golden Gate reaction, using the BsmBI restriction enzyme sites, inserts a variable selection/reporter cassette to generate a complete knockout vector. The knockout vector then contains all the machinery to disrupt a gene of interest by inserting a variable selection cassette and barcode at the genomic locus. <bold>b.</bold> A knockout vector targeting thymidine kinase (cgd5_4440) was generated and transfected into <italic>C. parvum</italic> sporozoites that were used to infect <italic>Ifnγ</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice under paromomycin selection.

Following construction of KO vectors (detailed in 1a), sporozoites are transfected with gene specific KO vectors and used to infect mice.
