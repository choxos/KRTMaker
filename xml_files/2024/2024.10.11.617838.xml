Yet how metamorphosing insect pupae protect themselves against the threat of dehydration remains unclear. Here, we identify the chemical composition and biosynthetic origins of a lipid desiccation barrier specific to the pupal and sexually-immature adult stages of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. This barrier comprises unisex hyper-long hydrocarbons, 29-37 carbons in length, which are synthesized by larval oenocytes and stored in the larval fat body before being deployed on the pupal and young adult cuticles. We show that the fatty acid elongase <italic>EloHL</italic> is required for the biosynthesis of hyper-long hydrocarbons that are essential for the barrier to water loss during metamorphosis. Across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genus, many species express unisex profiles of hyper-long hydrocarbons and, as young adults, transition to sex-specific shorter hydrocarbons with known pheromonal functions. The desert species <italic>D. mojavensis</italic>, however, retains hyper-long hydrocarbons during adulthood likely as an adaptation to an arid environment. Our study reveals how the cuticular lipid barrier is tuned to meet changing environmental pressures during insect development and evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic> development</kwd><kwd>cuticular hydrocarbons</kwd><kwd>lipid metabolism</kwd><kwd>desiccation barrier</kwd><kwd>pupal cuticle</kwd><kwd>metamorphosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Dehydration is a major threat to all terrestrial life. The evolution of multiple water conservation mechanisms has nevertheless allowed animals to colonize much of the earth’s land surface, including hot and arid zones. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] One critical adaptation for restricting water loss is the cutaneous lipid barrier - a hydrophobic coating of the integument that provides a direct interface between the animal and its environment. This widespread if not universal feature of terrestrial fauna is particularly important for small animals, like insects, as their large surface area to volume ratio makes them highly vulnerable to desiccation. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] Insects have therefore evolved very effective cuticular lipid barriers to water loss, contributing to their remarkable success as the most diverse and species-rich class of animals. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] The superficial site and chemistry of insect cuticular lipids make them well suited to perform an additional function as semi-volatile pheromones, conveying social cues about location and physiological status. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] The potential dual role of some cuticular lipid species - as both desiccation barrier and sex pheromone - raises intriguing evolutionary questions about the links between ecological adaptation and speciation. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]</p><p id="P3">Holometabolous insects undergo complete metamorphosis. This remarkable and complex developmental process involves a dramatic morphological and physiological transformation of the larva into the adult (imago) and is often accompanied by a shift in ecological niche. In many holometabolous insects, including the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, larval stages typically burrow in a semi-aquatic environment of rotting fruit but subsequent pupal and adult stages take place in a terrestrial environment that necessitates a more efficient barrier to desiccation. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] In adult insects, it is well established that their cuticle is coated with a lipid layer consisting primarily of hydrocarbons. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] These hydrocarbons play key roles both in desiccation resistance and in social communication, especially mating behaviour. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] <italic>Drosophila</italic> cuticular hydrocarbons fall into four main categories (<italic>n</italic>-alkanes, methyl-branched alkanes, monoenes and dienes) and the precise blend of these determines the overall biophysical properties of the cuticular hydrocarbon layer, such as melting temperature, transpiration rate and volatility. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] Adult oenocytes are the site of synthesis of cuticular hydrocarbons in pterygote insects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and many other insects, these specialized lipid-secreting cells are confined to abdominal segments, where they are located beneath the epidermis and cross-talk with other tissues to coordinate lipid metabolism. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]</p><p id="P4">Adult oenocytes synthesize hydrocarbons from fatty acyl-CoA precursors via reduction to fatty aldehydes and loss of one carbon by cytochrome-P450 dependent oxidative decarbonylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, knockout or oenocyte-specific knockdown of the P450 decarbonylase, Cyp4g1, results in loss of cuticular hydrocarbons, susceptibility to desiccation, and reduced viability upon adult emergence (eclosion). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] Multiple fatty acid synthases, elongases, and desaturases expressed in adult oenocytes regulate the types of fatty acyl-CoA substrates for Cyp4g1, in turn determining the length and desaturation of molecules in the complex blend of cuticular hydrocarbons. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]</p><p id="P5">Across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genus, adult cuticular hydrocarbon profiles are highly divergent and tend to be sex-specific.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>] Natural selection is thought to favour the production of long-chain hydrocarbons with low volatility as these are thought to contribute most to an effective adult desiccation barrier. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] Consistent with this, carbon chain length correlates across species of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and also ants, with the temperature and humidity of their habitats. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] In particular, there is a strong correlation between the evolution of longer chain methyl-branched hydrocarbons and higher desiccation resistance across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] Furthermore, in the desert species <italic>D. mojavensis</italic>, evolutionary changes in an oenocyte fatty acyl–CoA elongase (<italic>mElo</italic>) confer chain-lengthening of methyl-branched hydrocarbons and increased desiccation resistance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>] The pheromonal role of adult hydrocarbons also places them under strong sexual selection, with both males and females exhibiting a mate preference for particular blends. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>] In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, several hydrocarbon molecules have been identified as sex and species-specific pheromones. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>] For example, female dienes of 27 or 29 carbons in length (C27:2 and C29:2) are synthesized by a sex-specific oenocyte fatty acid elongase (<italic>EloF</italic>) and desaturase (<italic>desatF</italic>) required for mating success. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>] In summary, the available evidence suggests that the evolution of adult cuticular hydrocarbons is shaped by natural selection, promoting non-volatile n-alkanes and methyl-branched alkenes for desiccation resistance, and sexual selection favouring semi-volatile monoenes and dienes for pheromonal communication.</p><p id="P6">In contrast to the barrier lipids of the adult fly, the cellular origin and molecular composition of their counterparts in the pupa remain mysterious. This raises fundamental questions about how this terrestrial phase of development is protected from desiccation. Here we use a combination of genetics, mass spectrometry and a surface-specific analytical technique to identify the molecular composition of the pupal desiccation barrier as well as its cellular origin and biosynthetic pathway.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Sexually immature flies express unisex hyper-long cuticular hydrocarbons</title><p id="P7">To characterise hydrocarbon (HC) profiles during <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> development, we optimised a high temperature gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (HT-GC-MS) workflow capable of resolving chain lengths of up to ~40 carbons (C40, see Methods). Hexane extracts of the body surface analysed using this method did not contain detectable amounts of HCs at the wandering third-instar larval (wL3) or pupal (48h after pupariation) stages. In contrast, at 0-6 hr after adult emergence (eclosion), young flies express abundant HCs on their cuticle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The male and female cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of 0-6 hr flies are remarkably similar, contrasting with marked sex-specific differences in older flies at 1, 3 and 7 days after eclosion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A</xref> + <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) illustrates that the transition from unisex to male/female specific cuticular profiles is already evident at 1 day and very marked by 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, the range of cuticular hydrocarbon chain lengths switches from C27-C37 in young flies to C21-C31 in older flies, with an intermediate pattern at 1-3 days of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">S1</xref>). Henceforth, we define C21 to C28 hydrocarbons as long (L) and C29 to C37 hydrocarbons as hyper-long (HL). The major categories of cuticular HL hydrocarbons are alkenes, dienes and methyl-branched (mb) alkanes, with only low levels of linear alkanes. Interestingly, although dienes are female-restricted in mature adults, we observed HL dienes in both sexes at 0-6 hr after eclosion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). During the first week after adult eclosion, both sexes transition to a lower cuticular ratio of HL to L hydrocarbons but females maintain a higher value, primarily because they continue to express C29-C31 hydrocarbons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A and 1C</xref>). Together, the HT-GC-MS analysis shows that the external body surfaces of larvae and pupae lack detectable hydrocarbons, whereas those of adult flies transition from unisex HL to sex-specific L profiles within a day of eclosion.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Hyper-long hydrocarbons are synthesized in larval oenocytes and stored in the fat body</title><p id="P8">HL hydrocarbons are already present on the cuticle surface at the time of adult eclosion, prompting us to investigate their developmental origin. HT-GC-MS analysis of hydrocarbons extracted from homogenized whole animals after external hydrocarbons were removed, revealed the presence of substantial amounts of “internal” HL hydrocarbons, and some L hydrocarbons (meC26 and C27:1), in wandering L3 larvae, even though “external” hydrocarbons are not detectable on the cuticle at this developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). These internal hydrocarbons have a similar, although not identical, composition to those of newly eclosed adults, suggesting that they may originate from a common larval source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). To identify the larval source of hydrocarbons, we analysed individual dissected tissues. This revealed the presence of substantial amounts of all HL hydrocarbon species in the larval fat body, whereas in the larval carcass (cuticle, epidermis, muscle and oenocytes) and gut, only methyl-branched (mb) hydrocarbons were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). Nevertheless, the levels of two major mb hydrocarbons (mbC28:0 and mbC30:0) were higher in the fat body than in the carcass or gut. These tissue-specific analyses indicate that HL hydrocarbons are stored during development, primarily in the fat body of the larva.</p><p id="P9">We next determined the larval cell type that synthesizes HL hydrocarbons. In adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other dipterans, it is known that sex-specific L hydrocarbons are synthesized in specialised lipid-metabolizing cells called adult oenocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. These hydrocarbons are derived either from dietary or <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized fatty acids (FAs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthases (FASs) generate long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) from acetyl-CoA. Fatty acid elongases then convert <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized or dietary LCFAs into very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA esters (VLCF-CoAs) of varying lengths. Fatty acid reductases (FARs) reduce VLCF-CoAs to very long-chain fatty aldehydes (VLCF aldehydes), which are then converted to hydrocarbons in an irreversible reaction via Cyp4g1, a P450 oxidative decarbonylase. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] Importantly, adult oenocytes do not differentiate until late in pupal development and so they cannot be the site of synthesis for larval HL hydrocarbons. However, in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and other dipterans it is known that there are two separate generations of oenocytes, larval and adult, which differ from one another with respect to cell size, cell number and developmental origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>] Larval oenocytes form in the embryo and are known to play developmental roles in lipid metabolism, molting and tracheal waterproofing. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>] In contrast to their adult counterparts, larval oenocytes have not been implicated in the synthesis of cuticular hydrocarbons. Intriguingly, larval oenocytes are reported to express Cyp4g1 from embryonic stages onwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. We therefore used an oenocyte-specific driver (<italic>PromE-GAL4</italic>, Ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]) to express RNAi for <italic>Cyp4g1</italic> specifically in oenocytes throughout development. This oenocyte <italic>Cyp4g1</italic> knock down resulted in larvae with a dramatic decrease in fat body storage of HL hydrocarbons of the methyl-branched, monoene and diene classes (each hydrocarbon species is represented by meC28:0, C31:1 and C33:2 respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). To achieve spatiotemporal control, we then combined <italic>PromE-GAL4</italic> with the temperature-sensitive Gal80 system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>], selectively knocking <italic>Cyp4g1</italic> down in oenocytes during the pupal period, either with or without additional knockdown during larval development. This revealed an oenocyte <italic>Cyp4g1</italic> requirement for adult eclosion and viability that maps specifically to the larval phase of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Together, the <italic>Cyp4g1</italic> and HT-GC-MS analyses indicate that larval not adult oenocytes synthesize HL hydrocarbons, which are then stored in the larval fat body.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>EloHL is required in oenocytes for the biosynthesis of hyper-long hydrocarbons</title><p id="P10">The carbon-chain length of insect cuticular hydrocarbons is thought to be determined by the length of their VLCF-CoA precursors, which in turn depends upon fatty acid elongases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). To identify the elongase(s) responsible for synthesizing HL rather than L hydrocarbons, we purified actively translated mRNAs from larval versus adult oenocytes using a RiboTag method. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>] qRT-PCR assays of RiboTag purified mRNAs detected the expression of 15 of the 20 predicted <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> elongases in the larval and/or adult oenocytes of males and/or females. For these 15 elongases, PCA revealed that male and female elongase expression profiles cluster together in larval oenocytes (at the wandering L3 stage) but markedly separate in adult oenocytes (at 7 days after eclosion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This correlates with the unisex versus sex specific profiles of larval HL and adult L hydrocarbons respectively. The principal component coefficients (loadings) of individual elongases show that two elongases, <italic>CG6660</italic> and <italic>CG8534</italic>, contribute the most to the PCA separation between larval and adult oenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). These two elongases are highly expressed in the larval oenocytes of both sexes but <italic>CG8534</italic> is also highly expressed in the adult oenocytes of females but not males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P11">As a first step towards identifying whether <italic>CG6660</italic> or <italic>CG8534</italic> is required for the larval oenocyte synthesis of HL hydrocarbons, their developmental phenotypes were characterized. We reasoned that the RNAi knockdown phenotype of an oenocyte elongase dedicated to HL hydrocarbon biosynthesis would recapitulate, or be less severe than, that of <italic>Cyp4g1</italic>. Oenocyte-specific knockdown of Cyp4g1 gives normal larval development and pupariation but defective adult eclosion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Consistent with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>], larval oenocyte-specific knockdown of <italic>CG6660</italic> blocked all pupariation, ruling it out as an elongase dedicated to HL hydrocarbon synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, larval oenocyte-specific knockdown of <italic>CG8534</italic> did not affect pupariation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). We therefore used HT-GC-MS to quantify the internal hydrocarbons of these knockdown animals at the larval stage, observing a dramatic decrease in HL hydrocarbons, compared to <italic>GFP</italic> knockdown and <italic>GAL4</italic> driver only controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). This decrease is accompanied by a corresponding increase in L hydrocarbons such as C27:1 and meC26:0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). This suggests <italic>CG8534</italic> is specific for HL hydrocarbon biosynthesis but to rule out that the observed chain-length selectivity is due to partial knockdown, or even to RNAi off-target effects, we generated a precise null allele using CRISPR-Cas9 induced homologous recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>]. Both exons and the intron of <italic>CG8534</italic> were replaced with a 3xP3-mCherry cassette, thus removing the entire coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). The knockout mutant allele (<italic>CG8534</italic><sup>Δ1</sup>) was verified by PCR, using primer pairs that detected the presence of 3xP3-mCherry and the absence of <italic>CG8534</italic> coding sequences in <italic>CG8534</italic><sup>Δ1</sup><italic>/Df(3R)Excel6155</italic> transheterozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S2</xref>). Importantly, HT-GC-MS analysis of these <italic>CG8534</italic><sup>Δ1</sup> transheterozygotes, compared to control genotypes, revealed a strong decrease in HL hydrocarbons and a concomitant increase in L hydrocarbons, similar to the RNAi knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Together, the RNAi knockdown and null mutant analyses demonstrate that <italic>CG8534</italic> is required in larval oenocytes for HL but not L hydrocarbon biosynthesis. Furthermore, they suggest that, in the absence of <italic>EloHL</italic>, LCFA precursors are diverted towards other elongases that tend to produce shorter VLCF-CoA precursors for L hydrocarbons. Based on the selectivity of <italic>CG8534</italic> for HL hydrocarbons, we hereafter name it as <italic>EloHL</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The switch from HL to L hydrocarbons is conserved across <italic>Drosophila</italic> species</title><p id="P12">To determine the extent to which HL hydrocarbons are conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, we first examined a chromosomal region of microsynteny that in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> contains <italic>EloHL</italic> and four other predicted fatty acid elongases (<italic>EloF, CG16904, CG9459</italic> and <italic>CG9458</italic>). We identified the elongases in this microsyntenic region from 30 species across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Sophophora</italic> subgenera. This analysis suggests that the elongase microsynteny is restricted to the <italic>Sophophora</italic> subgenus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Within the microsyntenic region of the 23 <italic>Sophophora</italic> species analysed, there are three examples of elongase duplications, but many species lack a recognisable ortholog of <italic>EloHL</italic> and/or the other elongases, and three species contain only <italic>CG16904</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). To determine whether the presence of an <italic>EloHL</italic> gene correlates with HL hydrocarbons, six <italic>Drosophila</italic> species were selected for further comparative functional analysis.

HT-GC-MS analysis of cuticular hydrocarbons showed that there are clear unisex trends for shortening of the hydrocarbon chain length during the first week after adult eclosion in five of the six selected species.

Nevertheless, it remains possible that larval HL hydrocarbons synthesized during the larval stage are stored in the fat body, in order to function later on in development - during the pupal period. To address this possibility, we asked whether <italic>EloHL</italic>-dependent HL hydrocarbons are required for the pupal barrier to desiccation, which remains mysterious both in terms of its chemical composition and anatomical location. <italic>EloHL</italic><sup><italic>Δ1</italic></sup>/<italic>Df(3R)Excel6155</italic> transheterozygotes, deficient in HL hydrocarbons, were subjected from pupariation onwards to varying degrees of desiccation stress induced by low relative humidity (RH) and/or high temperature. First, we established that the pupal dry weights of <italic>EloHL</italic><sup><italic>Δ1</italic></sup>/<italic>Df(3R)Excel6155</italic> transheterozygotes, as well as oenocyte-specific <italic>Cyp4g1</italic> knockdowns, were not significantly different from those of genetic controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S4A and S4B</xref>). At 30% RH and 25°C, the pupal water content of genetic controls declines rapidly by 24 hr after puparium formation (APF) and subsequently slows, such that it is roughly halved by 72 hr APF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S4C</xref>). Under these environmental conditions, the pupal water loss of <italic>EloHL</italic><sup><italic>Δ1</italic></sup>/<italic>Df(3R)Excel6155</italic> transheterozygotes showed a very similar temporal pattern and magnitude to that of genetic controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Figure S4C</xref>). In contrast, with drier conditions of 15-20% RH, <italic>EloHL</italic><sup><italic>Δ1</italic></sup> transheterozygotes lost more water by 48 hr APF than controls, and this was observed across temperatures from 25 to 28°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). At 29°C under these drier conditions, there was a catastrophic loss of ~75% of pupal water by 48 hr APF, both in the transheterozygotes and the genetic controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). At 15-20% RH and 26°C, we observed that the excessive rate of dehydration of <italic>EloHL</italic><sup><italic>Δ1</italic></sup> transheterozygotes is apparent by 24 hr and continues until 48 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>).

This contrasts with the almost complete lack of all hydrocarbon synthesis in <italic>Cyp4g1</italic> knockdowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Using a mild desiccation stress (30% RH and 25°C) that does not elevate dehydration in <italic>EloHL</italic> mutants, water loss in larval oenocyte-specific <italic>Cyp4g1</italic> knockdown pupae is nevertheless very pronounced, almost double that of genetic controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Importantly, this excessive water loss is already present at 24 hr APF, three days before adult eclosion and long before adult oenocytes differentiate and synthesize hydrocarbons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Remarkably, the excessive water loss in <italic>Cyp4g1</italic> knockdown pupae at 25°C could be fully rescued by raising the humidity from 30% to 95% RH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). The stronger pupal dehydration phenotype of <italic>Cyp4g1</italic> compared to <italic>EloHL</italic>, together with our biochemical analyses, strongly suggests that L and HL hydrocarbons both contribute to the pupal desiccation barrier. Nevertheless, loss of the HL class alone in <italic>EloHL</italic> mutants is enough to compromise barrier efficiency in high temperature and/or arid environments.</p><p id="P17">The results thus far raise important questions about the anatomical location of the pupal hydrocarbon barrier to desiccation. Multiple cuticles with barrier functions are synthesized during insect development and, in holometabolous insects like <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there are three cuticles present during metamorphosis i.e from pupariation until adult eclosion. From external to internal, these are the third-instar (L3) larval cuticle, which hardens to form the puparium (external pupal case), the much thinner and more flexible pupal cuticle that envelopes the forming adult, and the adult cuticle itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). The puparium persists throughout metamorphosis but we were unable to detect significant hydrocarbons on its external surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, although there are HL hydrocarbons on the surface of the adult cuticle in newly eclosed flies, this structure does not form until ~36 hr APF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>], long after the onset of excessive pupal dehydration in <italic>EloHL</italic> mutants and <italic>Cyp4g1</italic> knockdowns. However, the pupal cuticle forms at ~12 hr APF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>], early enough to participate in the pupal desiccation barrier. Dissected pupal cuticles were therefore analysed at 48 hr APF for the presence of hydrocarbons using cryogenic time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging (cryoTOF-SIMS), a surface-specific analytical technique that we previously optimised for adult cuticular hydrocarbons. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>] Hydrocarbons on the pupal cuticle were largely absent from the internal surface but were detected in abundance on the external surface, ranging from C29 to C41 HL hydrocarbons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D-5F</xref>). In summary, we have identified a unisex hydrocarbon barrier to desiccation during <italic>Drosophila</italic> metamorphosis and shown that it is synthesised by <italic>EloHL</italic> in larval oenocytes, stored in the larval fat body, and then mobilized to the external surface of the pupal cuticle.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">This <italic>Drosophila</italic> study fills a gap in our understanding of how holometabolous insects cope with the threat of dehydration during metamorphosis. It identifies the cell source, chemical basis, mechanism of synthesis, and anatomical location of a lipid barrier specialized for a developmental stage particularly vulnerable to water loss. The pupal lipid barrier we identify differs from its adult counterpart in four important ways. First, it is synthesized by larval oenocytes, a separate cell population from the adult oenocytes that produce the lipid barrier of the imago. Second, it is stored in the larval fat body until required at the pupal stage. Third, it is comprised of unisex hydrocarbons with longer average carbon chain lengths than the sex-specific hydrocarbons of the adult. And fourth, its anatomical location is on the exterior surface of the pupal cuticle, a separate structure from the adult cuticle. We now discuss how separate hydrocarbon barriers are synthesized during development and adulthood, and how their evolution may be shaped by distinct selective pressures on desiccation resistance and pheromonal signalling.</p><sec id="S9"><title>Larval and adult oenocytes synthesize different hydrocarbon barriers</title><p id="P19">Despite their shared name, larval and adult oenocytes are different cells with distinct developmental origins and functions.

It also provides the first unifying evidence that both types of oenocytes make hydrocarbon lipid barriers, albeit chemically distinct ones. Larval oenocytes synthesize the hyper-long hydrocarbons of the pupal and immature adult cuticle, whereas adult oenocytes make the sex-specific shorter hydrocarbons of the mature adult cuticle. Both cell types utilize Cyp4g1 for hydrocarbon biosynthesis but, in contrast to previous interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], we find that it is the larval not the adult oenocytes that require <italic>Cyp4g1</italic> to make the hydrocarbon barrier relevant for survival at adult eclosion.</p><p id="P20">Both larval and adult oenocytes express the same terminal biosynthetic enzyme for hydrocarbons, Cyp4g1 (Ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]), but the different chain length ranges they produce appear to be specified by distinct fatty acid elongases. Hence, unisex <italic>EloHL</italic> expression in larval oenocytes enables them to produce hydrocarbons longer than C27, which are critical for an optimum pupal desiccation barrier. Larval oenocytes also express another gene (<italic>CG6660</italic>) encoding an elongase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>] but it is not yet clear whether or not this also contributes to the synthesis of hyper-long hydrocarbons. Adult oenocytes on the other hand express a range of sex-biased elongases, including female-specific <italic>EloF</italic>, which produces shorter (up to C29) blends of hydrocarbons with dual barrier and pheromonal functions. Interestingly, we found that <italic>EloHL</italic> is not only expressed in a unisex pattern in larval oenocytes but also redeployed in a sex-specific manner in adult oenocytes to synthesis long female pheromones such as 7,11-nonacosadiene (C29:2). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>]</p><p id="P21">A key finding of this study is that larvae synthesize hyper-long hydrocarbons but do not transport them to the cuticular surface. Instead, hyper-long hydrocarbons are stored internally, within the larval fat body. This is one of very few larval tissues that does not undergo histolysis during metamorphosis, persisting through to the sexually immature adult. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>] Larval oenocytes, in contrast, histolyse at the midpupal stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>] and so cannot supply hydrocarbons to the pupal or early adult cuticles during the remainder of metamorphosis. The persistence of the larval fat body is therefore able to ensure an internal store of barrier hydrocarbons throughout metamorphosis, bridging the developmental gap between the larval and adult oenocyte sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Our study shows that larval-oenocyte derived hyper-long hydrocarbons are required for the desiccation barrier of the pupal cuticle. Nevertheless, other cuticular components may also contribute and it is very likely that non-cuticular mechanisms of water homeostasis also play significant roles during metamorphosis.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Specialized lipid barriers for distinct life stages and ecological niches</title><p id="P22"><italic>Drosophila</italic> and other holometabolous insects undergo dramatic morphological and physiological changes during their life course, often in correlation with changes in their ecological niche.

In contrast, the pupa occupies a drier terrestrial niche and it is coated with unisex hydrocarbons that are hyper-long. Physicochemical and biological studies of insect hydrocarbons indicate that longer chain lengths and higher proportions of methyl-branched and linear alkanes promote lower volatility and higher desiccation resistance. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] Hyper-long hydrocarbons of the pupal lipid barrier are therefore likely to have evolved to minimize water loss but presumably they are not volatile enough to function well as olfactory pheromones at temperate climate. The adult flies of <italic>Drosophila</italic> species that communicate using sex-specific olfactory pheromones therefore need to transition to shorter more volatile hydrocarbons.

Relative humidity was measured using an RH probe, and high RH levels (~95%) were achieved by adding wet tissues to the bottom of the pipette tip boxes. The weight of the tube plus pupa was measured every 24 hours after pupariation. (2) Tubes with pupae were transferred to a PCR machine with different temperatures set as constant incubation (25-29°C). Relative humidity was not controlled but measured, varying between 15-20%. The weight of the tube plus pupa was measured every 24 hours after pupariation. After 72 hours APF or when the pupa turned dark, the tubes with pupae were dried at 60°C overnight, and the weight of the tube plus pupa was measured again. The pupal wet weight was calculated by subtracting the empty tube weight from the ‘tube + pupa’ weight. The pupal dry weight was calculated by subtracting the empty tube weight from the dried ‘tube + pupa’ weight, and the pupal water content was calculated by subtracting the pupal dry weight from wet weight.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>cryoTOF-SIMS surface analysis</title><p id="P33">Pupae were collected from the side of the vial at 48 hours post-pupariation. The pupae were stripped of their larval cuticles by attaching them to double-sided tape and removing the cuticles with forceps. The pupae were then transferred to PBS, and a small incision was made at the anterior end, the pupal cuticle was cut longitudinally, and internal tissues were removed. The pupal cuticles were then washed twice with PBS and twice with 150 mM ammonium formate. ITO-coated glass coverslips (SPI Supplies #6462-AB, 18 mm<sup>2</sup>, resistivity 70-100 Ω) were cut to size with a diamond knife, and the pupal cuticles were mounted with either the internal or external surface facing upwards.</p><p id="P34">ToF-SIMS measurements were performed on a ToF-SIMS V instrument (IONTOF, GmbH) as previously described by Newell <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>] Samples on the ITO-coated glass slides were mounted on a cooling stage. The loadlock was flooded with nitrogen gas before cooling during pump-down. During the analysis, the sample was cooled with a copper cooling finger to approximately -110ºC. Analyses were conducted using a 30 keV Bi3+ analysis beam with a spot size of approximately 1 μm and a current of 0.04 pA at a cycle time of 200 μs. Secondary ions were extracted with an extraction voltage of 1 kV, with delayed extraction mode activated. For measurements used to generate graphs, data was obtained from a field of view of 250 x 250 μm at a resolution of 128 x 128 pixels. The measurements shown are a sum of 20 scans. To compensate for sample charging, a flood gun was applied during analysis with an energy of 21 eV and a current of -10 μA. The total ion dose was approximately 8.18 x 10<sup>7</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>. The mass resolution of the resulting spectra was approximately 5,000 at m/z 200. Spectral mass calibration was performed with reference to the known ions [C]+, [CH]+, [CH2]+, and [CH3]+. For measurements used to plot mass spectra, a total of 50 scans were acquired, with a total ion dose of approximately 2.05 x 10<sup>8</sup> ions/cm<sup>2</sup>. For the quantification shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>, the [M]<sup>+.</sup> ion from hydrocarbons ranging in length from C29-C37 were summed. For these hydrocarbons, presence and positive identification has been confirmed in pupal samples with GC-MS.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Homologous Gene Identification and Evolutionary Analysis</title><p id="P35">To identify all fatty acid elongases across species, we performed TBLASTN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>] to search against the reference genomes of each species (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) using the protein sequences of the fatty acid elongases gene group from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (FBgg0000965) as queries, with a cutoff e-value of 1×10<sup>-5</sup>.

Hydrocarbons with a carbon length between C21-27 are defined as hydrocarbons (HCs) and C29-31 as hyper-long HCs (HL-HCs). A transition from unisex hyper-long (HL-HCs) to long sex-specific (L-HCs) hydrocarbon profiles occurs between 6-24 hr after adult eclosion.

Cuticular hydrocarbons (HCs) are absent from the surface of the larval cuticle. However, unisex hyper-long HCs (HL-HCs) are synthesized in larval oenocytes through the action of the fatty acid elongase EloHL and the cytochrome P450 enzyme Cyp4g1. These HL-HCs are then stored in the larval fat body, a tissue that does not undergo histolysis during metamorphosis. During the early pupal stage, the former larval cuticle hardens to form a rigid pupal case, while a softer pupal cuticle begins to form underneath it approximately 10 hours after puparium formation. At this point, HL-HCs are transported from the fat body - and possibly from oenocytes - to the surface of the pupal cuticle. Notably, larval oenocytes are among the last tissues to undergo histolysis during the late pupal stage, coinciding with the synthesis of the adult cuticle. The HL-HCs, which likely originate from the fat body store, are then transferred to the surface of the adult cuticle as oenocytes have already histolyzed by this stage. In mature adult stages, adult oenocytes synthesize sex-specific cuticular hydrocarbons by expressing sex-specific elongases, such as the female-specific EloF and EloHL, along with the Cyp4g1 enzyme. The transport of cuticular hydrocarbons to the surface of the adult cuticle may occur either directly from oenocytes or via the fat body, although this mechanism has not yet been fully investigated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199395-f006"/></fig></floats-group></article>
