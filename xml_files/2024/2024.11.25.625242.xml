The threat posed by unrepaired SSBs to human health is exemplified by the existence of hereditary disorders in which genes encoding proteins that facilitate DNA single-strand break repair are mutated, and typically which are associated with neurodevelopmental dysfunction and/or neurodegeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. One such disorder is spinocerebellar ataxia autosomal recessive 26 (SCAR26), which results from mutations in <italic>XRCC1</italic>; a gene encoding a scaffold protein that plays a central role in DNA single-strand base repair <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. PARP1, a protein that detects and is activated by SSBs, recruits XRCC1 to SSB sites where it negatively regulates PARP1 to prevent excessive binding and activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The latter leads to excessive depletion of the NAD+ cofactor and metabolic dysfunction, and/or to toxic levels of poly(ADP-ribose)product. The importance of this relationship is illustrated by the observation that <italic>Parp1</italic> deletion suppresses the cerebellar defects and seizures in mice with <italic>Xrcc1</italic> deletion in brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. To what extent this relationship is reflected in other animal species is unclear, however. Here, we have examined the impact of <italic>xrcc1</italic> and/or <italic>parp1</italic> depletion in zebrafish, and we show that <italic>parp1</italic> knockdown rescues the cerebellar defects observed in <italic>xrcc1</italic> mutant larvae.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P3">To characterize contributions of <italic>xrcc1</italic> to neural development we generated G0 <italic>xrcc1</italic> crispants. Co-injection of multiple highly efficient guide RNAs (gRNAs) can generate zebrafish G0 animals with biallelic mutations (crispants) that reproduce phenotypes in stable mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. As a first step to generating <italic>xrcc1</italic> crispants, we injected a set of four guide RNAs that each targeted a different early exon of <italic>xrcc1</italic> to assess the cutting efficiency of each. gRNA-t1 and gRNA-t2 depleted the wildtype peak to less than 50% of the total product (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, in subsequent experiments we co-injected gRNA-t1 and gRNA-t2 to generate <italic>xrcc1</italic> crispants. To minimize the possibility of off-target mutations, we also tested an independent set of guide RNAs that had no sequence overlap with gRNA-t1 or gRNA-t2, and identified two additional highly efficient gRNAs (gRNA-t5 and gRNA-t6; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>). We then focused on phenotypes that were present both in gRNA-t1/2 and gRNA-t5/6 crispants.</p><p id="P4">Xrcc1 crispants appeared normal during the first week of development, including inflating swimbladders at around 4 dpf (days post-fertilization) and beginning to swim freely. We measured balance, sensory responsiveness to auditory and visual cues, movement kinematics and sensorimotor integration, but did not detect any significant changes in behavior in 6 dpf larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, <italic>xrcc1</italic> knockout zebrafish show grossly normal development at early larval stages.</p><p id="P5">Loss of <italic>xrcc1</italic> is expected to lead to an accumulation of single-strand breaks, triggering expression of DNA-damage response genes such as p53 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. We performed RNA-seq on crispants and controls from RNA isolated from head tissue to assess differentially expressed genes in crispants. In gRNA-t1/2 crispants, 125 genes were significantly changed and 842 in gRNA-t5/6 crispants. Of these 31 genes appeared in both lists, with the change occurring in the same direction, a highly significant convergence (Fisher Exact test p=1.9x10<sup>-14</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). All but three of these overlapping genes were upregulated, and unexpectedly, 25 were lens proteins (including 18 crystallins). Expression of <italic>xrcc1</italic> itself was significantly reduced, possibly reflecting nonsense-mediated decay of truncated transcripts. Importantly, p53 was elevated in both experiments, indicating that crispants reproduce a key <italic>xrcc1</italic> phenotype seen in mammalian models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Next, we employed brain morphometry to assess whether crispants showed changes in brain architecture or composition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. To do so, we co-injected gRNA-t1 and gRNA-t2 into triple transgenic fish in which all neurons were labeled with mCardinal (mCar), glutamatergic neurons labeled with GFP and GABAergic neurons labeled with RFP. After whole-brain confocal imaging of GFP, RFP and mCar in 6 dpf larvae, we performed elastic registration of each image stack to an annotated zebrafish brain atlas, allowing us to compare the fluorescence intensity in controls and mutants at each voxel, as well as in atlas-defined brain divisions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. In addition, we used the inverse of the transformation matrix generated during registration to apply the atlas annotations to the original brain scans, allowing us to measure the volume of each brain, its divisions and individual voxels. Crispants showed no reproducible change in overall brain volume and no changes in either the mean fluorescence intensity or volume of any brain division (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>). However, when comparing maps of voxel volume (i.e., where individual voxels had to be dilated or compressed to match the reference brain), we noticed that there was a strong bilaterally symmetric localized reduction in voxel volume in part of the cerebellum in crispants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The affected region was in a lateral part of the cerebellar plate (LCeP), immediately above the cerebellar commissure that separates the cerebellum from the prepontine tegmentum. To determine whether this phenotype was reproducible, we made a mask from the affected region in gRNA-t1/2 crispants, and measured its volume in a second experiment using gRNA-t5/6. The same subregion of the cerebellar plate was significantly reduced (t-test, p = 0.0043; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), confirming that knock-down of <italic>xrcc1</italic> leads to a cerebellar phenotype in larval zebrafish.</p><p id="P7">To more precisely localize the hypotrophic area, we performed a two-way ANOVA on each voxel in samples from the two experiments controlling for main effects of experiment and genotype, then filtered the resultant p-value map to exclude small clusters and voxels that were not bilaterally symmetric. In a 3D projection it was apparent that the area that was reduced in size in crispants extended dorsally from the LCeP and rostrally into the caudal aspect of the optic tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Using the Zebrafish Brain Browser (ZBB) atlas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, we examined previously registered transgenic lines and in situ hybridization images to characterize the most strongly affected region (black outline in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Intriguingly, this region was in an area containing a relatively low signal for mature neuronal somas (<italic>elavl3:nls-GFP</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>), but that also lacked expression of a marker of neuronal progenitors (<italic>sox2</italic>). There was partial overlap with <italic>neurod:GFP</italic> and <italic>zic2a</italic>, markers of granule cells and granule cell progenitors respectively. However, the strongest overlap was with <italic>en1b</italic>, a gene that in mouse promotes the differentiation and survival of multiple cerebellar neuron subtypes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">In cultured mammalian cells lacking XRCC1, the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase PARP1 becomes trapped on chromosomes during DNA base excision repair leading to repair failure and cell death. Accordingly, depletion or deletion of PARP1 can rescue DNA damage sensitivity in XRCC1 mutant cell lines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. We therefore examined whether the cerebellar phenotype in <italic>xrcc1</italic> crispants was rescued if we simultaneously depleted <italic>parp1</italic>. We tested several gRNAs against <italic>parp1</italic> and identified four guides that were especially efficient at cutting their target sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4</xref>). We first checked for brain phenotypes in <italic>parp1</italic> crispants, again performing two experiments, each with two non-overlapping guide RNAs. We did not detect changes in the fluorescence intensity of the transgenic reporters, or size of any brain division, or local changes in brain volume in <italic>parp1</italic> crispants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 5</xref>). Importantly, the LCeP that was contracted in <italic>xrcc1</italic> crispants was unchanged in <italic>parp1</italic> crispants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Next, we tested the effect of simultaneously targeting <italic>xrcc1</italic> and <italic>parp1</italic>, compared to controls and to <italic>xrcc1</italic> alone. An ANOVA test confirmed that the volume of the LCeP was strongly affected by experimental condition (F<sub>2,39</sub> = 5.98, p = 0.005). Post hoc comparisons confirmed that – as expected – the volume was smaller in <italic>xrcc1</italic> crispants than in controls. However, in double <italic>xrcc1, parp1</italic> crispants, the LCeP was significantly larger than in <italic>xrcc1</italic> crispants and in fact similar in size to controls, thus confirming that <italic>parp1</italic> deletion rescues cerebellar plate hypotrophy in <italic>xrcc1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P9">Defects in DNA single-strand break repair are associated with at least six neurodevelopmental and/or neurodegenerative disorders, one of which is caused by mutations in the central SSB repair scaffold protein, XRCC1. This disease, denoted spinocerebellar ataxia autosomal recessive 26 (SCAR26), is associated with progressive cerebellar degeneration and ataxia. Intriguingly, patient-derived cells from SCAR26 exhibit hyperactivity of the SSB sensor protein PARP1, a phenotype that is recapitulated in other human cell and mouse models of Xrcc1-defective disease. Here, we show that like Xrcc1-defective mice, <italic>xrcc1</italic> mutant zebrafish exhibit cerebellar defects, and that these defects are rescued by additional depletion of <italic>parp1</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In particular, we show here that knockdown of <italic>parp1</italic> during zebrafish development rescues localized hypotrophy in a lateral part of the cerebellar plate in <italic>xrcc1</italic> mutant fish. This discovery is consistent with previous work showing that a key role of mammalian XRCC1 is to suppress toxic PARP1 hyperactivity during base excision repair <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. These data support the idea that inhibitors of Parp activity, which are currently employed in the clinic to treat certain types of breast and ovarian cancer, might potentially be repurposed for the treatment of Xrcc1-defective neurological disease.</p><p id="P10">An unexpected finding from RNA sequencing experiments was that a large number of lens proteins were upregulated in <italic>xrcc1</italic> crispants. Most of these were crystallins, many of which are related to heat-shock proteins and could be acting as stress-related chaperones. However, we also noted elevated expression of <italic>lctla</italic> (<italic>lactase-like a</italic>) and <italic>calpain 3a</italic>, enzymes that are expressed in the lens but not obviously related to chaperone activity. It is interesting to note that lens proteins are subject to relatively high levels of oxidative stress, which is one of the major sources of SSBs to which XRCC1-dependent repair is a response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, one of the protein partners of human XRCC1 is acyl peptide hydrolase/oxidized protein hydrolase, an enzyme implicated in the degradation of oxidized proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. It is thus tempting to speculate that the upregulation of crystallins detected here is a response to the reduced ability of <italic>xrcc1</italic>-depleted fish to respond to protein oxidation.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Zebrafish husbandry</title><p id="P11">Experimental procedures were approved by the NICHD Animal Care and Use Committee (21-007).

To measure the efficiency of guide RNAs we performed CRISPRstat <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Briefly, CRISPRstat involves amplifying the genomic DNA surrounding each target site using fluorescently tagged primers, then using capillary electrophoresis to assess the spectrum of product sizes. In control embryos, the PCR product is almost entirely present in a single peak, whereas efficient gRNAs generate such a high rate of insertion-deletions that the wildtype peak is extinguished and replaced with a range of product sizes.

We used the Dark Flash test to assess visual responsiveness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In this assay, larvae respond to a sudden loss of illumination by executing a specific ‘O-bend’ maneuver. After adapting 7 dpf larvae to an illumination level of 500 µW/cm<sup>2</sup>, we presented larvae with a pseudorandom sequence of reductions in light intensity to either 150 µW/cm<sup>2</sup> (dim flash) or to 0 µW/cm<sup>2</sup> (dark flash) and recorded the next 800 ms of movement with a high speed camera (1000 Hz). Stimuli were separated by 1 minute to avoid habituation. To assess auditory responsiveness and sensorimotor gating, we used a digital-to-analog card (PCI-6221; National Instruments) to generate 2 ms duration waveforms, delivered to larvae using a minishaker (4810, Bruel and Kjaer) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.

The weak stimulus was 10% of the intensity of the strong stimulus, which had been calibrated so that larvae responded with a short-latency C-start on around 50% of trials. Responses to the weak and strong stimuli in isolation measured auditory responsiveness. Prepulse inhibition (at 50 and 500 ms) was measured using the double-stimulus trials. For habituation, we compared mean percent responsiveness to strong stimulus trials in the first half of the assay to mean responsiveness in the second half of the assay.

Dotted line marks the upper boundary of the cerebellar commissure (cec) that separates the cerebellar plate (CeP) from the prepontine tegmentum (Tg). At this level, CeP is positioned ventrally to the midbrain optic tectum (TeO). B. Volume (as percentage of total brain volume) of the affected part of the lateral cerebellar plate (LCeP) in second experiment using gRNAs-t5/6. N = 14 controls, 17 crispants. C. 3D projection from the Zebrafish Brain Browser superimposing on a brain model, the location of voxels that during brain registration, had to be inflated more in crispants than in controls (indicating areas that were smaller in the crispants). D. Coronal section (same plane as in A), through map of p-values for changes in voxel volume in <italic>xrcc1</italic> crispants derived from combining gRNA-t1/2 and gRNA-t5/6 experiments using ANOVA at each voxel. Color scale indicates -log<sub>10</sub>(p-value). p-values greater than 0.01 removed. Red square shows region shown in E. Black outline in right cerebellum corresponds to outlines in E. E. Characterization of the affected area by comparison to expression in transgenic lines elavl3:nls-GFP (marking neuronal somas) and neurod:GFP, and hybridization chain reaction (HCR) fluorescent in situ images for sox2, zic2a and en1b.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201279-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Rescue of <italic>xrcc1</italic> crispant cerebellar phenotype by <italic>parp1</italic> deletion</title><p>A.
