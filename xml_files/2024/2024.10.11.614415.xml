Diseases of the GI tract affect millions worldwide and as such there are now over 25 published single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets surveying the GI tract, profiling specific anatomical regions, cell lineages, ages and diseases. To consolidate these efforts, we harmonised and integrated scRNAseq datasets across the whole GI tract from developing and adult human tissues, as well as newly generated data from preterm gut. We uniformly processed 385 samples from 189 healthy controls using a newly developed automated QC approach (scAutoQC). In total, our healthy reference contains ~1.1 million cells which we annotated to a total of 137 fine-grained cell states. We anchor 13 published and 1 unpublished GI disease datasets covering gastric and colorectal (CRC) cancers, celiac disease, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) to this reference, taking our atlas to a total of 1.6 million cells. We provide our atlas as a valuable resource to the community (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gutcellatlas.org">gutcellatlas.org</ext-link>). Using this resource, we discover epithelial cell metaplasia arising from stem cells across intestinal inflammatory diseases (celiac, UC and CD) and CRC with transcriptional similarity to cells of the gastric and Brunner’s glands. Whilst previously linked to mucosal healing, we now implicate these cells in inflammation through recruitment of immune cells including T cells and neutrophils, and through direct interactions with T cells. Overall, we discover a shift in paradigm whereby changes in stem cells during inflammation lead to altered mucosal tissue architecture, which in turn contributes to ongoing inflammation. These findings highlight that in addition to barrier function, epithelial cells actively contribute to progression of inflammation which may be a function applicable to other tissues and diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a complex system comprising several organs that work together to efficiently absorb nutrients, while simultaneously providing an immunologically active barrier. Diseases of the GI tract are prevalent; ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) affect over 7 million people worldwide, and 2 million new colorectal cancer (CRC) cases are diagnosed annually<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Recently, the field of single cell transcriptomics has revolutionised our understanding of GI health, development, and disease, offering unprecedented molecular insights<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Over 25 single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) studies of the human GI tract have been published to date, with most primarily focused on profiling individual organs or specific upper (e.g., oesophagus, stomach) and lower (e.g., small and large intestine) GI regions. The integration of these publicly available datasets not only serves as a valuable resource for the Human Cell Atlas community and beyond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, but also enables seamless cross-regional comparisons of intestinal cell types.</p><p id="P3">The epithelial cells that line the lumen of the GI tract develop from a common endoderm progenitor and acquire their regional identity early in embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In some cases, this regional identity can be altered in adulthood and lead to metaplasia, where mature tissue is replaced by cells normally occurring in other anatomical regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Cross-regional comparison from single cell data is especially relevant for metaplasia, enabling the direct comparison between healthy cells and their metaplastic counterparts. Intestinal metaplasia is well described in the stomach and in Barrett’s oesophagus patients, where the mucosa is transformed to intestinal epithelial cells, and is associated with increased risk of gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, stomach-like metaplasia of intestinal cells is less well characterised. These lineages have been assigned various names including pyloric metaplasia, pseudopyloric metaplasia, gastric metaplasia, ulcer-associated cell lineage (UACL), and spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM), and mostly studied using histology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The prevailing hypothesis is that these metaplastic lineages may be part of the mucosal healing process in the epithelial layer and may also transition to neoplastic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, the origin and functional role of metaplastic cells in both acute and chronic tissue damage remains unresolved.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we assemble a healthy reference GI tract atlas, carefully curating and integrating 23 publicly available scRNAseq datasets from both developing and adult human GI tissues, as well as 2 unpublished datasets from preterm and adult gut. Using this atlas as a healthy reference, we anchor 13 publically available and 1 unpublished GI disease datasets to resolve cell type features across disease sets. In total, our atlas integrates and harmonises data from 271 donors across health, development and disease, resulting in 1.6 million cells which we annotate to 137 fine-grained cell types. We provide this atlas as a resource to the community, and use it to interrogate cell types and signatures in inflammatory intestinal diseases.</p><p id="P5">Analysing cell types in scRNAseq disease data across the GI tract, we discover the presence of two distinct populations representing pyloric-type metaplastic cells in the terminal ileum of pediatric and adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and the duodenum of celiac disease patients. Using our reference to deconvolute bulk-RNA-sequencing data, we identify the presence of these cells across multiple studies of IBD and CRC. Here, we show that these metaplastic lineages arise from stem cells in inflamed tissues, and retain stem-like characteristics. These cells have transcriptional features resembling <italic>MUC6</italic>+ mucous gland neck cells and <italic>MUC5AC</italic>+ surface foveolar cell types of the healthy stomach, and to some extent duodenal Brunner’s gland cells. However, in inflammatory intestinal diseases we find that <italic>MUC6</italic>-expressing cells can be distinguished by expression of inflammatory programs such as upregulated MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II and immune cell-recruiting chemokines. Our in-depth analysis suggests that this metaplastic cell type, which we termed INFLAREs (<underline>Infla</underline>mmatory <underline>e</underline>pithelial cell<underline>s</underline>), interact with CD4+ T cells and recruit monocytes, dendritic cells and neutrophils to the site of damage <italic>via</italic> interaction with activated vascular endothelial cells. Thus, we propose a shift in epithelial stem cells which alters the differentiation pathway from healthy to metaplastic lineages and in turn contributes to ongoing inflammation in chronic disease settings.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Pan-gastrointestinal data integration</title><p id="P6">We curated, integrated and harmonised healthy cells across the GI tract profiled by scRNA-seq data from 23 published and 2 unpublished datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data 1a, b</xref>). Tissues covered in the atlas broadly include the oral mucosa, oesophagus, stomach, small and large intestines and mesenteric lymph nodes. We harmonised metadata from each study including age, sex, fine-grained anatomical region, sampling methods such as sequencing technology, cell and tissue fraction enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). To reduce batch effects from different genome references, sequence alignment and quality control (QC) methods, we remapped raw data and processed gene counts uniformly through a newly developed automated QC pipeline (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">2</xref>). Our pipeline (scAutoQC) removes the reliance on manual thresholds with low quality cells/droplets identified by taking into account 8 standard metrics (such as mitochondrial and ribosomal genes) in a reduced QC metric space. Cells/droplets are filtered out if present within a cluster that fails QC according to thresholds set by Gaussian Mixture modelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data 2a</xref>). A major advantage of our approach is the calculation of thresholds using multiple QC metrics per cell, exploiting both the distribution of individual metrics as well as correlations between them, allowing retention of cells with unique features such as plasma cells which have lower numbers of expressed genes. After initial filtering, we removed 596,449 (31.22%) low quality cells which were present within failed QC clusters and cells from samples where &lt; 10% of cells passed QC. Next, we removed a further 67,846 cells predicted as doublets by scrublet, with further manual doublet removal after integration and cell type annotation.

Similar to our approach in the healthy dataset, we started from the raw data, remapped and applied the scAutoQC approach to the disease data. This ensured that the healthy and disease references are comparable. To annotate the disease data, we first used the healthy reference to predict broad lineages using scANVI and scArches.</p><p id="P13">We found an apparent reduction in epithelial cell numbers in disease compared to healthy datasets, which could be due to epithelial damage and/or focus on immune cells in many studies of disease. Since we were specifically interested in identifying metaplastic cells, we added new epithelial data by incorporating count matrices from a large recently published study of CD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and unpublished data from celiac disease. In total we added ~500,000 cells to our atlas, bringing the total number to 1.6 million cells across 27 studies and 271 donors. To annotate cells at fine-grained resolution, we used scANVI and scArches, projecting disease data onto our subclustered, lineage- and region-specific views of the atlas (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">4</xref>). Overall, we successfully annotated disease cells using this approach, with the exception of a population of gastric cancer cells with high uncertainty metric which are likely cancer cells. We also observed a distinct cluster of cells in large intestinal epithelium that were originally labelled as a mixture of goblet cells and doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data 4c, e-j</xref>).

In the healthy reference, this population included cells from gingival mucosa, with marker genes involved in collagen and matrix deposition (<italic>CTHRC1, COL12A1, COL1A1, COL5A2, CSTK</italic>). Compared with healthy counterparts, disease-associated oral mucosa-like fibroblasts overexpressed marker genes of inflammatory/activated fibroblasts reported in UC and CD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, using CellTypist models from published studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, oral mucosa fibroblasts were predicted as inflammatory/activated fibroblast populations. Hence we refer to this cell population from disease samples as inflammatory fibroblasts. Hierarchical clustering of oral mucosa/Inflammatory fibroblasts across locations distinguished cells from gingiva/periodontium but not buccal mucosa, potentially reflecting unique microbiome and disease susceptibilities of gingival mucosa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in disease-associated inflammatory fibroblasts vs healthy oral mucosa fibroblasts, DEGs were enriched for various inflammatory pathways (KEGG IL-17 signalling pathway, MSigDB Hallmark Interferon gamma response, MSigDB Hallmark inflammatory response), supporting an immune-mediated role of this population in the lower GI tract during disease. In periodontitis, gingival mucosa fibroblasts also upregulate inflammatory genes, particularly those involved in recruiting neutrophils (<italic>CXCL1, 2, 5 and 8</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. This oral mucosa fibroblast state, which is homeostatic in healthy gingival mucosa, may be primed to promote inflammation and resolve infection. Gingival mucosa is particularly vulnerable to damage and infection, as the first point of contact for commensals and pathogens entering the GI tract, and due to injury exposure through mastication. Thus, the existence of a readily primed fibroblast state in homeostasis may facilitate rapid infection and healing responses. In the intestines, this population does not exist in homeostasis and only arises in severe inflammatory environments, perhaps similar to inflammation of the gingival mucosa. Understanding the regulation of inflammatory gene expression programs in this fibroblast population, especially in gingival mucosa, could give clues for novel therapeutic strategies to target fibroblasts in IBD.</p><p id="P15">To identify populations that are consistently enriched in disease, we applied differential abundance method Milo on integrated healthy and disease datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

In addition, we performed deconvolution on TCGA data from colon adenocarcinomas and bulk RNAseq datasets from celiac disease.

While some elevation in MHC-II expression was seen in other epithelial cell types in disease samples, including metaplastic surface foveolar and <italic>LGR5</italic>+ stem cells, this was markedly increased in INFLAREs compared with MGN cells in healthy tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended data 8g</xref>). In support of the role of IFNγ signalling, we observed increased gene expression in IFNγ signalling and the IFNγ receptor to MHC-II pathways in INFLAREs from inflamed tissue compared with neighbouring inflamed and healthy tissues, which correlated with the levels of MHC-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d, f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended data 8e, g, m</xref>).

Although these cells were rare in single cell data, gastric mucous/pyloric gland metaplasia is estimated to be present in ~40% of IBD patients. We hypothesised that these metaplastic lineages arise due to inflammatory shifts in intestinal stem cells, leading to altered cell trajectories and transformation of healthy tissue. In addition to the previously hypothesised role in mucosal healing we find that metaplastic cells, specifically INFLAREs, may additionally contribute to ongoing inflammation through recruitment and interaction with T cells and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5h</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">Cells across the GI tract play a vital role in nutrient uptake and immunity, and diseases affecting this system have a significant global burden. Despite the prevalence of GI diseases, there is still much to uncover about the shared and tissue specific cell types in health and the cellular and molecular changes in GI disease. To address this gap in knowledge, we curated and integrated single cell datasets covering the whole human GI tract. In contrast with other recent integration efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, we uniformly processed raw data through our bioinformatics workflow including automated QC (scAutoQC), which is of use to future single cell studies and integration efforts. This approach removed processing-related batch effects and uncovered rare cell types that might otherwise be excluded by conventional QC approaches. In total, we integrated 1.6 million cells from 271 donors and 27 studies across health, development and disease which we provide as a resource to the community and interrogate in order to further understand IBD in cellular and molecular detail.</p><p id="P30">We identified regional differences in health and disease and highlighted various metaplastic cell lineages that lost their regional identity in chronic disease. In the large intestine of IBD patients, we identified Paneth cells, a known metaplastic lineage in colonic inflammatory settings. In our healthy atlas, we identified multiple tissue-specific fibroblast populations, including fibroblasts specific to oral mucosa which had transcriptional similarity to inflammatory fibroblast populations previously characterised in IBD. Therefore, metaplasia may not be confined to epithelial cell types but may occur in other lineages such as fibroblasts. Inflammatory fibroblasts are associated with ongoing inflammation, tissue damage and therapeutic resistance in IBD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. We propose that oral mucosa fibroblasts exist in a primed cell state which can be readily activated in response to inflammation such as the inflammatory fibroblast populations in gingival mucosa during periodontitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Understanding this process may give insights into how intestinal fibroblasts transition to an inflammatory state in IBD and importantly, how this can be halted or reversed.</p><p id="P31">We identified two distinct metaplastic lineages expressing <italic>MUC6</italic> and <italic>MUC5AC</italic> at single cell resolution in inflammatory intestinal disease, resembling cells in healthy stomach mucous glands and duodenal Brunner’s glands.

Aberrant mucin expression and gastric mucous/pyloric gland metaplasia in CD patients has been reported extensively from histology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> and is emerging in transcriptional studies. Here, we identify and interrogate gastric mucous/pyloric gland metaplasia at the single cell level, with full transcriptional resolution. Importantly, we highlight distinguishing features of metaplastic cells from their healthy counterparts in the stomach and duodenum and define epithelial transformation both in stem cells and mature, differentiated cells across intestinal inflammatory diseases.</p><p id="P32">Our observations suggest a paradigm shift, where metaplasia arises due to a change in adult stem cell identity and potential. Recent studies investigating intestinal metaplasia in oesophagus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and stomach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, propose that metaplastic lineages emerge from altered undifferentiated stem cells. In the ileum of IBD patients, we propose a similar transformation following mucosal injury in the small intestine, whereby the intestinal stem cells transform to LEFTY1+ stem cells and differentiate to stomach-like gland cells. We provide multiple orthogonal lines of evidence for stem cell and proliferative features in INFLAREs using cNMF, trajectory analysis and imaging.</p><p id="P33">Although difficult to dissect the exact origins of altered stem cell dynamics, it is possible that inflammatory signalling in <italic>LGR5</italic>+ stem cells drives intestinal tissue transformation. Inflammatory driven alterations have been identified in stem cells across tissues including neural and hematopoietic stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. Differentiation trajectories of intestinal organoids from mice are skewed by T helper responses (Th1, 2, 17) where, for example, Th1 responses increased Paneth and goblet cell differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. During sustained inflammation, stem cells may be unable to re-enter homeostasis, and differentiation could be further skewed towards metaplastic lineages. Indeed, <italic>ex vivo</italic> colonic organoids cultured from UC patients suggest permanent changes in stem cells with increased expression of anti-microbial and gastric associated genes compared to healthy controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>.

Thus, epithelial transformation such as gastric mucous/pyloric gland metaplasia, may be a direct consequence of lasting changes within stem cells and their trajectories in response to chronic inflammation.</p><p id="P34">Previous observations suggest that gastric mucous gland metaplasia plays a role in epithelial wound healing and barrier repair after mucosal injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Our results build on these observations and propose a role of INFLAREs in chemokine-mediated immune cell recruitment and antigen presentation. Increased expression of MHC-II on intestinal epithelial cells in IBD patients has been previously described, along with the ability of epithelial cells to stimulate CD4+ T cells in an MHC-II dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. We propose that INFLAREs recruit and similarly interact directly with CD4+ T cells under inflammatory conditions. In addition, INFLAREs can recruit neutrophils, similar to inflammatory fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>, using a cellular circuit likely aided by the close association with <italic>ACKR1</italic>+ vessels found in our data. In support of a disease promoting role, many genes expressed by INFLAREs have been implicated in GWAS studies of IBD, including chemokines <italic>CXCL1/2/3/5</italic> and <italic>JAK2/IFNGR2/STAT1</italic>, involved in IFNγ signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>.

Each lineage was split, and reintegrated with scVI (scVI settings) to annotate cells at fine resolution (annotation level 3). Mesenchymal populations were further split by developmental age group (first trimester fetal, second trimester fetal/preterm and adult/pediatric). Epithelial cells were further split by GI region and/or developmental age group (oral all ages, oesophagus all ages, stomach all ages, small intestine first trimester fetal, small intestine second trimester fetal/preterm, small intestine adult/pediatric, large intestine first trimester, large intestine second trimester fetal/preterm, large intestine adult/pediatric). For fine-grained annotations of objects by broad compartment (and age/region if applicable), a combined approach including automated annotation with leiden clustering and marker gene analysis was used. Celltypist predicted labels were calculated for the entire core atlas using various relevant models (Cells_Intestinal_Tract v2 - Elmentaite 2021, Immune_All_Low v2 - Dominguez Conde 2022 and Pan_Fetal_Human v2 - Suo 2022) and custom label transfer models from Martin 2019 (intestinal dataset), Warner 2020 (salivary gland dataset). Notebooks for all annotations are available via our GitHub. MGN cells (MUC6+) in the healthy reference in small intestine were identified in healthy duodenum with leiden clustering resolution 0.5, and further refined to remove any residual doublets or MUC6- cells by subclustering.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Disease data projection and label prediction</title><p id="P54">Models for disease projection were made on the full healthy reference dataset (without doublets) using scANVI incorporating broad (level 1) annotations, based on the healthy reference scVI model. We projected disease data using scArches with the scANVI model. To annotate at fine resolution, we first predicted broad (level 1) lineages in the projected disease data using a label transfer method based on majority voting from kNN. Broad lineages were then split as for the healthy reference. For all lineages except epithelial, lineage specific disease cells were projected onto the respective healthy reference lineage specific latent space and fine-grained annotations predicted using the same method as for broad lineage predictions. Due to an underrepresentation of epithelial cells, we added additional epithelial cell data from celiac disease duodenum (unpublished data from Klenerman lab - Fitzpatrick2023) and CD ileum and colon <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, increasing the amount of diseased epithelial cells from 57,406 to 92,342 cells plus an additional 219,472 cells from healthy controls/non-inflammed tissue. These additional datasets were not remapped, instead these studies were added based on the raw counts matrix. Split epithelial cells from the original disease set (remapped data) and the additional disease sets (from count matrices) were concatenated and reduced to a common gene set of 18,485 genes. The resulting epithelial dataset was further split by region (stomach, small intestine and large intestine), prepared for projection using scANVI_prepare_anndata function (fills 0s for non-overlapping genes) and projected onto the respective healthy reference epithelial region specific latent space embeddings.</p><p id="P55">To refine level 3 annotations on disease cells, we utilised scArches weighted kNN uncertainty metric. We labelled cells as unknown if they had an ‘uncertainty score’ greater than the 90th quantile for each lineage. For epithelial cells the 90th quantile was calculated separately for cells from cancer and non-cancer to account for high uncertainty labelling of tumour cells. To refine the labels of these unknown cells, we performed leiden clustering (resolution = 1) and reassigned the label based on both majority voting of the higher certainty cells (above the cut off) and marker genes. In stomach epithelium, there was one cluster of unknown cells, likely to be cancer cells, which could not be assigned a label and was therefore left annotated as unknown. In large intestine epithelium we found a cluster which corresponded to metaplastic Paneth cells (a cell type not present in the healthy reference) which were reannotated based on the distinct marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Quantitation of technical and biological variation</title><p id="P56">To determine the contribution of different metadata covariates to the integrated embedding of the healthy reference data, we performed linear regression for each latent component of the embedding with each covariate as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>.

To limit unwanted batch and technical effects, samples were preprocessed by downsampling to 200 cells per cell type per donor and removing ribosomal and mitochondrial related genes. For Gene set analysis, the output from Scanpy rank gene groups was filtered to contain genes with a minimum log fold change of 0.25 and p-value cut off of 0.05.

Interaction analysis was performed on remapped data, to avoid loss of genes/interactions lost when merging additional count matrices (See Disease data projection and label prediction for more detail). Before analysis, data was preprocessed by downsampling to 50 cells per cell type per donor.

We used the default processing and normalisation of cNMF, which considers 2,000 highly variable genes along with 100 iterations of NMF. All other parameters were set at default values. We tested hyperparameter values of K, the number of factors, ranging in steps of 1 from 5-80 and picked on inspection a favourable tradeoff between factor stability and overall model error at K=44. For determining consensus clusters we excluded 6% of fitted cNMF spectra with a mean distance to k-nearest neighbours above 0.3. The resulting per-cell gene program usage was compared across fine-grained cell annotations, identifying gene programs corresponding to the identity of Mucous_gland_neck cells and other relevant cell types (Goblet, Stem and Surface foveolar cells).</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Trajectory analysis</title><p id="P61">To infer the developmental trajectory giving rise to MGN/INFLARE cells in the ileum IBD we used monocle3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup> on a subset of data containing cells in the ileum from Jaeger2021 (GSE157477), Martin2019 (GSE134809) and Kong2023 (SCP1884). We performed Louvain clustering on the original UMAP representation generated from the scANVI latent space to account for batch effects and inferred developmental trajectories along pseudotime by choosing the node assigned the highest number of epithelial stem cells as the root node. We then extracted the MGN/INFLARE-specific trajectory by selecting the nodes assigned the highest number of MGN/INFLARE cells as the final nodes. Finally, we determined genes whose expression changes along pseudotime by using ‘monocle3::graph_test’, which leverages a Moran’s I test considering gene expression changes within groups of k=25 neighbouring cells on the principle trajectory graph.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Bulk RNA sequencing deconvolution using single cell data</title><p id="P62">For bulk deconvolution analysis, we first downloaded published bulk RNA-seq datasets of adult IBD from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE111889), pediatric IBD from the ArrayExpress database (E-MTAB-5464) and the Expression Atlas (E-GEOD-101794), TCGA colon adenocarcinoma using R package TCGAbiolinks and celiac disease data from GEO (GSE131705 and GSE145358). A single-cell reference for deconvolution analysis was then prepared by subsetting the overall object to only include cells from the small intestine in disease conditions and downsampling to 300 cells for each fine-grained cell type annotation. BayesPrism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> was used for deconvolution analysis with raw counts for both single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data as inputs. Both the ‘cell type labels’ and the ‘cell state labels’ were set to fine-grained annotations. Ribosomal protein genes and mitochondrial genes were removed from single-cell data as they are not informative in distinguishing cell types and can be a source of large spurious variance. We also excluded genes from sex chromosomes and lowly transcribed as recommended by the BayesPrism tutorial. For further analysis, we applied a pairwise t-test to select differentially expressed genes with the ‘pval.max’ being set to 0.05 and ‘lfc.min’ to 0.1. Finally, a prism object containing all data required for running BayesPrism was created using the new.prism() function, and the deconvolution was performed using the run.prism() function. For correlation analysis, we calculated the Pearson correlation between (1) the estimated abundance of INFLAREs and other cell types, and (2) the estimated INFLAREs abundance and gene expression in bulk RNA-seq datasets. For the later calculation, we first normalised raw counts in the expression matrix from each bulk dataset using R package DESeq2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S30" sec-type="extended-data"><title>Extended Data</title><fig id="F6" position="anchor"><label>Extended data 1</label><caption><title>Overview of atlas assembly.</title><p id="P63">a) Detailed flowchart of the methods used to assemble the healthy reference, datasets were remapped and filtered based on scAutoQC automated QC pipeline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), integrated with scVI and annotated as broad lineages.
