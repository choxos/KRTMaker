However, the implementation of PDOs in both these settings has been hampered by several bottlenecks including sample requirements, assay time and handling in the context of high-throughput-based drug assays. We report here the development of a microfluidic-based device (Microfluidic Platform for Organoids culture, MPO) that miniaturises and greatly simplifies PDO cultures in a 384-plate format. Both retrospective and prospective clinical studies demonstrate its predictive value and the swift and straightforward implementation in the clinical setting. Obtaining comprehensive functional and molecular information on the response to drugs is becoming a requirement in drug discovery. MPO allows subcellular phenotypic and imaging screenings, target engagement for the assessment of the efficacy of therapies, alongside the ability to comprehensively and concomitantly define PDOs genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, lipidomic and metabolomic landscape. In all, we demonstrate the potential of our platform to impact clinical practice generating relevant information on drug sensitivity within a time frame that could inform treatment decisions alongside exploration of the mechanisms underlying compound response and resistance in drug discovery efforts.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">Knowing preemptively which therapy may benefit a specific cancer patient represents the most daunting unmet clinical need in oncology. Solving this challenge will provide patients immediate relief from the disease and prevent unwanted toxicities, often severe in the case of cancer therapies. Insofar, the selection of the most appropriate treatment has been largely confined to targeted therapies, relying on the genomic analysis of patient-derived samples. In fact, the availability of therapies directly targeting cancer cells endowed with specific genetic lesions has provided remarkable successes, exemplified by mutations in EGFR in non–small cell lung cancer, BRAF in melanoma, and TRK in various cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. However, several large prospective clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, most prominently the NCI-MATCH trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, have demonstrated a limited response rate in an intention-to-treat analysis for these genomic-based therapies, not reaching 5% of all cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">One potential and enticing opportunity to overcome this sobering clinical reality is the combination of static genomic measurements with the direct testing of large arrays of compounds directly on patient-derived samples, before administering any treatment, that is, the functional precision medicine (FPM) paradigm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. FPM efforts have been proposed several decades ago, whereby attempts have been made to assess the response to treatment directly on patient derived samples. These efforts have been hampered by several technological barriers, including rudimentary <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture methods and low-throughput capabilities, and thus they never entered clinical practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Recent technological breakthroughs have in large part tackled these roadblocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In particular, the PDOs, stem-cell derived self-organized 3D models, closely mimic <italic>in vitro</italic> the complex structure and function of the corresponding healthy or diseased <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue, including cellular heterogeneity, histopathological features and genomic profiles of the corresponding tumour of origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. They can be derived and quickly expanded from the tissues of patients and stored in “living biobanks”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. In the last decade, PDOs have become a central tool for therapeutic screening and precision medicine especially in the cancer field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, overcoming the limitations of standard two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures and even patients derived xenografts (PDX)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Cells grown in monolayer, the primary model for drug screening, are easy and practical but do not reproduce the complexity of a tumour tissue in terms of cellular heterogeneity, gene expression profiles, pathways activity and drug sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. When compared with PDXs, PDOs are easier to work with, less time-consuming, more efficient, less expensive and amenable to high-throughput drug screenings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Notably, a tight correlation between patient and PDOs responses to drugs has been firmly established in several tumour types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, further supporting the role of PDOs as patient avatars that could predict response to therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. These and other studies have demonstrated the feasibility of medium-throughput drug screenings on PDOs, mostly used as retrospective models or to inform patients about second line treatments or adjuvant therapies.</p><p id="P8">One of the major challenges and still unmet goals for organoid research is to use PDOs as prospective models for defining the optimal treatments for cancer patients. Crucial for the effectiveness of this approach is the development of innovative systems to perform high-throughput drug screens that reduce the time between PDO derivation and testing, within a frame that could inform clinical treatment decisions. Miniaturisation can increase the capability of existing bioassays. However, when applied to 3D models as organoids there are constraints that limit their use in high-throughput applications, such as the incorporation of multiple cell types, the heterogeneity in size, volume and density, and the embedding in ECM to support 3D architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The manipulation of the most commonly used extracellular matrix substitutes for organoids culturing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> is challenging due to their non-Newtonian rheology and thermosensitive behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. These characteristics limit their compatibility with the liquid-handling robots commonly used in HTS assays, which are designed to fill 384 and 1,536 well plates. Additionally, cell distribution homogeneity and reproducible cell seeding, key parameters for robust HTS-based approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, are challenging when seeding small multicellular structures as organoids, particularly prone to sedimentation. Several culturing systems have been described that try to overcome limitations imposed by ECM embedding. In these protocols, suspensions of organoids in medium containing a small percentage of ECM are dispensed by liquid-handling robots onto the microwell plates coated with the preferred matrix on top of which organoids grow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. These procedures, while rendering organoids culture more practical for HTS-based assays, present limitations that do not fully recapitulate the best organoids culturing conditions and are only suitable for short term assays.</p><p id="P9">Other technological advancements pertain to the field of microfluidics, which has now reached a level of maturity whereby the simultaneous high-throughput screening of hundreds of compounds and combinations on patient samples is within reach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In this scenario, 3D-microfluidic culture systems might offer a rapid and cost-effective solution to the aforementioned needs through advanced strategies for cell seeding, compartmentalization, continuous flow, mechanical and biochemical stimuli administration, and single-cell analyses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">Efforts are ongoing to complement traditional functional assays of cell viability, such as those based on intracellular enzyme activity or ATP, with methods that faithfully assess the cellular phenotypes emerging from exposure to drugs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. As a matter of fact, oftentimes effective therapeutic compounds do not elicit extensive cell death, nor select for genetic subclones, but exert more subtle and yet impactful dynamic phenotypic responses.</p><p id="P11">Another major challenge for potential treatment guidance is the development of robust readouts that integrate drug response features with proteogenomic profiling of PDOs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. For such a readout, instruments are required to enable the recovery and handling of individual samples, preserving their integrity. Traditional microfluidics is based on irreversibly sealed microchips, where constructs have to be labour-intensively seeded and harvested through microchannels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. A recent trend shows a new generation of openable/resealable systems that on one side simplify the handling of biological samples but on the other increase the technical complexity of the system operations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">Here, we propose a microfluidic based-device (MPO) to miniaturise organoids culture in ECM. Extensive validation of the platform has been performed by exploiting a biobank of genomically and clinically annotated PDOs generated from tissue resections of colorectal cancers liver metastasis (mCRC) exposed to combinations of drugs reproducing the chemotherapeutic regimens used for treating this condition. The platform allows integrative multi-omics analysis and high-content imaging studies in PDOs-based HTS applications. The reduction in the reagents needed to perform drug screening enabled the determination of basic response parameters within a few weeks of organoids derivation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>MPO allows the concomitant seeding and culturing of hundreds of PDOs</title><p id="P13">We have developed a platform based on a microfluidic approach, <underline>M</underline>icrofluidic <underline>P</underline>latform for <underline>O</underline>rganoids culture (MPO) which enables high-throughput seeding, culturing in a miniaturized format and drug testing of PDOs. MPO combines some basic microfluidic strategies and 3D printing approaches with the standards of a laboratory of cell biology (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Materials and Methods</xref>). MPO includes a custom dispenser, named BMdrop (Biological Matrices drop dispenser)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>) that allows the rapid and automated seeding of organoids embedded in extracellular matrices. Microsamples of organoids are seeded in 3D printed custom structures named NESTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>). These structures allow the immobilization of the organoids in single 3D culture units that, when dipped in the culture medium in a 384-well plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), could be preserved for extended periods of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Moreover, this configuration enables the handling of each 3D culture unit as a single sample in downstream applications as proteo-genomic and high-content imaging-based assays.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>MPO in the clinical setting</title><p id="P14">The pre-emptive identification of the optimal treatment remains the crucial unmet clinical need in oncology. The time required to obtain PDOs from patient samples still remains a critical issue for the implementation of PDO technology in the clinical arena<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. For example, in the SENSOR trial, the average time for development of PDOs from metastatic colon cancer samples was 10 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. We hence designed a prospective clinical study whose primary goal was the definition of the time needed after surgery to obtain and test PDOs in the MPO. We surmised that the small amount of material required by the MPO may shorten the time needed to obtain these data. The study lasted 18 months from April 2023 to October 2024, a total of 66 tumour samples were collected from 61 patients undergoing surgical resections of metastatic colo-rectal cancer to the liver (mCRC) and from whom 37 PDOs were derived. The success rate of tumour PDOs generation was highly dependent on the quality and size of resections, proportion of cancer cells and cell proliferation rate, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. For 26 PDOs out of 37 the average time to establish enough organoids for performing an initial drug testing was less than 4 weeks, with several integrated into the platform and screened as early as one week after surgery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We also sought to determine the predictive value of the MPO. To properly address this question, we first had to define the threshold discriminating between sensitive versus resistant PDOs. To this end, we added to the prospective study PDOs a second retrospective cohort, for a total of 52 PDOs, exposed to treatment in the MPO for 96h, when drug effects were quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). PDOs were seeded into the platform and exposed to a combination of drugs reproducing two chemotherapeutic regimens commonly used as first-line treatments for patients with mCRC, namely FOLFOX (FOX) and FOLFIRI (FIRI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. In order to maintain patient-relevant concentrations, each chemotherapeutic combination was used at two concentrations, the maximum clinically achievable plasma concentration (Cmax) reported for each drug (FOX2 and FIRI2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> and 10-fold lower (FOX1 and FIRI1). This strategy ensured the exposure of PDOs at a range of drug concentrations that are relevant to those observed in the clinical practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Independent assays demonstrated the robustness and reproducibility of the MPO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), also when compared with the conventional 96-well microplate setting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Clustering based on the sensitivity to lower concentrations separated PDOs into sensitive or resistant, with the threshold distinguishing the two groups set at 40% viability relative to the untreated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Of note, most of the PDOs were either sensitive or resistant to both treatments although there were two exceptions: PDO#63 which was more sensitive to FOLFIRI and PDO#163, which was more sensitive to FOLFOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We hence relied on this threshold to determine the predictive value of MPO in a subset of patients exposed to postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. These patients were treated with combinations of 5-FU and oxaliplatin or 5-FU and irinotecan regimens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>). In a 24-months follow-up study, we observed a significant correlation between <italic>in vitro</italic> PDOs response and disease free survival (DFS)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), with a median DFS of 24 and 7 months in patients from whom sensitive and resistant PDOs were respectively derived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P17">These data suggest robust predictive capabilities of the MPO for FOLFOX and FOLFIRI chemotherapy and emphasise the strong potential of the MPO as a tool for anticipating clinical responses to a vast array of drugs thus guiding treatment decisions.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>High-content imaging of PDOs cultured in MPO</title><p id="P18">Imaging-based screening methods generate accurate measurements of multiple cellular features across conditions allowing phenotypic analyses, efficacy studies, and target localization, providing crucial information on cellular states and transitions arising from treatments. As such, this approach is relevant both for assessing the clinical response to drugs, and in HTS to obtain more reliable information on compound effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. We hence tested whether imaging-based approaches could be applied also to MPO. Mindful of the challenges that cells grown on a 3D system may broach for reliable collection of images, when compared with cells on 2D systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, we modified the grid architecture, elongating the NEST support, to position the surface of the matrix embedding PDOs closer to the bottom of the wells, to reduce the working distance and allow the visualisation of the PDOs by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We next assayed quantitative immunofluorescence.

Similarly to what is observed in 2D cell cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, after stimulation with the NF-KB activator TNFα, we were able to detect the shuttling of mScarlet-p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus as early as 1 hour after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5C</xref>).

Cell Painting has emerged as one of the most prominent unbiased, quantitative, high-dimensional profiling techniques, leveraging on six fluorescent dyes to comprehensively describe eight subcellular components or organelles, including nuclei (Hoechst 33342 Nuclear stain), nucleoli (Nucleic Acid staining), cytoskeleton (Phalloidin), mitochondria (Mitochondrial Stain), Endoplasmic Reticulum (Concanavalin A), and the Golgi apparatus (Wheat Germ Agglutinin [WGA])<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. We adjusted the 2D Cell Painting protocol to stain and image the 3D structures directly embedded in matrices (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Materials and Methods</xref>). We were able to identify in the PDOs grown in MPO all the subcellular organelles usually detected by Cell Painting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5D</xref>). We attempted also to visualize the entire 3D structures, reconstructing the spatial organization of the PDOs, with the representation of the subcellular compartments and the relationships between them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5E</xref>).</p><p id="P22">In all, these results demonstrate that MPO is amenable to multiparameter imaging-based phenotypic profiling that complements traditional functional assays to provide a complete picture of cellular events that may reveal hidden vulnerabilities triggered by exposure to drugs.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Genomic and transcriptomic definition of PDOs cultured in the MPO</title><p id="P23">Despite the limitations listed above, the definition of the genetic lesions affecting a cancer, and the identification of mutated or translocated proteins, remain the mainstay of personalized medicine. Importantly, several reports have highlighted how mutated genes are not necessarily expressed in the corresponding cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, suggesting that it is imperative to determine not only the mutational status of a gene, but also whether it is expressed, to guide the selection of the most appropriate targeted therapies to administer to patients. We thus sought to define both the genetic landscape and the expression profiles of the PDOs grown in the MPO. To obtain from the same PDOs both DNA and mRNA information, we selected and adapted the G&amp;T-seq protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>, which provides parallel sequencing of genomic DNA and mRNA. Low-pass whole genome sequencing (WGS) of PDOs grown and treated into the MPO revealed a high degree of overlap of the copy number variants (CNV) profiles between untreated PDOs grown on the platform and on those derived from a 24-well plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). In line with the known distinction of colorectal cancer patients, PDO#62, a microsatellite instable tumor (MSI) showed minimal if any copy number variations, while PDO#74 and PDO#61, microsatellite stable (MSS), showed chromosomal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>).

We hence explored whether it is possible to measure target engagement also in the MPO miniaturized setting. To this end, we adapted to the MPO the HTRF (Homogeneous Time Resolved Fluorescence)-based protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, which combines fluorescence resonance energy transfer technology (FRET) with time-resolved measurement (TR) MPO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6A</xref>). We selected PDOs presenting mutations in the KRAS gene, and exposed them to the pan KRAS inhibitor BI-2865<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. To assess target engagement, we assayed the phosphorylation status of ERK, a direct target of RAS, alongside ERK total levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). HTRF adapted to MPO demonstrated that BI-2865 strongly inhibited ERK phosphorylation in the treated samples without affecting ERK total levels. In parallel, we also asked whether BI-2865 was able to inhibit other kinases, namely AKT, whose activity is under the control of RAS in some cellular settings. BI-2865 indeed mildly decreased pAKT levels, without impacting on AKT total levels. In parallel, we assessed the activity of the specific PIK3CA inhibitor alpelisib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. As expected, alpelisib did not suppress ERK signalling but reduced AKT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), without any effect on the total protein levels of ERK and AKT. A conventional western blot analysis of the same PDOs grown and treated in standard assay conditions confirmed MAPK and PI3K pathways modulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7A and B</xref>) as seen in HTRF-based assays.</p><p id="P26">In all, these results demonstrate how MPO could be used for high-throughput measurements of target engagement.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>High-throughput proteomic, metabolomic and lipidomic analyses on PDOs treated in the MPO</title><p id="P27">It is becoming increasingly evident that a thorough assessment of the activity of a compound entails a comprehensive understanding not only of the genomic and transcriptomic modifications induced by a drug, but importantly refined measurements of the proteome, the metabolome and the lipidome profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. The main obstacle to the widespread adoption of these analyses rests on the requirement for mass spectrometry-based approaches of sizable amounts of starting material. We hence explored whether PDOs grown within the MPO could be leveraged for these analyses.</p><p id="P28">We first asked whether the few microliters of PDOs present in each NESTpillar may provide enough material to perform proteomic, metabolomics and lipidomics analyses. To this end, we performed a simultaneous MS-based multiomic profiling. Notably, for each NEST pillar we obtained an average of 1,200 proteins, 32 polar metabolites and 123 lipids (data not shown).</p><p id="P29">We next explored whether proteomic analysis might provide insights on the response of PDOs to treatment. We exposed one PDO (#61) to the chemotherapy regimens described above. We retrieved 2,061 proteins as differentially expressed between samples (0.1% FDR). PCA and clustering including all samples revealed that treated and non-treated samples were neatly separated. Intriguingly, samples treated with either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI at high dosage clustered together, while samples exposed to lower concentrations for each regimen were separated in the PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). We thus embarked to define the set of proteins altered by high dosage exposure. To this end, 379 proteins were collectively modulated by the higher drug concentration, with 56 proteins in common between the two treatments. By performing STRING interaction enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>), we found that the top 6 KEGG pathways ranked by strength of interaction were Mismatch repair, spliceosome, Arginine and Proline metabolism, RNA transport, Glutathione metabolism and central carbon metabolism in cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p><p id="P30">We next explored which proteomic changes were instead induced by the exposure of PDOs to low dosages. The proteins emerging as differentially present between controls and lower FOLFIRI concentration included proteins belonging to intracellular membrane-bounded organelle, serine biosynthesis and NAD metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 8A-D</xref>). In this context, key targets involved in serine biosynthesis such as PSAT1 and PHGDH were identified and found generally reduced in the FOLFIRI treated group. Additionally, other key proteins such as Aldehyde dehydrogenases ALDH1B1 were part of the network. In the case of FOLFOX at low doses, central carbon metabolism in cancer, RNA transport and negative mRNA regulation of metabolic processes related proteins were affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 8E-H</xref>).</p><p id="P31">As for the lipidomic analysis, we were able to annotate and quantify 123 lipids belonging to 11 lipid subclasses. Treatments reduced all lipid classes detected, independently from the concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>), with FOLFOX reducing lipid biosynthesis more than FOLFIRI. We then performed an in-silico functional lipidomics analysis to evaluate potential routes of lipid biosynthesis hampered by each treatment. FOLFOX treatment appeared to halt the synthesis of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) from lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) and phosphatidylinositols (PIs). This effect may stem from an indirect influence on phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which plays a crucial role in PC remodeling. Consequently, the inhibition of PLA2 activity could reduce PC turnover and limit its recycling into signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9a</xref>). When considering lipid building blocks, we noticed an overall extension of fatty acid chain length from C16 to C18, coupled with the inhibition of monounsaturated C18:1 fatty acid biosynthesis, that suggests alterations in the activity of key enzymes involved in fatty acid elongation (ELOVL) and desaturation (SCD). On the other hand, FOLFIRI treatment affected the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine (PEs) to PCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SupplementaryFigure 9b</xref>). Overall the lipidomics profiling suggests a membrane lipid breakdown as result of oxidative damage and more broadly a stress-adaptive mechanism to cope with chemotherapy treatment.</p><p id="P32">Polar metabolome profiling resulted in 32 metabolites annotated with MSI level = 2 or =1 when an authentic standard was available. While this number is low it should be underlined that within the same pillar, three different biomolecules were simultaneously extracted, which is challenging for the very low volume and cell number available. Nevertheless, important metabolites such as lactate, succinate, choline, serine, different acylcarnitines and free fatty acids were profiled. Their trend with the treatment is reported in the hierarchical clustering reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 10</xref>, which indicates that FOLFOX and FOLFIRI elicit a different metabolome perturbation.</p><p id="P33">In all, these results demonstrate that the MPO, combining drug sensitivity assays performed on PDOs with proteomic studies, allows for better ex vivo modelling of drug responses.

While the standard practice for 3D cell culture privileges lab handwork and 48 or 96-plate format culturing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>, we designed and validated a system that combines 3D printing, microfluidics, and biological lab standards to build a fast, affordable, versatile, and robust drug screening platform on PDOs in 384-plate.</p><p id="P35">There are several key features of the MPO, which we propose as innovative, including the seeding of organoids already embedded in ECM, the use of 3D printed biocompatible material for 3D culture and the straightforward integration of MPO into laboratory standards. This approach hence greatly simplifies the execution of survival, phenotypic and omic screenings, as well as of high-content imaging. Specifically, the NESTs culture setting, allowing a swift replacement of the culture medium and retrieval of the PDOs, overcomes limitations that restrict the scalability towards HTS by most of the emerging devices in microfluidic and organ-on-a-chip field. It targets a standardisation of the method, as advocated by the Focus Group Organ-on-Chip Standardization Roadmap CEN/CENELEC FGOoC. The design strategy tailored around 3D printing allows a fast scalability (even of NEST microstructures) to afford HTS and a wide pre-clinical research validation. The seeding process, as a result of the combination of BMdrop and NESTs, overcomes a current limitation of the standard in bioprinting Matrigel, directly delivering organoids embedded in Matrigel, and distributing them homogeneously among the NESTs culture units. BMdrop and NESTs are optimized are designed to be tunable to fit different protocols, as they could be utilized with different dilutions or grades of ECM, different drop volumes, and include different populations or densities of cells. The dispenser BMdrop is then a compact and low-complexity instrumentation, provided by Standard Operation Procedures documentation. All these conditions pave the way for a possible use in both small or well-equipped laboratories and to support the introduction of PDOs into the clinical practice.</p><p id="P36">All together, these novel approaches herald a new, preemptive, “try-it-all” era that promises to deliver more effective and less toxic treatments for cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. Indeed, alongside several ongoing studies based on FPM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, a few functional clinical trials have already been implemented with remarkable successes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>, even obtaining exceptional responses in heavily pretreated patients (EXALT trial; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>). Other studies are ushering new enticing paths, integrating ex-vivo screenings (as for the FPM paradigm) alongside extensive, in depth, multi-omic tumor profiling and clinical data, to predict patient responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P37">In the clinical trial setting, the dosing and schedule of treatments is almost always empirical, hampering efforts to test and validate more innovative therapeutic schemes such as adaptive and metronomic approaches. Additionally, identifying the most effective combination therapy in the clinical setting is challenging. A large study involving over 1,000 PDX has revealed that fewer than 5% of combinations improved progression-free survival more effectively than the best monotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. While the success of combination therapies in cancer treatment has been well-documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>, much of this success has been attributed to the “bet-hedging” paradigm of independent drug action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>, which posits that a single drug within a combination is primarily responsible for cancer cell killing in each specific patient. Beside bet-hedging, the potential of synthetic lethal and additive or synergistic drug combinations has also been firmly established in the clinic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>. Examples include the use of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutated cancers, the combination of BRAF and EGFR inhibitors in <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutant colon cancer and collateral lethality through co-deletions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup> or co-amplifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>. While many promising combinations have been identified <italic>in vitro</italic>, their clinical translation has been hampered by two primary factors: reliance on inadequately predictive preclinical models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> – and the dependency on overly sensitive cell lines that inflate the perceived impact of additivity or synergistic interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. MPO is poised to address these critical medical needs, identifying the most effective compounds, at the proper concentration, maximizing efficacy while preventing unnecessary toxicities. Specifically for targeted therapies, MPO allows to gauge target engagement across a broader concentration range beyond the commonly used IC50<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>, addressing the so-called Drug-Dosing Conundrum in Oncology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref></sup> and aligning with initiatives like the FDA Project Optimus. More broadly, in the setting of phase I and phase II clinical trials, the availability of multi-layered data from each PDOs will assist towards the definition of biologically efficacious dose (BED), leveraging on “effect markers”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P38">The introduction of targeted therapies has heralded a new era in cancer treatment, but also posed new challenges. For cytotoxic therapies, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), while variable across patients, has nonetheless provided a useful benchmark to define the dose to be used during the clinical trial phase and then in the clinical practice. Targeted therapies often do not exhibit dose limiting doses. Thus, the MTD is often difficult to attain and may not guide the definition of the dose to be implemented in the clinic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>. Various strategies have been implemented, which include target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD), with the clearance of the drug used as a proxy; measurements of downstream effects, again prone to approximations, such as IL2 levels in the bloodstream over a 2,000-fold dose range of Pembrolizumab, and others. In all, these methods provide only an approximation of the optimal dose to be used and often correspond to an incomplete target engagement, with suboptimal responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. Therefore, with these therapies, for the single patient, undertreatment is very frequent, but at times also overtreatment, leading to toxicity-driven early discontinuation, where lower doses could instead be highly effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. Measuring the impact of a targeted compound directly on its target could provide a robust, reliable, assessment of its effectiveness on the tumour of a specific patient.</p><p id="P39">Phenotypic screenings are enticing, as they are poised to provide critical and complementary information to conventional genomic assessments (ref Letai). Unbiased approaches such as Cell Painting seem to be especially apt to high-throughput screenings as they do not require extensive sample processing nor of course preemptive knowledge of proteins and targets to be assessed with specific antibodies. However, obtaining reliable images for high-throughput phenotypic screenings from 3D structures like PDOs has proven challenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. We demonstrate that the Cell Painting protocol could be adapted to PDOs, obtaining selective stainings without evident differences from the existing findings.

The “BMdrop dispenser” includes a pump, to dispense controlled volumes of samples, connected to a custom-made cartridge. Organoids resuspended in PBS are mixed to the biological matrix and the resulting solution is preloaded into the cartridge equipped with an iced core to prevent gelation. The pump allows the extrusion of microfluidic drops of the organoids suspension then seeded into individual nests organized in grids. <bold>B</bold>. Grids are overturned and positioned in a 384-well plate, where each nest is dipped in the culture medium of a single well. The panel on the left shows a grid with the NESTs filled with the suspension of organoids before the culture; in the middle panel, the grid is positioned inside the plate; the right panel shows a 384-well plate filled with 8 grids for a total of 288 single NESTs. <bold>C-D</bold>. a PDO was cultured in the MPO and viability evaluated at different timepoints by CellTiter-Glo assay (C) and bright-field imaging analysis (D).

A panel of 52 PDOs lines were seeded in the 3D culture platform and exposed to a combination of drugs that replicated two chemotherapeutic regimens commonly used to treat patients with mCRC. Two concentrations were used, one highest (FOx2 and FIRI2) based on the Cmax reported for each drug and one 10–fold lower (FOx1 and FIRI1). The heatmap summarizes the sensitivities to the chemotherapeutic combination regimens reported as the mean percentage of viable cells in treated relative to untreated control samples averaged from a minimum of two independent experiments, each performed in six technical replicates per condition. The range of responses among the different organoids allowed their separation into two major groups: sensitive and resistant. <bold>B</bold>. A Kaplan-Meier curve of disease-free survival for patients eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy and whose organoids were reported as sensitive or resistant. Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon and Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests were used to determine statistical significance among the two groups of patients.
