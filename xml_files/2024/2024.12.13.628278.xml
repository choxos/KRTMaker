While the acute effects of infections have been documented, their long-term consequences on neurological and behavioral recovery as well as the potential precipitation of seizures after TBI remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the chronic effects of <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> infection following TBI, focusing on post-traumatic seizure development and neurobehavioral changes. Using a mouse model, we assessed the long-term effects of TBI and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infection both in isolation and in combination. We found that, while infection with <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> resulted in loss of body weight and increased mortality compared to vehicle-inoculated mice, there was no additional mortality in TBI animals. Further, although TBI alone induced chronic hyperactivity and reduced anxiety-like behaviors, <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> lung infection had no lasting effect on these long-term outcomes. Thirdly, while TBI resulted in both spontaneous and evoked seizures long-term post-injury, early post-injury <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infection did not affect late onset seizure susceptibility. Together with recent findings on acute outcomes in this combined insult model of TBI and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infection, this study suggests that <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> does not significantly alter long-term neurobehavioral outcomes or the development of post-traumatic epilepsy. This research highlights the need to further explore the interplay between additional immune insults such as infection that may influence long-term recovery.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bacteria</kwd><kwd>pneumonia</kwd><kwd>hospital-acquired infection</kwd><kwd>controlled cortical impact</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>seizures</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Background</title><p id="P2">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of long-term disability worldwide, with many survivors suffering from persistent cognitive, emotional, and physical impairments. Among the most significant acute and subacute complications following severe TBI are hospital-acquired infections, particularly pneumonia, which effects a substantial proportion of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Pneumonia caused by <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, an opportunistic pathogen commonly associated with ventilator-associated infections, is of particular concern due to its role in exacerbating systemic inflammation and respiratory failure, and increasing the risk of mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> In TBI patients, immune dysregulation induced by the injury itself heightens vulnerability to such infections, which can worsen functional outcomes and complicate recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> Several recent studies, including from our group, have investigated the acute consequences of various infection models in the context of TBI and provided important insights into how bacterial infections exacerbate acute post-injury neuroimmune responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> However, there remains a critical gap in understanding how pneumonia following TBI impacts long-term neurological and behavioral outcomes.</p><p id="P3">Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) represents a debilitating long-term complication for survivors of moderate or severe TBI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> Defined as recurrent and unprovoked seizures that occur at least one week after TBI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> PTE can severely impact quality of life and is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline, mood disorders, early-onset neurodegeneration and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> Yet the precise mechanisms that drive the development of epileptogenesis after a brain injury remain elusive. Neuroinflammation, a well-known hallmark of TBI, is thought to play a role, and in this way, an additional immune challenge such as an infection is hypothesized to promote post-traumatic epileptogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup></p><p id="P4">To address this hypothesis, we recently conducted a retrospective cohort study examining a large trauma registry of adults with moderate to severe TBI. Infections were documented for approximately one quarter of TBI patients in the registry, with pneumonia being the most common presentation. By multivariate analysis to adjust for known risk factors, we found a solid association between hospital-acquired infections and the development of PTE at 2 years post-injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> This finding suggests that hospital-acquired infections may contribute to the development of PTE, such that infections represent a modifiable risk factor. However, further exploration of this hypothesis in mouse models have to date failed to produce experimental evidence to support this theory. Specifically, we have evaluated the long-term consequences of peripherally-administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as an infection-like immune challenge, after experimental TBI in mice. In both pediatric and adult contexts, we reported that LPS induced a robust acute immune response yet did not exacerbate the long-term development of post-traumatic seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">While the LPS mouse model has some advantages as a well-established, predictable model of a systemic immune challenge, it fails to recapitulate many of the key features of a live bacterial infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. As such, it is pertinent that experimental models shift towards preferential use of live infectious agents, delivered via clinically-relevant routes, to more appropriately model the complex pathophysiological scenario of a hospital-acquired infection in an individual with severe TBI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> To address this, we recently established a new model of intratracheal inoculation of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> bacteria after experimental TBI in the mouse, and conducted detailed characterization of the acute consequences of this dual insult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> We observed that <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> lung infection after TBI induced a robust yet transient inflammatory response, primarily restricted to the lungs but with some systemic effects, alongside exacerbated elevation of several pro-inflammatory genes such as <italic>Ccl2</italic> in the brain of TBI + <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> mice. However, the potential long-term consequences of these changes were not determined.</p><p id="P6">The current study therefore sought to address this knowledge gap by investigating the chronic consequences of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infection following experimental TBI, with a particular focus on the development of post-traumatic seizures and alterations in neurobehavioral outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Experimental Timeline</title><p id="P7">To determine the long-term effects of lung infection with a TBI, mice were subjected to a moderate-to-severe TBI model (or a sham control surgery), followed by intratracheal inoculation with Vehicle or <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> bacterium at 4 days post-injury. The four experimental groups were Sham-Vehicle, Sham-<italic>Kp</italic>, TBI-Vehicle, and TBI-<italic>Kp</italic>. At approximately 4 months (16 weeks) post-injury, mice underwent extensive behavioral testing over a three-week period. At approximately 4-5 months post-injury, a recording electrode was implanted to allow for subsequent video-EEG monitoring for an average of 10 days per mouse. Finally, all mice received a sub-convulsive dose of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) to evaluate evoked seizure responses, followed by tissue collection at 6 months post-injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Animals and Ethics</title><p id="P8">All animal experiments were conducted with approval from the Alfred Research Alliance Animal Ethics Committee (#P8032) and the Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO) of the US Department of Defense.

Prior to surgery, all animals were given buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg in saline; subcutaneously in the flank) and bupivacaine (1 mg/kg in saline; subcutaneously in the scalp) for pain relief, and 0.5 mL of 0.9% saline was administered at the end of the procedure for hydration. The mice were stabilized in a stereotaxic frame, and a 3.5 mm craniotomy was performed over the exposed left parietal bone. An electronic controlled cortical impactor device (eCCE-6.3; Custom Design and Fabrication Inc., Sandston, VA) was used to deliver an impact with a 3 mm rounded tip, at a speed of 4.5 m/s, to a depth of 1.7 mm for 150 ms. Sham animals underwent the same surgical procedure without the impact. After the CCI or sham surgery, the skin incision was sutured and an antiseptic solution applied.

This experimental design was required due to the specialized facilities required for these procedures. Prior to leaving the Monash Clayton facility, for each of 4 cohorts of mixed-experimental groups, a health screen was performed at 6 weeks post-inoculation by sacrificing and testing a Swiss strain male mouse that was housed alongside the experimental mice and exposed to their bedding weekly. An additional health check was performed at the end of the four-week quarantine period upon arrival at the Alfred Hospital site. This involved the sampling of sera collected from 2-4 experimental animals that had previously had <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infection, via submandibular bleed performed by the animal facility technicians. Health screening was performed by Cerberus Sciences (Scoresby, VIC, Australia) via a standard panel. All cohorts passed the health screening.

Firstly, mice underwent an Open Field (OF) test, in a square arena for 10 min duration, to evaluate general locomotor activity, exploratory behavior and anxiety-like behavior. Anxiety-like behavior was additionally measured using the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) during a 10 min period.

TopScan software was used to monitor the amount of time the experimental mouse spent in each outer chamber. In stage 2, a preference for the chamber with the stimulus mouse over the empty chamber indicated social interest, while in stage 3, a preference for the novel mouse over the familiar mouse demonstrated social recognition or memory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> 2 mice from the TBI-Vehicle group were unable to be analyzed from this test due to aberrant video tracking.</p><p id="P16">Finally, the sucrose preference test was employed to identify potential depressive-like anhedonia in mice. Over a 5-day period, mice had access to two drinking bottles: one with filtered water and the other with a 1% sucrose solution. The positions of the bottles were switched halfway through the experiment. On the first and last day of the test, the volumes of liquid consumed from each bottle were measured, and a sucrose preference ratio was calculated by dividing the volume of sucrose solution consumed by the total volume of liquid consumed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Video Electroencephalography (EEG)</title><p id="P17">To evaluate chronic seizure activity, EEG electrodes were surgically implanted at 18-19 weeks post-injury.

However, <italic>Kp</italic> and Vehicle-treated groups performed similarly, and there were not TBI x infection interactions.

Here, TBI mice spent significantly more relative time in the open arms of the maze compared to Sham groups (2-way ANOVA, F<sub>1,55</sub>=23.79, p&lt;0.0001), indicating a reduction in anxiety-like behavior chronically after injury as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> Infection did not alter this response. In the Rotarod test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>), while all experimental groups demonstrated improvement in performance over time (increased latency to fall from trials 1 to 3), no differences between the groups were observed nor were there any interactions between the factors of TBI, infection or time (3-way RM ANOVA, main effect of time p&lt;0.0001). Similarly, all mice showed a comparable preference for sucrose over water in the Sucrose Preference Test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>), of approximately 70-80%, with no effects of TBI or <italic>Kp</italic> (2-way ANOVA, p&gt;0.05).</p><p id="P27">Finally, the Three-Chamber Social Approach Test was conducted.

Tukey’s post-hoc analyses found that all groups showed a preference for the chamber containing the stimulus animal compared to the empty chamber side, indicating an intact preference for sociability. Lastly, in Stage 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2h</xref>), a main effect of chamber side was detected (F<sub>1,50</sub>=6.06, p=0.0173), as well as a chamber side x TBI interaction (F<sub>1,50</sub>=6.63, p=0.0131). Visually, it appears that Sham-Vehicle and Sham-Kp groups spent more time in the chamber containing the novel stimulus mouse compared to the familiar one, while both TBI groups spent roughly equivalent time in each chamber. However, Tukey’s post-hoc analyses failed to detect any specific differences between chamber sides for any of the experimental groups, rendering this stage difficult to interpret.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Chronic Seizures After TBI and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> Infection</title><p id="P28">Continuous Video-EEG recordings were obtained over an 8-12 day monitoring period per animal at approximately 5 months post-TBI/Sham, to evaluate whether early post-injury <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infection altered the development of PTE.</p><p id="P29">Spontaneous electro-clinical seizure activity was observed in TBI-Vehicle and TBI-<italic>Kp</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a-b</xref>), but none of the sham-operated mice.

In addition, both TBI groups showed a similar response to the PTZ challenge, an indirect measure of seizure susceptibility indicating epileptogenesis.

The study was carefully designed to dissect out specific effects of the combined insult of TBI plus <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> compared to either TBI or infection alone, and is one of few studies to date to consider the long-term consequences of such a paradigm. Detailed seizure monitoring via continuous video-EEG is the gold-standard measure of PTE, and inclusion of both male and female mice allowed for consideration of typical biological variability as well as exploration of potential sex differences in responses to injury and infection. Conversely, the study was limited by lack of longitudinal analysis of seizure development, which could provide additional insight into seizure onset and progression over time. Use of a single infection model, time of administration relative to injury, and host strain/species, also limits the generalizability of the findings to other types of infections or pathogens. Finally, while this study focused on behavioral and seizure outcomes, we did not delve into the biological or molecular mechanisms that underlie these presentations. Future studies may benefit from the complementary inclusion of detailed histological or molecular analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S19" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P39">In conclusion, this study provides important insights into the potential long-term effects of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> infection following moderate-to-severe TBI. We found that a non-trivial <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> lung infection, associated with ~20% mortality, did not affect the chronic TBI-induced neurobehavioral deficits or PTE for the survivors. These findings suggest that while <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> can worsen acute health parameters, its impact on long-term neurological outcomes post-TBI is limited once the infection has been resolved. Further research is needed to further explore potential sex-specific responses to infection, and consider how the timing of infection relative to injury may influence the host’s response. Overall, this work contributes to our growing understanding of how infections influence brain injury outcomes. Given the high incidence of both infections and seizures in TBI patients, and a growing concern over multidrug-resistant pathogens, such research is vital to the medical management of infections in TBI patients and support of optimal long-term outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Monash Animal Research Platform (Clayton and Alfred Precincts) for their assistance with the project.</p><sec id="S21"><title>Funding</title><p>This project was supported by an Epilepsy Research Program Idea Development Award (#W81XWH-19-ERP-IDA) from the US Department of Defense, awarded to BDS, JL and TOB.
