Precise regulation of XPG recruitment and activity during DNA repair is essential to avoid erroneous DNA incisions and genomic instability. In this study, we employed live-cell imaging to investigate how XPG function is regulated during NER, focusing on its dynamic interactions with key factors involved in the pre- and post-incision steps. We found that TFIIH and XPA facilitate the recruitment and association of XPG with DNA damage, and that XPG localizes separately from TFIIH to UV-induced lesions. Furthermore, our results show that XPG’s dissociation from DNA damage is triggered by its own incision activity as well as by that of XPF. Additionally, the exonuclease EXO1 promotes XPG dissociation, likely by processing incised DNA, even in the absence of XPG-mediated incision. Our findings help to better understand the regulatory mechanisms that control XPG activity during NER and provide important insights into the complex dynamics of the repair process.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">DNA damage is a constant threat to cells. It is estimated that cells incur thousands of new DNA lesions every day from external sources, such as UV light from the sun, and from reactive chemicals released during metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Cells rely on the DNA damage response (DDR) to maintain genome integrity. This is an evolutionarily conserved, intricate network of DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, DNA damage signaling, and tolerance mechanisms to cope with DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Disruption of the DDR and inefficient removal of lesions cause genome instability and have disastrous consequences for organisms, leading to genetic diseases, developmental failure, premature aging, and cancer susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P6">XPG/ERCC5 is a major DDR endonuclease and an essential factor in maintaining genome integrity. XPG is best known for its role in nucleotide excision repair (NER), but functions in multiple other genome maintenance mechanisms as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), such as R-loop resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), replication stress and homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), and base excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). XPG harbors two nuclease domains termed N and I, which are separated by a spacer region, two highly conserved domains, i.e., the D1 and D2 boxes, and a PIP box with which it was reported to interact with PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Hereditary mutations in XPG cause an extraordinary broad spectrum of clinical features, associated with rare human disorders such as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and XP with additional Cockayne syndrome features, called Xeroderma pigmentosum Cockayne syndrome (XPCS) complex or (in the more severe form) cerebro-oculofacio-skeletal (COFS) syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). XP is characterized by photosensitivity and pigmentation abnormalities of the skin, and high incidence of skin cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). XPCS and COFS patients display mental retardation, developmental delay, progeria and severe, progressive neurological abnormalities. To understand the pathogenesis of these diseases and why different mutations cause different symptoms, it is important to precisely understand how XPG function is controlled in NER and other DDR pathways.</p><p id="P7">NER is a highly coordinated DNA repair pathway that removes many different types of bulky lesions, such as the UV light-induced cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts, chemotherapy-induced intrastrand crosslinks and ROS-induced cyclopurines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). This versatility relies on its ability to recognize similar helix distortions in DNA inflicted by different types of DNA damage, instead of the lesions themselves. NER detects and removes DNA damage by either one of two subpathways: global genome-NER (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER). GG-NER is initiated by damage detection anywhere in the genome by the coordinated action of DDB2, which is part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4<sup>DDB2</sup>, and XPC, which is part of the trimeric XPC-RAD23B-CETN2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). TC-NER is initiated when damage in the template strand blocks forward movement of RNA polymerase II during transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Stalling of RNA Polymerase II at DNA damage leads to stable binding of the translocase CSB and subsequent recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4<sup>CSA</sup> and the factors STK19 and UVSSA/USP7, involving the RNA Polymerase II-bound ELOF1 protein as well.</p><p id="P8">Damage detection by either subpathway leads to the sequential and cooperative buildup of the core NER incision complex, which is precisely coordinated by multiple protein-protein interactions and posttranslational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). In GG-NER, the 10-subunit complex TFIIH is recruited through interaction of its XPB and p62 subunits with XPC bound to DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). This in turn coincides with DDB2 dissociation and promotes the transition from temporary to stable binding of XPC to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). In TC-NER, TFIIH is recruited and positioned by interactions with UVSSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) and STK19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). TFIIH unwinds and scans the DNA with its helicase XPD and translocase XPB to verify the presence of lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). This TFIIH activity is stimulated by the DNA binding protein XPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Thus, TFIIH recruitment precedes that of XPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), but XPA in turn stabilizes TFIIH association with damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Also, RPA is recruited, which binds to the ssDNA opposite of the damaged strand and interacts with XPA to stabilize its DNA damage binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). The helicase and translocase activities of TFIIH generate a DNA bubble necessary for the ss/dsDNA junction binding and incision activity of endonucleases ERCC1-XPF and XPG. These incise DNA, respectively, 5’ and 3’ of the lesion, leading to removal of the damaged DNA strand. ERCC1-XPF is recruited via an interaction of ERCC1 with XPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), and will only incise DNA in the presence of XPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). While both ERCC1-XPF and XPG are thought to be positioned through an interaction with RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), it is still not entirely clear how XPG recruitment is regulated. Previous immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that XPG can form a stable complex with TFIIH that is able to incise DNA bubble substrates <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), suggesting that XPG already accompanies TFIIH when this complex binds to DNA damage. This model, however, contrasts cellular mobility studies that suggested that XPG diffuses freely through the nucleus without being part of a larger complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Additionally, it is unclear when and how XPG dissociates from DNA damage. Following DNA incision, the HLTF translocase promotes the dissociation of the damaged DNA strand and of several incision complex factors, including XPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Excision assays showed a tight association of XPG and TFIIH with the excised DNA product, suggesting that XPG dissociates simultaneously with TFIIH upon incision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). In apparent contradiction, <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of dual incision of cisplatin-DNA adducts suggested that after DNA incision XPG first promotes the recruitment of downstream DNA replication factors RFC1 and PCNA, together with RPA, to initiate DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) and restore the resulting 22-30 nucleotides DNA gap. Interestingly, this DNA repair synthesis appears to be cell cycle-dependent, as loading of DNA polymerases δ and κ by PCNA is favored in non-S phase cells, while loading of polymerase ε only happens in S phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Moreover, the 5’-3’ exonuclease EXO1 has been suggested to compete with RFC1 and PCNA-mediated DNA repair synthesis, by resecting DNA and generating long ssDNA structures that activate the DNA damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Also, this was reported to be dependent on the cell cycle phase, since recruitment of a fluorescently-tagged EXO1b isoform to UV damage was only observed in non-S phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). It is still ambiguous if and how XPG dissociation is regulated by these post-incision factors and whether the cell cycle plays a role in the crosstalk and coordination between XPG and the post-incision step.</p><p id="P10">To better understand the dynamic activity of XPG during NER, and its function and interplay with other NER factors, here we investigated, by live-cell imaging of endogenous XPG in human cells, how XPG association to and dissociation from DNA damage is organized within the NER incision complex and after incision has taken place. We show that while XPG recruitment depends on TFIIH, XPG is separately recruited to sites of UV damage. Furthermore, XPG dissociation is stimulated by the catalytic activity of XPF, of XPG itself and by EXO1 activity, irrespective of whether XPG itself can incise DNA or not.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell lines, culture conditions and treatments</title><p id="P11">All human osteosarcoma U2OS cells generated and used are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.

To this end, we inserted the fluorescent protein tag mClover (together with the mAID degron tag, which is not used in this study, thus for simplicity we refer to it as XPG-mClover) at the C-terminus of the <italic>XPG/ERCC5</italic> locus in U2OS DIvA cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>) using CRISPR/Cas9. Successful XPG-mClover knock-in (KI) was validated by fluorescence microscopy and by immunoblot, showing clear nuclear localization of XPG-mClover and exclusive expression of the fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Functionality of mClover-tagged XPG was confirmed in a UV colony survival assay, showing that the UV sensitivity of XPG-mClover KI cells was comparable to that of the parental cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P24">To further validate the functionality of mClover-tagged XPG, we tested its recruitment to DNA damage using immunofluorescence after induction of local UV damage (LUD) through a microporous filter. CPD staining was used as a marker of UV damage, as CPDs are slowly repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). 40 min after UV irradiation, we observed clear accumulation of XPG-mClover at UV-induced DNA lesions, which had diminished 2 h after UV due to ongoing repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). Previous similar immunofluorescence studies in patient fibroblasts indicated that stable XPG recruitment depends on functional TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). We confirmed this by showing strongly decreased XPG recruitment to DNA damage after siRNA-mediated depletion of the TFIIH subunit p62 (sip62) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>), 40 min and 2 h after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> dual excision assays suggested that XPA binding to TFIIH and DNA damage is needed for stable assembly of other incision complex factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). Indeed, we found that XPG recruitment to DNA damage was significantly reduced, though not fully impaired, in cells depleted of XPA (siXPA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>).

In FRAP, incomplete fluorescence recovery reflects immobilization of a fraction of the mClover-tagged molecules, which after UV irradiation is indicative of their stable association to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). In cells treated with control siRNA (siCTRL), a significant fraction of XPG-mClover molecules became immobile immediately after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F, G</xref>). However, in cells in which p62 or XPA was depleted this UV-induced immobilized fraction was strongly reduced, indicating that both TFIIH and XPA promote binding of XPG to DNA damage. This FRAP reflects the recruitment and dynamic association of XPG with DNA damage immediately after UV irradiation. Combined with the immunofluorescence experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>), which reflect the steady recruitment 40 min after UV irradiation, these results suggest that TFIIH is essential for recruitment of XPG to DNA damage. XPA, on the other hand, appears not essential for recruitment of XPG per se, but rather promotes its association with DNA damage upon recruitment.</p><p id="P26">XPG was previously reported to form a stable complex with TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). We were therefore interested in testing if indeed XPG diffuses together with TFIIH and whether they bind to sites of DNA damage as a complex or separately. To compare the association of XPG with DNA damage to that of TFIIH, we fused the mClover tag (together with the mAID degron tag, which is not used in this study) to the C-terminus of TFIIH subunit XPD in U2OS cells using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C, D</xref>) and performed FRAP experiments following UV-irradiation. This showed that a significant fraction of XPD-mClover molecules were bound to DNA damage shortly after UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), comparable as observed with XPG-mClover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Because immunofluorescence and FRAP experiments indicated that XPG association to DNA damage is stimulated by XPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D-G</xref>), we further compared XPG and TFIIH association with DNA damage by FRAP after depletion of XPA. In cells depleted of XPA, XPD-mClover showed a slightly smaller UV-dependent immobile fraction than in siCTRL-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). This is similar to what we have previously observed in FRAP experiments with TFIIH subunit XPB in the absence of XPA, and suggests that XPA merely stabilizes the binding of TFIIH to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>), rather than being absolutely required for its recruitment and binding. In contrast, the UV-induced XPG-mClover immobile fraction was much more diminished in XPA-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that the association of TFIIH and XPG with DNA damage differently depends on XPA.</p><p id="P27">To test if the binding of TFIIH and XPG to DNA is indeed different, we used computational modeling to calculate and compare the XPG and XPD assembly and disassembly kinetics based on these FRAP experiments. To this end, we fitted the experimental FRAP curves to simulated curves obtained by Monte Carlo simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>), to obtain average immobile fractions and residence times at DNA damage. Monte Carlo simulation suggested that in non-irradiated conditions, a higher fraction of XPD molecules is bound to chromatin, than XPG molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). This higher immobilized fraction of XPD molecules in undamaged cells reflects the specific activity of TFIIH in transcription initiation, as was previously also found with FRAP on ectopically expressed XPB-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Strikingly, after UV irradiation, XPD and XPG showed similar immobile fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), likely reflecting their simultaneous activity in NER, but dissimilar residence times at DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Following XPA depletion in UV-irradiated cells, only the immobile fraction of XPG molecules was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>), while the residence times of both XPD and XPG at DNA damage were reduced. These simulated data therefore confirm that XPA activity differently affects TFIIH and XPG association with DNA damage. Also, this modeling challenges the idea that XPG localizes to DNA damage as part of a preformed TFIIH-XPG complex</p><p id="P28">To independently confirm that XPG depends more on XPA than does TFIIH, with regard to DNA damage binding, we monitored XPG and TFIIH real-time recruitment to UV-C laser (266 nm)-induced DNA damage in XPA proficient and XPA deficient cells by live cell imaging. As alternative to the U2OS DIvA cells so far used, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock in mClover at the C-terminus of XPG in normal U2OS cells, and subsequently knocked out (KO) XPA in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>). Also, we used previously generated GFP-XPB KI U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>), as alternative to the XPD-mClover KI cells, and knocked out XPA in these cells as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1F</xref>). Both GFP-XPB and XPG-mClover were rapidly recruited to DNA damage in XPA proficient cells, which was diminished in XPA KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G-I</xref>). However, XPA loss had a different and stronger effect on XPG-mClover compared to GFP-XPB, causing mildly diminished GFP-XPB recruitment but severely delayed XPG-mClover recruitment to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). We obtained even more pronounced results in cells treated with siRNA against XPA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1G-I</xref>). These results are consistent with the milder XPA effects on TFIIH binding to DNA damage observed in FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-F</xref>).</p><p id="P29">To discard the possibility that the residual XPG-mClover recruitment observed in XPA KO and siXPA-treated cells is due to the induction of lesions that are not repaired by NER, or due to the generation of R loops, to which XPG may localize, we knocked out XPC in XPG-mClover KI U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>). In the absence of XPC, no accumulation of XPG-mClover at UV-C laser-induced DNA damage was detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1J, K</xref>), demonstrating that XPG-mClover accumulation solely reflects its activity in GG-NER. As comparison, we also generated XPA proficient and XPA KO U2OS cells with TEV-mAID-mClover knocked-in at the C-terminus of XPF (referred to as XPF-mClover) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1L, M</xref>). Like XPG, XPF-mClover was rapidly recruited to laser-induced DNA damage, but this was, in contrast to XPG and TFIIH, completely XPA dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1N, O</xref>), in line with our previous observations and those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). Thus, our UV-C laser accumulation experiments reveal that XPG depends more on XPA than does TFIIH to be recruited to NER lesions. Together, our data therefore indicate that TFIIH and XPG diffuse and localize to UV-induced DNA damage separately. In the absence of XPA, however, XPG is still able to localize to DNA damage, albeit less efficient, in contrast to ERCC1-XPF that is completely dependent on XPA.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>XPG residence time at DNA damage depends on XPF and PCNA</title><p id="P30">Once XPG and ERCC1-XPF are bound to damaged DNA, ERCC1-XPF is thought to first incise DNA 5’ to the lesion, after which XPG incises 3’ of the lesion. Both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> partial DNA synthesis have been observed in the presence of catalytically active ERCC1-XPF but catalytically inactive XPG. This indicates that the 5’ incision is sufficient to initiate DNA repair synthesis, probably by already allowing PCNA and polymerase loading, whereas the 3’ incision is required to complete but not to initiate repair synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). It is still unclear whether XPG dissociates directly upon incision, or whether it might sometimes prematurely dissociate even if there is no incision, and whether it has a role in recruiting downstream factors. One such downstream factor could be PCNA, whose <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction with XPG, via a PIP box motif within XPG, has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). To better understand XPG dissociation, we measured and compared XPG-mClover, XPD-mClover and XPF-mClover residence times at DNA damage by inverse fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (iFRAP) in U2OS cells. To this end, we irradiated cells locally through a microporous filter to induce fluorescent protein accumulation at LUD, after which we monitored the fluorescence decrease in the LUD, while continuously bleaching the fluorescently tagged proteins outside the LUD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p><p id="P31">iFRAP showed that XPG-mClover dissociation is slower than that of XPF-mClover but faster than that of XPD-mClover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Possibly, the TFIIH residence time at DNA lesions is longer than that of XPF and XPG because TFIIH arrives earlier and interacts with multiple NER proteins, including XPC, XPA, XPG and XPF for the assembly of the initiation complex. The faster XPF dissociation, on the other hand, is confirmed by FRAP, which showed that after UV irradiation only a small fraction of XPF-mClover molecules transiently bound to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A and B</xref>). This faster dissociation of XPF-mClover is in line with the idea that ERCC1-XPF cuts before XPG and therefore needs to bind DNA for a shorter time. The longer residence time of XPG at damaged DNA might indicate that XPG arrives before ERCC1-XPF and/or remains longer bound. Possibly, this indicates that XPG, before or after 3’ incision, helps in recruiting other factors, as also previous <italic>in vitro</italic> data have suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Recently, the translocase HLTF was shown to promote the dissociation of TFIIH and XPG after the dual incision by ERCC1-XPF and XPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). To study if the arrival of additional downstream factors affects XPG dissociation <italic>in vivo,</italic> we performed iFRAP after knocking down XPF (siXPF), RFC1 (siRFC1) and PCNA (siPCNA) by siRNA in XPG-mClover cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2C, D and E</xref>). XPG-mClover clearly dissociated slower upon XPF and PCNA depletion, but was unaffected by RFC1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). These results suggest that XPG dissociation depends on XPF-mediated incision, which allows subsequent incision by XPG, and therefore likely promotes its dissociation. Also, these results suggest that XPG dissociation is stimulated by the binding of PCNA, indicating that XPG interacts with PCNA and aids its recruitment after which it dissociates.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>XPG incision of DNA promotes its dissociation</title><p id="P32">To test if XPG’s own catalytic activity is a prerequisite for its dissociation from DNA damage, we generated an XPG catalytically inactive mutant by introducing the E791A point mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) in <italic>XPG</italic> in XPG-mClover KI U2OS cells using CRISPR/Cas9 technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). We tested the UV sensitivity of mutant XPG(E791A)-mClover KI cells in a UV-colony survival assay, which confirmed that these cells are NER deficient due to the lack of XPG’s catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we performed FRAP experiments to assess if XPG(E791A) dynamics and binding to damaged chromatin differ from those of wild type (WT) XPG. In non-treated cells, both XPG-mClover and XPG(E791A)-mClover showed similar mobility in FRAP, indicating that WT and mutant XPG molecules both freely diffuse through the nucleus. Upon UV irradiation, however, XPG(E791A)-mClover showed a much stronger immobilization than WT XPG-mClover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Fitting these FRAP curves to Monte Carlo simulated curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>) indicated that not the fraction of bound XPG molecules, but the residence time of E791A mutant XPG at DNA damage is increased compared to WT XPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D, E</xref>). To test this experimentally, we used iFRAP, which showed that indeed the residence time of XPG(E791A)-mClover at damaged DNA is longer than that of WT XPG-mClover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F, G</xref>). Thus, these results demonstrate that XPG dissociation is strongly promoted by its catalytic activity.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>EXO1 promotes XPG dissociation</title><p id="P33">Even though XPG(E791A)-mClover resides longer at DNA damage, it is still able to dissociate. This dissociation may be spontaneous or could involve other proteins that actively promote XPG displacement. We, therefore, tested involvement of the 5’-3’ exonuclease EXO1, which has been suggested to compete with canonical DNA repair synthesis factors for gap processing at problematic lesions and to generate long ssDNA intermediates that induce checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). In case of catalytically inactive XPG, the absence of 3’ incision and slow dissociation of XPG impedes efficient refilling during repair, which could allow EXO1 loading and DNA resection in a 5’ to 3’ direction leading also to the removal of stalled XPG from the lesion. Using immunofluorescence to visualize endogenously expressed EXO1, we confirmed that EXO1 is indeed recruited to UV lesions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P34">We, therefore, studied if the depletion of EXO1 affected XPG-mClover localization to DNA damage by immunofluorescence, UV-C laser accumulation and iFRAP experiments. As control, we depleted XPF. Depletion of EXO1 led to increased recruitment of WT XPG-mClover to LUD, similar as after XPF depletion, which was especially clear at 40 min after UV irradiation in immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2G</xref>). Recruitment of XPG(E791A)-mClover was higher than that of WT XPG, but also this was increased after depletion of XPF or EXO1. After DNA damage infliction by UV-C laser, recruitment of both WT XPG-mClover and XPG(E791A)-mClover was increased to the same level after depletion of XPF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). Strikingly, after EXO1 depletion XPG accumulation also increased, but this was even stronger for XPG(E791A)-mClover, suggesting that if NER cannot proceed properly, EXO1’s function may become even more important in processing the damaged DNA and promoting the dissociation of XPG. iFRAP confirmed this delayed dissociation of XPG-mClover from LUD in EXO1-depleted cells, which was even more pronounced for XPG(E791A)-mClover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Since the cell cycle phase is thought to be an important determinant of which DNA polymerases are used for DNA synthesis during NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) and in previous studies EXO1 recruitment to UV-induced DNA lesions was only observed in non-S phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), we tested whether EXO1-stimulated XPG dissociation is different depending on the cell cycle. Hence, we inserted an mScarlet tag at the N-terminus of PCNA in XPG-mClover KI U2OS cells, which allowed us to differentiate between non-S and S phase cells by discriminating replication-associated PCNA foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2H and I</xref>). UV-C laser accumulation experiments showed that XPG-mClover accumulation is similar in both S and non-S phase cells and increases after EXO1 depletion irrespective of the cell cycle phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). iFRAP confirmed that XPG-mClover dissociation from sites of DNA damage was delayed in EXO1-depleted cells, independently of the cell cycle phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H and I</xref>). Together, these data show that XPG dissociation from DNA damage is stimulated by EXO1 and that EXO1 especially promotes the removal of catalytically inactive XPG when 3’ incision does not occur.</p><p id="P36">As EXO1 depletion affects XPG dissociation in both S- and non-S phase cells, we tested whether EXO1 is similarly recruited to LUD in non-S and S cells. To this end, we incubated U2OS cells with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxiuridine (EdU) to distinguish replicating cells by fluorescently visualizing EdU incorporated into DNA. Subsequent immunofluorescence studies showed that EXO1 is clearly recruited to UV-induced lesions, as indicated by CPD staining, in both S phase and non-S phase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J and K</xref>), in line with the fact that we did not observe a cell cycle-dependent effect on XPG release upon EXO1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H and I</xref>). We finally tested if the lack of EXO1 also results in reduced UV-induced DNA repair synthesis, referred to as unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS), as EXO1 is thought to compete with canonical gap filling during NER by extending the DNA gap, which would lead to more DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). We, therefore, tested if EXO1 depletion affected UDS in XPG WT and XPG(E791A) cells by measuring EdU incorporation in LUD. As control, we used previously generated XPF and XPG KO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>), which showed that, as expected, the UV-dependent UDS signal is completely dependent on the presence of both NER endonucleases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5L</xref>). In WT cells, a significant part of the UV-induced DNA repair synthesis also depended on EXO1. Moreover, we observed that the UDS signal was severely reduced in XPG(E791A) cells, showing that most UV-dependent DNA synthesis is dependent on XPG catalytic activity. However, a residual UDS signal was still detected in XPG(E791A) cells, as previously also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), which was reduced upon depletion of XPF and EXO1. These data therefore suggest that EXO1 can compete with canonical NER gap processing in cells both proficient and deficient in XPG catalytic activity. As XPF incises DNA when catalytically active or inactive XPG is present, but not when XPG is completely absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), our results suggest that EXO1 can bind to DNA after the 5’ incision by XPF, and can compete with XPG to start extensive DNA resection while XPG is displaced.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P37">In this study, we show that the stable assembly of XPG into the NER incision complex is stimulated by both TFIIH and XPA, but that only TFIIH is essential for XPG recruitment. Our data suggest that, although XPG can form a complex with TFIIH in the absence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), XPG localizes separately from TFIIH to DNA damage. Moreover, we show that XPG resides longer than XPF at DNA damage and that its dissociation is stimulated by its own incision activity, by that of XPF, and by the subsequent recruitment of PCNA. These results suggest that XPG dissociates later than XPF to help to recruit downstream factors. Moreover, we show that EXO1 is recruited to UV lesions and promotes XPG dissociation, even when XPG itself does not incise DNA. We therefore propose, in line with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>), that EXO1 can resect the XPF-incision-generated 5’ flap DNA structure in a 5’-3’ direction, which leads to XPG removal from the damaged DNA.</p><p id="P38">In agreement with previous immunofluorescence experiments in XPD and XPB deficient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), we show that XPG recruitment requires TFIIH.

We therefore addressed whether in intact cells, XPG is already bound to TFIIH upon engagement in NER. We provide several lines of evidence to show that XPG associates with TFIIH at the site of damage. First, FRAP data of endogenously-tagged XPG and XPD proteins, analyzed by Monte Carlo simulations, showed different immobile fractions in unperturbed cells, which only became more similar after UV irradiation. Also, we observed a different dependency on XPA for TFIIH and XPG binding to damaged DNA. In line with these results, previous FRAP studies on XPG-eGFP and XPB-eGFP, overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and human patient fibroblasts, already showed that, in unperturbed conditions, XPG freely diffuses in the nucleus and that its mobility was temperature independent, while that of TFIIH varied at different temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Moreover, we find that the dissociation of XPG at sites of damage is faster than that of TFIIH, indicating that XPG is not part of the same associating or dissociating TFIIH complex.</p><p id="P39">Even if TFIIH and XPG assemble sequentially in the NER incision complex, it is likely that TFIIH and XPG interact before the DNA bubble generated by TFIIH is fully completed. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies revealed that XPG strongly stimulates XPD helicase activity, possibly by stabilizing its binding to DNA and promoting its transition from ssDNA translocation to dsDNA unwinding at the ss/dsDNA border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). Structural modeling of the NER incision complex suggested that XPG inserts a hydrophobic wedge and β-hairpin motif at the 3’ ss/dsDNA border that could act as ‘helicase pin’ to facilitate efficient strand separation by XPD activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>). Interestingly, XPG was shown to incise DNA only when TFIIH stalls at a lesion and a stretch of ssDNA of a certain length is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>), implying that XPG stimulates TFIIH DNA unwinding activity and that in turn TFIIH stimulates XPG incision activity. Upon its recruitment to DNA damage, XPG is thought to exchange with XPC, as inefficient XPC dissociation impairs stable association of XPG with the incision complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>). In fact, XPC and XPG, as well as their yeast orthologs Rad4 and Rad2, respectively, share similar acidic binding motifs with which they interact with the PH domain of p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>), leading to mutual exclusion when bound to TFIIH. Therefore, it may be that, upon DNA damage detection, TFIIH first forms a stable complex together with XPC, which anchors TFIIH to DNA damage and helps it to initiate DNA unwinding and DNA damage verification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). Subsequently, before DNA unwinding by TFIIH is finished, XPC is replaced by XPG. Then, XPG, together with XPA, stimulates the XPD helicase to complete the generation of the NER bubble and of the ss/dsDNA junction substrate at which XPG is positioned for 3’ incision. It will be of interest to investigate if only the physical presence of XPG or also the XPG catalytic activity is needed for stimulation of XPD helicase activity. Also, XPG has been reported to form homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>), but the exact functional and/or structural relevance of these in the build-up of the incision complex and XPG function in NER remains unknown.</p><p id="P40">Dual incision and DNA synthesis during NER have been shown to be tightly coordinated. XPF 5’ incision is triggered by the presence of XPG and this is followed by XPG 3’ incision and DNA synthesis. Interestingly, initiation of DNA synthesis was already detected after 5’ incision even in the absence of 3’ incision, whereas completed DNA synthesis was only observed after dual incision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). We also observed low levels of XPF-dependent DNA synthesis (UDS) in our XPG-E791A mutant KI cells. However, these levels appeared to be lower than previously observed in XPG deficient XPCS1RO fibroblasts overexpressing E791A-XPG mutant cDNA, which may be because of the lower endogenous XPG levels in our cells. This residual DNA synthesis suggests that XPF dissociates after its 5’ incision, and can even do so in absence of XPG catalytic activity, to allow loading of PCNA and DNA synthesis factors at the generated free 3’-OH end, 5’ to the lesion, to initiate repair synthesis, as was previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>). In support of this rapid XPF release, we show by FRAP and iFRAP that XPF resides for a shorter time at the damaged DNA than XPG and XPD/TFIIH. Moreover, the residence time of XPG increased in the absence of XPF, indicating that XPG dissociation is stimulated by XPF-mediated incision. The longer residence time of XPD might be because of the earlier arrival of TFIIH, although we cannot discard the possibility that its role in transcription influences these results. Furthermore, the longer residence time of XPG might indicate that this endonuclease does not incise and dissociate immediately upon XPF incision. Interestingly, we also show that XPG resides longer at the damage in absence of PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C, D</xref>), indicating that it may remain bound to DNA damage to help recruit PCNA through its PIP box, even before PCNA is stably loaded onto DNA by RFC, as was also shown in <italic>in vitro</italic> immobilized template assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>). We did not observe that XPG dissociation was affected by RFC depletion, which indicates that XPG has no role in its recruitment. RFC could be recruited by RPA, as suggested before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), and is required to load PCNA. Our results also contemplate the possibility that XPG dissociates together with TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) after eviction of DNA damage by the translocase HLTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Besides direct protein-protein interactions, possibly also post-translational modifications may influence XPG assembly to and disassembly from the NER incision complex. For example, quantitative proteomic studies reported ubiquitylation of XPG after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>). Although the role of this modification is not yet understood, it has been proposed that after 3’ incision the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4<sup>Cdt2</sup> ubiquitylates XPG, targeting the protein for removal from the NER complex and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>). It will be interesting to further investigate the role of such PTMs in regulating XPG activity in NER in the future.</p><p id="P41">In addition to XPF and PCNA, we show here that XPG dissociation is promoted by the exonuclease EXO1, whose implication in NER was thus far limited to few studies in yeast and mammalian cells. In these studies, it was shown that ssDNA gaps produced by NER activity after UV irradiation could be enlarged by DNA resection by the 5’-3’ exonuclease activity of EXO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). In line with this, we found a lower UDS signal upon EXO1 depletion, indicating that UV-induced DNA synthesis is partly dependent on EXO1 activity. It was proposed that this EXO1-processing of NER intermediates is restricted to a subset of UV-induced lesions, such as lesions for which DNA synthesis is somehow impeded. Such lesions could be closely spaced lesions on opposite DNA strands. Normally, for single lesions, DNA repair synthesis is thought to be faster than exonucleolytic processing by EXO1, preventing EXO1 to generate extended ssDNA intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). However, for lesions in close proximity on opposite DNA strands, the lesion in the template strand could impede gap filling by the regular DNA polymerases Polδ and Polε. EXO1 was proposed to be recruited after 5’-incision by XPF to process such NER intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). Furthermore, alternatively to the regular DNA polymerases, the Y-family TLS polymerases Polκ, Polι, Polη, and REV1 were found to be recruited to gap intermediates processed by EXO1. These TLS polymerases, especially Polκ, were found to be able to synthesize DNA past lesions on the opposite strand, leading to removal of EXO1 from damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). This competition between canonical gap filling and exonucleolytic processing may also occur when XPG incision is delayed or cannot take place, i.e. when DNA repair synthesis is initiated but not readily completed, suggesting that EXO1 processing may also compete with XPG incision. Interestingly, by iFRAP we found that both enzymatically active and inactive XPG reside longer at sites of DNA damage in the absence of EXO1. This indeed suggests that EXO1 promotes the dissociation of XPG at certain lesions, likely by extending the ssDNA gap, which implies that XPG does not need to incise the DNA and is displaced. This was confirmed by our observation that the low residual UDS signal in XPG(E791A) mutant cells was dependent on both XPF and EXO1, indicating that in absence of XPG 3’ incision, EXO1 can still process the DNA. It will be interesting to verify this further by measuring XPG retention at sites of damage in cells in which EXO1 is still present but its catalytic activity impaired. Finally, we found that EXO1 function in NER acts independent of the cell cycle, which was supported by its recruitment to UV lesions in S and non-S phase cells.</p><p id="P42">In summary, we show that the recruitment and activity of XPG in NER is tightly regulated by both pre-incision and post-incision factors. To further clarify the exact role of EXO1 it will be necessary to study whether any NER-specific protein interactions are involved in EXO1 recruitment. Also, it will be interesting to determine which other proteins act together with EXO1 in dealing with lesions that are repaired in a manner that apparently does not require XPG’s catalytic activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental information</label><media xlink:href="EMS201824-supplement-Supplemental_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d107aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Gert van Cappellen and Gert-Jan Kremers of the Erasmus MC Optical Imaging Center for microscope support.
