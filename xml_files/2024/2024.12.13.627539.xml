Unfortunately, clinical responses remain limited due to rapid resistance onset. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional inhibition. However, there is limited mechanistic understanding of KRAS degradation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, we developed a preclinical LUAD mouse model and demonstrated that targeted oncogenic KRAS degradation induces rapid tumor regression. Transcriptional, histological, and immunophenotypic analyses revealed a substantial remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Notably, disease relapse observed during long-term degrader treatment stems from proteolysis machinery dysregulation, indicating resistance mechanisms distinct from those reported upon KRAS inhibition. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of KRAS degradation in LUAD, offering insights into cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms driving durable antitumor responses and supporting further clinical exploration.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">RAS GTPases are among the most frequently mutated oncoproteins in cancer with ~30% of all human tumors harboring a mutation in either HRAS, NRAS, or KRAS isoforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The most common activating mutations occur at codons 12, 13 and 61<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Functionally, these mutations stabilize the active, GTP-bound (ON) state of RAS proteins, thereby increasing oncogenic flux through downstream effectors such as the MAPK pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. KRAS mutations are also found in nearly a quarter of all lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD), the deadliest type of cancer worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Although KRAS was one of the first oncogenes identified in human tumors, efforts at developing efficient inhibitors stalled for around four decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. However, recent drug development breakthroughs led to the approval of the first KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitors for LUAD patients, namely sotorasib (AMG510) and adagrasib (MRTX849), greatly renewing the hope of inhibiting oncogenic KRAS through pharmacological tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, the clinical efficacy of KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitors rapidly declines due to the development of resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Furthermore, these drugs spare non-G12C mutants, which constitute most KRAS alterations in cancer. As such, many drug discovery programs are ongoing to identify inhibitors targeting of other KRAS mutants. For instance, a non-covalent KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> inhibitor (MRTX1133) is already undergoing early clinical testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In addition, multi-KRAS inhibitors such as BI-2865, capable of engaging a broad spectrum of KRAS alleles have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Despite extensive advances in the treatment of cancer using inhibitors, resistance to this type of pharmacology is still a major medical problem, as observed with sotorasib and adagrasib. Indeed, preclinical data with additional mutant-KRAS inhibitors suggest extent and rate of response are far from complete<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Intense efforts are devoted to exploit on- and off-target drug combinations. The combination of KRAS inhibitors with immunotherapy, with inhibitors of upstream and downstream effectors, or with other actionable vulnerabilities are expected to increase the efficacy of anti-KRAS therapies in the clinic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">In addition to combination therapies, novel approaches of direct KRAS targeting are actively being pursued. The development of RAS therapeutics that operate via different mechanisms of action compared to inhibitors could help realize the full potential of direct RAS targeting for cancer treatment. In particular, hijacking cellular circuits with drugs that induce protein-protein proximity offers interesting therapeutic opportunities.</p><p id="P8">RMC-4998 and RMC-6291, two covalent tri-complex inhibitors of active KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, exploit the concept of chemically-induced protein proximity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. They are macrocyclic compounds derived from sanglifehrin A, a natural product that binds to cyclophilin A (CYPA) with high affinity. Upon binding CYPA, these tri-complex inhibitors remodel the surface of CYPA to create a binary complex with high affinity for active KRAS. The ternary complex sterically blocks KRAS–effector interactions and disrupts downstream signaling. RMC-6291 is currently in clinical trials (NCT05462717). Recently, the reversible RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor RMC-7977 was also reported, and the related compound RMC-6236 has also entered clinical testing (NCT05379985)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Another promising RAS therapeutic concept enabled by proximity-inducing pharmacology is “targeted protein degradation” (TPD). TPD depends on small molecules called <italic>‘degraders’</italic> that prompt the destruction of disease-relevant proteins by inducing proximity to effectors of the cellular proteolytic machinery—often an E3 ubiquitin ligase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. While inhibitors typically target a specific enzymatic function, degraders affect protein abundance comparably to a genetic perturbation. The event-driven mechanism of action of degraders compared with occupancy-based traditional inhibitors imparts several unique advantages related to target scope, target fate, potency, and selectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. For instance, degraders do not require high binding affinity for the target protein in order to achieve effective depletion, thus holding the promise to widening the druggable proteome. Two are the prototypical types of degraders: proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular glue degraders. PROTACs feature a dedicated ligand for the target protein and a dedicated E3 binder, both connected by a linker. In contrast, molecular glue degraders are monovalent linker-less compounds and connect target and E3 in a highly cooperative manner, typically by binding only one of them in isolation.</p><p id="P10">The availability of KRAS inhibitors quickly resulted in the development of initial PROTACs against KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> and KRAS<sup>G12D29-31</sup>. The most clinically advanced PROTACs are ASP3082 and ASP4396, both KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> degraders with phase I studies ongoing (NCT05382559 and NCT06364696 respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Recently, a multi-KRAS PROTAC showed degradation against 13 out of 17 of the most prevalent oncogenic KRAS alleles, including those not yet tractable by inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, this chemical tool is unsuitable for long-term studies <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P11">In summary, PROTACs have garnered great interest as means against KRAS-driven tumors, suggesting that they may be one of the next long sought-after therapeutic modalities tested in the clinic. Recent elegant studies with LUAD mouse models revealed that while <italic>Kras<sup>G12C</sup></italic> ablation induced massive tumor regression and prevented resistance <italic>in vivo</italic>, KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibition caused a limited antitumor response similar to that observed in the clinic, including the rapid onset of resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The prospect of chemical KRAS degradation mimicking the superior efficacy of genetic ablation compared to inhibition is certainly appealing.</p><p id="P12">Although the emphasis of TPD has been typically placed on expanding the druggable proteome, degraders can also help tackle resistance to current anticancer inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. The critical opportunity lies in the fact that different pharmacology exhibits distinct resistance mechanisms. Inhibitors typically lead to target-related resistance such as secondary mutations at the binding pocket that decrease inhibitor affinity. The resistance to degraders instead is mainly driven by dysregulated activity of the proteolytic machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Leveraging these differences presents a strategic chance to defeat resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. From the perspective of overcoming resistance, and besides other interesting complementary capabilities, the availability of different pharmacological modalities against KRAS is expected to help achieve durable responses. There is, however, limited mechanistic understanding of KRAS degradation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P13">Here, we set out to evaluate the therapeutic potential of PROTAC-induced degradation of oncogenic KRAS <italic>in vivo</italic>. Given the utmost unmet clinical need, we focused on LUAD. Particularly, on KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-driven LUAD, a KRAS mutant with no selective inhibitors or degraders available. To this end, we developed a first-in-class KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-degradable LUAD mouse model by leveraging a tag-PROTAC chemogenetic approach. Tag-based technologies of protein degradation offer a loss-of-function chemical solution to resolve target biology in cells and in mice even before having the required chemistry in hand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Chemical, tumor-specific modulation of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> protein abundance served here as a versatile strategy to probe the therapeutic potential of oncoprotein degradation and to selectively dissect the biological outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Novel LUAD KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-degradable syngeneic mouse models enable PROTAC-dependent phenotyping <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P14">To explore the <italic>in vivo</italic> outcomes of acute KRAS<sup>mut</sup> degradation in LUAD, we took advantage of the degradation TAG (dTAG) approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In brief, this chemogenetic system uses a 12-kDa cytosolic prolyl isomerase engineered variant (FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>) as a tag to make fusion proteins amenable to targeted degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. This tag-based approach leverages the potency of standardized PROTACs such as dTAG-13 and dTAG<sup>V</sup>-1, which hijack the endogenous E3 ubiquitin ligases CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> and CRL2<sup>VHL</sup>, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">We focused on KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>, a variant with no selective inhibitors or PROTACs available. The C-terminal portion of KRAS contains the hypervariable region that cannot be modified as it is essential for KRAS trafficking and function. KRAS has been N-terminally fused to a variety of tags without any obvious biological alteration. Thus, we opted for the N-terminal dTAG fusion. The chimeric fusion also included two HA tags to facilitate detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Of note, FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> and HA tags have been previously expressed <italic>in vivo</italic> with no immunogenicity reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. First, we validated <italic>in celullo</italic> the ability of dTAG-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> to rescue the proliferation of cells devoid of all RAS isoforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, thus confirming the biological activity of the tagged oncoprotein and the overall cellular efficiency of the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. S1A</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To establish mouse models amenable to targeted KRAS degradation, we innovated a LUAD-induction approach based on intranasal inhalation of dTAG-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-carrying lentiviruses into fully immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Our approach confirmed the oncogenic activity of dTAG-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> by inducing the development of LUAD with an average latency of 10 months. Tumors were subsequently harvested and orthotopically implanted into the lungs of immunodeficient mice as this approach greatly enhances the development of primary cancer cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. We next established several cancer cell lines derived from independent lesions and evaluated the efficiency of the dTAG system <italic>in cellulo</italic> upon exposure to the dTAG-13 and dTAG<sup>V</sup>-1 PROTACs. As expected, acute degradation of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> resulted in downstream signaling blockade accompanied by concomitant proliferation arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E-G</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Tail vein injection of the established cell lines consistently enabled the generation of syngeneic mouse models of LUAD. To test the efficacy of dTAG-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> degradation <italic>in vivo</italic> we first optimized the scalable synthesis of the compatible PROTACs dTAG-13 and dTAG<sup>V</sup>-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. S1B</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM">Supplementary information</xref> for detailed synthetic and purification procedures). In addition, we designed and synthesized an additional PROTAC analogue (IGP002; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. S1B</xref>) aimed at improving the metabolic stability and solubility of the formers. However, we observed concomitant cellular degradation of the endogenous FKBP12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. S1C</xref>). This finding with IGP1.002 was particularly surprising given that it only differs from dTAG-13 in one atom. We assume that subtle differences in the ternary complex formation drive the lack of FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup>-selective degradation. Henceforth, we focused on dTAG-13 and dTAG<sup>V</sup>-1, and observed efficient degradation <italic>in vivo</italic> by intraperitoneal administration at 40 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Collectively, we established an efficient approach to study tumor-specific chemical modulation of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> protein abundance in LUAD syngeneic mice.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Degradation of oncogenic KRAS inhibits downstream signaling resulting in efficient tumor regression <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P19">To assess the <italic>in vivo</italic> potential of a KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> degradation-based therapy, we further modified the dTAG-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> cell lines described above by concomitantly introducing a luciferase reporter and fluorescent marker (ZsGreen) to allow both longitudinal assessment of tumor burden and purification of cancer cells upon tissue dissociation, respectively. To this end, we delivered the dTAG-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> LUAD cells to the lungs of isogenic C57BL/6J recipient mice via caudal vein injection. This procedure resulted in efficient engraftment followed by tumor development with a short latency period (3-4 weeks). In order to induce degradation of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> we utilized dTAG-13 given than most of the PROTACs currently in clinical trials rewire the E3 CRL4<sup>CRBN 25</sup>. Daily intraperitoneal injection of dTAG-13 significantly suppressed tumor growth inducing tumor regression as early as 3 days post-treatment, assessed both by luminescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) and histopathological examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Two independent cohorts were sacrificed following 3 and 7 days of continuous dTAG-13 treatment. Immunohistochemical detection of the ZsGreen cancer cell reporter confirmed the efficient tumor regression phenotype anticipated by the decline in the luminescence signal. Likewise, quantification of HA-tag immunostaining (a KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> surrogate marker) demonstrated the acute degradation of the driver oncoprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Furthermore, immunostaining analyses of lung tumor sections showed that dTAG-13 treatment resulted in a significant reduction of proliferative cells and enhanced induction of apoptosis when compared to untreated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). As in the <italic>in cellulo</italic> data, oncoprotein degradation resulted in a marked downregulation of ERK/MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). To gain deeper mechanistic insights, bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was performed on LUAD cells (ZsGreen+/CD45− population) directly isolated upon dissociation and FACS separation of tumor-bearing lungs. The biological significance of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> degradation was reinforced by an overall transcriptional profile almost identical to a recently reported gene-signature obtained following chemical inhibition of the oncogene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). A more detailed scrutiny using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified 7 gene sets significantly enriched in dTAG-13-treated tumor cells, including immune-related categories such as those associated with type I and type II interferon (IFN) alpha and gamma responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>), previously reported in the context of oncogenic KRAS inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, we observed increased expression of IFN target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). On the other hand, 12 gene sets were found significantly downregulated when compared to untreated tumor cells with a remarkable presence of metabolic and proliferative related functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Collectively these data indicate that targeted degradation of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> is a highly effective and rapid anti-tumoral approach.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Role of the adaptive immunity in the immediate therapeutic response triggered by KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> degradation</title><p id="P20">The results presented above, highlighting the increased enrichment of several pro-inflammatory pathways following KRAS oncoprotein degradation, prompted us to investigate the tumor microenvironment (TME) composition. Comprehensive immunophenotypic characterization of both dTAG-13 treated and untreated tumor-bearing lungs, revealed that the tumor shrinkage observed as soon as 3 days after the degrader administration occurred concomitantly with an expansion of immune (CD45+) and, to a lesser degree, non-immune (CD45–) cell components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). To more precisely quantify the immune-related phenotypic changes, all immune cell subtypes were normalized relative to the tumor cellularity (ZsGreen+/CD45– population). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, the elimination of KRAS oncoprotein significantly increased both myeloid and lymphoid major lineages. Since cytotoxic populations, such as CD8+ T cells, are pivotal in mediating immunological rejection, we focused our initial analyses on T cell compartments. Most notably, the relative abundance of all major T cell subtypes was significantly increased upon oncogenic KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> degradation, with a concomitant decrease of the respective peripheral blood populations, likely indicative of a strong pulmonary recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. S2A</xref>). Indeed, immunostaining of lung sections revealed enhanced infiltration of CD8+ T cells in dTAG-13-treated tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), a process potentially linked to the upregulation of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 chemokines and interferon-stimulated genes upon KRAS degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Adaptive immunity, driven by priming and activation of T cells, critically depends on dendritic cells (DCs), which phagocyte and present antigens loading them on plasma membrane embedded MHC proteins as an initial step. In response to KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> degradation, increased infiltration of the two major DC subtypes (cDC2 and CD103+ DC cells) was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>) alongside with reduced overall numbers in peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. S2B</xref>), again potentially indicating increased DC recruitment to tumor sites. Among them, the CD103+ DC subset displaying co-expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 showed a more remarkable expansion, suggesting a more effective antigen cross-presentation to CD8+ cells. Accordingly, the activated cytotoxic CD8+CD4- T cell subset appeared significantly amplified according to the CD25 activation marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Likewise, the activated CD4+_Th subtypes also displayed a similar amplification pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>), probably due to the increased DC2 infiltration and the MHC-II presentation capacity of both cDC2 and CD103+ DCs. Moreover, KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> degradation also promoted the acquisition of a differentiation phenotype with both memory and effector properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). This robust adaptive cytotoxic response was potentially enhanced both by increased MHC-I expression of LUAD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), leading to higher antigen presentation capacity, as well as by elevated numbers of innate cytotoxic NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Altogether, these evidences highlight the prominent role played by oncogenic KRAS in the suppression of several anti-tumor immune responses that appeared significantly increased following degrader treatment.</p><p id="P21">Finally, the ratio between the sum of cytotoxic lymphoid CD8+CD4- and NK cells and the counteracting immunosuppressive Treg population, was found significantly diminished at day 7, suggesting a shift towards inflammation resolution likely due to the drastic reduction of the tumor burden during dTAG-13 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> degradation enhances tumor regression mechanisms potentially dependent on the phagocytic ability of the myeloid innate immunity</title><p id="P22">Next, we evaluated the role of the innate immune response as a potential contributor in the tumor regression process described above. To determine the importance of both the adaptive and innate immune components in the short-term antineoplastic response, we replicated the orthotopic engraftment procedure using NSG mice, a strain characterized by lacking functional B, T and NK cells. Remarkably, tumor regression (measured by the decline in bioluminescence signal) occurred with similar kinetics to that observed in an immunocompetent background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Accordingly, histological examination showed a significant decrease in tumor area as well as in the amount of HA and ZsGreen positive LUAD cells upon dTAG-13 administration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. S3A and 3B</xref>). Likewise, immunohistochemical analysis revealed an impairment of ERK/MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways accompanied by cleaved caspase 3 induction and compromised cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. S3B</xref>). These anti-tumor phenotypes, also observed upon dTAG13 treatment in the C57BL/6J background, are likely the consequence of tumor-intrinsic processes and are in good agreement with the substantial GSEA intersection observed between both genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig S3C</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Next, we decided to directly address the potential implication of innate immune responses in both mouse strains. Considering the key role of the phagocytic response as an anti-tumor mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, we took again advantage of the ZsGreen reporter expressed by tumor cells to perform a more precise characterization of this cellular response. Noteworthy, degradation of KRAS oncoprotein greatly exacerbated the overall phagocytic activity in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised tumor bearing lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Among the potential immune populations with phagocytic capacity, alveolar macrophages (AM) emerged as the most prominent cell type able to phagocyte tumor cells in the C57BL/6J background. In NSG mice, interstitial macrophages (IM) were also actively implicated in this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). In good agreement, we detected massive infiltration in both models as measured by the F4/80 pan-macrophage marker in dTAG-13 treated tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Interestingly, both AM and IM populations displayed an increased proportion of CD80+ cells indicative of enhanced anti-tumoral M1 phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>).</p><p id="P24">All these findings suggest that the combination of cancer-cell intrinsic together with innate anti-tumor immune responses contribute to the tumor regression phenotype observed at early stages following KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> degradation.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Resistance to KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> degradation <italic>in vivo</italic> is mostly driven by dysregulation of the proteolytic machinery</title><p id="P25">Despite the rapid and efficient tumor regression elicited by KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> degradation, we decided to prolong the dTAG-13 treatments <italic>in vivo</italic> to evaluate the emergence of resistance to this therapeutic approach.

We therefore followed C57BL/6J and NSG cohorts until detecting tumor relapse (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). Mice were subsequently maintained on dTAG-13 treatment until reaching humane end-point to increase the selective pressure potentially maximizing the onset of full therapy resistance. dTAG-13 resistance appeared with accelerated kinetics in NSG mice resulting in shorter median time to progression and overall reduced survival when compared to C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-D</xref>). Immunohistochemical studies of the resistant tumors revealed that the vast majority of proliferative lesions retained KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E, F</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Cell lines were established from resistant tumors for further phenotyping, together with control lines derived from treatment-naïve animals.

We then focused on understanding the mechanisms driving the lack of targeted degradation. To discard potential technical issues related to the dTAG system, we first sequenced the dTAG-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> fusion in the cell lines established from the resistant LUAD tumors and revealed no on-target secondary mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Efflux pump overexpression has been reported as a mechanism of resistance to PROTACs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. However, these models were sensitive to paclitaxel, a common substrate of efflux pumps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, and an efflux pump inhibitor did not restore dTAG-13-induced degradation of KRAS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. S4A,B</xref>).</p><p id="P27">The loss of function of the E3 hijacked by degraders is the most common resistance mechanism <italic>in cellulo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. To our surprise, only one of the tumor-resistant cell lines showed lack of CRBN expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>). We treated our dTAG-13 resistant models with dTAG<sup>V</sup>-1, which recruits CRL2<sup>VHL</sup> instead of CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>. In addition to the cell line without CRBN, some others were sensitive to this alternative PROTAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. S4D</xref>), suggesting that the lack of KRAS degradation was driven by factors related to the CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> complex. For instance, we observed some downregulation of the adaptor protein DDB1 in some clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. S4E</xref>), previously shown to confer resistance to degraders <italic>in cellulo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. When challenged with other KRAS-unrelated PROTACs that co-opt the same E3s, similar compromised targeted degradation was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. S4F</xref>). These results suggested dysregulation of proteolytic machinery upstream or downstream of the E3 ligases as the main drivers of resistance <italic>in vivo</italic>. To query changes in the protein plasticity of E3-related factors, we defined a panel of interesting proteins related to the Cullin-RING ligase (CRL) family of ubiquitin E3s, and performed targeted proteomics via parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). We could capture a trend in the tumor-derived resistant cell lines towards dampening the levels of important activation machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5J</xref>). For instance, downregulation of DCNL1 and NAE1, both part of the neddylation cascade to activate CRLs, was observed and might contribute to the defective targeted degradation of KRAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5J</xref>). We also mined our RNAseq data to search for potential coding point mutations that might compromise ligase activity in this panel of E3-related genes. In addition to the resistant cell lines, control and dTAG-13 resistant tumors from immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice were analyzed. We only found one point mutation (50% of reads, which would be equivalent to a heterozygote tumor) corresponding to a single-nucleotide insertion predicted to cause a frameshift in the <italic>Nae1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. S4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Overall, we could not find any other point mutations predicted to affect E3 activity in the resistant cell lines or tumors, suggesting the observed dysregulation at the protein level as the most probable contribution towards resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5J</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Given that the KRAS oncoprotein was expressed, we decided to test whether our degradation-resistant LUAD models were sensitive to KRAS inhibitors. There are no selective KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> inhibitors available, but the panKRAS inhibitor BI-2865 engages this mutant. dTAG-13 resistant cells and the cell lines also resistant to dTAG<sup>V</sup>-1 were sensitive to BI-2865 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5K</xref>) reinforcing their dependency on the driver oncoprotein.

In this context, the development of KRAS PROTACs, with some already under early clinical evaluation, could represent a significant breakthrough in the treatment of KRAS-driven cancers. Yet, there is currently very limited information regarding the mechanistic phenotypes brought about by oncogenic KRAS targeted degradation <italic>in vivo</italic> and no data whatsoever concerning the potential resistance mechanisms.</p><p id="P31">In this study, we focused on modeling targeted degradation of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> in LUAD using the dTAG system.

Overall, our preclinical findings provide proof-of-principle of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> degradation as a therapeutic strategy in LUAD, potentially leading to durable anti-tumor responses through a combination of cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. The transcriptional profile obtained from LUAD tumors following KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> degradation displayed substantial overlapping with recently reported signatures upon oncogene inhibition using small molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, suggesting that dampened downstream and pro-survival signaling are major contributors leading to early tumor regression.</p><p id="P32">KRAS-derived neo-peptides have been identified as efficient immunological targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Peptides derived from targeted proteasomal degradation display an average size compatible with MHC-mediated presentation. It is therefore tempting to speculate that, in addition to the enhanced inflammatory response driven by the abrogation of KRAS-driven immune evasion programs, acting on both innate and adaptive compartments as previously reported upon inhibition with specific inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>, PROTACs directed against KRAS may also fuel anti-tumor immunity by means of neo-antigens directly derived from its targeted degradation. While some of these notions will require additional experimental support, altogether our observations suggest a potential synergy between KRAS degradation and tailored immunotherapy to achieve more durable responses.</p><p id="P33">Currently, the patterns of PROTAC resistance <italic>in vivo</italic> remain largely unknown. However, potential resistance mechanisms can be inferred from studies with cell lines. We and others have mapped through functional genomic studies how the repertoire of E3 ligases and their regulators shape the resistance mechanisms to targeted protein degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. Indeed, these mechanisms largely differ from the target-centric resistance associated with traditional inhibitors, and mainly involve the loss or mutation of key ubiquitin-proteasome-system components such as E3 ligases, E2 enzymes, or other regulatory factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. Given that several PROTACs and molecular glue degraders are currently undergoing clinical trials, valuable lessons in these clinical settings are expected to complement our current understanding of how cancer cells cope with degrader modalities.</p><p id="P34">Our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies revealed that long-term treatment eventually resulted in some disease relapse due mainly to KRAS-independent mechanisms. We observed that tumor progression occurred with delayed dynamics in immunocompetent hosts, suggesting that effector/memory components of the adaptive immunity might be key to enhance therapeutic responses. Interestingly, resistance predominantly emerged from dysfunctional E3-dependent protein degradation, and not from adaptive or acquired KRAS-related mechanisms as observed in patients progressing on KRAS specific inhibitors. Our preclinical study is based on tag-based PROTACs, thus, direct KRAS degraders might have divergent resistance mechanisms and/or toxicity profiles. Nevertheless, we hypothesize that the resistance patterns we observed with dTAG-13 are expected to be similar for PROTACs currently in clinical trials against different targets, given that most of them also hijack the E3 CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> via similar thalidomide-inspired ligands. Thus, our KRAS-focused work might provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic challenges of PROTACs as a pharmacological modality.</p><p id="P35">Our findings suggest a valuable opportunity to explore on-target combination therapies with different pharmacological modalities.

After weaning, mice were fed a standard chow diet (#2918, Harlan Laboratories). Animals were treated humanely in accordance with standards described in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals considering relevant national and European guidelines. For orthotopic tumor induction, 10<sup>5</sup> dTAG-KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> LUAD cells co-expressing both immunofluorescence and luminescence reporters, were injected in 100 μl of PBS via the tail vein of 8-week-old C57BL/6 or NSG mice. Tumor growth was routinely monitored by measuring the bioluminescence signal. For image acquisition, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μL of a 30 mg/ml D-Luciferin potassium salt solution (LUCK-100, Gold Biotechnology) 10 min before imaging and were then anesthetized using 2% isoflurane. The bioluminescent signal was quantified as total photon flux by measuring at the site of lung tumors using a region of interest (ROI), which directly correlates the signal with the size of the tumor. Bioluminescence imaging and data processing were performed using the IVIS Lumina S5 imager (Revvity) equipped with the Living Image 4.7.3 software, starting on day 7 after tumor cell injection. Prior to treatment initiation, when tumor size reaches a pre-determined bioluminescence level (between 7.5-8 x 10<sup>8</sup> p/s), mice with similar photon counts were randomized to either the control or treatment groups. Then, mice assigned to each of the groups received a daily intraperitoneal 200 μl injection of either solvent solution (20% Polyoxyl 15 hydroxystearate USP – GX7347, Glentham Life Sciences-in PBS, control group) or dTAG-13 degrader (40 mg/kg, treatment group) during the first week, a period in which IVIS imaging was conducted at 3 and 7 days post-treatment. Afterwards, a 4-day/week degrader administration with <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging follow-up once a week was implemented. Undetectable bioluminescence signal in two consecutive measurements resulted in treatment discontinuation.
