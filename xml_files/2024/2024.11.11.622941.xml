Location specific place cell activity allows quantifiable measurement of the neuronal representation of an environment and when a new environment is encountered, hippocampal place cells rapidly adapt their firing (or remap) to efficiently encode the new features of the environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This dynamic neuronal representation is essential for behavioural adaptation to new environments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Synaptic plasticity triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to dendrites and spines is a fundamental process that underpins adaptation of place cell firing where large dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> events termed plateau potentials have been shown to be particularly effective at driving the formation and tuning of place cells 6-13. In CA1 pyramidal cells, plateau potentials are thought to be driven by supra-linear integration of coincident CA3 (proximal) and entorhinal (distal) inputs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, but the regulation of this integration, and therefore of behaviorally relevant synaptic plasticity and place cell adaptation, is largely unexplored.</p><p id="P3">Hippocampal interneurons in CA1 are diverse and sub-categorised by genetic, morphological and physiological properties <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Major sub-categories are parvalbumin (PV) expressing interneurons that are mostly perisomatic targeting and somatostatin (SOM) expressing interneurons that are mostly dendrite targeting <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, but within these general subtypes there is considerable heterogeneity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Manipulation of all CA1 interneuron activity disrupts many features of place cell activity including place cell formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, specifically, targeted silencing of PV interneurons alters the timing of place cell firing with respect to theta cycles whereas SOM interneuron silencing enhances place cell burst firing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The dendritic targeting of inhibition by SOM interneurons imparts them with privileged control of synaptic inputs whereas perisomatic targeting of inhibition by PV interneurons provides them with fine control of pyramidal cell spike timing and rate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. This suggests that SOM interneurons are prime candidates to regulate synaptic integration, plateau potentials, and thus the plasticity associated with place cell formation and remapping.</p><p id="P4">Activity of different interneuron subtypes is also associated with behavioural state induced by experience. In novel environments, where plasticity enables place cells to remap to the new environment, interneurons increase or decrease their activity in line with their subtype: PV interneurons generally increase activity and SOM interneurons decrease firing rate, but with considerable variability perhaps reflecting distinct subtypes within the PV or SOM classification (see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P5">Within the family of CA1 SOM interneurons, Oriens Lacunosum Moleculare (OLM) interneurons have a unique morphology receiving feedback excitation from CA1 in stratum oriens and targeting inhibition specifically to the distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells in stratum lacunosum moleculare. They also receive direct cholinergic input from the medial septum and express nicotinic and muscarinic receptors that respond to the release of acetylcholine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Indeed, the majority of OLM neurons express the α2 nicotinic receptor (OLMα2; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>), which can be used to selectively manipulate and measure OLMα2 neurons using Chrna2-cre mice 33. Surprisingly, stimulation of OLMα2 neurons in <italic>ex vivo</italic> slices enhances synaptic plasticity at CA3-CA1 Schaffer collateral synapses via a disinhibitory action on PV interneurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> but the role of OLMα2 neurons in regulating plasticity driven by entorhinal inputs and plateau potentials has not been investigated. Furthermore, disruption of OLMα2 activity impairs learning in novel object recognition, y-maze and fear conditioning paradigms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> but the contribution of OLM neurons to the plasticity of neuronal representations required for hippocampal-dependent learning is unknown.</p><p id="P6">Here we made use of Chrna2-cre mice to selectively measure and manipulate OLMα2 interneurons in the hippocampus. By optogenetically stimulating OLM interneurons in <italic>ex vivo</italic> slices we show that they control dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling and synaptic plasticity initiated by entorhinal inputs to CA1 pyramidal neurons. Measurement of OLM activity during behaviour revealed a strong regulation by novelty and movement where OLM firing was reduced in a novel environment that requires place cell remapping. Finally, bidirectional manipulation of OLM activity at specific locations within novel and familiar environments showed that OLM interneurons regulate the emergence and stability of new place cell representations. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for dendrite targeted inhibition for control of synaptic plasticity that underpins the remapping of neuronal representations necessary for adapting to unfamiliar environments.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Control of synaptic plasticity and dendritic calcium dynamics by OLM interneurons</title><p id="P7">Behaviorally relevant synaptic plasticity that underlies place cell adaptations in CA1 is thought to be induced by coincident CA3 and entorhinal cortex inputs that summate supra-linearly and generate large dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> events termed plateau potentials <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The precise targeting of OLM interneuron synapses to the distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells where entorhinal cortex inputs are located suggests they may have an important role in the integration of entorhinal and CA3 inputs and therefore generation of behaviorally relevant synaptic plasticity. To test this we selectively activated a subset of OLM interneurons that express Chrna2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> by expressing the light-activated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in a cre-dependent manner using mice that expressed cre recombinase under control of the promoter for Chrna2 (Chrna2-cre) crossed with mice expressing cre-dependent ChR2 (Ai32 mice; methods). Immunohistochemistry confirmed that Chrna2-cre mice expressed cre selectively in OLM interneurons with reporter expression highest in the Stratum Oriens (SO) and Stratum Lacunosum Moleculare (SLM) layers and cell bodies principally located in SO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. This expression profile is consistent with OLM interneurons providing distal dendritic inhibition that exhibits slower synaptic current kinetics when measured at the soma than perisomatic targeting parvalbumin expressing interneurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Having established selective control of OLM interneurons we investigated whether OLM interneurons can control behaviorally relevant synaptic plasticity. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) elicited in 3 independent pathways (Schaffer collateral (SC) control, SC test and temporoammonic (TA) test) were recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons, via whole-cell patch clamp. Plateau potentials can be replicated in <italic>ex vivo</italic> slices by bursts of high frequency synaptic input <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, therefore, to induce synaptic plasticity, coincident theta burst stimulation (TBS) was given to the SC and TA test pathways. Since OLM interneurons are feedback interneurons excited by CA1 pyramidal neurons and active during the same phase of theta cycles <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, the impact of OLM input was assessed by concurrent TBS of OLM interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the absence of OLM stimulation LTP was induced in the SC test pathway but not in the TA test pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>; 2.22 ± 0.59 (SC), 1.39 ± 0.44 (TA), n = 7). In contrast, in the presence of OLM stimulation SC LTP was blocked and instead LTD emerged in the TA test pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>; 0.94 ± 0.22 (SC), 0.46 ± 0.12 (TA), n = 7). This indicates that when synaptic plasticity is induced by a behaviorally relevant synaptic stimulation, OLM interneurons inhibit LTP at SC synapses.</p><p id="P9">Plateau potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons generate large Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in SR apical dendrites which triggers synaptic plasticity at SC synapses, but OLM interneurons target SLM distal dendrites. Therefore, we next tested whether OLM interneurons can regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> in SR dendrites during plateau potentials. To measure dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations, Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics were imaged in <italic>ex vivo</italic> slices using 2photon imaging of defined apical SR and SLM dendritic regions during electrical synaptic stimulation of SC and/or TA inputs. CA1 pyramidal neurons were filled with the morphological marker Alexa594 and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fluo5f and dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and somatic voltage responses to synaptic stimulation recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Coincident TBS of TA and SC inputs that induced LTP in SC synapses generated large depolarizations at the soma that lasted for an extended period (&gt;200ms) similar to plateau potentials that induce new place fields <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. These depolarizations were associated with large and long-lasting dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in the SR region of apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Concurrent TBS of OLM interneurons substantially reduced the SR dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal without any impact on the somatically recorded depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>; 62.28 ± 6.81 % (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), 99.41 ± 8.01 % (depolarization)). This is reminiscent of other situations where dendritic and synaptic voltage dynamics are localised and do not propagate linearly to the soma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. In comparison, when SC inputs were stimulated in the absence of TA stimulation, smaller depolarizations and Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases were generated and no effect of coincident OLM interneuron stimulation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>; 116.3 ± 25.59 % (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), 108.6 ± 26.69 % (depolarization)). This indicates that OLM interneurons can reduce the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in SR dendrites by preventing the integration of coincident TA inputs.</p><p id="P10">To further test this conclusion, we spatially dissected the action of OLM interneurons on dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> by stimulating SC and TA inputs separately and measuring the impact of OLM interneuron stimulation on dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in apical SR and SLM regions. In these experiments dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases were induced by increasing the stimulation intensity for each input pathway in a step wise manner. OLM stimulation decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the distal SLM dendrites regardless of the site of synaptic stimulation whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were only decreased at proximal SR dendrites when TA inputs were stimulated and not when SC inputs were stimulated alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G,H,I,J</xref>; SLM/SC - F(1, 6) = 20.46, P = 0.004, SLM/TA - F(1, 5) = 8.298, P = 0.0346, SR/TA - F(1, 5), P = 0.0201, SR/SC - F(1, 5) = 0.389, P = 0.5602). This demonstrates that OLM interneurons control not only the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at distal dendrites but also Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in proximal dendrites if the depolarization originates in distal dendrites. This provides an explanation for how OLM interneurons control SR dendrite Ca<sup>2+</sup> during plateau potentials and therefore synaptic plasticity at SC synapses on apical CA1 dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>OLM activity during exploration in novel environments</title><p id="P11">Synaptic plasticity leading to place cell formation and remapping is predicted to occur when mice explore novel environments. The question we next addressed is whether OLM interneurons play a role in enabling synaptic plasticity in novel environments by altering their firing rate. To answer this question, OLM activity was monitored <italic>in vivo</italic> by measuring Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in OLM interneurons using miniaturised microscopy during exploration of familiar and novel environments. AAV1-Flex-GCaMP6s was injected into the dorsal hippocampus of Chrna2-cre mice and a GRIN lens and baseplate implanted above the hippocampus to selectively express and image the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6s in OLMα2 interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Mice were trained to run from end to end of a 140cm linear track for 10% sucrose rewards whilst tethered to a miniscope camera that recorded the activity of OLM interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). To investigate the response of these interneurons to novel environments OLM activity was first observed during exploration of a familiar environment for 10 minutes before switching the mice to a novel environment. The average OLM activity on the initial laps exploring a novel environment was significantly lower than the activity of the latter laps of exploration in a familiar environment (0.011 ± 0.005 vs 0.093 ± 0.063 DF/F). In comparison, mice transitioned between two exposures of the familiar environment showed no change in OLM activity (0.084 ± 0.008 vs 0.082 ± 0.008 DF/F) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 C,D</xref>). Analysis of single interneurons revealed the majority of interneurons reduced their activity in the novel environment and this reduction was more prominent for interneurons that were more active in the familiar environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). As expected during novel exploration the velocity of the mice was reduced, as the mice explored unfamiliar surroundings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>) and similar to other interneuron populations within the hippocampus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> we observed that OLM activity was also correlated with velocity of the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B,G,H</xref>). Therefore, it was important to distinguish between any reduction in OLM activity due to a change in velocity and changes in OLM activity due to a novelty signal. To do this the average activity of the interneurons was binned based on the velocity of the mice. This revealed that at comparable velocities the activity of OLM interneurons was consistently reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). The correlation between interneuron activity and mouse velocity was still observed in the novel environment, although significantly reduced compared to familiar exploration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). These observations suggest that OLM activity is positively modulated by mouse velocity and negatively modulated by novelty suggesting that synaptic plasticity at CA1 pyramidal neurons is more likely to occur in novel environments when place cells are remapped.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Place cell formation and remapping is modulated by OLM interneuron activity</title><p id="P12">With OLM interneurons reducing their activity in novel environments and able to modulate excitatory synaptic plasticity we hypothesised that OLM interneurons may play a key role in the mechanisms of place cell formation and the plasticity that leads to their long-term stability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. To test this, we recorded place cell formation and stability <italic>in vivo</italic> whilst manipulating the activity of OLM interneurons using miniaturised microscopy. To express the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6f into dorsal hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, we injected Chrna2-cre mice with AAV5-CAMKII-GCaMP6f alongside either AAV5-hSyn-Flex-ChrimsonR, AAV5-hSyn-Flex-JAWs or the control AAV5-hsyn-DIO-mCherry to express either the redshifted excitatory opsin ChrimsonR or the redshifted inhibitory opsin JAWs in OLMα2 interneurons. This enabled us to record the activity of pyramidal neurons whilst either stimulating or inhibiting the activity of OLM interneurons. OLM activity was modulated using 620 nm light through the miniscope when mice entered a specific 33 cm section of the track termed the ‘optogenetic-zone’ with an adjacent 33 cm section of the track without light delivery used as a direct comparator termed the ‘control zone’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Analysis of CA1 pyramidal neuron Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity whilst mice traversed a familiar linear track revealed place cell firing fields that tiled the entire length of the track. When mice were switched to a novel track the spatial encoding of these cells was completely lost and a new spatial representation was formed from a population of <italic>de novo</italic> place cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). To assess the impact of OLM activity on place cell formation and remapping, pyramidal neuron activity was recorded during exploration in a novel environment (session 1) with and without optogenetic manipulation of OLM interneurons. To subsequently assess the stability of these newly formed place cells and the impact of OLM perturbation, mice were re-exposed to the same novel environment for a second time (session 2) and place cell representations were compared between Session 1 and Session 2.</p><p id="P14">Increased OLM activity by activation of chrimsonR in the optogenetic stimulation zone of the novel track reduced the proportion of <italic>de novo</italic> place cells that represented that spatial location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). This corresponded with a reduction in the event rate of the pyramidal neurons specific to the region of the track where OLM activity was increased. Together with the lack of any effects of LED stimulation in the mCherry expressing mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), this confirms the predicted impact of enhanced inhibition on pyramidal neuron firing and demonstrates the successful implementation of OLM interneuron optogenetic excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). In contrast, reducing the activity of OLM interneurons with the inhibitory opsin JAWs caused a small and non-significant increase of pyramidal neuron activity that lead to an overrepresentation of <italic>de novo</italic> place cells selective to the optogenetic stimulation zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E,F</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To assess the stability of newly formed spatial representation we calculated the population vector correlations between the two exposures to the same novel environment (session 1 vs session 2) This revealed that increasing OLM activity led to enhanced spatial encoding restricted to the optogenetic stimulation zone (0.421 ± 0.046 vs 0.529 ± 0.066 (correlations for control vs opto zone)). Interestingly, reducing the activity of OLM interneurons did not lead to a decrease in the population encoding of the track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H,I</xref>).One possible explanation for enhanced spatial encoding between the two sessions would be an enhanced stability of the newly formed place cells. By comparing the place cells formed in session 1 with the place cells formed in session 2 we could determine if modulating the activity of OLM interneurons lead to an increased retention of place cells encoding specific regions of the track. Neither stimulation nor inhibition of OLM interneurons resulted in <italic>de novo</italic> place cells that were more or less likely to be retained in the next session, nor did it lead to place cells that had altered spatial information content or place field widths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J, K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). However, of the place cells that did remain between sessions the degree of remapping to a new location on the track was altered. Enhancing the activity of OLM interneurons during place cell formation resulted in place cells that were more likely to encode the same location in subsequent sessions. When reducing the activity of OLM interneurons this resulted in a trend towards the formation of place cells that had a higher propensity to remap to a different location in subsequent sessions. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C,D</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Next, we analysed the stability of individual place cells between session 1 and session 2 in the novel environment. Increasing OLM activity during place cell formation led to a population of place cells with significantly higher spatial firing stability between the two sessions and place fields that shifted their location significantly less compared to place cells formed in the absence of increased OLM activity (0.363 ± 0.049 vs 0.634 ± 0.049 spatial correlation, 11.016 ± 2.854cm vs -4.231 ± 2.621cm place field shifts). Inhibiting OLM activity during place cell formation did not significantly alter the place cells spatial stability or alter the degree of place field location changes but there was a trend towards lower spatial firing stability and location shifting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3L, M</xref>). Therefore, OLM activity not only regulates the number of <italic>de novo</italic> place cells that are formed but also the population of place cells with high spatial stability. This suggests that increased OLM activity reduces the proportion of unstable place cells whilst reduced OLM activity leads to an increased proportion of unstable place cells. By categorising the place cells into stable and unstable based on a spatial correlation threshold of 0.5 we observe this to be the case with OLM activity bidirectionally altering the level of unstable place cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C,D</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Place cell representations completely remap in a novel environment but in the hippocampus there is also continual refinement of spatial representations even in familiar environments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. To investigate whether OLM interneurons also regulate place cell stability in familiar environments or whether their role is selective for novel environments we next manipulated OLM activity during exploration of a familiar environment. In agreement with previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, the stability of place cell representations between sessions on a familiar track was notably higher than those of newly learnt representations but still resulted in measurable drift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A,C,F,G</xref>). Similar to the experiments in novel environments, OLM activity was selectively increased or decreased via optogenetic activation of ChrimsonR or JAWs on a defined section of the track. The acute effects of manipulating OLM activity were similar to that found in novel environments; increasing OLM activity reduced the number of place cells representing the stimulated region of the track whereas decreasing OLM activity had a limited effect with a trend towards an increased number of place cells (10% vs 21% and 16% vs 18%). This again demonstrates that although OLM interneurons have the capacity to inhibit place cells, at basal firing rates in familiar or novel conditions OLM interneurons do not appear to be actively inhibiting place cells.</p><p id="P18">In a novel environment, reducing OLM activity facilitates place cell remapping and increasing OLM activity promotes stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In a familiar environment neither decreasing nor increasing OLM activity altered place cell stability, with no changes in the population vector or spatial correlations, alongside no changes in place cell information content or place field widths as a result of modulating OLM activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 F-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). These findings suggest that OLM interneuron regulation of place cell stability is contingent on the conditions found during novel explorations.</p><p id="P19">Although OLM activity did not alter place cell stability, enhancing their activity was able to reduce the number of place cells encoding the stimulated region of the track. In a familiar environment the reduction in place cell numbers may be due to silencing pre-existing place cells or reducing the rate of <italic>de novo</italic> place cell formation or remapping. To investigate the degree to which increased OLM activity may be silencing pre-existing place cells we measured the retention of pre-existing place cells from a previous exploration of the same familiar environment (session 0). We took the place cells in session 0 that had a place field centre in either the control or optogenetic stimulation zones and calculated the percentage of these place cells that were also a place cell in session 1 and session 2. For the control zone the number of session 0 place cells retained was sequentially reduced during session 1 and session 2, indicating after each exposure less session 0 place cells remained in the representation. However, during session 1, OLM stimulation led to a more drastic reduction in the number of session 0 place cells that were retained, to a comparable degree of place cell retention observed for session 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 J,K</xref>; 61.91 ±3.88% vs 48.34 ±5.86% control zone, 50.96 ±6.84% vs 54.81 ±8.71% opto zone).

Here we show that OLM interneurons specifically inhibit this entorhinal input thereby reducing apical dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and synaptic plasticity during associative plasticity induced by pairing both inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This demonstrates the importance of OLM interneurons for gating behaviorally relevant synaptic plasticity. We then show that OLM activity is reduced at exactly the timepoint where synaptic plasticity is required to remap place cells – the experience of a novel environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In a final set of experiments, we test the impact of manipulating OLM activity on place cell formation and stability in novel and familiar environments given the prediction that OLM inputs gate behaviorally relevant synaptic plasticity. These experiments show that artificially reinstating OLM activity in a novel environment reduces the emergence of new place cells but that the place cells that do emerge are more stable, in effect pruning out the more “speculative” place cells. In contrast, further reduction of OLM activity in a novel environment increased the proportion of unstable place cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and S?). In a familiar environment, increasing OLM activity reduced place cell firing rates and the remaining place cells exhibited enhanced stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). For experiments examining place cell stability the use of control and OLM manipulation zones enabled us to make powerful within experiment comparisons. Overall, these results support the conclusion that OLM interneurons reduce synaptic plasticity and thereby stabilise place cells and spatial representations in the hippocampus. In a novel environment, OLM activity reduces to allow remapping of place cells.</p><p id="P22">We have previously demonstrated that inhibitory synapses from SOM interneurons (that include OLMα2 interneurons) to pyramidal neurons undergo potentiation when synaptic activation is paired with pyramidal neuron depolarization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. By modelling the activity of place cells <italic>in vivo</italic> this inhibitory plasticity is predicted to regulate the stability of place cells in novel and familiar environments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Interestingly, here we show that pairing of temporoammonic input with plateau potentials in CA1 pyramidal cells resulted in LTD of the TA input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>) and therefore that plateau potentials cause a simultaneous increase in inhibition and decrease in excitation for synaptic transmission to distal CA1 dendrites. Under this framework the burst firing of place cells in their place fields drives potentiation of OLM synapses and depression of TA synapses which in turn makes further plasticity of those place cells less likely in response to ongoing place cell activity – effectively stabilizing the place cells. When OLM interneurons reduce their activity in novel environments less inhibitory plasticity is induced and therefore place cells can undergo more plasticity and exhibit less stability after remapping. This is indeed what we and other studies have found (c.f. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Conversely, when we stimulate OLMα2 neurons in a novel environment there will be more inhibitory plasticity, at least in the place cells that are still active, making those place cells more stable. This is what we see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and therefore our results support these predictions for the role of inhibitory plasticity in place cell stabilisation.</p><p id="P23">An alternative explanation for the observed enhancement of place cell stability by OLM stimulation is that OLM activation specifically inhibits place cells that are more unstable leaving a population of stable place cells. Two pieces of data argue against this interpretation. Firstly, the proportion of stable place cells in the novel environment as a fraction of the total cells, and not just relative to unstable place cells, increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>). Secondly, in the familiar environment when place cells are compared between sessions prior to and during OLM stimulation, stable, unstable and novel place cells are all reduced equally in the stimulation and control zones of the track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4L</xref>).</p><p id="P24">The reduction in OLM activity when mice are placed in a novel environment is in line with reductions in SST interneuron activity in novel environments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> suggesting either that OLM interneurons (and specifically OLMα2 neurons) form the majority of observed SST interneurons in CA1 or that a majority of SST interneurons respond in a similar manner to novelty. There is some evidence for both conclusions. The stratum oriens location of the OLM cell bodies makes them more accessible to imaging than deeper SST interneurons and therefore more likely to be recorded <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> but where SST interneurons have been compared across different layers there does not appear to be a big difference in their response to novelty <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. A significant proportion of OLM interneurons do not express nicotinic a2 receptors and target their outputs more selectively to CA1 pyramidal neurons and not to fast spiking PV interneurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. There is also evidence that the proportion of non-OLMα2 to OLMα2 interneurons is higher in dorsal CA1 compared to ventral <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. We have not addressed the physiology of these non-OLMα2 OLM interneurons but the evidence suggests they respond to novelty and control dendritic excitability and synaptic plasticity in much the same way as OLMα2 interneurons. The increase in OLM activity with velocity of movement also mirrors findings from SST interneurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> although there is some heterogeneity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. This heterogeneity might be explained by the heterogeneity of SST interneurons in general and</p><p id="P25">OLM interneurons in particular <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> but we show that the reduced average velocity in novel environments does not account for the reduced OLM activity in response to novelty.</p><p id="P26">An important unanswered question is what controls the activity of OLM interneurons and specifically what causes reduced activity in novel environments? The main excitatory input to OLM interneurons is from CA1 pyramidal neurons but their average activity remains broadly stable in a novel environment so this is unlikely to cause the reduction of OLM activity. The major inhibitory inputs to OLM interneurons are from VIP expressing interneurons which strongly inhibit SST interneurons in both hippocampal and neocortical circuits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. VIP expressing interneurons are themselves a diverse population of neurons that respond to inputs from hippocampal, cortical and subcortical areas and there are at least 2 subtypes that inhibit OLM interneurons. Interestingly, these subtypes are differentially modulated by animal velocity and therefore may be responsible for heterogeneity of OLM activity during movement 54. Moreover, the activity of these VIP interneurons is increased in response to surprise or novelty, making them prime candidates to mediate the reduction of OLM activity with novelty <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Then the question is what drives VIP interneurons and their activity increase in novel environments? 2 primary sources have been identified: Intercortical inputs and neuromodulatory inputs from subcortical structures. In the hippocampus these are for example from entorhinal cortex and cholinergic projections from medial septum, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. This suggests dual antagonistic roles for cholinergic input to the circuit since direct input to OLM interneurons excites OLM interneurons whereas indirect input to VIP interneurons will inhibit OLM interneurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. In a behavioral context it appears that the cholinergic input to VIP interneurons is dominant since cholinergic inputs are disinhibitory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup> and during novelty cholinergic inputs are active leading to a reduction in OLMα2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

Overall, our data support a model where OLM activity is reduced in novel environments that require place cell representations to be remodelled by synaptic plasticity.

For average lap velocity this was taken as the average running velocity (velocity higher than 7cm/s) for each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Place cell identification</title><p id="P47">Spike activity inferred from the recorded Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were assigned a track coordinate based on the mous position. Due to the directionality of place cell firing fields <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup> activity during left and right traversals of the track were analysed separately and activity was only including for running epochs where the mous velocity exceeded 7cm/sec for a minimum of 10 cm. The two 15cm reward zones at the end of the track were also excluded from the analysis The resulting neuron spike activity was binned and averaged into 40 spatial bins giving a 2.75 cm bin width. This activity was divided by the mouse’s occupancy within the bin and gaussian filtered (σ = 1.5). The resulting rate maps were used to classify a neuron as a place cell by calculating the spatial information for each neuron. <disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:msub><mml:mi>∑</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>log</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>r<sub>i</sub></italic> is probability and firing rate of the mouse/cell in position bin i and <inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> the mean firing rate.</p><p id="P48">This spatial information value was then compared to a distribution of spatial information values acquired by shuffling the spike times 1000 times. Statistically significant spatial coding was calculated using a z-test comparing the actual spatial information value to the bootstrapped spatial information distribution. For neurons that were classified as place cells for both left and right lap direction the rate map for the direction that had the lowest firing rate was discarded. All other rate maps for left and right traversals were normalised to the maximum firing bin and combined for all subsequent analysis. Place field centres were calculated as the bin with the maximal normalised activity. Place field bins are defined as the consecutive bins from the place field centre that has an activity rate equal to or exceeding 50% of event rate in the centre bin. Place field widths are defined as the sum of the bin widths in the place field. Cross-validation of place fields was performed on the initial familiar track dataset. Fields for even and odd laps were separated and sorted by even lap activity and showed high spatial and population vector correlation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A,B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Population vector correlations</title><p id="P49">To compare the similarity of spatial representations across sessions, we calculated the population vector correlation between sessions. The population vector is defined as the activity rate for each neuron at a given positional bin. These population vectors are then correlated (using Pearson’s correlation) for each positional bin, resulting in a pairwise matrix of correlation values. For comparisons between sessions, the population vector activity is defined as the activity of place cells in session 1, with the same cells’ activity, irrespective of place cell status, in session 2. The population correlations for optogenetic and control zones are computed by taking the diagonal elements of the correlation matrix, corresponding to each zone, and calculated from the rate maps of each animal.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Spatial correlation calculations</title><p id="P50">To compare the similarity between a cells spatial firing a spatial correlation for each cell is calculated as the Pearson’s correlation between the place cell activity in session 1 with the with the same cells’ activity, irrespective of place cell status, in session 2.

Place cells were classed as lost if the place cell in the initial session was not classified as a place cell in subsequent sessions. Place cells were considered retained if the place cell in the initial session was also a place cell in subsequent sessions. These retained place cells were then split into stable place cells if the place field centres of the two cells were within 2 spatial bins and remapped place cells if the place field centres were more than 2 spatial bins apart. When comparing place cell retention to a previous session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4L</xref>) de novo place cells were classified as place cells in the subsequent session that were not place cells in the previous session.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P52">Experimental unit was defined by analysis of the source of greatest variance in the data.
