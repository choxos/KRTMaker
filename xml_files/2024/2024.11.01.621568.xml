In molecular genetic studies, this facilitates both the cultivation of severe mutant alleles and their phenotypic characterization. Essential membrane lipids, such as complex phosphosphingolipids (in plants, glycosyl inositol phosphorylceramides, GIPCs), have been difficult to functionally characterize due to non-viable and pleiotropic phenotypes of mutants affected in their synthesis in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Following the isolation and biochemical characterization of mutants affected in GIPC synthesis in <italic>P. patens</italic>, including <italic>sphinganine-C4-hydroxylase</italic> (<italic>s4h/sbh</italic>) and <italic>inositol phosphorylceramide synthase</italic> (<italic>ipcs</italic>), we now report some of their morphological, histological, and cytological phenotypes. We observed alteration in cell division, expansion, and differentiation. Specifically, the <italic>s4h</italic> knock-out mutant had abnormal cell division planes, as well as irregular depositions attached to cell walls. Severe <italic>ipcs</italic> mutant alleles showed frequent incomplete cell divisions, causing compromised cell autonomy as demonstrated by intercellular motility assays. These phenotypes suggest that sphingolipids impact both the orientation and proper formation of the cell plate during cytokinesis. Transmission electron microscopy revealed dramatic plasmodesmal structural defects in all three mutants, however, qualitative aspects of plasmodesmal transport do not seem to be severely impacted. Our methods can be used as a toolkit for quantifying growth, and specifically cell division and plasmodesmal phenotypes in mosses; our present results elucidate the specific contributions of GIPCs to fundamental cell functions. Finally, the severity of the observed defects in cell functions and ultrastructure highlight the resilience and utility of <italic>P. patens</italic> for studying basic cellular functions and severe mutant phenotypes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Glycosyl inositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs) are complex phosphosphingolipids that are essential and abundant components of plant cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Tjellström et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cacas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bahammou et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Genetic manipulation of different plant species, including <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa</italic>, and <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>, has produced mutants with modified GIPC content that exhibit abnormalities in their interactions with symbiotic microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Moore et al., 2021</xref>), pathogen resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lenarčič et al., 2017</xref>), and responses to abiotic environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). GIPC-deficient mutants also usually show obvious growth defects in the absence of environmental stresses, and knock-out lesions that block GIPC assembly entirely cannot be recovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Rennie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Ito et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that in addition to contributing to plant interactions with their environment, GIPCs contribute to normal physiology and development, and underscores the notion that they are essential.</p><p id="P4">Defining precise roles of GIPCs in growth and development is challenging for two reasons. First, most studies on GIPC functions have been conducted on vascular plant models. Their complex organ structures and developmental patterns can be difficult to analyze, and mutants can be non-viable when even a single developmental step is blocked by a given mutation. Second, GIPCs are synthesized from ceramides, the defining lipidic backbone common to sphingolipids. Therefore, blocking steps in headgroup assembly not only results in reduced GIPC levels, but also increased levels of free ceramides. As ceramides are potent signals that trigger programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Berkey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">König et al., 2022</xref>), it can be difficult to resolve which mutant phenotypes are caused by substrate excess and which by depleted product.</p><p id="P5">GIPCs accumulate together with sterols into lipid-ordered microdomains within the plasma membrane, which can direct the organization of other protein and lipid membrane components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gronnier et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, recent work on artificial microRNA (amiRNA) <italic>IPCS</italic> transgenic lines of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> suggested that GIPCs drive the localized depletion of the phosphoinositide phosphoinositol-4-phosphate PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Ito et al., 2021</xref>). The development and application of fluorescent probes with affinity for specific phosphoinositides has revealed myriad impacts of their specific localizations on fundamental cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Simon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Noack and Jaillais, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Markovic and Jaillais, 2022</xref>). Therefore, by mediating PI(4)P distribution, GIPCs could be expected to have an impact on these processes as well. Further, the very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) moieties of GIPCs have been shown to be essential for normal endomembrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Molino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wattelet-Boyer et al., 2016</xref>), likely through a direct role in stabilizing highly-curved membranes that form during vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Schneiter et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Molino et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Additionally, several studies have suggested that GIPCs are involved in the formation and function of plasmodesmal cell connections in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Enrichment of plasmodesma-derived plasma membrane from cell walls of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> suspension cell cultures revealed increased GIPC content relative to the total plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Grison et al., 2015</xref>). Further, mutants of <italic>A. thaliana PHLOEM LOADING MODULATOR</italic> (<italic>PLM</italic>) displayed defects in plasmodesmal development and intercellular connectivity, as well as a mild reduction in GIPC levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Yan et al., 2019</xref>). PLM shares sequence identity and conserved motifs with <italic>A. thaliana</italic> INOSITOL PHOSPHORYLCERAMIDE SYNTHASEs (IPCSs), which catalyze the committed step in GIPC synthesis. Therefore, although the biochemical activity of PLM remains uncertain, its sequence and mutant phenotype suggest it may contribute to GIPC accumulation in a cell type- or membrane domain-specific manner.</p><p id="P7"><italic>Physcomitrium patens</italic> is a good genetic system for isolating and studying strong mutant phenotypes that severely affect growth and development. There are routine lab protocols for not only propagating <italic>P. patens</italic> tissue vegetatively, but also carrying out precise genome manipulation without going through a reproductive cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Schaefer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lopez-Obando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Collonnier et al., 2017</xref>); as such it is possible to generate and cultivate mutants with severe developmental defects. Additionally, the filamentous protonemal growth and single-cell thick phyllids of moss gametophores are easy to image and to monitor for phenotypes related to cell division, differentiation, and growth.</p><p id="P8">Profiling <italic>P. patens</italic> sphingolipids with targeted lipidomics revealed the presence of GIPCs containing hexose sugars (Hex) as well as <italic>N</italic>-acetylated hexoses (HexNAc), within the same tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Resemann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Steinberger et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, A-, B-, and C-series GIPCs could be detected having 1, 2, or 3 sugars (Hex, HexNAc, or pentose [Pent]), respectively, linked to the glucuronic acid moiety of the headgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Steinberger et al., 2021</xref>) (See structure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, and simplified pathway, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We previously identified several GIPC-deficient <italic>P. patens</italic> mutants by targeting the <italic>IPCS</italic> gene family, which consists of three members in the moss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Haslam et al., 2024</xref>). We were especially interested in an <italic>ipcs2</italic> single mutant that showed a moderate decrease in Hex-GIPCs (<italic>ipcs2.1.11</italic>), and an <italic>ipcs1 ipcs2 ipcs3</italic> triple mutant that showed severe reductions in Hex-GIPCs and Hex-Hex-GIPCs (<italic>ipcst.92</italic>). While these alleles caused relatively strong decreases in A- and B-series GIPCs with hexose headgroups, they showed only modest reductions in HexNAc-containing GIPCs. The <italic>ipcst.92</italic> mutant was also unusual in that it showed no significant increase in ceramide substrate despite the GIPC product depletion, and an exponential accumulation of the direct product of IPCS activity, inositol phosphorylceramides. In our previous work, we proposed a model in which one of the three mutagenized <italic>ipcs</italic> loci in this triple mutant is still expressed and active, but produces and accumulates the inositol phosphorylceramide product in a way or in a location where it is inaccessible for further glycosylations to produce mature GIPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Haslam et al., 2024</xref>). This would explain both the inositol phosphorylceramide accumulation and the wild type-like levels of ceramide in the mutant. We also previously generated <italic>sphinganine-C4-hydroxylase</italic> (<italic>s4h</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gömann et al., 2021</xref>) (also known as <italic>sphingoid base hydroxylase, sbh</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Steinberger et al., 2021</xref>)). S4H hydroxylates di-hydroxy (18:0;2 or d18:0) long-chain bases (LCBs) to tri-hydroxy LCBs (18:0;3 or t18:0), which are preferentially used in the synthesis of GIPCs. Perhaps surprisingly, among the different changes in the sphingolipid profile of <italic>s4h</italic> mutant, we noticed a 5- to 6-fold increase in B-series GIPCs, including Hex-Hex-GIPCs and Hex-HexNAc-GIPCs, while the A-series GIPCs were not significantly altered compared to the wild type.</p><p id="P9">Together, this selection of moss mutants presents a good toolkit to investigate the impacts of different GIPC defects on growth and development, in a model system that is both easy to image and particularly tolerant of basic physiological and developmental deficiencies. We quantified macroscopic growth of gametophores, cell division and differentiation in the leaf-like phyllids, and ultrastructural differences between the wild type and mutant cells. We observed strong phenotypes related to cell division in both <italic>ipcst.92</italic> and <italic>s4h</italic>, and malformation of plasmodesmata in all mutant alleles. The physiological consequences of these defects were further investigated using intercellular motility assays with protein and small chemical fluorescent probes. Our results identify roles of GIPCs in fundamental plant cell biology, in a bryophyte model that provides a complementary and phylodiverse comparison to <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>ipcs</italic> and <italic>s4h</italic> mutants cause substantial and distinct modifications to the GIPC profile of <italic>P. patens</italic></title><p id="P10">We first confirmed the metabolic deficiencies of our mutants of interest, after cultivating and processing material from all genotypes in parallel, under uniform growth conditions. This supported our previously-reported analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gömann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Haslam et al., 2024</xref>), with several substantial and significant differences to GIPC profiles of the mutants motivating our interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). There are also minor discrepancies in the present work compared to our previous reports; this should be due at least in part to different growth conditions, and to the fact that we used mature gametophores for analysis, whereas protonema was used in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gömann et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Absolute quantification of GIPCs is not possible in the absence of standards. Therefore, we expressed differences in GIPC amounts between samples as MRM peak areas normalized against a total FAMEs measurement. This provides a rough proxy for the total amount of acyl lipid per sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Additionally, we expressed GIPC amounts in fold-change relative to the wild-type measurement for that lipid class, with the wild-type value for each class of GIPC arbitrarily set to one; this provides a different perspective of the relative shift in each class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Although neither quantification is absolute, in the absence of standards, this is the best and most objective analysis we can devise.</p><p id="P12">We confirmed the mild reductions in Hex-GIPCs of the <italic>ipcs2.1.11</italic> mutant, which were decreased approximately 30 % relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>), and resulted in an approximately 20 % reduction of the overall GIPC levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). While not statistically significant in this measurement, this difference was reproducible between multiple experimental replicates. In the more severely-impacted <italic>ipcst.92</italic> triple mutant, we observed an approximately 70 % reduction in Hex-GIPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>), and similar reductions in Hex-Hex-GIPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>) and Pent-Hex-Hex-GIPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>), compared to wild type, while levels of HexNAc-decorated GIPCs were unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1D, E</xref>). Overall, this resulted in an approximate 40 % reduction of total GIPCs in this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The conspicuous trend of <italic>ipcs</italic> lesions having little or no impact on HexNAc-containing GIPCs suggests that the synthesis of these could be regulated differently than for GIPCs decorated with only hexose(s) and pentose. We also confirmed the puzzling GIPC chemotype of the <italic>s4h</italic> mutant, namely the dramatic increase in B-series GIPCs (6-fold increase in Hex-Hex-GIPCs, 12-fold increase in Hex-HexNAc-GIPCs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1B, E</xref>), and further observed a more moderate increase in C-series GIPCs (2-fold increase in Pent-Hex-Hex-GIPCs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>). We also observed mild, though insignificant, reductions in A-series GIPCs in <italic>s4h</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A, D</xref>); altogether these changes resulted in a slight increase in total GIPC levels in <italic>s4h</italic> relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Importantly, the metabolic phenotypes of <italic>ipcs</italic> and <italic>s4h</italic> mutants are not limited to GIPCs. As we previously reported, <italic>ipcst.92</italic> strongly accumulates IPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1F</xref>). However, a transgenic line we generated in the wild-type background (a partial genetic replica of <italic>ipcst.92</italic>, “wt&gt;t92”), using only one of the three mutagenized loci from <italic>ipcst.92</italic> (<italic>ipcs2</italic>), maintained a wild type-like growth phenotype while producing the strongly increased IPC levels characteristic of <italic>ipcst.92</italic>. That this line lacks all developmental phenotypes of <italic>ipcst.92</italic> indicates that it is the cumulative loss of IPCS activity in the <italic>ipcst</italic>.92 triple mutant, not IPC accumulation, that correlates to its growth deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Haslam et al., 2024</xref>). We also observed no substantial difference in the free ceramide and HexCer levels of the <italic>ipcs</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1G-I</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The metabolic phenotype of the <italic>s4h</italic> mutant is especially complex in its impact on different sphingolipid classes. We observed near-complete depletion of all sphingolipids containing an 18:0;3 LCB moiety, which are replaced with 18:0;2 LCB moieties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A-F</xref>). In the case of free ceramides, this compensation was incomplete, with free ceramides accumulating to approximately 20 % of the wild-type level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1G</xref>). Additionally, HexCer levels in <italic>s4h</italic> nearly doubled compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1H</xref>), and strikingly, contain a more diverse fatty acid profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1I</xref>). In summary, all three mutants have strong GIPC-related phenotypes, with <italic>ipcs</italic> mutants showing overall GIPC reduction, and differences in Hex- vs. HexNAc-GIPCs. The <italic>s4h</italic> mutant displays a strong shift to more highly-glycosylated GIPCs. The sphingolipid phenotypes of the <italic>ipcs</italic> mutants are essentially limited to GIPCs, whereas the phenotype of <italic>s4h</italic> is complex, and its growth and development may be impacted by other changes in its sphingolipid profile.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The <italic>ipcs2.1.11, ipcst.92</italic>, and <italic>s4h</italic> mutants have obvious and distinct morphological phenotypes</title><p id="P15">All three mutants have obvious morphological phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). These were quantified based on images of 2-month-old gametophores of different genotypes grown together on the same plates. Gametophore colony area is significantly reduced in all three genotypes, with a near 50 % reduction in <italic>ipcs2.1.11</italic>, and approximately 90 % reductions in both <italic>ipcst.92</italic> and <italic>s4h</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). <italic>ipcs2.1.11</italic> overall appears morphologically similar to wild type, but smaller. In contrast, <italic>ipcst.92</italic> and <italic>s4h</italic> are both dwarf and morphologically unusual. Gametophore expansion was reduced in <italic>ipcst.92</italic> and <italic>s4h</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), to a degree that was more severe than reduction of individual phyllid size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). This discrepancy between colony size reduction and phyllid length reduction gave these two mutants a dense, round appearance compared to the branched and stellate wild type and <italic>ipcs2.1.11</italic>. The altered form of <italic>ipcst.92</italic> and <italic>s4h</italic> can be quantified as circularity, which increased nearly 10-fold in these two mutants compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). Additionally, the % dry mass of <italic>ipcst.92</italic> and <italic>s4h</italic> was significantly increased relative to wild type, by approximately 30 % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>), presumably due at least in part to the relative increase in apoplastic vs. symplastic material that would occur with reduced cell size, and corresponding increased surface area-to-volume ratio.</p><p id="P16">Comparing <italic>ipcst.92</italic> and <italic>s4h</italic> to each other, there are also clear differences. Though both mutants required more time to undergo the transition from protonema and gametophore growth, thereafter, <italic>ipcst.92</italic> grew uniformly as such. In contrast, the <italic>s4h</italic> mutant never established homogeneous gametophore growth, and the gametophores that were initiated were morphologically irregular.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cell division, expansion, and differentiation are all altered compared to wild type in mutant phyllids</title><p id="P17">Phyllid histological features and differentiation into distinct cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dennis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Lin et al., 2021</xref>) were next observed in surface view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-G</xref>), and in crystal violet-stained semi-thin sections of the median regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H-U</xref>). There are several distinct cell types in phyllids. First, phyllid margin cells (also called edge cells), have an elongated form and protrude slightly at the apical end, producing a rounded serration for the margin. Second, stereid and hydroid cells in the hadrom (a “midrib” in analogy to vascular plants), are elongated, straight, and stereids have thicker cell walls than the other cell types. The remaining cells between the hadrom and margin are considered here simply as parenchyma, and vary substantially in size, but generally have a shorter aspect ratio than the margin, stereid, and hydroid cells, and are more densely filled with chloroplasts. In some literature, parenchyma cells are further sub-divided into base and tip cells, and are distinguished based on their different shape and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dennis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Lin et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Dramatic reductions were clear in phyllid cell numbers for all mutants, with <italic>ipcs2.1.11</italic> reduced to 55 %, <italic>ipcst.92</italic> to 20 %, and <italic>s4h</italic> to 10 % of the cell number per phyllid compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Average cell length was calculated by measuring individual phyllids and dividing the length by the number of cells in a column spanning the length of the phyllid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F, G</xref>). We could clearly distinguish between parenchyma and margin cells in the Gransden wild type and in <italic>ipcs2.1.11</italic>, and so these cell types could be measured separately. In <italic>ipcst.92</italic> and <italic>s4h</italic>, there was no consistent, distinct shape to cells at the phyllid margin; additionally, cell columns within the phyllid were difficult to track. Therefore, only an edge row of cells was used for quantification of these two genotypes.

Although median phyllid sections were compared between genotypes, the strong developmental phenotypes of the <italic>ipcst.92</italic> and <italic>s4h</italic> mutants introduced some complexity to these comparisons given that plasmodesmal structure and function is known to progress alongside cell maturation. The specifics of this process were recently described for <italic>P. patens</italic> Reute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wegner and Ehlers, 2024</xref>). Similar to angiosperms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Nicolas et al., 2017</xref>), young, narrow type I plasmodesmata typically have a uniform, approximately 25 nm diameter over their length, and internal structures cannot be discriminated. These plasmodesmata have a relatively high size exclusion limit (SEL) of at least 27 kDa, which allows for the movement of macromolecules between cells. In contrast, in older type II(-like) plasmodesmata characteristic of mature cells, internal substructures can clearly be seen, including the central ER-derived desmotubule and the cytosolic sleeve between the plasma membrane and desmotubule. These type II-like plasmodesmata are wider at approximately 45 nm in the dilated region located in the median cell wall layers (white arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-N</xref>), and show constricted ‘necks’ only at the orifices (white arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-N</xref>), where the plasma membrane and desmotubule membrane (black arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-N</xref>) are still locally difficult to distinguish. Type II plasmodesmata have a much lower size exclusion limit, approximately 1 kDa in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, and therefore restrict the intercellular transport between older cells to small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Nicolas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wegner and Ehlers, 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P27">All plasmodesmata observed in mature phyllids of the wild-type Gransden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-D, O</xref>, n=28) were classified as type II(-like) plasmodesmata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4P</xref>), since the desmotubule and the cytosolic sleeve could be clearly discerned in the median plasmodesmal regions, which always had a strongly dilated shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4Q</xref>). In contrast to many characterized angiosperms, the desmotubule was also usually dilated in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4R</xref>), and spoke-like structures linking the desmotubule membrane to the plasma membrane could sometimes be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, indicated by black lines). The median dilations of the wild-type plasmodesmata were always long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4S</xref>) and covered more than half of the cell wall thickness. Cell wall collars surrounding the median region of the plasmodesmata were occasionally observed, in 7 % of the wild-type plasmodesmata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4T</xref>). The interior of the cytosolic sleeves and desmotubules were electron-lucent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4U</xref>), and short, constricted, electron-dense neck regions at the plasmodesmal orifices were surrounded by moderate callose deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4V</xref>).

In the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A, E</xref>), eYFP fluorescence was restricted 79 % of the time (15/19) to a single bombarded cell. The other 21 % of bombardment events led to some eYFP fluorescence in 1-3 additional cells adjacent to the bombarded cell. This could possibly be attributed to a relatively younger developmental stage of these cells and, consequently, a higher SEL of their plasmodesmata in these particular bombardment events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wegner and Ehlers, 2024</xref>), or random, non-targeted leakage. In contrast, Sp-mCer-KDEL was always restricted to the bombarded cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A, F</xref>), fitting with previous observations that the desmotubule lumen does not allow for the transport of macromolecules larger than 3-10 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Crawford and Zambryski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Li et al., 2021</xref>).

The appearance of eYFP-fluorescent cell clusters in <italic>ipcst.92</italic> was also distinct from the other genotypes in that the clusters were generally uniformly bright with eYFP, to the extent that the bombarded cell could not be distinguished from its neighbours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). In the other genotypes, weak eYFP fluorescence in cells adjacent to the bombarded individual cell could only be visualized by either adjusting microscope settings or enhancing image brightness to the point that fluorescence signal from the bombarded cell was saturated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). We infer that in wild type, eYFP is able to pass through plasmodesmata of adjacent cells, but with a limited capacity that is dependent on the SEL of plasmodesmata, the developmental stage of the bombarded gametophore colony, phyllid, and individual cell.

We compared CF FRAP in parenchyma cells from phyllids dissected from the gametophore tips.

FB1 treatment was linked to a mild reduction in cell size, and a more substantial ~25% reduction in cell number, within the root division zone in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Molino et al., 2014</xref>). Although <italic>P. patens ipcs</italic> mutants do not show substantial shifts in the fatty acid moiety chain length profile of GIPCs specifically, there is likely an overall reduction in VLCFA content for membrane lipids as a whole due to the reduction in GIPC content. Therefore, we cannot distinguish whether the cytokinesis defects in <italic>ipcst.92</italic> are due to reduction in GIPCs, or reduction in VLCFAs. Further, it is unknown whether the cell division phenotype of <italic>ipcst.92</italic> is directly caused by sphingolipids, or if it could be mediated by downstream effects on the overall lipid content of cellular membranes. A mechanism whereby GIPCs (as VLCFA-containing sphingolipids) could affect cytokinesis was previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Molino et al., 2014</xref>), namely that VLCFAs stabilize highly-curved membranes that form upon vesicle fusion, which is of particular importance during cell plate formation. In both our <italic>P. patens ipcst.92</italic> mutant and in FB1-treated <italic>A. thaliana</italic> roots, plate formation appears to be aborted during late cytokinesis, after substantial vesicle fusion must have already occurred. If our model is correct, this implies there is sufficient VLCFA and/or GIPC content in these membranes to support the initial stages of vesicle fusion, but that at some point it can no longer support stable expansion of the cell plate. Overall, this hypothesis and model parallels observations in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that VLCFA-containing lipids are essential for formation of the highly-curved membranes of nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Schneiter et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P39">Similar phenotypes to <italic>ipcst.92</italic> have were also observed in <italic>A. thaliana pi4kβ1 pi4kβ2</italic> double mutants deficient in PI4P synthesis, that is, aborted cytokinesis producing multinucleate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, a different, but related phenotype was reported by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lebecq et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lebecq et al., 2023</xref>) who showed that localized depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] by the phosphatase SUPPRESSOR OF ACTIN9 (SAC9) is required at the leading edge of the phragmoplast; in <italic>sac9</italic> mutants, ectopic accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> leads to cell plate branching. The similarity of <italic>P. patens ipcst.92</italic> to <italic>A. thaliana pi4kβ1 pi4kβ2</italic> specifically is perhaps surprising in light of recent analysis of <italic>Atipcs1/2</italic> amiRNA lines, which revealed PIP phospholipase activity is dependent on the presence of VLCFA-containing sphingolipids in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Ito et al., 2021</xref>). This study demonstrated that reduced levels of VLCFA-containing sphingolipids produced increased PI4P at the TGN, suggesting an inverse relationship between GIPC and PI4P accumulation. The similarity of our GIPC-deficient phenotypes to PI4P-deficient phenotypes is in apparent opposition with the notion that GIPC accumulation is antagonistic to PI4P accumulation. However, we were unable to measure phosphoinositide levels in <italic>P. patens</italic> for the present study, and our approach for GIPC detection is insensitive to subcellular localization. More precise analysis of the spatiotemporal changes in sphingolipid and phosphoinositide content in our mutants may present a more harmonious model of how these lipid classes interact. Additionally, it is not inconceivable that there may be differences between <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>P. patens</italic> in this respect, considering substantial differences between cytokinesis in these two models, reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Buschmann and Zachgo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Buschmann and Müller, 2019</xref>), and the fact that the vascular and bryophyte lineages diverged over 450 million years ago.</p><p id="P40">The <italic>s4h</italic> mutant has a complex and unique metabolic phenotype: <italic>s4h</italic> accumulates sphingolipids with 18:0;2 in place of 18:0;3, and has strong accumulations of B-series Hex-Hex-GIPCs and Hex-HexNAc-GIPCs. Among the visual phenotypes observed in <italic>s4h</italic>, we were especially interested in the loss of orientation of cell division within phyllids. This observation together with the overall morphological abnormalities of the <italic>s4h</italic> mutant suggest that it may have partially lost the capability to define apical-basal polarity. Another interesting aspect of the <italic>s4h</italic> phenotype is the tufted aggregates observed here and in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gömann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Steinberger et al., 2021</xref>). The aggregates observed with various imaging techniques must represent multiple different chemical accumulations. The aggregates likely include callose, as suggested by aniline blue-stained accumulations adjacent to cell walls seen with epifluorescence microscopy, and electron-lucent layers within the depositions attached to cell walls in TEM images. Callose hyperaccumulation and mis-localization is reminiscent of persistent callose at the maturing cell plate of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Molino et al. (2014)</xref> upon FB1 treatment, though the phenotype we observed is more severe. The red-coloured material in tufted aggregates viewed by light microscopy, and the electron-dense material in tufted aggregates observed by TEM, is not callose. This would be in conflict with their pigmentation and osmium tetroxide staining, and with the spatial separation of these features. The chemical composition of these structures remains ambiguous. Fragmentation of chloroplasts was frequently observed in <italic>s4h</italic> with basic light microscopy, as well as patchy CF fluorescence suggesting inconsistent hydrolysis of non-fluorescent CFDA to produce fluorescent CF. Both observations suggest cell death in <italic>s4h</italic> phyllids, with a patchy, cell-autonomous distribution. Whether and how cell death may be correlated with development of tufted aggregates was not investigated in the present study, and remains an essential question for understanding this mutant phenotype.</p><p id="P41">The plasma membrane detachment phenotypes we observed in all mutants could support the notion that GIPCs impact the physical connection of the plasma membrane and cell wall. These phenotypes could also, alternatively or additionally, be driven by accumulation of excess plasma membrane material in the mutants, such that the plasma membrane area exceeds the inner cell wall area. Vesicular trafficking is likely impacted by GIPC deficiencies, given GIPC enrichment along the secretory pathway and the fact that GIPCs impact membrane physical properties: they increase membrane thickness due to their incorporation of VLCFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Levine et al., 2000</xref>), and increase lipid ordering due to their incorporation of saturated, hydroxylated LCB and VLCFA moieties that hydrogen bond with each other and free sterols in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Grosjean et al., 2015</xref>). Further, as discussed above, VLCFA-containing GIPCs are expected to be required for vesicle fusion during cytokinesis. It seems reasonable to expect that other dynamic processes involving plasma membrane budding and fusion would be impacted by sphingolipid content, including secretion and endocytosis, and this in turn would affect the staining properties and physical appearance of the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Plasmodesmal development is impacted by GIPC deficiencies in <italic>P. patens</italic></title><p id="P42">The <italic>s4h</italic> and <italic>ipcst.92</italic> mutant plasmodesmata did not undergo a full type I-to-type II(-like) transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Nicolas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wegner and Ehlers, 2024</xref>). Internal plasmodesmal substructures did not become visible along the length of these severely affected plasmodesmata, there was no clear spatial separation of the desmotubule and the plasma membrane by a visible cytosolic sleeve, they regularly exhibited an electron-dense interior, and the widening of the plasmodesmal diameter and the formation of significant median dilations was lacking in most plasmodesmata of these mutants. Striking cell wall collars were observed instead. It could be speculated that the developmental defects of the severely affected mutants’ plasmodesmata would impair their quantitative transport capacities, that is, the volume flow of even small molecules. Enlarged cytosolic sleeves and/or enlarged median dilations characteristic of type II(-like) plasmodesmata would otherwise contribute to plasmodesmal widening. This is thought to sustain transport rates when plasmodesmal channels become elongated during thickening growth of the wall: Modelling predictions showed that larger cytosolic sleeves and median dilations would be favoured in thicker walls to increase plasmodesmal permeation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Deinum et al., 2019</xref>). Lack of these plasmodesmal modifications and reduced symplastic transport rates might contribute to the dwarf phenotypes of all three mutants. Notably, in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, multiple C2-domains and transmembrane region proteins (MCTPs) have been shown to act as plasmodesmata-specific ER-plasma membrane tethers interact with PI4P, contribute to plasmodesmal formation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Pérez-Sancho et al., 2023</xref>), and MCTP-deficient mutants show dwarfism and aberrant cell division phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Brault et al., 2019</xref>) that are similar to <italic>s4h</italic>. MCTPs have been identified in the <italic>P. patens</italic> plasmodesmal proteome and confirmed to localize to plasmodesmata via confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gombos et al., 2023</xref>). It will certainly be of interest to functionally characterize MCTPs in <italic>P. patens</italic> and to test whether their localization, and the localization of other plasmodesmal and plasma membrane proteins, are disrupted in <italic>s4h</italic>.</p><p id="P43">In addition to the plasmodesmal structural defects in our mutants, we observed two-fold increased plasmodesmal density in <italic>s4h</italic>, and four- to five-fold increased plasmodesmal densities in <italic>ipcs2.1.11</italic> and <italic>ipcst.92</italic> compared to the wild type. One explanation that could account for both the observed plasmodesmal structural defects and their increased density in our mutants is that both of these phenotypes reflect that the mutant phyllids are altogether not fully differentiated, perhaps displaying some default state, or incomplete gametophore-specific programming. As discussed further below, <italic>P. patens</italic> protonemal cell walls are characterized by a very high density of type I plasmodesmata, and lack type II(-like) plasmodesmata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gombos et al., 2023</xref>). Similarity of wild-type protonema to the mutant phenotypes observed in gametophores supports the notion that the mutants may simply be less differentiated by normal gametophore developmental programming. Moreover, type II(-like) plasmodesmata can be expected to mediate a highly controlled, targeted exchange of macromolecular signals whereas type I PD would allow their unhindered non-specific transport by diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Crawford and Zambryski, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ehlers and Westerloh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Nicolas et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, lack of type II(-like) PD formation in the <italic>s4h</italic> and <italic>ipcst.92</italic> mutants could explain their severe developmental phenotypes, in particular their impaired ability to undergo the developmental switch from simple protonema- to complex gametophore growth and their problems in tissue differentiation. Clearly, in <italic>ipcst.92</italic>, these issues would be compounded by incomplete cell division.</p><p id="P44">A second model to explain the changes in plasmodesmal density and structure is that the cytokinetic defects, of <italic>ipcst.92</italic> and <italic>s4h</italic> in particular, cause the plasmodesmal phenotypes: As it has been demonstrated that primary plasmodesmal deposition is determined by ER strands becoming trapped and integrated in the expanding cell plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hepler, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Li et al., 2023</xref>), perhaps the cytokinetic defects are somehow responsible for the higher frequency of ER “trapping” in the plate, and/or the stabilization and retention of desmotubules. Overall, it seems most likely to us that the plasmodesmal phenotypes observed in these sphingolipid-deficient mutants are at least partially caused by broader developmental and cytokinetic defects.</p><p id="P45">We could also make inferences regarding the SEL of mutant plasmodesmata from the FRAP and biolistic assays. Due to the ambiguity of these results in the <italic>ipcst.92</italic> mutant introduced by its incomplete cell divisions, we will limit our discussion to the <italic>ipcs2.1.11</italic> and <italic>s4h</italic> mutants. Similarly to the Gransden wild type, both the <italic>ipcs2.1.11</italic> with weakly dilated type II-like plasmodesmata, and even <italic>s4h</italic> mutant with narrow and straight type I plasmodesmata mediated the fast exchange of CF(DA) (376 Da) between mature phyllid cells within minutes after bleaching. This suggests that the shape of plasmodesmata and their desmotubules, which are dilated in wild-type plasmodesmata, less dilated in <italic>ipcs2.1.11</italic>, and mostly constricted in <italic>s4h</italic>, did not have a substantial impact on the general capacity for transport of small molecules. For <italic>ipcs2.1.11</italic>, slow intercellular exchange of eYFP (27 kDa) was also occasionally observed, similar to the Gransden wild type. A comparison can be made to <italic>P. patens</italic> protonema, which exclusively form straight plasmodesmata at very high density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gombos et al., 2023</xref>). Movement of Dendra2 (26.1 kDa) between protonema cells, presumably <italic>via</italic> type I plasmodesmata, could be observed within 15 min, whereas between mature <italic>P. patens</italic> phyllid cells, which are interconnected by type II-like PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wegner and Ehlers, 2024</xref>), movement was only observed after 9.5 h over 1-2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kitagawa and Fujita, 2015</xref>). The slow spread of Dendra2 into neighboring phyllid cells indicates that while macromolecular transport rates are drastically reduced in this tissue compared to protonema cells and young phyllids with type I plasmodesmata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wegner and Ehlers 2024</xref>), transport of larger molecules is not entirely prevented by a strict size exclusion limit in mature phyllids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kitagawa and Fujita, 2015</xref>). At this point, it is unclear whether this slow macromolecule transport over hours and days has a physiological impact. Regardless, we infer that developmental control of the plasmodesmal SEL is exerted in regions of the plasmodesmata largely unaffected by the transition from type I to type II and by these mutations, and instead presumably occurs <italic>via</italic> molecular changes in the neck regions at the plasmodesmal orifices. The persistent finding of occasional, very slow macromolecule (Dendra2 and eYFP) transport through plasmodesmata raises the question whether the SEL is indeed an exclusively qualitative and definite parameter; it could be that this reflects random leakage that is unavoidable during targeted macromolecule transport.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title><italic>P. patens</italic> mutants are complementary tools for deciphering complex developmental phenotypes</title><p id="P46">Plant development is intricate and is easily derailed past the point where processes can be cleanly analyzed and deciphered when using blunt mutagenesis approaches.

These congruent results in <italic>P. patens</italic> additionally suggest that GIPC functions could be conserved across embryophytes.

A linear gradient was applied: start from 65 % B for 2 min; increase to 100 % B in 8 min; hold for 2 min and re-equilibrate to the initial conditions in 4 min. Starting condition of 40 % solvent B was utilized for long-chain bases (LCBs). For multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), precursor ions were [M+H]<sup>+</sup> and product ions were dehydrated LCB fragments for ceramides and glycosylceramides. The loss of phosphoinositol-containing head groups was used for detection of glycosyl inositol phosphorylceramides.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) derivatization and measurement by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID)</title><p id="P65">20 % of the total lipid extract was used for methylesterification to FAMEs, and total fatty acid quantification for normalizing the peak areas of individual lipid species measured by high performance UPLC-nanoESI-MS/MS.

Ceramide (Cer) assembly and backbone modifications occur on the endoplasmic reticulum, including SPHINGANINE-4-HYDROXYLASE (S4H, pink) hydroxylation of 18:0;2 LCBs to 18:0;3. In wild-type <italic>P. patens</italic>, only 18:0;3 LCBs are incorporated in GIPCs. Ceramides containing an 18:0;3 LCB and a VLCFA move into the Golgi and <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) where phospho-sugar headgroup additions build GIPCs.
