However, the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying their effects remain elusive. This study introduces a personalized whole-brain model built upon a laminar neural mass framework to elucidate these effects. Using multimodal neuroimaging data from thirty subjects diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease, we simulate the impact of serotonin 2A receptor activation, characteristic of psychedelics, on cortical dynamics. By modulating the excitability of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, our models reproduce hallmark changes in EEG power spectra observed under psychedelics, including alpha power suppression and gamma power enhancement. These spectral shifts are shown to correlate strongly with the regional distribution of serotonin 2A receptors. Furthermore, simulated EEG reveals increased complexity and entropy, suggesting restored network function. These findings underscore the potential of serotonergic psychedelics to reestablish healthy oscillatory dynamics in the prodromal and early phases of Alzheimer’s disease and offer mechanistic insights into their potential therapeutic effects in neurodegenerative disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Psychedelics</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer’s disease</kwd><kwd>Neuropsychiatry</kwd><kwd>Serotonin</kwd><kwd>5-HT2A</kwd><kwd>PET</kwd><kwd>Whole-Brain Model</kwd><kwd>Laminar Neural Mass Model</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">In the last couple of decades, classical serotonergic psychedelics (hereby, <italic>psychedelics</italic>) have re-emerged as potential treatments for a range of different neuropsychiatric disorders, yielding promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Nutt et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Husain et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cameron and Patel, 2023</xref>]. Emerging evidence also points to the potential of psychedelics in treating neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">Winkelman et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Garcia-Romeu et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Vann Jones and O’Kelly, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Kozlowska et al., 2022</xref>]. While current evidence is primarily preclinical, there is growing interest in investigating psychedelics as potential treatments for AD, with both high-dose and micro-dosing regimens being considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Vann Jones and O’Kelly, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Garcia-Romeu et al., 2022</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Serotonergic psychedelics primarily act as agonists of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Nutt et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cameron and Patel, 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019</xref>, Carhart- Harris and Chandaria, 2023], though other receptors, such as 5-HT1AR, may also contribute to these effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">Warren et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Hansen et al., 2022</xref>]. The intensity of these effects is linked to the degree of occupancy of these receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Madsen et al., 2019</xref>]. Among the different serotonin receptor (5-HT) subtypes, 5-HT2ARs are the most abundant in the cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Luppi et al., 2024</xref>] and show some regional heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Nutt et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Berger et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Andrade, 2011</xref>]. 5-HT2A receptors modulate the excitatory effects of glutamate, particularly by enhancing the excitability of deep-layer pyramidal neurons to glutamate inputs (i.e., making them more susceptible to excitatory inputs typically associated with glutamate receptors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Andrade, 2011</xref>]. This enhanced excitation dysregulates the spontaneous activity in cortical populations, increasing the entropy or complexity of ongoing brain activity and producing alterations in its power spectrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Nutt et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019</xref>]. In particular, the power changes associated with 5-HT2AR activation disrupt the brain’s normal alpha rhythm dynamics, resulting in a widespread decrease in the mean PSD of the alpha band in the cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Nutt et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Carhart-Harris and Leech, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Ort et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Timmermann et al., 2023</xref>] and an increase in the cortical gamma band power [Tim- mermann et al., 2023, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Smausz et al., 2022</xref>].</p><p id="P6">These mechanisms may be particularly valuable in the context of Alzheimer’s disease, where disrupted oscillatory patterns, reduced complexity, and impaired connectivity are hallmarks of the disorder. Specifically, these disruptions evolve across the stages of the disease, reflecting progressive impairments in neural dynamics. During the preclinical phase, alpha activity is disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Nakamura et al., 2018</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Gallego-Rudolf et al., 2024</xref>], while gamma power shows variability, with reports of increases, stability, or reductions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Gaubert et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Rochart et al., 2020</xref>]. As the disease progresses into the prodromal phase, alpha power remains elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Nakamura et al., 2018</xref>]. During this phase, gamma power is thought to decline due to the dysfunction of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, which are essential for generating gamma oscillations and maintaining network balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Murty et al., 2021</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Palop and Mucke, 2016</xref>]. In the mild to moderate stages, alpha power declines, gamma power becomes markedly reduced, and neural complexity decreases, reflecting growing impairments in synaptic function, network flexibility, and cognitive processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Garcés et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abásolo et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Sun et al., 2020</xref>]. For a more detailed discussion of AD physiopathology and oscillatory deficits, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material S1</xref>.</p><p id="P7">Psychedelics, acting through the mechanisms described above, could counteract these deficits by reducing alpha power, thereby alleviating hyper-synchronization and enhancing network flexibility. Their ability to increase gamma power is particularly relevant for addressing PV interneuron dysfunction, potentially restoring gamma oscillations and rebalancing excitatory-inhibitory networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Palop and Mucke, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Halberstadt, 2015</xref>]. Additionally, psychedelics enhance neural complexity, increasing entropy and promoting a more flexible and integrated network state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Carhart-Harris, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Nutt et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Ruffini et al., 2023</xref>], which may help counteract the rigidity and loss of complexity observed in Alzheimer’s disease. These effects suggest that psychedelics could be especially effective in the prodromal and mild stages of the disease, where compensatory mechanisms remain active, and neural circuits are less extensively damaged. A summary of how psychedelics may compensate for these deficits in AD is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p id="P8">A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of psychedelics is essential to develop such effective treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Nutt et al., 2020</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cameron and Patel, 2023</xref>]. Psychedelics affect brain dynamics across scales, from subcellular mechanisms to whole-brain networks, making computational models valuable tools for exploring their therapeutic potential. Such mechanistic models have recently proven helpful in advancing our understanding of the mechanism of action of psychedelics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Deco and Cruzat, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Kringelbach and Cruzat, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Vohryzek et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">Vohryzek et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Herzog et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Mindlin and Herzog, 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Jobst et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Luppi et al., 2022</xref>]. However, existing computational models primarily focus on macroscale brain dynamics, overlooking critical mesoscale and microscale dynamics, such as neuronal population interactions that mediate oscillatory changes. Moreover, there is a notable lack of computational studies examining the effects of psychedelics in the context of AD.</p><p id="P9">Mesoscale modeling may be well suited to reproduce such oscillatory alterations by psychedelics in AD, as it represents an intermediate level between the macro- and micro-scale and focuses on neuronal populations and local circuits within brain regions. Computational approaches such as neural mass models (NMMs) and neural field models are frequently used in mesoscale modeling to simulate the collective behavior of neuronal populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Jansen and Rit, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Cook et al., 2022</xref>]. The laminar NMM (LaNMM) framework is a natural extension of the neural mass formalism to produce coupled fast (gamma) and slow (alpha) oscillatory activity and simulate realistic electrophysiological signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Ruffini et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Sanchez-Todo and Bastos, 2023</xref>]. It has been recently applied in the context of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Sanchez-Todo et al., 2024</xref>], showing how disrupted PV-to-pyramidal connectivity can explain the PSD alterations observed in the process of neurodegeneration in AD. Additionally, we have used the LaNMM to investigate the role of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in hierarchical predictive coding, showing how error evaluation and precision mechanisms deteriorate in AD due to disruptions of inhibitory interneuron function that impair the computation and gating of prediction errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Ruffini et al., 2025</xref>]. By capturing multiband oscillatory dynamics, the LaNMM provides a unique framework for modeling neuronal processes in conditions like AD or under exposure to psychedelics, where disruptions in slow and fast oscillatory activity are prominent.</p><p id="P10">In this study, we investigate the effects of psychedelics at the whole-brain level and their therapeutic potential in AD using the LaNMM. With multimodal data from a cohort of AD subjects, we develop personalized hybrid brain models based on the LaNMM. We hypothesize that these whole-brain models can reproduce the spectral changes observed in empirical studies of psychedelic administration, specifically a pronounced decrease in alpha power and an increase in gamma power. Given the known disruptions in oscillatory activity in AD, we hypothesize that psychedelics may counteract key spectral abnormalities associated with the disease—particularly the imbalance between alpha and gamma oscillations. Furthermore, we predict that these changes will correlate with the spatial distribution of 5-HT2A receptor expression, supporting the notion that psychedelics modulate cortical excitability in a regionally specific manner. Finally, we explore whether psychedelics enhance neural complexity and entropy, which have been proposed as markers of cognitive flexibility and may contribute to their therapeutic effects.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p id="P11">An overview of the methodology followed in this study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. We first generated subject-specific whole-brain models based on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) data from AD subjects (Stage I). We then integrated the effects of psychedelics following a positron emission tomography (PET)-informed distribution of 5-HT2AR densities and study the effects of psychedelics at the whole-brain level in the cohort of AD subjects (Stage II). We used such models to evaluate the changes in oscillatory activity at the cortical level. Finally, we combined such whole-brain models with a biophysical layer to simulate realistic electrophysiological activity (i.e., EEG) under psychedelics (Stage III), and evaluate changes in alpha and gamma power and complexity metrics.</p><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Laminar neural mass model implementation</title><p id="P12">The LaNMM consists of two coupled neural masses—a Jansen-Rit (JR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Jansen and Rit, 1995</xref>] and a pyramidal-interneuron-gamma (PING) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Börgers et al., 2008</xref>]— to simulate both slow and fast oscillations in a cortical column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Sanchez-Todo and Bastos, 2023</xref>].

This decrease is significant across all EEG channels, and highly significant decreases in alpha power (p &lt; 0.001) were consistently observed in all subjects and in all brain lobes. On the other hand, we found a significant increase in the EEG gamma band power after 5-HT2AR stimulation (37% mean gamma PSD increase with respect to baseline averaged over subjects and EEG channels). This increase is significant across all EEG channels and was consistently observed in all subjects.</p><p id="P55">It is worth mentioning that the cortical distribution of alpha and gamma activity in the synthetic EEG may not fully align with the spectral features typically observed in the EEG of healthy or AD individuals. The reduced oscillatory activity in both alpha and gamma frequencies in the parietal regions may be explained by the fact that the whole-brain models developed in this study were not personalized based on EEG data but on fMRI data. Inspection of the connectivity matrix revealed that this reduced EEG power can be mostly explained by a saturation of the connections to the parietal lobe. Indeed, the parietal lobe acts as a network hub, and the neural populations in this lobe receive high inputs and consequently often show saturated activity in the model. This hinders the emergence of oscillatory activity in alpha and gamma frequencies, resulting in the decreased alpha and gamma power observed in the parietal and parieto-frontal areas.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><label>3.6</label><title>Simulated EEG complexity and entropy</title><p id="P56">Next, we used different metrics to capture the complexity of the simulated EEG signals obtained from the personalized hybrid brain models under psychedelics.

The normalized LZW complexity (<italic>ρ</italic><sub>0</sub>) of EEG signals in subjects under psychedelics was significantly higher than at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8a</xref>), demonstrating that the oscillatory changes induced by psychedelics in the whole-brain models lead to increased complexity of the signals.</p><p id="P57">This was further highlighted by the significant increase in spectral entropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8b</xref>) and entropy rate at different Markov orders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8c</xref>). The normalized LZW complexity reflects the structural richness of the signal, while the spectral entropy indicates a more uniform power distribution across frequencies, consistent with increased neural variability mainly explained by the decreased power in the alpha band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). The entropy rate at different orders provides a measure of the temporal predictability of the EEG signals, highlighting how psychedelics induce more diverse oscillatory patterns in the models.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S19" sec-type="discussion"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S20"><label>4.1</label><title>Main findings</title><p id="P58">Our modeling implementation of psychedelics’ effects into NMMs successfully explains the power spectrum typically observed after administration of psychedelics in the experimental literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Carhart-Harris and Leech, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Ort et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Timmermann et al., 2023</xref>].

Consequently, and consistent with our initial hypothesis, the significantly reduced alpha power and increased gamma power observed under the influence of psychedelics are mainly explained in our modeling framework by the agonism of these drugs on 5-HT2A receptors and the magnitude and spatial distribution of their effects are directly related to the expression amounts of such serotonin receptors.</p><p id="P60">Our findings align with experimental evidence linking psychedelics to enhanced neural entropy and complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Ruffini et al., 2023</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Carhart-Harris and Leech, 2014</xref>], and support the potential therapeutic role of psychedelics in restoring the complexity deficits observed in AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abásolo et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Sun et al., 2020</xref>].

The ability of our whole-brain models to reproduce these effects highlights their utility in exploring the neural mechanisms underlying psychedelic-induced changes and their potential for counteracting pathological states associated with reduced complexity.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><label>4.2</label><title>Potential therapeutic role of psychedelics in AD</title><p id="P61">Our results suggest that psychedelics may acutely mitigate EEG spectral alterations characteristic of AD, reinforcing their therapeutic potential for this neurodegenerative condition. The spectral shifts induced by psychedelics in our models may counteract the disrupted alpha-gamma coupling and oscillatory imbalances observed in AD induced by PV dysfunction, potentially improving functional connectivity and cognition. These results indicate that psychedelics may hold therapeutic potential in the AD stages characterized by alpha power increases and reduced gamma power (prodromal and mild AD).</p><p id="P621">However, we caution that in the preclinical and very early stages of AD, cortical neurons in certain regions exhibit heightened excitability, driven partly by elevated concentrations of soluble amyloid-beta, which impairs glutamate uptake and increases extracellular glutamate levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">Zott et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bao et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Harris et al., 2020</xref>]. As activation of 5-HT2ARs by psychedelics modulates glutamate’s excitatory effects, increasing the excitability of deep-layer pyramidal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Andrade, 2011</xref>], their use under these conditions may intensify the existing hyperexcitability and accelerate pathological processes, suggesting a contraindication of such compounds during the earliest phases of AD. On the other hand, in the later stages of AD, the widespread loss of alpha and gamma power resulting from global neuronal death may render psychedelics ineffective as a treatment. This suggests there may be an optimal window for the treatment of AD with psychedelics, namely the prodromal to mild phase.</p><p id="P63">Importantly, the effects of psychedelics are not limited to their acute phase. Growing evidence highlights a post-acute phase characterized by enhanced neural plasticity, which underpins their long-term therapeutic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Ruffini et al., 2024b</xref>]. This phase involves structural and functional neural changes that can promote sustained recovery of cognitive and neural functions, which is particularly relevant for addressing the progressive degeneration seen in AD. Thus, by recalibrating neuronal excitability and oscillatory activity, psychedelics may not only acutely alleviate acute EEG abnormalities but also facilitate long-term neural reorganization and plasticity. This aligns with prior research emphasizing the role of enhanced brain functional connectivity and neuroplasticity in slowing or reversing neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Garcia-Romeu et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">Winkelman et al., 2023</xref>].</p><p id="P634">Finally, there is a natural synergy between psychedelics and non-invasive interventions such as transcranial electrical stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Sprugnoli et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Dhaynaut et al., 2022</xref>] or sensory stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Iaccarino et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Martorell et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Adaikkan et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Adaikkan and Tsai, 2020</xref>], which seek to entrain natural fast frequency circuits in AD.

Extending this approach, we used 30 subject-specific whole-brain models, integrating MRI, dMRI, and fMRI data from AD subjects, to simulate the effects of psychedelics on whole-brain dynamics following 5-HT2A receptor stimulation.</p><p id="P68">The subject-specific whole-brain models effectively reproduced the power spectrum changes observed experimentally with psychedelics, notably the significant decreases in alpha and beta power and increases in gamma power.

In Stage I, we generate personalized whole-brain models based on the LaNMM using multimodal data from a cohort of AD patients. In Stage II, we simulated the effects of psychedelics in the personalized models using the distribution of 5-HT2A receptors obtained from PET, and evaluated the oscillatory changes at the cortical level.
