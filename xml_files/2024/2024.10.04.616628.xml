These functions are underpinned by specific structural sub-elements whose functions have been under investigation since many years. The A-C linker structure, connecting adjacent microtubule triplets in the proximal region, has remained unexplored due to its unknown composition. Here, using ultrastructure expansion microscopy, we characterized two recently identified A-C linker proteins, CCDC77 and WDR67, along with a newly discovered protein, MIIP. Our findings reveal that these proteins localize between microtubule triplets at the A-C linker, forming a complex. Depletion of A-C linker components disrupt microtubule triplet cohesion, leading to breakage at the proximal end. Co-removal of the A-C linker and the inner scaffold demonstrates their joint role in maintaining centriole architecture. Moreover, we uncover an unexpected function of the A-C linker in centriole duplication through torus regulation, underscoring the interplay between these protein modules.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>A-C linker</kwd><kwd>centriole</kwd><kwd>expansion microscopy</kwd><kwd>centriole duplication</kwd><kwd>torus</kwd><kwd>PCM</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>ciliogenesis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Centrioles are evolutionarily conserved macromolecular complexes critical for a wide range of fundamental cellular processes, including cell division, motility, and signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In dividing cells, two centrioles are embedded within the pericentriolar matrix, together forming the centrosome, which acts as a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) essential for the accurate segregation of genetic material into daughter cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. During ciliogenesis, centrioles, functioning as basal bodies, dock to the plasma membrane, initiating the formation of cilia or flagella—cellular extensions that serve as sensory antennas or drivers of fluid and cell movement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Each sub-structural component of the centriole has a highly specific role in these biological processes. Human centrioles exhibit a nine-fold symmetrical, microtubule-based cylindrical structure, measuring approximately 450 nm in length and 250 nm in diameter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. They are polarized along a proximal-distal axis, with distinct architectural features at each end. The distal extremity, about 50 nm long, contains microtubule doublets and is decorated with subdistal and distal appendages crucial for ciliogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The central core region spans approximately 250 nm where lies an inner scaffold, which is critical for maintaining centriole cohesion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Proximally, the cartwheel structure, approximately 150 nm long, is essential for centriole duplication and imparts the nine-fold symmetry of the organelle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The cartwheel is connected to the microtubule triplets (MTTs), consisting of a complete A-microtubule and incomplete B- and C-microtubules, via the pinhead structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Neighboring proximal MTTs are bridged by the A-C linker, a structural element spanning 35-45% of the centriole length <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Although its function remains enigmatic, it is hypothesized to contribute to the structural cohesion of the centriole <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Additionally, the proximal region is encircled by an amorphous torus, composed in part of CEP152 and CEP63, which plays a key role in recruiting PLK4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. PLK4 phosphorylates STIL to initiate cartwheel formation through SAS-6 oligomerization, and procentriole assembly during the S phase, concurrent with DNA replication <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Despite advances in understanding the molecular composition and function of various centriole components, including the cartwheel, inner scaffold, and distal appendages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, the A-C linker structure has remained poorly characterized since its initial description in the 1960s <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. The evolutionary conserved protein POC1 (Proteome Of Centriole 1) has been suggested as a component of the A-C linker, but its localization appears species-specific. For instance, in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, POC1 is thought to localize to the proximal region of centrioles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, while in human osteosarcoma cells, we have demonstrated that POC1B is a central core component <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. More recently, cryo-tomography analysis of POC1 in <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> proposed that POC1 is associated with the microtubule triplets, rather than the A-C linker, and is required for centriole structural integrity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">To elucidate the molecular identity of the A-C linker, we employed ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM), a technique that enables nanoscale protein mapping of centrioles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. We previously screened 23 candidate proteins in mature centrioles from U2OS cells, and identified two poorly uncharacterized proteins, CCDC77 and WDR67, as putative A-C linker components <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Building on these findings, we aimed to unravel the function of the A-C linker. In addition to CCDC77 and WDR67, we identified a novel A-C linker component, MIIP (migration and invasion inhibitory protein). Using U-ExM in combination with cell biology approaches, we revealed two crucial functions of the A-C linker proteins—CCDC77, WDR67, and MIIP—in centriole cohesion but also in duplication through torus assembly. Collectively, this study establishes the role of the A-C linker in centriole function, offering a foundation for exploring its broader significance in cellular architecture and division processes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>MIIP, together with CCDC77 and WDR67, localizes at A-C linker level in human centrioles</title><p id="P7">We identified recently CCDC77 and WDR67 as two putative A-C linker components <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. CCDC77 is a long coiled coil protein of 77KDa, and WDR67, also known as TBC1D31, is a 125 KDa protein containing 7 WD repeats, a 170 amino acid Rab-GAP-TBC domain, several coiled coil regions, and a C-terminal tail that mediates direct interaction with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase praja2 (PJA2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. We first capitalized on these two proteins to ask whether other proteins could be part of the A-C linker. To explore this, we conducted a cross DepMap analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, which revealed co-dependencies between genes expression, specifically focusing on the relationships between CCDC77 and WDR67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Among the top 100 genes, we identified 12 that shared co-dependencies with CCDC77 and WDR67: WDR8, SPICE1, CEP135, TUBE1, TUBD1, TEDC2, RTTN (rotatin), CEP44, CEP295, PP1R35, CEP152, and MIIP. Notably, 11 out of these 12 genes encode characterized centriolar proteins, most of which localize to the proximal end of the centriole. The exception is MIIP (Migration and Invasion Inhibitory Protein, also known as IIP45), a poorly characterized protein known for its role in inhibiting cell migration and invasion via its interaction with the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Although MIIP was previously detected in centrosome mass spectrometry analyses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, it has not been characterized at the centriole level. Consequently, we decided to focus on MIIP for further investigation.</p><p id="P8">We first monitored the localization of MIIP at centrioles in U2OS cells using regular immunofluorescence microscopy. Our results confirmed that MIIP is consistently associated with centrioles throughout the cell cycle both in interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Using U-ExM to further gain in resolution and by staining for tubulin as a proxy for the centriolar microtubule wall, we found that MIIP localizes to the proximal region of centrioles and corresponds thus to be <italic>a bona fide</italic> centriolar component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data Fig. 1c</xref>). Next, to further investigate whether MIIP could be a component of the A-C linker, we analyzed MIIP’s longitudinal localization in the proximal region and revealed that it spans 37% +/- 9 of the total centriole length, similarly to CCDC77 and WDR67’s coverages of 36% +/- 10 and 39% +/- 9 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-f</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The analysis of MIIP radial position relative to the microtubule wall showed that it localizes at the level of the MTT compared to the tubulin center of mass signal (-10 nm +/- 6), close to the values of CCDC77 (-4 nm +/- 5) and WDR67 (3 nm +/- 8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Next using time series reconstructions of centriole assembly using tubulin as a proxy as we previously established <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, we monitored the appearance and elongation of MIIP. Like observed for CCDC77 and WDR67, we found that MIIP is recruited on procentrioles when the average tubulin length reaches around 115 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h, i</xref>), a length which marks the beginning of the elongation phase during centriole assembly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Finally, to determine whether MIIP is positioned between microtubule triplets, where the A-C linker is expected to reside, we analyzed its distribution using U-ExM in top-viewed centrioles. A plot profile analysis revealed that MIIP forms 9 distinct foci, consistent with localization between the microtubule triplets, like the pattern seen with CCDC77 and WDR67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref>). However, due the 20 nm distance between microtubule triplets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> and the 60-70 nm resolution of U-ExM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, we employed iterative expansion microscopy (iU-ExM) to achieve a higher resolution of 10 nm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. This higher resolution confirmed that MIIP, along with CCDC77 and WDR67, is indeed localized between the microtubule triplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that MIIP is a novel component of the A-C linker in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1l</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Co-dependency of CCDC77, WDR67 and MIIP complex</title><p id="P10">The A-C linker is a conserved centriole structural element whose complexity revealed in cryo-tomography suggests that it is composed by several proteins and that probably have multiple intricate interactions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Therefore, we wondered whether the loss of one of the three components identified in this study could lead to the destabilization of the others. To test this, we monitored the localization of CCDC77, WDR67 and MIIP in cells depleted of each of the individual components using siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data Fig. 1a-d</xref>). We initially validated the specificity of each staining and the efficacy of each siRNA treatment by monitoring the overall centrosomal signals corresponding to CCDC77, WDR67, and MIIP in siCCDC77, siWDR67, and siMIIP conditions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-i</xref>). Consistently with these proteins being structurally incorporated inside centrioles, we observed that the three proteins were mostly depleted from one centriole (53.4% in siCCDC77, 63.5% in siWDR67 and 51.7% in siMIIP), and more rarely in both centrioles (22.6% in siCCDC77, 29.5% in siWDR67 and 8.2% in siMIIP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e, g, i</xref>). This result suggests that these proteins are stably incorporated and only the newly formed centriole is depleted. To discriminate between the mother and daughter centrioles, we co-stained cells depleted for CCDC77, WDR67 or MIIP with CEP164 (yellow arrow), a distal appendage protein present on mother centrioles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> and the respective A-C linker proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a-d</xref>). We found that the depletion occurred at the level of the daughter centrioles in the three conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a-d</xref>), confirming that these three proteins are stably incorporated components of the centriole and mainly new centrioles assembled in the absence of the proteins are depleted.</p><p id="P11">Next, we monitored the impact of the depletion of the three A-C linker proteins on the localization of each other. Interestingly, we found that CCDC77 signal was strongly reduced upon siWDR67 but only mildly upon MIIP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, d</xref>). Reciprocally, the fluorescent signal corresponding to WDR67 was strongly reduced upon siCCDC77 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, f</xref>). This result suggests that WDR67 and CCDC77 proteins are interdependent for their localization at the proximal region of centrioles. In contrast to CCDC77 however, we found that WDR67 localization was greatly impaired in siMIIP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, f</xref>), indicating that WDR67 localization at centrioles relies both on CCDC77 and MIIP. We next assess if MIIP localization was affected by CCDC77 or WDR67 depletion. Consistently, we found that MIIP distribution at centrioles was strongly reduced upon WDR67 depletion but only moderately upon CCDC77 depletion, probably as an indirect effect of the partial loss of WDR67 in that condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, h</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To further investigate whether the three identified A-C linker protein could interact and being part of the same complex, we used a microtubule displacement assay as previously published <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. We found that mcherry-CCDC77 binds microtubules (M) upon transient transfection in U2OS cells, in contrast to GFP-WDR67 and GFP-MIIP that stay cytoplasmic (C) or at the level of the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j-l</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig 1e</xref>). To assess whether CCDC77 can facilitate the displacement of WDR67 and MIIP onto microtubules, we co-transfected these proteins with mCherry-CCDC77. Remarkably, both GFP-WDR67 and GFP-MIIP were independently displaced onto microtubules (93% and 78%, respectively), indicating an interaction between these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2m-o</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig 1f-h</xref>). Notably, MIIP recruitment to microtubules was enhanced in the presence of WDR67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2p, q</xref>), suggesting that the three proteins can form a microtubule-associated complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2r</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>WDR67 and CCDC77 but not MIIP are important for ciliogenesis</title><p id="P13">We next investigated the function of the A-C linker components. CCDC77 and WDR67 were previously shown to be important for ciliogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, suggesting a potential role for the A-C linker in cilia formation. However, since both display additional localizations besides the A-C linker, at satellites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> and at distal appendages for CCDC77 and at the proximal torus for WDR67 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, it remains unclear whether their role in ciliogenesis is directly linked to the A-C linker. Given that MIIP is exclusively localized to the A-C linker, we investigated whether it also plays a role in ciliogenesis, to directly assess the involvement of the A-C linker structure in this process.</p><p id="P14">To do so, we treated RPE1 cells with either siRNA control or siCCDC77, siWDR67 or siMIIP and analyzed the impact on ciliogenesis by counting the number of cilia formed relative to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Consistently with previous reports <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, we found that 43% of CCDC77-depleted cells and 51% of WDR67-depleted cells displayed a primary cilium stained with acetylated tubulin, in contrast to the 73% observed in control cells, indicating that both proteins are important to regulate ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a-e</xref>). Moreover, among the ciliated cells, 31% and 34% displayed shorter cilia in CCDC77-depleted and WDR67-depleted cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2f, g</xref>). However, depletion of MIIP did not impact ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2d, e</xref>), suggesting that the ciliogenesis defect observed might be triggered by a mechanism independent of the A-C linker.</p><p id="P15">To further investigate the underlying causes of this phenotype and given that CCDC77 localizes to the distal appendages of mature centrioles, we used U-ExM to examine whether this localization was affected in cells depleted of CCDC77 or WDR67, while remaining intact upon MIIP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2h-k</xref>). We observed that the distal localization of CCDC77 in RPE1 cells was significantly reduced upon depletion of CCDC77 and WDR67 but was less affected with MIIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2h, i</xref>). A similar trend was noted in U2OS cells, where the reduction of CCDC77 at distal appendages was not significant upon MIIP knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2j, k</xref>). These findings underscore a possible correlation between CCDC77 at appendages and ciliogenesis, suggesting that the ciliogenesis defects could be associated with the distal localization of CCDC77 rather than with the function of the A-C linker. In the same line, CCDC77 and WDR67 have been found at satellites, known to affect ciliogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Altogether, these results indicate that the observed ciliogenesis defect is probably not due to A-C linker removal.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The A-C linker maintains cohesion between the microtubube triplets in the proximal region</title><p id="P16">Since the A-C linker sub-element is bridging adjacent MTTs, a key prediction is that its loss would affect centriole architecture by destabilizing centriolar MTTs cohesion. To test this hypothesis, we analyze the centriole integrity using U-ExM in control and siRNA-mediated depletion of A-C linker components in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Importantly, we found that the loss of CCDC77, WDR67 or MIIP resulted in approximately 25-30% of broken centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-f</xref>, white arrows). Additionally, re-expression of RNAi-resistant version of CCDC77, WDR67 or MIIP rescued this phenotype, highlighting the specificity of the observed effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-f</xref>).</p><p id="P17">We next wondered whether the dual depletion of A-C linker components would exacerbate the phenotype. To address this, we treated U2OS cells with siRNA targeting CCDC77 and WDR67 and analyzed their centriolar phenotype by U-ExM. We found around 45% of broken centrioles in this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g, h</xref>), confirming a synergistic effect of the co-depletion. We then sought to determine whether the weakening of the microtubule wall occurs along the entire length of the centriole or is more pronounced in the proximal region, where the A-C linker is localized. To investigate this, we stained U2OS control or CCDC77/WDR67-depleted cells with anti-tubulin antibodies to mark the microtubule wall, and the distal marker CP110 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). Analysis of the percentage of structural defects in the proximal, central or distal regions revealed that more than 75% of the centrioles with structural defects exhibited breakage primarily in the proximal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>). These results indicate that the loss of A-C linker components particularly weakened the structural integrity of the proximal region of centrioles.</p><p id="P18">To further characterize this phenotype, we analyzed the ultrastructure of centrioles co-depleted for CCDC77 and WDR67 using resin-embedded electron microscopy. In control cells, centrioles displayed structurally intact and well-connected microtubule triplets with clear densities of the A-C linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3j</xref>). In contrast, serial section imaging of depleted cells revealed that the A-C linker densities are less visible at the proximal end, although the inner scaffold in the central region remained largely intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3k</xref>). In some cases, we observed central region centrioles with impaired structures, characterized by loss of MTTs and a deformed inner scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3l</xref>). These findings underscore the critical role of the A-C linker in maintaining the structural integrity and connectivity of MTTs.</p><p id="P19">Based on these results, we explored whether the observed centriole breakage could be an indirect consequence of the destabilization of other structural elements within the centriole. To address this, we examined the effects of depleting each A-C linker component on several other markers: CEP44, a protein located in the pinhead region in the proximal region of centrioles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>); CEP135 and SPICE, two proximal proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig 3b, c</xref>); and POC5 for the inner scaffold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3d</xref>). We observed that depletion of A-C linker components resulted in mild impairments to all markers, with CEP44 and CEP135’s coverages being shorter and POC5 and SPICE’s coverage slightly extended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a-h</xref>). To ensure no bias in the coverage quantification since we noticed a slight decrease in centriole size upon CCDC77 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3i</xref>), we measured the length for each marker and confirmed our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3j-m</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that the depletion of A-C linker components subtly affects centriole architecture, indicating that the observed breakage is likely directly related to the loss of the A-C linker.</p><p id="P20">Finally, given that centrioles depleted for the A-C linker exhibit breakage predominantly in the proximal region while the inner scaffold remains intact, we investigated the impact of simultaneously removing these structures by co-depleting POC5, a component of the inner scaffold, and WDR67, an A-C linker component. Strikingly, 81% of centrioles were broken upon POC5 and WDR67 co-depletion in contrast to the 25-30% broken centrioles in the single depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3m-p</xref>). This result demonstrates the complementary role of both the A-C linker and inner scaffold structures in maintaining MTT connection and centriole architecture integrity. Interestingly, we noticed that some impaired centrioles appeared to be maintained distally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3o, q</xref>, white triangle). Staining with the distal marker C2CD3, which recently was shown to localize as an internal ring inside the centriole <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>, confirmed this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3r</xref>). This suggests the existence of a third structural connector located distally at the level of the microtubule doublet, which may contribute to the overall cohesion of the centriole along its proximal-distal axis.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Depletion of A-C linker proteins impairs centriole duplication</title><p id="P21">Since the A-C linker is in the proximal region of centrioles and that centriole duplication arise from that region, we wondered whether the loss of the three A-C linker components could also impact centriole duplication. We first analyzed the number of centrin dots in mitosis as a marker of centriole duplication using immunofluorescence microscopy. We found that 52%, 59% and 54% of cells in mitosis had less than 4 centrin dots upon depletion of A-C linker components, indicative of a defect in centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-i</xref>). To ensure that the putative centriole duplication defects was real and not reflecting solely a reduction of centrin localization itself, we turned to U-ExM and monitored directly procentriole presence using tubulin as a proxy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j-l</xref>). We found that 24% of CCDC77 siRNA, 16% of WDR67 siRNA and 28% of MIIP siRNA-treated cells displayed 2 procentrioles in contrast to 50% observed in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j-o</xref>), suggesting that the loss of these proteins impairs centriole duplication. Importantly, we verified that centriole duplication could be restored upon re-expression of an RNAi-resistant version of CCDC77, WDR67 and MIIP, ensuring the specificity of the described phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j-o</xref>). Finally, we monitored the impact of the depletion on the cell cycle and found that the depletion of the A-C linker components was not impairing the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Centriole duplication initiates around the torus, a fibrous density composed in part of CEP152 and CEP63, two proteins critical for recruiting proteins that initiate cartwheel and centriole formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. Since the A-C linker and the torus shares the same longitudinal position and length <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4p</xref>), we next tested whether CEP63 localization would be affected upon CCDC77, WDR67 or MIIP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4q, r</xref>). We found that CEP63 signal was strongly reduced in the three tested conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4q-s</xref>), unveiling an unexpected role for the A-C linker in dictating the recruitment of the CEP63 torus. Interestingly, we observed a correlation between procentriole presence and residual CEP63 signal at the base of the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4q</xref>, <bold>asterisk</bold>), indicating the robustness of centriole duplication, as even partial CEP63 signal appears sufficient to initiate procentriole formation. Collectively these results suggest that the A-C linker is not only crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of centrioles but also plays a pivotal role in ensuring the proper recruitment and localization of the torus, critical for centriole duplication mechanism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P23">The A-C linker, originally referred to as “A-C connections” by Gibbons and Grimstone in their pioneering 1960 study on flagellar structure in <italic>Trichonympha, Pseudotrichonymph</italic>a, and <italic>Holomastigotes</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, has since been widely recognized across various species, ranging from humans to <italic>Paramecium</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>, with the exception of <italic>Drosophila</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> and the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. Despite these advances, the molecular composition of the A-C linker remained enigmatic. In this manuscript, we elucidate the identity and function of three key proteins—CCDC77, WDR67, and MIIP—as integral components of the A-C linker, revealing the functional significance of the A-C linker in human centrioles. We found that the A-C linker is crucial for maintaining the cohesion between microtubule triplets at the proximal end. We also found that the loss of the A-C linker slightly influences the other centriole’s structures. By simultaneously depleting the inner scaffold and A-C linker, we demonstrated that these two substructures together protect the centriole from fragmentation in an additive manner. Furthermore, we observed that depletion specifically affected only the daughter centriole. This suggests that the incorporation of the A-C linker is stable in mature centrioles, and only daughter centrioles assembled during the previous cycle under A-C linker depletion conditions lack it. This finding indicates that centriole assembly can occur even in the absence of the A-C linker. Finally, we also found that the A-C linker depletion leads to a centriole duplication defect due to the lack of the torus assembly in the newly formed centrioles lacking the A-C linkers. We conclude that the A-C linker has two critical functions at centriole level, microtubule cohesion and torus anchoring.</p><p id="P24">Previous study in cryo-electron tomography unraveled the high-resolution structure of the A-C linker in its native state in several species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. These works demonstrated the complexity of this structural element that is composed of a A-link and a C-link, connected through a trunk <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The whole structure is 15-20 nm long and is repeated every 8-8.5 nm along the microtubule triplets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. The molecular weight of WDR67 is around 124 KDa, 57KDa for CCDC77, and 43KDa for MIIP, for a total of 224 KDa. It is therefore possible that these three proteins constitute a large part of the A-C linker although it would be interesting in the future to determine whether other components are part of this sub-structural element. Our DepMap analysis identified other possible candidates, some already well characterized. It will be important later on to focus on these proteins in order to decipher the full molecular composition of the A-C linker. We have identified that CCDC77 associates with microtubules, suggesting that this protein is either involved in A-linker interaction with the A-microtubule or C-linker interaction with the C-microtubule. To determine its position, it will be necessary to develop super-resolution tools to pinpoint precisely which side the protein is on, or to increase the resolution of cryo-ET maps in order to place this protein unambiguously.</p><p id="P25">The role of the A-C linker in maintaining cohesion between the A and C microtubules of adjacent triplets has been proposed for some time. Our study confirms this role by identifying its components and demonstrating that the loss of the A-C linker results in breaks in the microtubule triplets at the proximal end. Unexpectedly, we discovered a second function of the A-C linker in torus anchoring. It has been well established that procentriole formation occurs proximally to the mature centriole. This duplication is enabled by the torus located in this region. Our observations revealed a positional correlation between the A-C linker and the torus. Removal of the A-C linker prevents torus recruitment, but intriguingly, partial depletion of the A-C linker is sufficient to recruit a reduced amount of torus and initiate procentriole duplication. These findings suggest that the A-C linker is crucial for defining the torus’s position at the proximal side of the mature centriole. Further studies are needed to investigate whether the displacement of A-C linker components affects procentriole duplication and to elucidate the significance of spatial positioning in centriole biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Human cell lines and cell culture</title><p id="P26">Human bone osteosarcoma U2OS cells (ATCC-HTB-96) and retinal pigment epithelial cells hTERT RPE-1 (ATCC-CRL-4000) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and GlutaMAX, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.

Only raw data were used for intensity measurements, otherwise only deconvolved images were used for representations and quantifications. Measurements of the length, the relative position, and the coverage of centriolar proteins were done as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Briefly, images were resized by decreasing the pixel size by 6 to improve the precision by using the plugin “CropAndResize”. The fluorescent signal distribution of tubulin and the protein of interest were measured using the Fiji line scan and the plugin “PickCentrioleDim” to easily select the start and the end of the fluorescent signal defined as 50% of the peak value at both extremities of the centriole. For all the measures, the tubulin was defined as the reference protein, and its starting coordinate was shifted and set to 0. The same shift was applied to the protein of interest to keep the correct distances between the 2 proteins. The gel expansion factor was applied to all measures before plotting them using GraphPad Prism10. Graphs of the relative average position of the protein of interest according to the tubulin signal were done using the plugin “CentrioleGraph”. For the quantification of the broken phenotype, the number of cells with broken centrioles was manually quantified under the microscope when both or one of the two centrioles per cell were deformed/abnormal or with missing part of the centriole or only blades of microtubules.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Expansion factor</title><p id="P41">For each experiment, the expanded gel is precisely measured with a caliper and the calculated expansion factor is applied in every quantification. Values presented in graphs and scale bars always correspond to “real” values after the application of the expansion factor.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>siRNA</title><p id="P42">siRNA efficiency was evaluated manually at the level of the centriole from cells in either G1 (two centrioles) or S/G (four centrioles) phase. The intensity was increased to the maximum, and the signal was monitored. For the measurement of the protein of interest intensity from regular IF or U-ExM, a pixel square with always the same size in between IF measures or in between U-ExM measures was positioned around the centrosome/centriole or in the vicinity to evaluate the background and mean intensity was measured in both regions. Background value was subtracted, and data were plotted as mean intensity values. Data were classified into three categories: signal on the two mature centrioles when all the centrioles were positive for the protein of interest, only one of the two mature centrioles was positive, and completely depleted when the protein of interest was absent from all the mature centrioles.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P43">Statistical analyses were performed using Excel or Prism10 (GraphPad version 10.2.3 (403), April 21, 2024) and all data are expressed as the mean (average) +/- standard deviation (SD). The comparison of the two groups was performed using an unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test or its non-parametric correspondent, the Mann–Whitney test, if normality was not granted because rejected by the Pearson test. The comparisons of more than two groups were made using one-way ANOVAs for one interaction factor or two-way ANOVAs for several interaction factors followed by multiple comparison tests as indicated in the corresponding Data files to identify all the significant group differences. N indicates independent biological replicates from distinct samples. Every experiment was performed at least three times independently on different biological samples unless specified. No statistical method was used to estimate the sample size. Data are all represented as scatter dot plots with the centerline as mean, except for some percentage quantifications, which are represented as histogram bars. The graphs with error bars indicate SD (+/-) and the significance level is denoted as usual (*P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001, ****P &lt; 0.0001).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="extended-data" id="S25"><title>Extended Data</title><fig id="F6" position="anchor"><label>Extended Data Figure 1</label><caption><title>Depletion efficiency and microtubule binding</title><p id="P44"><bold>(a-c)</bold> Widefield images of expanded U2OS centrioles in longitudinal view stained for α/β tubulin (magenta) and CCDC77+CEP164 (cyan) (a), WDR67 + CEP164 (cyan) (b) or MIIP+ CEP164 (c) in the following conditions: siCTRL (a-c) and siCCDC77 (a), siWDR67 (b) or siMIIP (c).
