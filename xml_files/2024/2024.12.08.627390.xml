Rehabilitative physical exercise is a promising approach to overcome such functional impairment and the metabolic sensor AMPK has emerged to be a critical mediator for this. However, the mechanistic understanding of upstream and downstream components of AMPK signalling in the physical exercise-mediated enhancement of axon regeneration is not clear. We combined swimming exercise with laser axotomy of posterior lateral microtubule (PLM) neurons of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to address this question. We found that direct activation of AMPK through AICAR treatment is sufficient to improve axon regeneration and functional recovery. The PAR-4/Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) acts upstream of AMPK to enhance functional recovery following swimming exercise. Using genetics, tissue-specific RNAi, and AICAR treatment, we found that the transcriptional regulators DAF-16 and MDT-15 act downstream of AMPK in mediating the positive effects of swimming. We found that MDT-15 acts in neuron to mediate the benefit of AMPK activation in axon regeneration, whereas DAF-16 acts both in neuron and muscle to promote regrowth downstream to AMPK. We also showed that swimming exercise induces nuclear localization of DAF-16 in an AMPK-dependent manner. Our results showed that neuronal and non-neuronal arms of AMPK signalling play an integrative role in response to physical exercise to promote functional recovery after axon injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>PLM neuron</kwd><kwd>Axon regeneration</kwd><kwd>AMPK</kwd><kwd>DAF-16</kwd><kwd>MDT-15</kwd><kwd>Functional recovery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Classification</title><kwd>Biological Sciences (Neurosciences)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Central nervous system (CNS) injury like traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) is a growing socio-economical challenge due to their devastating consequences on quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Injury to the CNS axons hamper information transfer resulting in functional impairment because of axon regeneration failure due to extrinsic and neuron-intrinsic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). In the model systems of axon regeneration study, the manipulation of a single regulator can only provide limited functional recovery, which demands a combinatorial strategy for achieving desired functional recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Clinically validated rehabilitative therapy involving physical exercise is promising for functional recovery and can be combined with other regeneration-enhancing strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Physical exercise has well-documented beneficial effects on health parameters such as improvement in motor function, cognitive function, memory and neurogenesis in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Physical exercise also leads to improved functional recovery and axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). However, the cellular and molecular mechanism of how physical exercise improves axon regeneration and functional recovery is still unclear.</p><p id="P3">The metabolic sensor AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is a key mediator of the positive effects of exercise(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) including axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). It acts as a cellular energy sensor and regulates energy homeostasis by monitoring the ATP level through the competitive AMP/ATP binding in the γ subunit that regulates its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). AMPK is also essential for swimming exercise-mediated improvement in behavioural recovery, fitness preservation and muscle health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Phosphorylation of Thr172 in the α subunit is critical for AMPK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) and it is mediated by the upstream kinase Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) and CAMKK2 (also known as CAMKKβ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The activated AMPK normally inhibits the anabolic processes while activating catabolic processes to maintain energy homeostasis by direct phosphorylation of key metabolic enzymes and also by regulating several transcription factors for restoring energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). How AMPK signalling regulates axon regeneration, especially following a physical exercise paradigm is not well understood. Emerging evidence of the tissue-specific role of AMPK and the cross-tissue interaction of this signalling demands further mechanistic understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p><p id="P4"><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is an excellent model system to address this gap as it has been a well-established axon regeneration model for the last two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Also, a physical exercise paradigm involving swimming mimics major features of mammalian exercise in worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Regeneration studies in multiple neurons including gentle touch sensory neuron and motor neuron has revealed positive and negative regulators of axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Calcium and DLK-1 MAP kinase signalling promotes axon regeneration while guidance factors and <italic>let-7</italic> microRNA inhibit axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Axon regeneration in the early stages of life in both motor and touch neuron leads to functional recovery. However, functional rewiring is strongly inhibited in older age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Interestingly, swimming exercise following axotomy in PLM neuron promote axon regrowth and functional restoration in older age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The beneficial effect of swimming in axon regeneration depends on the metabolic sensor AMPK/AAK-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In this study, we utilised the combined paradigm of laser-induced PLM neuron axon injury, swimming exercise, genetics and pharmacology to identify the upstream and downstream components of AMPK signalling in the improvement of axon regeneration through swimming exercise. We established that acute activation of AMPK using AICAR treatment mimics the effect of exercise for improving behavioural recovery. Further, we found that LKB1/PAR-4 is a key upstream molecule activating AMPK after swimming exercise. Our results also show that FOXO/DAF-16 and MDT-15/PGC1α- are key downstream transcriptional mediators through which AMPK promotes functional rewiring after axotomy. Nuclear localization of DAF-16 is enhanced following a swimming session in an AAK-2-dependent manner. Further, using tissue-specific RNAi, we demonstrated that DAF-16 is required in both muscle and neuron to regulate rewiring events while MDT-15 is required only in neurons. Our study revealed neuron-specific and non-neuronal integrative roles of AMPK signalling arms in physical exercise-mediated enhancement of axon regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>AMPK activation through AICAR treatment improves functional recovery after laser-induced PLM axon injury</title><p id="P6">Following an axonal injury, physical exercise improves functional recovery and axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). A single session of 90-minute swimming improves functional recovery following laser axotomy of <italic>C. elegans</italic> posterior gentle touch sensory (PLM) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The metabolic sensor AMPK/AAK-2 (AMPK α subunit) is essential for this improvement of functional restoration due to swimming exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B-C</xref>) as seen before (Kumar et al 2021). However, whether the direct activation of AMPK would replace the swimming session itself to promote functional recovery is not clear. The functional recovery is assessed in terms of the ‘recovery index’ which is determined by the ratio of the Posterior Touch Response Index (PTRI) value obtained at 24 h to the PTRI value at 3h post-axotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). We used AICAR as an agonist reported to directly activate AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) and also previously used in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). The temporary paralysis of worms during a swimming session by brief levamisole exposure before the session begins blocks the beneficial effects of exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). We tested three concentrations of acute AICAR treatment in this set-up and observed that 1 mM AICAR treatment improved the recovery index significantly at the L4 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-E</xref>). However, such enhancement in functional recovery is not observed in <italic>aak-2(lf)</italic> animals suggesting that the enhancement occurs through AMPK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>). The recovery index is significantly reduced in day 3 adult (A3) axon injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) as seen before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Interestingly, acute AICAR treatment could overcome this age-related decline in recovery index at A3 stage axotomy experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1E</xref>). AICAR treatment also improved regrowth length at 24 h post-axotomy signifying enhanced axon regeneration process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). Similarly, in the background with a constitutively active AAK-2 (CA-aak-2) mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), the functional recovery after axon injury is significantly enhanced as compared to wildtype both in L4 and adulthood day 3 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1G</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Conversely, treatment with Dorsomorphin (Compound C), which is a well-known inhibitor of AMPK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>) during the swimming session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>) blocked the enhanced functional recovery due to the swimming session, validating AMPK activation as a key mediator of swimming exercise benefits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We wanted to test the effect of AICAR treatment in an alternate functional recovery paradigm, which also utilizes the AMPK function. For example, the Posterior touch response index decreases significantly as the worm ages from day-4 adult stage (A4) to day-5 adult stage (A5) and when the worms are subjected to a 90-minute swimming session at A4 stage this decline was not observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>) as seen before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). AICAR treatment to temporarily paralyzed A4 stage worms resulted in the preservation of posterior gentle touch response in the A5 stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B-C</xref>). Also, brief treatment of dorsomorphin during the swimming session hinders the preservation of PTRI conferred by swimming exercise (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1D-E</xref>). These results established AMPK as a key regulator of exercise’s effect on axon regeneration and a promising therapeutic target.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Liver kinase B1/PAR-4 acts upstream of AMPK in swimming-mediated enhancement of axon regeneration</title><p id="P9">We wanted to identify the enzyme that acts upstream of AMKP during swimming exercise, that promotes axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2A</xref>). The AMPK enzyme is phosphorylated at the Threonine-172 position during physical exercise either by the liver kinase B1 or by CAMKK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). In worms, the orthologues for liver kinase B1 and CAMKK2 are known as PAR-4 and CKK-1, respectively. The scaffolding protein PRY-1 or AXL-1, the worm orthologue of Axin is a key mediator of LKB-1 phosphorylation of AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We found that in the absence of either <italic>ckk-1</italic> or <italic>axl-1</italic>, the recovery index is elevated significantly due to swimming exercise similar to the wild-type group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2A-B</xref>). The regrowth at 24 h post-axotomy in these mutants is also comparable to wild-type condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2C</xref>), which ruled out the function of CKK-1 and AXL-1 in swimming exercise-mediated improvement in behavioural recovery. The aging paradigm of functional recovery also supported this finding as improved PTRI at day 5 adults was observed with swimming in <italic>ckk-1</italic> or <italic>axl-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D-E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Since the absence of <italic>par-4</italic> leads to embryonic lethality (Kemphues et al., 1988), to test the role of PAR-4, we took advantage of a temperature-sensitive allele of <italic>par-4</italic>, which displays mutant phenotype when shifted to 25ºC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) (Watts et al., 2000). We saw a significant enhancement in the recovery index in the wild-type animals due to a swimming session at 25º C whereas such enhanced improvement was perturbed significantly in the <italic>par-4(ts)</italic> worms at 25ºC temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2C</xref>). Although the basal level axon regeneration length is comparable to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2D-E</xref>), swimming-mediated increment in regrowth length is not observed in <italic>par-4(ts)</italic> as opposed to wild-type condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2D-E</xref>). In the assay for swimming-mediated improved touch sensation of aged worms, significant enhancement in PTRI of day 5 <italic>par-4(ts)</italic> animals was observed only at permissive (15ºC) temperature but not at the non-permissive (25ºC) temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F-G</xref>).To test whether <italic>par-4</italic> acts upstream of the activation of AMPK, we evaluated the effect of <italic>par-4(ts)</italic> in the background of constitutively active AAK-2. We found that constitutively active AAK-2 in the <italic>par-4(ts)</italic> background still shows an improved recovery at non-permissive 25ºC at the comparable level to the active AAK-2 background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2F</xref>). However, activation of AMPK through AICAR treatment in the <italic>par-4(ts)</italic> mutant fails to mimic the exercise’s effect in axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2H-I</xref>). Also, only at 15º C, an improvement in Posterior Touch Response was observed in aged animals following AICAR treatment but not at 25º C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2J-K</xref>).</p><p id="P12">This supports the role of PAR-4 in AICAR-mediated AMPK activation similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The knockdown of <italic>pry-1</italic> using RNAi perturbs swimming session-mediated enhancement in functional recovery following axotomy of PLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). These results showed that PAR-4/ LKB-1 and its scaffold PRY-1 are required for swimming exercise-mediated enhancement in sensory function in older age and also in behavioural recovery through axon regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Transcriptional regulators, DAF-16 and MDT-15 mediate AMPK’s beneficial effects after swimming exercise</title><p id="P13">The activation of AMPK following physical exercise leads to an adaptive response by regulating transcription factors along with acute metabolic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>).

AMPK also regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and transcription by directly phosphorylating peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), an important transcriptional coactivator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). In worms, a direct ortholog of PGC-1α is not reported but MDT-15 acts as a functional ortholog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). We assessed these molecule’s role using loss of function mutants in swimming exercise-mediated functional improvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The absence of either <italic>crh-1</italic> or <italic>hda-4</italic> did not affect the enhancement in recovery index through swimming exercise (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3A</xref>) ruling out the roles of CREB and HDAC5 in this process.

The swimming quality represented by thrashing frequency is comparable to the wild type for both groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S3C</xref>). The absence of enhanced PTRI of aged <italic>daf-16(lf)</italic> animals following swimming, strengthened the role DAF-16 being a mediator of exercise’s beneficial effects.

This result acts as proof of principle that activation of non-neuronal AMPK can boost the functional recovery after axon regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Swimming session promotes nuclear entry of DAF-16 through AMPK</title><p id="P20">To assay whether the swimming session directly affects DAF-16, we looked at the localization of the CRISPR-tagged endogenous DAF-16::mKate2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>) before and after an exercise session. Usually DAF-16:: mKate2 is localized in many tissues including neurons in the nerve ring area (white arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>) as reported before. There is a nuclear pattern of localization throughout various tissues. We found that following a 90-minute swimming session, the nuclear localization pattern becomes prominent in various tissues including muscle cells as compared to the control condition (Yellow arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A-B</xref>). The round-shaped nuclear pattern was prominent in the post-swimming group for the wild-type background, which was not seen in the <italic>aak-2(lf)</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6A-B</xref>). The nuclear localization is observed in several tissues including body wall muscle and intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B-C</xref>).</p><p id="P21">We also assayed the effect of swimming exercise on the localization of DAF-16::mKate2 in the PLM neurone before and after the swimming session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D</xref>). We noticed that following a swimming session, localization of DAF-16::mKate2 is increased in the cell body (dotted trace, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). Diffusible GFP expressed in touch neuron was used as a control to quantify the relative change in DAF-16::mKate2 localization in the cell body of PLM. We found that in the wild-type background, the ratio of DAF-16::mKate2 vs GFP is increased in the post-swimming group as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). Such increment was not observed in the aak-2 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6D-E</xref>). This finding shows that DAF-16 is regulated by AMPK following swimming exercise through AMPK signalling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">In this study, we have shown that the metabolic energy sensor AMP Kinase is activated through Liver Kinase B-1/ PAR-4 during the swimming exercise, which in turn activates two signalling axes, one in neuron and the other in muscle tissues. The FOXO family transcription factor DAF-16 acts both in neuron and muscle, whereas PGCα/MDT-15 exclusively acts in neuron to mediate the beneficial effects of swimming exercise in functional rewiring of injured PLM axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig.7</xref>). Excitingly, both of these signalling arms could be activated by AMPK agonist AICR as exercise mimetic. Our analysis indicates the neuronal roles of DAF-16 and MDT-15 in speeding up the regenerative response including enhanced regrowth from the injured axon stump and enhanced ventral targeting, which leads to behavioural recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). The behavioural recovery after the axon regeneration response is a cumulative readout of the axon regrowth, circuit rewiring and neuromuscular response.</p><p id="P23">AMPK is a master regulator for maintaining cellular energetic balance by regulating ATP production and expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). AMPK activation after exercise has been linked to the regulation of system metabolism and health benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). The finding that it is required for swimming exercise-mediated enhanced functional recovery after axon injury and averted functional decline due to ageing in <italic>C.elegans</italic> supports its conserved role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). It is also required for swimming-mediated preservation of physical fitness during ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Immunoblot analysis of activated AMPK (p-AMPK) shows significantly high activation after swimming exercise in <italic>C.elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). In this study, we found that acute activation of AMPK through AICAR treatment improved functional recovery after axon injury mimicking swimming exercise. In contrast, inhibition of AMPK activation through dorsomorphin blocked such enhancement by swimming session. This strengthens AMPK as a major regulatory hub for exercise-mediated beneficial effects. More interestingly, it puts AMPK activation through an AICAR-like agonist as a promising strategy to improve axon regeneration following an injury. AICAR treatment in mice leads to improvement in cognition and motor coordination both in the young and aged stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). AICAR treatment can be pursued further in other models for developing an axon regeneration improvement strategy.</p><p id="P24">AMPK activation is a highly regulated process that requires upstream factors including the kinases that phosphorylate the T172 position. Using a temperature-sensitive mutant of PAR-4/LKB-1, we found that it is required for swimming-associated improvement in both ageing and axon regeneration. Upregulation of LKB-1 in mouse CNS resulted in improved axon regeneration and enhanced locomotor functional recovery partly through AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). Our finding that PAR-4 is required for swimming-mediated recovery in posterior gentle touch response supports its axon regeneration-promoting role.</p><p id="P25">Activated AMPK regulates and restores energy balance by regulating metabolism acutely as well as initiating an adaptive response. AMPK regulates the activity of diverse downstream molecules regulated by direct phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). We tested selective downstream factors which are linked to exercise and axon regeneration. We found that DAF-16 (ortholog of FOXO) and MDT-15 (functional ortholog of PGC1α) are important downstream effectors for swimming-mediated enhancement in axon regeneration. Our result showed an increased nuclear localization of DAF-16 following swimming exercise both in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, which is dependent on the AMPK function. Previous reports also show increased DAF-16 localization in the nucleus after exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). Our finding along with this evidence supports a mechanistic model in which exercise-induced AMPK activation in both neuron and muscle leads to DAF-16 activation resulting in improved functional recovery. Swimming exercise improves the fitness of aged animals by active regulation of mitochondrial dynamics (Campos et al., 2023). In the absence of insulin receptor DAF-2 through DAF-16 transcription factor, aged animals preserve muscle mitochondrial morphology, and maintain higher muscle mitochondrial mass and high levels of intracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). Swimming exercise also induces autophagy in worms and DAF-16 is linked to this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Mitochondria and autophagy directly regulate axon regeneration potential after an injury in rodents and worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). AMPK regulates DAF-16 activity through direct phosphorylation at multiple sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>).DLK-1 regulation by DAF-16 also affects axon regrowth following an injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). DAF-16 regulates many neuronal genes that affect cellular transport, axon guidance, and signalling, which can influence behavioural recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>).DAF-16 regulates netrin-mediated guidance of regenerating axons to the ventral nerve cord for successful behavioural recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Our data shows that DAF-16-mediated regulation of such targeting events contributes to enhanced recovery after exercise.</p><p id="P26">Our finding also shows that neuronal activity of MDT-15 leads to improved functional recovery after neuronal injury after swimming exercise. MDT-15 acts as a functional orthologue of PGC1α in <italic>C.elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). MDT-15 encodes a subunit of the transcriptional coregulatory Mediator complex and regulates fatty acid metabolism genes, fasting-induced gene expression, xenobiotic and heavy metal detoxification genes and oxidative stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). Understanding how MDT-15 regulates functional recovery after axon regeneration is an interesting direction to explore further.</p><p id="P27">We also observed that when AMPK is knocked down in neuron, AICAR treatment could boost the non-neuronal function of AMPK to promote axon regeneration. This opens up an exciting window of opportunity to integrate the multiple signalling arms of AMPK signalling across various tissues.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Genetics and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> strains</title><p id="P28">Standard conditions were followed to grow and maintain the strains using Nematode Growth Media (NGM) at 20º C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>).

The control no swimming group worms were kept in an unseeded NGM plate for the duration of the swimming session and were transferred to OP50 containing NGM plates after 90 minutes.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance statement</title></caption><p>Finding ways to promote functional recovery after accidental damage to the nervous system has been challenging as adult neurons lose the capability to regenerate. Rehabilitation therapy is the most promising approach to improve the health condition of patients with nervous system injury. Even in the roundworm <italic>C. elegans</italic>, axon regeneration could be enhanced through swimming exercise, which is mediated by the metabolic energy sensor AMP Kinase. In this study, using sensory neurons in worm, we found that PAR-4/ Liver kinase B1 acts upstream of AMPK. Whereas, the transcription factor DAF-16/ FOXO and the transcriptional co-regulator MDT-15 act as downstream signalling arms in muscle and neuron tissues. Excitingly, both of these arms could be harnessed through agonist-mediated activation of AMPK to promote functional recovery in adulthood.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Direct activation of AMPK through acute treatment of AICAR improves axon regeneration.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematics of axon injury paradigm of the posterior gentle touch sensory neuron (PLM) in combination with swimming exercise.
