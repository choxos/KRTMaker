Strains of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> worldwide exhibit introgressions from the sister species <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>, despite the average sequence identity between these species being lower than 90%. While <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> isolates from the Neotropics are known for their high levels of introgression, the evolutionary events leading to the unusually high prevalence of them remain unclear. Here, we sequenced 216 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> isolates living in open agave fermentation across Mexico, a habitat at the interface of natural and industrial environments. The genomes of these strains revealed considerable genetic diversity and population structure linked to geographic distribution, which had been overlooked due to undersampling of this megadiverse region. These strains, along with those from French Guiana, Ecuador, and Brazil, form a broader Neotropical phylogenetic cluster that is notably enriched in introgressed DNA. Surprisingly, the origins and conservation patterns of introgressions indicate multiple hybridization events, suggesting an unprecedented scenario of flexible species barriers in this region. Our findings underscore concurrent evolutionary processes—geographical stratification and multiple introgressions—that shape the genomes of a diverse lineage of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Neotropical yeasts thus provide a natural laboratory for exploring the mechanisms and adaptive significance of introgressive hybridization in eukaryotic genome evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Evolutionary genomics</kwd><kwd>Genetic introgression</kwd><kwd>Gene flow</kwd><kwd>Geographic population structure</kwd><kwd><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Agave fermentation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Beyond its long-established status as the most extensively studied eukaryote in the laboratory, the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has emerged as an outstanding model for ecology, population genomics, and evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.

Some of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains from this area isolated from anthropogenic and natural environments group in a long-monophyletic branch. This diverged branch, referred to as a complex clade by Pontes et al. (2020), aggregates three groups of strains, namely Mexican Agave (MA), French Guiana (FG), and South American Mix 2 (SAM2). Notoriously, the handful of sequenced genomes available to date indicate that this Neotropical cluster harbors an unusually high and heterogeneous number of introgressions from <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Considering the vast area encompassed by this region, the few available sequenced isolates likely provide an underestimate of genetic diversity, thus limiting our understanding of the species evolutionary history in this part of the world.</p><p id="P4">The elevated numbers of introgressions observed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains from the Neotropical cluster could explain its high divergence when compared to other clades. Although a fraction of the introgressions from the Neotropical cluster has been associated with populations of <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> from the Americas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, their precise origins remain to be determined. In Mexico, there are reports of <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> in fermentations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, including a lineage that coexists with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in the agave distillery environment and that has not been considered by previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Therefore, this <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> lineage could be a potential donor for introgressions in the tropical Americas. Comprehensive understanding of both the vertical evolution of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and the origins of its introgressions is essential to accurately determine the dynamics of interspecies gene flow in the region.</p><p id="P5">To explore the evolutionary history and genomic diversity of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in the tropical Americas in the context of their strong signatures of introgression, we sequenced 216 strains primarily isolated from open agave fermentations in Mexico. Previous studies have highlighted the megadiversity in this region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> as well as high diversity of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in agave fermentation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, but whole-genome sequencing efforts have only included nine strains, mostly from a single agave fermenting region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. We show that most of the newly sequenced isolates belong to the Neotropical cluster, including new clades where diversity correlates with the geographic origin of the strains. Moreover, by analyzing the patterns and origins of the introgressions in the context of the relatedness of these lineages, we identified multiple introgression events in their evolutionary history. Notably, some of these introgression pulses were unique to strains isolated from agave fermentations. Our refined phylogeny allowed us to illustrate how recurrent episodes of gene flow between two sister <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> species have unfolded in a megadiverse region of the world.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P6">To provide a comprehensive view of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> diversity in one of the most biodiverse regions in the world <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, we sequenced the genomes of 216 isolates across Mexico (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Strains were primarily isolated from traditional agave distilleries. This fermentation environment provides a good starting point to study yeasts diversity, as spontaneous fermentations have taken place for over 3,500 years in a wide variety of ecosystems, latitudes, and cultural contexts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Specifically, 211 of the sequenced strains were isolated from agave fermentations collected through various sampling efforts conducted across the country between the years 1988 and 2021 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Four of the five remaining isolates were from fermentations of other substrates — pulque (fermented raw agave sap), apple cider, cactus pears, and cooked stems of sotol plants (<italic>Dasylirion</italic> spp.)— while the fifth was an uncharacterized commercial yeast strain used in one of the sampled distilleries; all of them were isolated in Mexico (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). With the 216 genomes (median depth coverage = 163X), we assessed the phylogenetic position and population structure of the strains in the context of the known diversity of the species and we also analyzed the dynamics and origins of the prevalent <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> introgressions within these populations.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Agave fermentation strains belong to the Neotropical cluster</title><p id="P7">To assess the relatedness of the agave <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains with other isolates of the species, we first performed multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) with 1,264 genomes, including the 216 newly sequenced strains. Most isolates from Mexico clustered next to other strains from the tropical Americas, such as those from the French Guiana (FG), the South American Mix 2 (SAM2), and the Mexican Agave 1 (MA1, formerly named “Mexican Agave”) clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The rich diversity of the newly sequenced strains is evident, as strains from the tropical Americas encompass nearly half of the global diversity shown in MDS component 1, depicted by gray points, and nearly the entire diversity in component 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Only eleven strains grouped with other clades, namely the Mixed-origin, Wild North American, or Wine clades. The population-structure (ADMIXTURE, K=3) showed that ~97% of the agave fermentation strains had a Neotropical ancestral genetic component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), distinguishing strains from the Neotropics (blue) from wild (green) and domesticated (red) isolates from other regions of the world. The ADMIXTURE analysis also indicated that strains from the tequila industry were highly admixed, bearing a combination of the three ancestral components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). All five isolates from non-agave substrates that we sequenced grouped close to the agave-fermentation strains from the Neotropics.</p><p id="P8">To establish the phylogenetic relationships of the newly sequenced isolates, we compared them to a reference panel of strains (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Consistent with the MDS analysis, the phylogeny showed that 205 of the 216 newly sequenced strains (94.9%) were part of a monophyletic group that included the clades MA1, a newly defined clade Mexican Agave 2 (MA2) and FG, plus the two admixed clades Tequila Distillery and SAM2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S2A-B</xref>). We refer to this higher hierarchy clade as the Neotropical cluster of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, as nearly all the strains in this group come from the tropical Americas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Of the remaining sequenced isolates, five strains grouped with the wild North America Oak clade; other five—including the commercial strain—were closely related to the Mixed Origin clade and only one clustered with Wine strains.</p><p id="P9">The mosaic strains of Tequila Distillery and SAM2 branched with poor support and their presence in the phylogeny changed the relative placement of MA1, MA2 and FG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). For that reason, these admixed strains were excluded from the main phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, when SNPS from introgressed segments were removed from the phylogeny, the clades of the Neotropical cluster remained the same. The presence of introgressed regions had a less significant impact on the branch lengths of the diverse Neotropical cluster compared to those of the Alpechin clade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Furthermore, the difference in the number of single nucleotide variants was more pronounced for Alpechin than for the Neotropical cluster after the removal of introgression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Three clades could be distinguished among the newly sequenced isolates from agave fermentations in Neotropical <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. First, we identified a group of 20 isolates from northeastern Mexico, which included the seven strains previously reported as “Mexican Agave” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> herein referred to as the MA1 clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). It is worth mentioning that the monophyletic MA1 clade comprised only strains isolated northeast of the Sierra Madre Oriental, a mountain range which runs parallel to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and acts as a natural barrier, exerting strong influence on the climate and biodiversity on either side of the range <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. As a result of the comprehensive sampling of the isolates reported here, we identified a novel MA2 clade closely related to MA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Most of the newly sequenced strains in this study (81.9%) belonged to this clade. Two sequenced strains isolated in Mexico <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> were previously assigned to the SAM2 clade <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and after these analyses were reclassified within the new MA2 clade. The third clade of agave isolates was composed of 15 strains with heterogenous and admixed genotypes, all sequenced in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). We refer to this as the “Tequila Distillery” clade, since eleven were isolated from the tequila industry.</p><p id="P11">Our results show that most strains from open agave fermentations are part of the Neotropical cluster, revealing that what was previously described as “Mexican Agave” represents only a minor fraction of the great genetic diversity found in agave fermentations. Furthermore, the clades within this cluster, including the newly identified groups, rank among the highest in terms of single nucleotide variants when compared to the reference genome, surpassed only by the wild Asian clades (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Together, our phylogenomic and population analyses of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> from the tropical Americas bridge the gap of genetic knowledge for the species in this megadiverse region of the world.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Neotropical yeasts belong to diverse populations stratified by geography</title><p id="P12">Yeasts from the tropical Americas come from a diverse variety of environments across a broad range of geographical distances. We thus asked to what extent geographic parameters influence the population structure of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in the Neotropical cluster. To this end, we carried out an ADMIXTURE analysis assuming the number of populations that better explained the genotypes according to the cross-validation error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). The population structure analysis revealed eleven ancestral components in the Neotropical cluster. Specifically, strains from the MA1, Tequila Distillery, FG, and SAM2 clades each clustered in unique populations, while the remaining seven populations were all from the newly reported MA2 phylogenetic clade.</p><p id="P13">Given the stratification observed in the Neotropical cluster, we analyzed the geographical distribution of these isolates according to their population structure. The eleven colors in the ADMIXTURE plot representing ancestral components within the Neotropical cluster showed good agreement with their geographic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). This geographic stratification was observed at two levels of resolution. First, each of the five clades of the Neotropical cluster are constrained to specific regions in the map. Second, at the resolution within the MA2 clade, the seven colors in the ADMIXTURE were also stratified by geography. In general, strains from the same agave-distillate producing region grouped together in the phylogeny and had the same ancestral population component. This was also shown by a correlation between geographic and genetic distance in this set of strains (statistic <italic>r</italic>=0.28, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, Pearson Mantel test including MA1 and MA2 strains) and increasing genetic diversity from north to south in the MA2 clade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that the genomic diversity in the Neotropical cluster is influenced by geography.</p><p id="P14">Despite the overall agreement between geography and population structure in the strains from the tropical Americas, there were exceptions suggesting gene flow within and even beyond the Neotropical lineage. For instance, a strain isolated from an open agave fermentation shared close ancestry with wild isolates of the Wild North American clade, while other four isolates closely related to the Wild North American clade showed signs of admixture with different ancestral populations of the Neotropical cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Likewise, there were SAM2 strains showing genetic components of the MA2 and French Guiana clades. Moreover, the Tequila Distillery showed admixture, mostly between different Neotropical populations, but also with other clades such as Wine. Together, these findings suggest that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> populations in the tropical Americas have diverged to some extent independently from one another by means of geographic isolation, while other ecological processes or human-related factors have led to gene flow, which also contributes to their genome diversity.</p><p id="P15">We used the genomic data to further explore the patterns of genetic diversity in the Neotropical strains. The strains from each clade varied significantly from each other in nucleotide diversity (π), Tajima’s D, and heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>), with some of them displaying remarkably high genetic diversity. For instance, the MA1, MA2, and Tequila Distillery clades all show higher genetic diversity than yeasts from the Wine clade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). This held true when comparing with the highly introgressed Alpechin strains, suggesting that differences in genetic diversity cannot be solely accounted for by their introgressions. In contrast, the FG clade showed a homogenous degree of heterozygosity and low genetic diversity. The Tequila clade had the highest heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity, in agreement with trends observed in domesticated beer isolates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, while SAM2 also showed high genetic diversity, but lower heterozygosity, as reported for wild yeast strains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. High diversity in these clades is in part due to their admixed genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), while high heterozygosity specifically in the Tequila Distillery strains may be associated to their adaptation to the semi-industrial context where they were isolated. Taken together, our population-structure and genetic-diversity analyses indicate that yeasts in the tropical Americas constitute highly diverse, structured populations stratified by geography.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Different distributions of introgressions show recurrent interspecies gene flow</title><p id="P16">The genomes of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains within the Neotropical cluster are characterized by an atypically high number of introgressed regions from <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. To gain insight into gene flow dynamics, we identified the set of introgressed genes (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Materials and methods</xref>), their location, and length patterns in each clade of the Neotropical cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S8A</xref>). We found that yeasts from MA1 typically exhibited not only more introgressed genes than all other clades, but also the highest variability in this number, ranging from 119 to 364 introgressed genes per strain. Collectively the introgressions in MA1 covered 7.1% of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> reference genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We note that the number of introgressed genes in most MA1 strains was within the range observed for the MA2 strains which featured 96 to 160 introgressed genes. Together, all the introgressed genes in the MA2 clade covered 3.2% of the nuclear genome. However, seven strains from the MA1 clade exhibited longer and more heterozygous introgressions than most MA1 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). Here, we call an introgression as heterozygous when both <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> alleles have been retained in a single genome, suggesting a more recent introgression event. The presence of both alleles in several introgressions of the Tequila Distillery clade suggests admixture with a non-introgressed population, which may also explain the lower number of introgressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P17">All Neotropical clades displayed more introgressed genes than the observed average in other groups from around the world, except for the Alpechin clade. The two clades from South America, SAM2 and FG, displayed fewer and shorter introgressions with a lower degree of heterozygosity, compared to the two Mexican agave clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S9</xref>). This trend suggests that the last introgression pulse of SAM2 and FG likely occurred in the common ancestor of all strains from the Neotropical cluster. These characteristics in the introgression patterns agree with the trends that we observed in terms of the introgressions that are shared, whereby a significant fraction of genes was common between the Mexican Agave clades and, to a lesser extent, with the French Guiana clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, these patterns of shared introgressions were confirmed using an alternative strategy that considered <italic>bona fide</italic> species-specific SNP markers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> for detecting and scoring introgressed regions (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To further understand how introgressions are shared among clades, we quantified the proportion of strains harboring each introgressed gene within the different clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Introgressed genes present at high frequency—at least in 90% of the strains within a/the clade—were common in French Guiana (43.6%) and Alpechin (22.5%). The high proportion of shared introgressed genes within these populations suggests either a strong bottleneck or positive selection acting on introgressed regions. Conversely, introgressed genes present at 10% or lower frequency were more common within the Mexican Agave clades (36% and 45.7%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), which suggests either divergent resolutions of the same hybridization events, recent independent hybridizations in specific strains or a combination of both.</p><p id="P19">We found that MA1 and MA2 shared the highest fraction of introgressed genes in paired comparisons among clades, suggesting that they were present in their common ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>). Moreover, the highest fraction in the triple intersection was that of the MA1, MA2 and FG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggest that a fraction of the introgressions present in the three clades was present in their common ancestor. Additionally, we observed that 14 genes were shared among all four clades, pointing to potential strong selective pressures or artifacts arising from the use of a reference genome lacking those specific genes. In terms of “private” introgressions—those present in a clade but absent in all others—we scored 18.9% in FG, 32.2% in MA2, and 58.6% in MA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), while most introgressed genes in the</p><p id="P20">Alpechin reference clade (76.3%) were exclusively found in this clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). The high percentage of private introgressed genes in Alpechin is due to hybridization events not shared with Neotropical strains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Likewise, MA1 and MA2 isolates exhibited a high fraction of private introgressions, potentially resulting from introgression pulses that are not shared with the related FG clade. Together, the patterns of disparate introgression distribution suggest recurrent interspecies gene flow episodes between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> from the tropical Americas.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Introgressions in the Neotropical cluster trace to different lineages of <italic>S. paradoxus</italic></title><p id="P21">To track the history of the observed interspecies gene-flow episodes, we determined the most likely <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> lineage from which each introgressed gene derived. To this end, we scored sequence similarity of each introgressed block against a panel of <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> genomes including representative strains from the Americas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Our results suggest that most introgressed genes in the Mexican Agave clades derived from a lineage of <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> that has only been isolated in Mexico and that cohabits in agave fermentations, <italic>SpB_Mx</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

As expected, the introgressed genes in the Alpechin group most closely resemble the European <italic>SpA</italic> lineage, previously identified as the parental population of these introgressions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.

In this study, we sequenced 216 strains from open agave fermentations, providing an extensive population genomics dataset for the Neotropics. Our phylogenetic and population structure analyses revealed multiple interspecies gene-flow events resulting in introgressions within this geographically structured complex clade.</p><p id="P23">Introgressions impact evolutionary trajectories across the tree of life, from bacteria to humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. These events are also central to the evolutionary history of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, as evidenced by their presence in isolates across the globe <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. In the Americas, several <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lineages feature high number of introgressions from <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>, both in wild and anthropogenic environments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, presumably as a consequence of the co-existence of the two species in the region. Here, we provide a broad picture of the evolutionary dynamics of introgression happening in the tropical Americas. In the most plausible scenario, an early introgression pulse occurred in the most recent common ancestor of the Neotropical cluster before its diversification, where genes of the American <italic>SpB</italic> lineage of <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> introgressed into <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). This first pulse was presumably followed by a subsequent introgression event from another lineage, <italic>SpB_Mx</italic>, in the common ancestor of MA1 and MA2. At least one additional, more recent pulse of introgression from the <italic>SpB_Mx</italic> lineage took place in the MA1 clade, which is supported by high numbers of large and heterozygous introgressions in some strains of this clade. It remains to be determined whether these introgression pulses are simply stochastic byproducts of the coexistence of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> in the region, or if they underlie adaptation processes. Wider sampling efforts in other areas, particularly in South America, will likely expand our knowledge of the interspecies gene-flow dynamics in these yeasts.</p><p id="P24">Our sequencing effort expanded knowledge of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> diversity and biogeography. We uncovered two clades within the Neotropical cluster: MA2 and the admixed Tequila Distillery. Together with MA1, FG, and SAM2, these five clades constitute the Neotropical cluster. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the MA1—previously designated as Mexican Agave—and MA2 are sister clades, which in turn are the closest relatives of the FG strains, in agreement with the previously reported phylogeny <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. The high variability observed in the remaining SAM2 strains indicates that there probably exist other undersampled lineages in the tropical Americas, a diverse and biogeographically complex region (Morrone, 2014). Additional sampling and sequencing in this region would further elucidate key evolutionary events that have shaped the natural history of yeasts, as discussed herein.</p><p id="P25">Importantly, we found that the novel genetic diversity in the Neotropical cluster is structured and associated with the geographic origins of the yeast isolates. Geographical influence that shaped the genetic diversity was evident across several dimensions: First, a clear correlation was observed between each of the eleven ancestral components of the strains from the Neotropics and their region of isolation. Second, strains from the MA2 clade exhibit increased nucleotide diversity, in a north-to-south gradient. Finally, the genetic divergence between the MA1 and MA2 clades is associated with the presence of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range, which is found at the edge where the Neotropical and Nearctic biogeographic regions coincide. This range is known to act as a geographical barrier impacting the distributions of multiple species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P26">Beyond biogeographical factors, human activities may have played a role in shaping these yeast populations, as evidenced by admixture events within and beyond the Neotropical cluster. It remains to be addressed to what extent the observed yeast population structure is driven by natural factors such as the ecology and biogeography of plant reservoirs and insect vectors or by the human dynamics and practices. For instance, the specific local production practices or the remarkable diversity of fermentation substrates, with over 50 species of <italic>Agave</italic> species used for producing spirits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, could be driving population differentiation. With the rising global demand for agave spirits there is a growing risk that producers may abandon traditional fermentation practices. This shift could lead to the loss of the microbial diversity herein described. This work provides a critical framework for developing conservation and management strategies for these fungi, highlighting their value beyond basic research. The agave fermentation system is not only a reservoir of remarkable yeast genetic diversity, but also a unique natural laboratory to gain insights into the interplay of genetic, ecological and evolutionary factors shaping population differentiation, and interspecies introgression.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Genome sequencing and variant calling</title><p id="P27">DNA was purified with the MasterPure DNA purification kit as recommended by the manufacturer, and it was sequenced using DNBSeq (2x150 bp; BGI, China).
