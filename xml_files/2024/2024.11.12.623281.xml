Over decadal time scales, one lineage typically dominates the others and spreads in global pandemic waves. However, it remains unclear to what extent diverse lineages co-circulate during a single outbreak season. Defining the pool of diversity during finer time scales is important because the selective pressures that impact <italic>V. cholerae</italic> – namely antibiotics and phages – are dynamic on these time scales. To study the nationwide diversity of <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, we long-read sequenced 273 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genomes from seven hospitals over one year (2018) in Bangladesh. Four major <italic>V. cholerae</italic> lineages were identified: known lineages BD-1, BD-2a, and BD-2b, and a novel lineage that we call BD-3. In 2022, BD-1 caused a large cholera outbreak in Dhaka, apparently outcompeting BD-2 lineages. We show that, in 2018, BD-1 was already dominant in the five northern regions, including Dhaka, consistent with an origin from India in the north. By contrast, we observed a higher diversity of lineages in the two southern regions near the coast. The four lineages differed in pangenome content, including integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) and genes involved in resistance to bacteriophages and antibiotics. Notably, BD-2a lacked an ICE and is predicted to be more sensitive to phages and antibiotics, but nevertheless persisted throughout the year-long sampling period. Genes associated with antibiotic resistance in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> from Bangladesh in 2006 were entirely absent from all lineages in 2018-19, suggesting shifting costs and benefits of encoding these genes. Together, our results highlight the dynamic nature of the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> pangenome and the geographic structure of its lineage diversity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Cholera is an acute bacterial infectious disease characterised by profuse watery diarrhoea. It is caused by the Gram-negative pathogen <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, which is found in coastal brackish waters in planktonic forms or attached to zooplankton or shellfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is genetically diverse in the aquatic environment, and only two serotypes (O1 and O139) are associated with pandemic cholera in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The current 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic was first detected in 1961 in Indonesia, caused by a <italic>V. cholerae</italic> lineage referred to as the 7<sup>th</sup> Pandemic El Tor (7PET), which is genetically distinct from the Classical Type responsible for the 6<sup>th</sup> pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Currently, the public health burden of cholera remains high, with 2.9 million cases and 95,000 deaths estimated to be caused by cholera every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The burden of cholera is likely underestimated, as most cholera infections do not display any symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). A recent study based on serological surveillance showed that the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> infection rate may be much higher – at 535 per 1,000 people annually in Bangladesh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Outside the endemic region around Bangladesh, shorter but often devastating outbreaks can occur, as demonstrated in 2010 in Haiti, or in 2016 in Yemen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In 2022, Bangladesh experienced one of the largest cholera outbreaks in recent years when the BD-2 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> lineage, which had been dominant in Bangladesh since the early 2010s, was superseded by BD-1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The BD-1.2 lineage is most closely related to BD-1 genomes sampled from India, suggesting an Indian origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). BD-1 and BD-2 are relatively closely related lineages within the 7PET, but differ by single nucleotide changes and gene content differences in pathogenicity islands such as VSP-II and integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). It remains unclear which, if any, of these differences explain why one lineage might replace another.</p><p id="P6">ICEs encode numerous antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, and were recently shown to confer resistance to the lytic ICP1 bacteriophage through diverse phage defence genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The first ICE discovered in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> was named SXT, as it conferred resistance to <underline>S</underline>ulfametho<underline>X</underline>azole and <underline>t</underline>rimethoprim) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Different ICE variants encode different AMR and phage resistance genes. For example, in a sample of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genomes from 2006, the genes <italic>qnr<sub>Vc</sub></italic> (encoding a pentapeptide that protects DNA gyrase from the attack of ciprofloxacin) and <italic>mphA</italic> (encoding a phosphotransferase that inactivates azithromycin) were respectively associated with ciprofloxacin and azithromycin resistance phenotypes localised to the ICE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Frequent homologous recombination between ICEs is thought to occur, allowing rapid gain and loss of AMR genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The same is likely true of phage-resistance genes. Notably, the <italic>Vch</italic>Ind5 ICE variant, but not the <italic>Vc</italic>Ind6 ICE, encodes a BREX anti-phage system that is associated with lower phage to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> ratios within patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Some <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genomes lack an ICE entirely, suggesting fitness costs under certain conditions.</p><p id="P7">To determine the distribution of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> lineages and genes circulating in Bangladesh, we sequenced 273 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genomes collected in 2018 and early 2019 from seven hospitals across the country, spanning a single annual outbreak season. In addition to the previously described BD-1 and BD-2 lineages, we identified two BD-2 sublineages, one of which typically lacks an ICE, and a novel lineage, BD-3, which was restricted to Dhaka in our data set. Despite the higher prevalence of BD-1, BD-2 persisted during the sampled period. BD-1 was more prevalent in northern Bangladesh bordering India, supporting its Indian origin. Southern regions contained a higher diversity of lineages, potentially due to distinct environments and migration patterns. We also highlight the diversity of AMR and phage resistance genes, many of which occur on the ICE and differ across lineages. Two genes associated with antibiotic resistance in 2006 were absent from all <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genomes in our 2018-19 sample, exemplifying the dynamic nature of the pangenome.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p id="P8">Samples for this study were collected as part of two published IRB-approved clinical studies in Bangladesh: (i) The mHealth Diarrhoea Management (mHDM) cluster randomised controlled trial (IEDCR IRB/2017/10; icddr,b ERC/RRC PR-17036; University of Florida IRB 201601762) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).

For each sample, approximately 200 ng was used to generate the sequencing library using the Nanopore Rapid Barcoding Kit 96 V14 (SQK-RBK114.96, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, the samples were made up to 10 μL with DNase-free water and 1 μL of rapid barcodes was added to each sample in groups of 96. The plates were incubated for 2 minutes at 30 °C followed by enzyme inactivation for 2 minutes at 80 °C. 2 μL per sample was used to pool the plates followed by concentrating using a 1:1 AMPure XP Beads clean up (Beckman Coulter). Beads were rinsed using two washes of 80% ethanol with 180-degree turns. The samples were eluted in 12 μL elution buffer EB (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). 11 μL of pooled library was ligated to 1 μL of pre-diluted Rapid Adapter and loaded on a PromethION R10.4.1 flow cell following priming (Oxford Nanopore Technologies).

PopPUNK genomic cluster 1 (GC-1) corresponded to BD-1 (coloured blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), whereas BD-2 was split into GC-2 and GC-3 (coloured shades of red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, henceforth referred to as BD-2a, BD-2b).</p><p id="P21">To support the phylogenetic relationships among <italic>V. cholerae</italic> lineages at a higher resolution, a second maximum-likelihood tree was constructed using the 273 new genomes only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Both trees identified BD-1, BD-2, and BD-3 as distinct monophyletic groups with bootstrap support of 100%. Consistent with our earlier metagenomic sequencing, two types of ICEs, <italic>Vch</italic>Ind5 and <italic>Vch</italic>Ind6, are found in the isolate genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). All BD-2a isolates lacked an SXT-ICE, consistent with the shorter median length of BD-2a assemblies, which was 91,825 bp shorter than that of BD-2b (Welch two sample <italic>t</italic>-test: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2*10<sup>-16</sup>), close to the average size <italic>Vch</italic>Ind6 at 94,599 bps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Other than occasional ICE gain or loss events, the ICE type is generally a stable feature within each lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), with BD-1 and BD-3 containing <italic>Vch</italic>Ind5 and most BD-2b genomes containing <italic>Vch</italic>Ind6.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Geographical and temporal distribution of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genomic diversity</title><p id="P22">To quantify the genomic diversity of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> between time points and locations, we compared the Shannon diversity of PopPUNK genomic cluster (GC) composition. The GCs largely map to phylogenetic lineages: GC-1 to BD-1, GC-2 to BD-2a, GC-3 to BD-2b, and GC-4 to BD-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). However, in addition to the core genome SNVs used to construct the phylogenetic trees, PopPUNK also uses accessory genome content, resulting in higher genetic resolution: 39 GCs compared to only 4 major phylogenetic lineages. For example, a genome with distinct gene content would be classified as a separate GC, despite branching within BD-1 or BD-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Such gene content ‘outliers’ tend to be rare, and are considered together as ‘others’ for visualisation purposes but counted separately to calculate Shannon diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P23">The distribution of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> GCs varied among sampling locations across Bangladesh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). The sites in the north, close to the Bangladesh-India border, contained predominantly BD-1.2 (GC-1, &gt;70%). By contrast, we observed a higher diversity of lineages in the two southern sites on the coast of the Bay of Bengal, marked by a mixture of BD-1 (GC-1) and BD-2 (GC-2 and GC-3). Previous work inferred an Indian origin for BD-1.2 in Bangladesh, which is consistent with the enrichment of BD-1.2 in parts of Bangladesh physically closer to India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Further supporting an Indian origin, all BD-1 isolates in this study clustered with publicly available BD-1.2 genomes, and were genetically closer to Indian BD-1 isolates from the early 2010s than to Bangladeshi isolates of the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). To more formally infer the divergence time and geographic source of BD-1.2, we used Bayesian ancestral reconstruction to infer the most recent common ancestor of BD-1.2 (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">Methods</xref>). We estimated the most recent common ancestor of BD-1.2 in 2002 (95% HPD interval: 2000 - 2003) and was of Indian origin. Site 10, which is located near a refugee camp at Cox’s Bazar, was also distinct in its lineage composition, containing a significant number of both BD-2a (GC-2) and BD-2b (GC-3) and high Shannon diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), whereas most other sites contained only one or the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). BD-3 (GC-4) was found only in Dhaka.</p><p id="P24">Lineage diversity varied less over time (s.d.=0.41; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>) than over sampling locations (s.d.=0.52, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The 2019 samples all came from Dhaka, and samples from April 2019 had a Shannon diversity of zero as all isolates from that month were BD-3. When excluding the 2019 samples, the standard deviation of Shannon diversity over time is only 0.30, much less than the variation over space. A shift from BD-2 to BD-1 has been previously reported in Dhaka from 2018 to 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). We also observe a higher frequency of BD-1, particularly at later time points during our sampling period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that the shift toward BD-1 may be a nationwide phenomenon. When examining the wider collection of publicly available genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), we found that shifts in the dominant lineage had occurred previously in Bangladesh - from predominantly BD-1 in 2010 (90.9%) to a mixture of BD-1 and BD-2 in 2011-2012, followed by a predominantly BD-2 population (96.7%) between 2013 and 2017. Therefore, the alternating dominance of BD-1 and BD-2 could be explained by fluctuating or frequency-dependent selection rather than a directional lineage replacement.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Lineage BD-2 has a more open pangenome than BD-1</title><p id="P25">Next, we compared the accessory gene content of BD-1 and BD-2. A pangenome is defined here as the entire set of genes from all isolates within a lineage. We found that BD-2 had a more ‘open’ pangenome (Tettelin’s γ = 0.0291), with more genes added to the pangenome per sequenced genome compared to BD-1 (γ = 0.0172; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Pairwise Jaccard distances between accessory gene content were consistently higher in BD-2, and this was true across all core genome distance bins (Welch two sample <italic>t</italic>-test: <italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2*10<sup>-16</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This implies that the differences in pangenome variation are not due to differences in phylogenetic depth between BD-1 and BD-2. The high level of pangenome variation within BD-2 is likely due to its subdivision in BD-2a, which lacks an ICE, and BD-2b, which contains the <italic>Vch</italic>Ind6 ICE.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Variation in AMR gene profiles</title><p id="P26">We used the CARD database to identify annotated AMR genes in our sample of genomes. We found 16 known AMR genes present in one or more genomes using the strict matching criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The major lineages had distinct presence/absence profiles of these 16 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Multidrug efflux pump <italic>rsmA</italic> (for fluoroquinolone, diaminopyrimidine, and chloramphenicol) was found in all 273 genomes. So was CRP, a global regulator for the efflux pump MdtEF, which removes fluoroquinolone, macrolide, and beta-lactam from bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Note that the screening for CRP did not consider a point mutation that was shown to render it dysfunctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). The loss of the SXT-ICE element in BD-2a profoundly affected its AMR gene profile: almost all genomes other than BD-2a contain APH(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>)-Id or APH(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>)-Ib (&gt;99%), a phosphotransferase of aminoglycoside, which is completely absent in BD-2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The same pattern was observed for the sulfonamide and trimethoprim resistance genes, <italic>dfrA</italic> and <italic>sul2</italic>, both of which were absent in BD-2a but had high frequencies in the other lineages. AMR genes against vancomycin (<italic>vanY</italic> and <italic>vanT)</italic>; carbapenem (<italic>varG</italic>); fluoroquinolone <italic>(parE)</italic>; and colistin (<italic>almEFG</italic>) were also prevalent across lineages (&gt;95%). A point mutation involved in chloramphenicol inactivation <italic>catB9</italic> was present in all but one BD-1 isolate. The chloramphenicol efflux pump <italic>floR</italic> is a hallmark of <italic>Vch</italic>Ind5; it was absent in BD-2 but present in almost all BD-1 and BD-3 isolates. Consistent with previous findings, <italic>tetA</italic>, an efflux pump for tetracycline, is located on the <italic>Vch</italic>Ind6 and is present in all BD-2b but none of the other genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Notably, two AMR genes on the SXT-R391 ICE (<italic>qnr<sub>Vc</sub></italic> and <italic>mphA</italic>) that were previously associated with ciprofloxacin and azithromycin resistance in a 2006 sample of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genomes from Bangladesh were absent in the 2018-2019 genomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). To compare the structure of the SXT-R391 ICEs that harboured these genes, their sequences were obtained by extracting bases between the genes <italic>prfC</italic> and <italic>gmr</italic>, flanking the ICE insertion site. A <italic>Vch</italic>Ind6 from a 2006 BD-2 isolate (EN-1443) that contains <italic>qnr<sub>Vc</sub></italic> and <italic>mphA</italic> was compared to another <italic>Vch</italic>Ind6 (EN-1581) from a 2018 BD-2 isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). All <italic>Vch</italic>Ind6 from 2018 share this loss of <italic>qnr<sub>Vc</sub></italic> and <italic>mphA</italic>. A 2018 <italic>Vch</italic>Ind5 ICE from a 2018 genome also contained this deletion relative to the ICE from 2006 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Thus, <italic>qnr<sub>Vc</sub></italic> and <italic>mphA</italic> were absent in the 2018-2019 genomes due to one or more deletion events of an ICE region that was present in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). It is unclear if these genes were deleted due to fitness costs, if they were replaced with more effective resistance mechanisms elsewhere in the genome (since ciprofloxacin and azithromycin are still commonly used antibiotics for cholera patients in Bangladesh), or a combination of these factors.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Variation in phage-defence gene profiles</title><p id="P28">We next identified known phage defence genes in our genomes using DefenseFinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Despite being relatively distantly related (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), BD-1 and BD-3 genomes all contain 13 or 14 of the 15 identified defence systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). This suggests that defence systems such as <italic>Abi</italic>, BREX, and Lamassu were present in the common ancestor of BD-1, 2 and 3, and were lost in BD-2. Other phage defence systems such as DdmDE, Zorya and restriction-modification systems are universal to all sequenced genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The Lamassu system, commonly referred to as <italic>DdmABC</italic> in the <italic>Vibrio</italic> literature, acts in conjunction with <italic>Abi</italic> to kill phage-infected bacterial cells before phage replication can be completed, thereby providing population-level immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). BD-1 and BD-2 encode different variants of VSP-II, where <italic>DdmABC</italic> is encoded, likely explaining the lineage-specific differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).

This revealed substantial diversity of different <italic>V. cholerae</italic> lineages encoding distinct profiles of AMR and phage resistance genes co-circulating across the country. Although the sample in this study covered a wide geographical region across Bangladesh, the sample size per month was still rather small, and from early 2019 onward, isolates were exclusively sourced from icddr,b. Despite these limitations, we identified an intriguing north-south gradient of genomic diversity, with a dominant lineage likely introduced from India to the north, and greater diversity persisting in the south. This pattern merits further investigations in larger and longer sampling efforts.</p><p id="P30">We also demonstrate the utility of long-read nanopore sequencing to resolve structure variation in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genomes and to infer phylogenetic relationships. The numbers of single nucleotide variants in the long-read genomes were comparable to those in short-read genomes over similar spatial and temporal scales, suggesting that sequencing errors are not excessive in the long-reads after quality filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). The benefit of long-read sequencing technology is that large-scale genomic structures can be resolved at higher accuracy – for instance, we observed the deletion of SXT-ICE in a sub-lineage. Of the 273 genomes sequenced, 65% were assembled into two circular contigs, corresponding to the two chromosomes in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, with the remaining assemblies failing to yield closed chromosomes. With DNA extraction protocols optimised for long reads, the completeness of assemblies could be further improved in future analyses.</p><p id="P31">Two distinct <italic>V. cholerae</italic> lineages, BD-1 and BD-2, have been predominant in Bangladesh since the late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Between 1999 and 2017, BD-2 increased in frequency compared to BD-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), until the BD-1.2 sub-lineage emerged as the cause of a major outbreak in 2022. Filling the gap between 2017 and 2022, our analysis shows that BD-1.2 dominated BD.2 throughout 2018, particularly in the north of Bangladesh. However, BD.2 persisted through the end of our sampling in 2019. Our phylodynamic and geographic analyses support an Indian origin of BD1.2, which likely arrived in Bangladesh from the north. Furthermore, we report a new lineage, BD-3, which only appeared in our samples from the icddr,b sampling site in Dhaka. This lineage appeared throughout the sampling period but became particularly frequent in 2019, when it comprised the majority of genomes at icddr,b. BD-3 has a similar AMR and phage resistance gene profile as BD-1, suggesting that it could compete with BD-1 in the future. Ongoing monitoring will be required to determine if this occurs.</p><p id="P32">Monir <italic>et al.,</italic> suggested serotype switching as a possible explanation for the success of BD-1.2 over BD.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Although we observed higher proportions of Ogawa serotype towards the end of our sampling period in early 2019, some Inaba isolates persisted. The O-antigen may be under negative-frequency dependent selection, such that no serotype reaches fixation and diversity is maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Indeed, Ogawa and Inaba serotypes have co-existed in O1 7PET since the beginning of the 7th pandemic in the 1960s, and serotype switchings in both directions have been frequently observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Negative frequency-dependent selection could also arise from the co-evolution of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and its virulent phages. <italic>V. cholerae</italic> lineages differ in the types of ICE they encode, and some genomes lack an ICE entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Different ICE types encode different genes involved in both phage and antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). For example, in our study, both BD-3 and BD-1 contained <italic>VchInd5</italic>, whereas BD-2 was split into sub-lineages that either possessed <italic>VchInd6</italic> or lacked an ICE. Intriguingly, a significant proportion of the isolates lacked an SXT-ICE despite the potential benefits it confers, such as antibiotic and phage resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). LeGault <italic>et al.,</italic> posited that it may be beneficial for a <italic>V. cholerae</italic> population to include multiple lineages with distinct ICEs to increase the diversity of defence mechanisms against the ICP1 phage(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Strains without ICEs may be beneficial at the population level, as ICP1 released from ICE-free <italic>V. cholerae</italic> lack epigenetic modifications necessary to evade ICE-encoded phage-restriction systems, thereby reducing the overall burden of phage predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that negative frequency-dependent selection for rare ICE types, or stabilising selection to maintain ICE-free cells at low frequencies, might explain the lack of a complete replacement of BD-2 by BD-1.2.</p><p id="P34">Antibiotic resistance has become widespread in clinical <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. A study of 443 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> isolates in the endemic region of India found that more than 99% of these were multidrug-resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Consistent with this observation, 16 known AMR genes were identified in our data set, conferring resistance to a wide variety of antibiotics - including aminoglycoside, sulfonamide, trimethoprim, vancomycin, carbapenem, fluoroquinolone, macrolide, colistin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. Each genome contained at least ten of these 16 genes. The acquisition of AMR in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> has likely occurred via mobile elements such as ICEs, which can disseminate AMR genes between genetically distant strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). In our dataset, distinct ICE variants are stably associated with distinct lineages, with occasional ICE gain or loss within a lineage. Notably, a variable ICE region containing two genes strongly associated with ciprofloxacin and azithromycin resistance in 2006, <italic>qnr<sub>Vc</sub></italic> and <italic>mphA</italic>, were completely absent in the 2018-2019 genomes. Extensive gene conversions have been observed between SXT-ICEs, which could provide a mechanism for these deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). The absence of these canonical ciprofloxacin and azithromycin resistance genes would necessitate alternative mechanisms if <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains were to remain resistant to both drugs, as they likely do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>).

In contrast to the lineage replacement events that appear to take place over decades in subsequent waves of globally successful clones, we observe that multiple distinct lineages, with distinct gene content, coexist within a year on a nationwide scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The north-south gradient of genomic diversity suggests geographically structured environmental pressures and transmission routes, which deserve further study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS200102-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d53aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS200102-supplement-Supplementary_Table_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d53aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS200102-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d53aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the patients for participating in the studies from which the strains were obtained, and the research teams at the icddr,b who made this work possible.
