Pathway analysis of post mortem brain-derived proteomic data from AD patients shows that the lysosomal system is perturbed relative to similarly aged unaffected controls. However, it is unclear if these changes contributed to the pathogenesis or are a response to the disease. Consistent with the hypothesis that lysosome dysfunction contributes to AD pathogenesis, whole genome sequencing data indicate that heterozygous pathogenic mutations and predicted protein-damaging variants in multiple lysosomal enzyme genes are enriched in AD patients compared to matched controls. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 (<italic>PPT1</italic>), α-L-iduronidase (<italic>IDUA</italic>), β-glucuronidase (<italic>GUSB</italic>), N-acetylglucosaminidase (<italic>NAGLU</italic>), and galactocerebrosidase (<italic>GALC</italic>) genes have a gene-dosage effect on Aβ<sub>40</sub> levels in brain interstitial fluid in C57BL/6 mice and significantly increase Aβ plaque formation in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, thus providing <italic>in vivo</italic> validation of the human genetic data. A more detailed analysis of <italic>PPT1</italic> heterozygosity in 18-month-old mice revealed changes in α-, β-, and γ-secretases that favor an amyloidogenic pathway. Proteomic changes in brain tissue from aged <italic>PPT1</italic> heterozygous sheep are consistent with both the mouse data and the potential activation of AD pathways. Finally, CNS-directed, AAV-mediated gene therapy significantly decreased Aβ plaques, increased life span, and improved behavioral performance in 5xFAD/PPT1+/- mice. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that heterozygosity of multiple lysosomal enzyme genes represent risk factors for AD and may identify precise therapeutic targets for a subset of genetically-defined AD patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia currently affecting ~6.7 million people in the United States and 44 million worldwide, and these numbers are growing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). AD is characterized histologically by neuronal degeneration, extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and intracellular Tau accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Familial forms of AD are typically driven by increased Aβ production and subsequent aggregation of Aβ into soluble oligomers or insoluble extracellular plaques. However, studies in late-onset sporadic AD patients demonstrate impaired clearance of Aβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Thus, the balance between production and clearance determines Aβ levels and the propensity to develop Aβ plaques.</p><p id="P5">The lysosome plays a major role in the degradation and clearance of intracellular organelles and aggregate-prone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have consistently identified endo-lysosomal genes as being associated with sporadic and late-onset AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Whole exome sequencing approaches have identified associations with coding variants in genes from the endolysosomal pathway in sporadic, early-onset AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). These genetic studies suggest that the lysosome may act as a common pathway through which downstream pathophysiological effects of AD might be mediated.</p><p id="P6">There is also a growing body of biological data supporting the role of lysosomes and lysosome dysfunction in AD. Lysosome biogenesis is up-regulated at early stages in the AD brain and AD models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Lysosome dysfunction and β-amyloidogenesis are intertwined since lysosomes play a role in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. <italic>Presenilin</italic>1 (<italic>PSEN1</italic>) deletion elevates endolysosomal pH by disrupting vATPase assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The essential γ-secretase components, PSEN2 and Nicastrin, are located in the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Pharmacological impairment of lysosomal function <italic>in vitro</italic> results in changes in Aβ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) and induces neuritic dystrophy in the absence of Aβ deposition <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Changes in lysosomal pH reduce Aβ secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and lysosomal protease inhibitors reduce production of amyloidogenic Aβ peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in several lysosomal enzyme genes result in the accumulation of Tau or altered Aβ metabolism and distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Accumulation of lysosomal markers are found in human brain tissue from patients with primary tauopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). In the brains of patients with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) and Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease there is intense, intracellular Aβ staining throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). MPS patients exhibit a significant increase in the level of soluble Aβ compared to normal control brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Increased CSF levels of amyloidogenic Aβ peptides suggest an increased γ-secretase-dependent Aβ release in the brains of patients with NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). In addition, mice deficient in <italic>NPC1</italic> (Niemann-Pick C disease), <italic>CLN3</italic> (Batten disease<italic>), IDUA</italic> (MPS-I<italic>), SGSH</italic> (Sanfilippo A<italic>), GBA</italic> (Gaucher disease<italic>), TPP1</italic> (Late Infantile Batten disease<italic>)</italic> and <italic>HEXB</italic> (Sandhoff disease<italic>)</italic> genes exhibit an increase in both intracellular APP fragments (α-CTF/β-CTF) and Aβ<sub>40/42</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). The absence of lysosomal neuraminidase 1 (<italic>NEU1</italic>) exacerbated the Aβ pathology in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Finally, selective enhancement of lysosomal proteolysis markedly reduces Aβ levels and amyloid load in AD mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Although both genetic and biological studies support the role of lysosome dysfunction in AD pathogenesis, it is unclear what level of dysfunction is necessary to promote AD pathogenesis. Homozygous loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in lysosomal enzyme genes result in fatal pediatric disorders, collectively known as lysosomal storage diseases. Historically, carriers (heterozygotes) of LoF mutations in lysosomal enzyme genes were considered normal throughout life. In other words, 50% levels of lysosomal enzymes are believed to be sufficient for normal overall lysosome function and the prevention of disease. However, there are now several well-established examples of heterozygous deleterious mutations in lysosomal proteins that are associated with adult-onset neurological disease. The best-known example is heterozygosity of the glucocerebrosidase gene (<italic>GBA</italic>) and Parkinson disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). In fact, with the exception of age, heterozygosity of <italic>GBA</italic> is one of the greatest risk factors for PD. Similarly, heterozygous mutations in the progranulin gene (<italic>GRN</italic>) are associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Most recently, a severe heterozygous mutation in the Neimann-Pick C1 gene (<italic>NPC1</italic>) is associated with an apparently autosomal dominant, late-onset form of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Based on strong evidence suggesting that the lysosome plays a critical role in Aβ metabolism and the fact that heterozygous mutations in several lysosomal proteins are associated with adult-onset neurological diseases, we hypothesized that heterozygous deleterious mutations in lysosomal enzyme genes are associated with AD. Here we provide human proteomic and genetic evidence supported by <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental data in both large and small animal models strongly suggesting that heterozygosity of multiple lysosomal enzyme genes is associated with AD. We further show that CNS-directed, AAV-mediated gene therapy can ameliorate some of the pathological and clinical signs in a mouse model of AD harboring a heterozygous LoF mutation in one of the genes. These data support the role of lysosome dysfunction in the pathogenesis of AD and identify potential therapeutic strategies for a subset of genetically-defined AD patients.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Genetic and proteomic analyses in Alzheimer’s disease</title><p id="P9">In order to test the hypothesis that haploinsufficiency of lysosomal enzyme genes is associated with AD, coding variants in 44 lysosomal enzyme genes were identified using publicly available data bases. Known pathogenic mutations were identified in the ClinVar data base. The likelihood of variants of unknown significance (VUS) being deleterious was determined using the Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scoring system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Single-variant and gene-based analyses were performed on the 44 lysosomal genes in a case-controlled cohort of AD patients (Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project, ADSP) containing 36,361 whole genome sequences. According to the genetic Principal Component Analyses, there were 6,547 and 4,739 Central European (CEU) AD patients and matched control samples, respectively. Similarly, 3,335 and 5,262 whole genome sequences were analyzed from African American (AA) AD patients and controls, respectively.</p><p id="P10">To investigate the impact of functional variants in endolysosomal genes, the analyses were restricted to ClinVar pathogenic variants and high and moderate variants with a CADD score greater than 30. In the CEU samples, SKAT-O analysis identified suggestive associations for the <italic>PPT1</italic> and <italic>GAA</italic> genes, and the Burden analysis identified a potential association for the <italic>ASAH1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In the AA samples, potential associations were identified in the <italic>IDUA</italic> and <italic>GALC</italic> genes by both SKAT-O and Burden analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

The patients were diagnosed clinically and confirmed to have AD on post-mortem analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). The proteomic analysis was run in triplicate and 7,915 proteins were identified. The proteomic changes in the AD patients indicate convergence on the lysosomal storage disease pathway when interrogated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>). Thirty common lysosomal enzymes were identified, greater than half of which were differentially expressed by ≥15%, and of those 11 were increased by ≥20% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Haploinsufficiency of palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 and Alzheimer’s disease</title><p id="P12">The human genetic and proteomic analyses support the hypothesis that lysosome dysfunction is associated with AD. In addition, they serve as an effective means to prioritize the lysosomal enzyme genes for further <italic>in vivo</italic> validation. Pathogenic mutations and deleterious variants in the <italic>PPT1</italic> gene are enriched in CEU AD patients. There are both large (ovine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) and small (murine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) animal models of CLN1 disease (infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) which is caused by a complete deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme, palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1). In addition, several critical proteins responsible for Aβ metabolism are palmitoylated and changes in palmitoylation have been reported in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Therefore, we determined the effects of <italic>PPT1</italic> heterozygosity on the sheep brain proteome, in a mouse model of AD, and on Aβ metabolism in otherwise normal mice.</p><p id="P13">Samples from the entorhinal cortex from four <italic>PPT1</italic> heterozygous sheep (554-2022 days of age) and five normal controls (500-1335 days of age) were collected and processed for proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table 3</xref>). All samples were run in triplicate and 8,835 proteins were detected in the <italic>PPT1</italic> heterozygous sheep. Pathway analyses of data from the <italic>PPT1</italic> heterozygous sheep and controls indicate that multiple protein differences are associated with interactions known to play a role in AD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 3</xref>). When the proteomic data from the heterozygous <italic>PPT1</italic> sheep are compared to the proteomic changes in AD patients, several important proteins in the amyloid processing pathway network also appear to be altered in a similar manner</p><p id="P14">To more precisely determine whether PPT1 haploinsufficiency exacerbates an amyloidogenic process <italic>in vivo</italic>, a <italic>PPT1</italic> null allele was bred onto the 5xFAD murine model of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). The resulting animals were heterozygous for the <italic>PPT1</italic> gene on the 5xFAD background and are hereafter referred to as 5xFAD/PPT1+/- mice. These mice have approximately 50% normal levels of PPT1 activity in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) and appear to develop normally. The 5xFAD/PPT1+/- mice exhibit a significantly shortened life span (median ~10 months) compared to either the 5xFAD or <italic>PPT1</italic> heterozygous mice (median ~24 months) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Coronal sections of the brains from seven-month-old 5xFAD/PPT1+/- mice were analyzed for amyloid plaque burden using anti-amyloid antibodies (HJ3.4). There is an obvious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>) and statistically significant increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) in Aβ plaques in the 5xFAD/PPT1+/- mice compared to the parental 5xFAD strain. To complement the finding of increased in Aβ plaques caused by PPT1 haploinsufficiency, samples from the hippocampus of those animals were fractionated into detergent-soluble and guanidine-soluble (detergent-insoluble) fractions, and the Aβ isoforms were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of detergent-insoluble Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> were significantly elevated in 5xFAD/PPT1+/- animals compared with 5xFAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E, F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Haploinsufficiency of PPT1 affects Aβ metabolism</title><p id="P15">Although heterozygosity of <italic>PPT1</italic> exacerbates the phenotype of 5xFAD mice, it is important to determine the effects of haploinsufficiency in the absence of any transgenes that might otherwise affect Aβ metabolism. It has been demonstrated that the level of soluble Aβ in brain interstitial fluid (ISF) reflects the total soluble Aβ in extracellular pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Therefore, the levels of murine Aβ in brain ISF were determined in the hippocampus of three-to four-month-old WT, heterozygous, and homozygous deficient <italic>PPT1</italic> animals on a C57Bl/6 background. There is a clear gene-dosage effect of <italic>PPT1</italic> on baseline Aβ levels in hippocampal ISF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), suggesting that dysfunctional lysosomes are likely to prevent Aβ from being secreted from neurons.</p><p id="P16">Western blot analysis was performed on brain homogenates from 18-month-old <italic>PPT1</italic> heterozygous mice and age-matched wild type (WT) animals on the C57Bl/6 background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The level of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in <italic>PPT1</italic> heterozygous mice is not significantly different from WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The level of ADAM10 (α-secretase), which favors a non-amyloidogenic pathway, is significantly decreased in <italic>PPT1</italic> heterozygous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). In contrast, the levels of β-secretase (BACE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>) and the catalytic component of γ-secretase (presenilin-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), which favor an amyloidogenic pathway, are significantly elevated in the 18-month-old heterozygous <italic>PPT1</italic> animals compared to the WT controls. Several critical proteins in the amyloid processing pathway network are changed in the brains of AD patients and <italic>PPT1</italic> heterozygous sheep. Interestingly, similar to the heterozygous <italic>PPT1</italic> mice, amyloid precursor protein is not elevated in the heterozygous sheep even though the AD pathway appears to be activated.

We first determined if Aβ plaques could be reduced if the AAV vector was delivered during the neonatal period. Animals received four bilateral intraparenchymal injections of the AAV vector at post-natal day 1 or 2 to target the anterior cortex and hippocampus. At seven-months-of-age, there was a significant decrease in Aβ plaques in the AAV-treated animals compared to age-matched untreated 5xFAD/PPT1+/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The level of PPT1 enzyme activity approached normal levels in the AAV-treated animals compared to the untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The effect of delaying the AAV injections and administering them through different routes was then determined. Two groups of 5xFAD/PPT1+/- animals were treated at the same age (3.5 months) with the identical total dose (8 x 10<sup>9</sup> vg) of vector. One group received a single intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. The second group received the identical dose divided equally between four different intraparenchymal injection sites to target the anterior cortex and hippocampus. A third group received a single ICV injection (8 x 10<sup>9</sup> vg) of a nearly identical AAV9 vector expressing GFP. At seven-months-of-age, the Y-maze and elevated plus maze behavioral tests were performed on those animals. The animals that received the intraparenchymal injections of AAV9-hPPT1 performed significantly better than AAV9-GFP-injected mice on the Y-maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).

Consistent with the hypothesis that lysosome dysfunction is associated with AD, human proteomic data identified the lysosomal storage disease pathway as being altered in AD patients. However, the proteomic data represent a snapshot in time and do not establish whether the changes in the lysosome pathway are causative or simply a response to disease. Therefore, three of the genes identified in the genetic analysis were validated <italic>in vivo</italic> by demonstrating that heterozygosity, by itself, affects Aβ trafficking in C57Bl/6 mice and exacerbates Aβ aggregation in a mouse model of AD. In fact, the number of lysosomal enzyme genes was expanded beyond the human genetic analysis by demonstrating that heterozygosity of <italic>NAGLU</italic> and <italic>GUSB</italic>, neither of which was identified in the genetic analysis, had similar effects on ISF Aβ levels and exacerbated the 5xFAD phenotype. That Aβ levels are impacted in lysosomal enzyme haploinsufficient mice expressing WT murine Aβ underscores that these changes are not related to using a transgenic mouse model harboring multiple human mutations. In total, at least seven different lysosomal enzyme genes have been identified that likely represent risk factors for AD when carrying heterozygous variants. Given that we validated two genes <italic>in vivo</italic> that were not identified in genetic analysis, the fact that the genetic analyses were underpowered relative to standard genetic linkage studies, and homozygous mutations in a number of other lysosomal enzyme genes affect Aβ metabolism, we predict that heterozygous deleterious mutations/variants in other lysosomal enzyme genes will also be associated with AD.</p><p id="P25">These findings are of particular interest since they challenge the dogma that, in general, carriers of lysosomal enzyme gene defects are normal throughout life. In fact, it is becoming increasingly apparent that this long-held belief may not be correct. Perhaps the best-known example of haploinsufficiency of a lysosomal enzyme gene being associated with an adult-onset neurological disease is the role of heterozygous missense variants in the <italic>GBA</italic> gene in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Carriers of coding variants in sphingomyelinase (<italic>SMPD1</italic>) are also associated with PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). There is also ample evidence from studies in experimental systems that heterozygous mutations in a number of lysosomal genes are associated with a Parkison-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). The association of heterozygous mutations in <italic>GBA</italic> is not the only example of carriers of lysosomal gene defects being associated with adult-onset neurological disease. Heterozygous mutations in <italic>GALC, GRN</italic>, and <italic>NAGLU</italic> are associated with multiple sclerosis, fronto-temporal dementia, and adult-onset axonal sensory neuropathy, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Finally, a recent study in an extended family identified a severe heterozygous mutation in the <italic>NPC1</italic> gene that is associated with a dominant form of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). These studies support the hypothesis that heterozygosity of deleterious variants in some, perhaps many, lysosomal genes predispose carriers to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p id="P26">At this point, these data do not allow us to determine if haploinsufficiency of a single lysosomal enzyme results in global lysosome dysfunction or in perturbations of a specific pathway affecting Aβ metabolism. However, the substrate specificity of some of the lysosomal enzymes might provide some insights. For example, PPT1 is responsible for removing the fatty acyl chains from palmitoylated proteins. Interestingly, several proteins involved in Aβ metabolism are palmitoylated proteins. The N-terminal region of APP is palmitoylated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and APP palmitoylation is involved in the amyloidogenic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). APP also interacts with the palmitoyl acyltransferase, DHHC12/AID, which suppresses APP trafficking by tethering APP in the Golgi and inhibiting APP metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Palmitoylated APP is enriched in lipid rafts and is a more efficient substrate for BACE1. BACE1 is also located to lipid rafts based on it being palmitoylated, thus promoting Aβ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). The palmitoyltransferase inhibitors, 2-bromopalmitate and cerulenin, decrease Aβ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Inhibition of palmitoylated-APP formation by ACAT inhibitors (the preferred long-chain acyl substrate for ACAT1 is palmitoyl-CoA, the precursor of palmitate) would appear to be a valid strategy for prevention and/or treatment of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Therefore, a perturbation in the balance between palmitoylation and de-palmitoylation could affect Aβ metabolism and might be associated with AD. Although it is unclear exactly how <italic>PPT1</italic> heterozygosity affects the levels of the secretases, the fact that α-secretase (non-amyloidogenic) levels are depressed and β- and γ-secretase (amyloidogenic) levels are increased in aged heterozygous <italic>PPT1</italic> mice, and the AD pathway is activated in <italic>PPT1</italic> heterozygous sheep supports the role of PPT1 haploinsufficiency in AD.</p><p id="P27">Another example where perturbation of a specific degradative pathway might affect Aβ aggregation and/or trafficking is with the <italic>NAGLU, IDUA</italic>, and <italic>GUSB</italic> genes. These lysosomal enzymes are involved in the stepwise degradation of glycosaminoglycans. Specifically, NAGLU is required for the degradation of heparan sulfate (HS), IDUA is required for the degradation of HS and dermatan sulfate (DS), and GUSB is required for the degradation of HS, DS, and chondroitin sulfate (CS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). The common substrate for all three enzymes is HS. Therefore, all three enzymes are required to maintain homeostatic levels of heparan sulfated proteoglycans (HSPG). HSPGs regulate the oligomerization, clearance, endocytosis and trafficking of a variety of pathogenic proteins and have been shown to mediate cellular Aβ uptake and accelerate its oligomerization and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). HSPGs are also present in Aβ plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). These findings suggest that HS and HSPGs play important roles in Aβ metabolism and the pathogenesis of AD. Complete deficiency of NAGLU, IDUA, and GUSB result in the pediatric lysosomal storage diseases mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB (MPSIIIB), mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPSI), and mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPSVII), respectively. Untreated MPS patients rarely live beyond their twenties and thus do not have AD. However, it has been shown that these patients have increased levels of soluble Aβ and accumulate intracellular Aβ in cells throughout the brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Data suggest that intraneuronal Aβ is neurotoxic and precedes extracellular deposition in both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). In addition, pharmacological inhibition of HSPG binding of pathogenic proteins and genetic reduction of HSPG synthesis facilitate the clearance of pathogenic proteins and reduce their aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that heterozygosity of <italic>NAGLU, IDUA</italic>, and <italic>GUSB</italic> might alter the normal levels of HSPGs and exacerbate Aβ aggregation. There are three additional lysosomal genes that are involved in heparan sulfate metabolism; heparan N-sulfatase (<italic>SGSH</italic>), α-glucosaminide acetyltransferase (<italic>HGSNAT</italic>), and N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfatase (<italic>GNS</italic>). If haploinsufficiency of lysosomal enzymes responsible for proper HS metabolism result in subtle changes in the levels of HSPGs and are involved in the pathogenesis of AD, by extrapolation, heterozygous mutations in <italic>SGSH, HGSNAT</italic>, and <italic>GNS</italic> might also represent risk factors for AD.</p><p id="P28">It is less clear how heterozygosity of other lysosomal enzyme genes discovered in the human genetic analysis might be involved in AD. Galactocerebrosidase and acid ceramidase are lysosomal enzymes that catabolize glycolipids and were identified in the human genetic analysis. Homozygous deficiency of <italic>GALC</italic> and <italic>ASAH1</italic> result in the lipid storage diseases, globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) and Farber lipogranulomatosis, respectively. Interestingly, the substrate specificity of these two enzymes overlaps. <italic>GALC</italic> and <italic>ASAH1</italic> can both cleave galactosylceramide, albeit at different sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Subtle perturbation in the levels or distribution of various galactosylceramide species could affect specific pathways involved in Aβ metabolism or disrupt the integrity of lipid membranes and thus result in secondary or global lysosome defects. In fact, it has been shown that accumulation of one of the substrates of GALC, galactosylsphingosine, can affect lipid microdomains and disrupt lipid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>).</p><p id="P29">With respect to the possibility that heterozygosity a single lysosomal enzyme might cause some sort of global lysosome dysfunction, it has been shown that complete deficiency of a single lysosomal enzyme can result in the accumulation of substrates other than those degraded by the deficient enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that heterozygosity of a single lysosomal enzyme could have effects on other enzymes and their substrates thus leading to a subtle but chronic global lysosome dysfunction. Another observation that would be consistent with global lysosome dysfunction is the fact that all five lysosomal genes validated <italic>in vivo</italic> significantly decreased the levels of Aβ in brain ISF. This common observation also appears to be counterintuitive since AD is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular Aβ plaques. However, as mentioned above, it has been shown in several distinct lysosomal storage diseases that there can be a massive accumulation of intracellular Aβ in the absence of extracellular plaques. This might suggest that a severe (in the case of homozygous deficiency) or a subtle (in the case of haploinsufficiency) perturbation in lysosome function affects some common pathway resulting in the sequestration of Aβ within the cell. This would also be consistent with a defect in the normal trafficking or secretion of Aβ fragments as described above.</p><p id="P30">Finally, the fact that soluble lysosomal enzymes can be secreted from a cell and taken up by adjacent cells through a well-established, receptor-mediated mechanism, commonly referred to as cross-correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>), opens the possibility that lysosomal enzyme-associated forms of AD might be amenable to treatment. The biochemical, histological and clinical improvements observed in the 5xFAD/PPT1+/- mice following CNS-directed, AAV-mediated gene therapy strongly support this contention. Complementing the haploinsufficient enzyme could be accomplished by a number of means, including direct gene therapy, <italic>ex vivo</italic> stem cell-directed gene therapy, protein replacement therapy, chaperone therapy, etc. Several of these approaches are already FDA-approved or are currently in clinical trials for homozygous lysosomal enzyme deficiencies.</p><p id="P31">Cumulatively, these data strongly suggest that heterozygous deleterious mutations/variants in lysosomal enzyme genes are associated with AD. However, at this point it is difficult to determine the exact mechanism/s involved or the overall risk. In this study, we identified at least seven different genes that might represent risk factors for AD and we believe that this underestimates the total number that are associated with AD. In addition, there are 40 or more LSD that have a significant neurological component. Even if the risk associated with an individual lysosomal enzyme gene is low, the number of genes involved could be relatively large. For example, based on an overall incidence of LSD of 1/7000 - 1/5000 live births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>), the carrier frequency for a lysosomal gene defect in the general population would be 1/41 - 1/35. For an individual LSD with an incidence of 1/100,000 live births, the carrier frequency would be 1/158. Therefore, heterozygous deleterious mutations/variants in lysosomal enzyme genes could be associated with a significant proportion of AD patients.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Animals and human samples</title><p id="P32">All the mice used in this study were maintained on a congenic C57BL/6J background by MSS at Washington University School of Medicine.

In the context of Het sheep, PPT1 protein was used as an internal control where the median of PPT1<sup>+/-</sup> samples calculated as 35% decrease from WT controls.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Proteomic bioinformatics analysis</title><p id="P42">Given the nature of the questions investigated, not knowing what a meaningful threshold for magnitude of change should be for protein alterations within a given defined molecular pathway/cascade data was analysed and differing abundance thresholds are indicated accordingly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Data were further analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Silicon Valley, CA, USA) to explore the cellular and molecular pathways that may have been altered as a consequence of differential expression in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) human post mortem samples or heterozygous PPT1 +/- sheep (Het) versus their respective controls. A right-tailed Fisher’s Exact Test was used to calculate the <italic>p</italic>-value determining the probability that each cellular and molecular function or canonical pathway assigned to that dataset is due to chance alone, and the final lists of functions and pathways were ranked accordingly to the resulting <italic>p</italic>-value.</p><p id="P43">The same datasets of proteins were used for network generation in IPA. Each identifier was mapped to its corresponding entry in Ingenuity’s Knowledge Base, and these proteins were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from information contained in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). Networks were then algorithmically generated based on their connectivity. The Functional Analysis of each network identified the biological functions and/or diseases that were most significant to the proteins in the network. A right-tailed Fisher’s Exact Test was used to calculate the <italic>p</italic>-value representing the probability that the overlaps reported between the input dataset and the base pathway/network (e.g., all of the constituent components of RhoGD signalling) are due to chance alone. The resulting networks are a graphical representation of the molecular relationships between proteins, where proteins are represented as nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge (line). All edges are supported by at least one reference from the literature, from a textbook or from canonical information stored in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base, all supporting an <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> observation of a protein–protein or protein–DNA interaction (as opposed to a merely predicted interaction from in silico experimentation).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>AAV9-hPPT1 vector and intracranial injections</title><p id="P44">The AAV9-hPPT1 vector used in this study was initially created and characterized by Griffey et al. (2004) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). The concentration of the AAV vector was 1 x 10<sup>12</sup> vg/ml in sterile lactated Ringer’s solution. For the intracranial injections in 3.5-month-old mice, animals were placed under surgical anesthesia with isofluorane, the head shaved, and cleaned with 70% isopropanol and Betadine. The animals were placed in a three-point stereotactic frame and a midline incision was made under aseptic conditions. A 2mm burr hole was made and the AAV vector slowly injected. Four, 2μl intraparenchymal bilateral injections were performed at the following coordinates from the bregma to target the cortex (-1.0mm – AP, -2.5mm – ML, -0.7 - DV) and hippocampus (- 2.0mm - AP, -1.5mm – ML, -1.5mm – DV). The single intracerebroventricular injections contained the identical dose (8 x 10<sup>9</sup> vg) of virus and were injected at the following coordinates: left hemisphere, -0.5mm – AP, -1.0mm – ML, -1.7mm – DV. Once the injection was complete, the needle was removed and the incision closed with 5-0 nylon suture. The animals were allowed to recover on a temperature-regulated pad and returned to their home cage.

For the Y-maze, a mouse was placed in the center of a Y-maze that contained three arms that were 10.5 cm wide, 40 cm long and 20.5 cm deep oriented at 120° with respect to each successive other arm. Mice were allowed to explore the maze for 8 min and entry into an arm was scored only when the hindlimbs had completely entered the arm. An alternation was defined as any three consecutive choices of three different arms without re-exploration of a previously visited arm. Dependent variables included the number of alternations and arm entries along with the percentage of alternations, which was determined by dividing the total number of alternations by the total number of entries minus 2, then multiplying by 100.</p><p id="P46">In the elevated plus maze, a 5 min trial was conducted in a dark room using a standard mouse elevated plus maze from Kinder Scientific (Poway, CA). The maze consisted of a black acrylic surface measuring 5x5cm and elevated 63cm above the floor equipped with photo beam pairs to track the position of the mouse. Four arms (35cm long, 5cm wide; two open and two with 15cm high walls) extended from a central area. The MotorMonitor software (Kinder Scientific, LLC, Poway, CA) quantified beam breaks as duration, distance traveled, entries, and time at rest in each zone (closed arms, open arms and center area). Variables analyzed were percent of total time, distance, and entries into the open arms of the maze during the trial, as well as total distance traveled.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> Aβ microdialysis</title><p id="P47">To assess ISF Aβ levels in the hippocampus of awake, freely moving WT, <italic>PPT1</italic>+/-, <italic>GALC</italic>+/-, <italic>NAGLU</italic>+/-, <italic>IDUA</italic>+/-, and <italic>GUSB</italic>+/- mice over time <italic>in vivo</italic>, microdialysis was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). Briefly, under isoflurane anesthesia, a guide cannula was stereotaxically implanted above the hippocampus (3.1 mm behind bregma, 2.5 mm lateral to midline, and 1.2 mm below dura at a 12° angle). A microdialysis probe was inserted through the guide cannula into the brain. Artificial CSF (1.3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 3 mM KCl, 0.4 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 122 mM NaCl, pH 7.35) containing 0.15% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane was used as perfusion buffer. Flow rate was a constant 1.0 μl/min. Samples were collected every 60 to 90 min overnight, which gets through the 4-to 6-hour recovery period, and the mean concentration of Aβ over the 6-hour preceding treatment was defined as basal concentration of ISF Aβ. Samples were collected through a refrigerated fraction collector and assessed for Aβ40 or Aβ42 by ELISAs [β-amyloid antibodies mHJ5.1 and mHJ2 (kind gift from David Holtzman, Washington University School of Medicine) were used for the ELISA assays]. The mean concentration of exchangeable Aβ (eAβ) detected was corrected for assuming a 12% recovery rate of Aβ into the microdialysis probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). The absolute concentration of ISF Aβ for each animal was the mean concentration of six hours of collection between hours 10-16 after probe insertion.

Statement</title></caption><p>Lysosomes play a role in the degradation of aggregation-prone proteins such as amyloid β (Aβ). Homozygous lysosomal enzyme gene defects result in fatal pediatric lysosomal storage diseases and, historically, carriers were considered normal. However, a human genetic analysis identified deleterious heterozygous variants in multiple lysosomal enzyme genes that are enriched in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. Those findings were validated <italic>in vivo</italic> by demonstrating that heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in five different lysosomal enzyme genes affect Aβ processing and exacerbate Aβ plaque formation. CNS-directed gene therapy ameliorated the effects of a heterozygous LoF mutation in one of those genes in a mouse model of AD. These findings provide insights into the role of lysosomes in AD and have important therapeutic implications.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Heterozygosity of <italic>PPT1</italic> exacerbates the AD-like phenotype of the 5xFAD mouse.</title><p>(A) Heterozygosity of <italic>PPT1</italic> decreases brain PPT1 activity by approximately half and homozygous deficiency completely eliminates enzyme activity.
