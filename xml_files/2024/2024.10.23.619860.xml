Disruption of these regulators in mice leads to severe neurological phenotypes, and their misregulation is linked to human disease. However, the specific microexons involved in these phenotypes and the effects of individual microexon deletions on neurodevelopment, physiology, and behavior remain poorly understood. To explore this, we generated zebrafish lines with deletions of 18 individual microexons, alongside <italic>srrm3</italic> and <italic>srrm4</italic> mutant lines, and conducted comprehensive phenotypic analyses. We discovered that while loss of <italic>srrm3</italic>, alone or together with <italic>srrm4</italic>, resulted in significant alterations in neuritogenesis, locomotion, and social behavior, individual microexon deletions typically produced mild or no noticeable effects. Nonetheless, we identified specific microexons associated with defects in neuritogenesis (<italic>evi5b</italic>, <italic>vav2</italic>, <italic>itsn1</italic>, <italic>src</italic>) and social behavior (<italic>vti1a</italic>, <italic>kif1b</italic>). Additionally, microexon deletions triggered coordinated transcriptomic changes in neural pathways, suggesting the presence of molecular compensatory mechanisms. Our findings suggest that the severe phenotypes caused by <italic>Srrm3/4</italic> depletion arise from the combined effects of multiple subtle disruptions across various cellular pathways, which are individually well-tolerated.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">Alternative splicing, the differential processing of introns and exons in eukaryotic pre-mRNAs, is the main mechanism generating transcriptomic and proteomic diversity in vertebrates. A large fraction of human multi-exonic genes exhibit alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pan, et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wang, et al. 2008</xref>), and a substantial portion of it is regulated in a cell type and tissue dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Tapial, et al. 2017</xref>). A paradigmatic example of tissue-specific regulation are neural microexons, tiny exons ranging from 3 to 27 nucleotides (nts) in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Irimia, et al. 2014</xref>). While a few microexons had been anecdotally reported before (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Worley, et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dergai, et al. 2010</xref>)), the discovery of hundreds of microexons regulated in a tight neural-specific manner dates back to a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Irimia, et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Li, et al. 2015</xref>). Neural microexons are often completely skipped in most cell types, including stem cells and neural progenitors, and are sharply switched on during neuronal differentiation by their master regulators <italic>Srrm3</italic> and <italic>Srrm4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Irimia, et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Nakano, et al. 2019</xref>). More recently, inclusion of a subset of neural microexons has been reported in endocrine pancreatic cells of mammals, where <italic>Srrm3</italic> is also expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Juan-Mateu, et al. 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The potential functional relevance of cell type-specific microexons is supported by multiple lines of evidence. First, neural microexons are the most conserved type of alternative splicing described so far, showing remarkable conservation across jawed vertebrates and, in some instances, from human to cephalochordates and arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Torres-Méndez, et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Torres-Mendez, et al. 2022</xref>). Second, the impact of numerous microexons on protein function has been demonstrated, and they often modulate protein-protein interactions or protein interactions with other molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ellis, et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kjer-Hansen and Weatheritt 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Roth, et al. 2023</xref>). Third, loss-of-function models for their highly specific master regulators show dramatic phenotypes, particularly in mammals. For instance, a homozygous mouse gene trap for <italic>Srrm4</italic> exhibits strong neurodevelopmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Quesnel-Vallières, et al. 2015</xref>), while another gene trap for <italic>Srrm3</italic> also displays multiple neurodevelopmental phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Nakano, et al. 2019</xref>), as well as pancreas-derived physiological alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Juan-Mateu, et al. 2023</xref>). Moreover, the heterozygous mouse gene trap for <italic>Srrm4</italic> has been shown to have defects on neuronal activity and it exhibits multiple hallmarks of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Quesnel-Vallieres, et al. 2016</xref>), in line with the reported misregulation of microexons in various human patients with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Irimia, et al. 2014</xref>). In zebrafish, we have recently demonstrated that <italic>srrm3</italic> mutants exhibit severe photoreceptor malformations and degeneration, leading to vision loss and early mortality under standard rearing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Ciampi, et al. 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Despite these studies, however, how misregulation of specific microexons leads to the dramatic phenotypes observed for the mutants of their master regulators is still largely unknown. For instance, it is not yet known whether these phenotypes are caused by a few microexon targets with strong effects (e.g., as in the paradigmatic example of Fgfr alternative splicing for <italic>Esrp1/2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bebee, et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Burguera, et al. 2017</xref>)) or by a complex cumulative effect of multiple small molecular impacts. A major limitation is that the cellular and organismal phenotypes caused by the removal or downregulation of individual microexons has only been assessed for a few cases, mainly using mouse models or cell cultures. In many such cases, loss-of-function microexon models show relatively mild but robust phenotypes. Importantly, these phenotypes range from defects on neurite growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Worley, et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zibetti, et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Ohnishi, et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Quesnel-Vallières, et al. 2015</xref>) to neuronal malfunction and behavioral abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Wang, et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis, et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Poliński, et al. 2023</xref>). However, other cases did not reveal noticeable phenotypes (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Matalkah, et al. 2022</xref>)), and the potential impact of the publication bias towards positive results is difficult to evaluate.</p><p id="P8">To tackle this major open question, common to other tissue-specific splicing regulators, in this study we generated stable CRISPR-Cas9 deletion mutants in zebrafish for 18 highly conserved neural-specific microexons regulated by <italic>srrm3/4</italic>. We phenotypically characterized these lines, along with mutant lines for <italic>srrm3</italic> and <italic>srrm4</italic>, across multiple levels, including axon guidance, neurite growth, larval and juvenile locomotion, larval sensory responses, and social behavior in juveniles. In contrast to the marked phenotypes observed for their master regulators, especially <italic>srrm3</italic>, most microexon mutants showed no phenotypes for most tests, with a few notable exceptions. Transcriptomic analysis of mutant larvae and their wild type siblings suggests that coordinated misregulation of specific neural-related pathways may provide functional compensations at the molecular level. In summary, while the presence of non-studied microexon targets with strong functional effects cannot be ruled out, our results are in line with a model in which the phenotypes of the master regulators are caused by the combined impact of multiple milder perturbations affecting many cellular pathways.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Identification and characterization of <italic>srrm3/4</italic>-regulated neural microexons in zebrafish</title><p id="P9">To identify neural exons and microexons in zebrafish, we employed a similar approach to that described recently for mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Juan-Mateu, et al. 2023</xref>)(see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). Using transcriptome-wide quantifications of exon inclusion for multiple cell and tissue samples from <italic>VastDB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Tapial, et al. 2017</xref>), we identified a total of 708 neural exons with sufficient read coverage in at least five tissues. Of these, 246 (34.8%) corresponded to microexons of 3-27 nt, 139 (19.6%) to 28-51 nt exons and 323 (45.6%) to exons longer than 51 nts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). For comparison, we identified 919 neural exons in human with equivalent expression criteria, which showed a similar proportion of microexons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1A</xref>). As in the case of mammalian programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Juan-Mateu, et al. 2023</xref>), a subset of zebrafish neural microexons were also substantially included in endocrine pancreatic cells, whereas smaller fractions were detected in muscle and, less expectedly, immune tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Tissue-specific regulation was validated by RT-PCR assays for all 21 selected conserved neural microexons (see below) using independent RNA samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Neural microexons show sharp progressive upregulation during embryo development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). In terms of function, genes harboring microexons are strongly enriched in Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to vesicle-mediated transport, endocytosis, GTPase activity, synaptic organization and neuron development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Irimia, et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Torres-Mendez, et al. 2022</xref>). Zebrafish microexons are also significantly more conserved in human than long exons in terms of neural regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 6.8e-03, two-sided Fisher's Exact test between microexons and long exons). However, this increased conservation was relatively minor and, in fact, similar at the genomic level ("no event ortholog" in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). This contrasts with the reciprocal comparison, where human neural microexons appeared substantially more conserved at the genomic and regulatory level in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1C</xref>), and suggests that zebrafish has evolved a larger fraction of lineage-specific microexons. Finally, 191/243 (78.6%) of neural microexons with sufficient read coverage were affected (ΔPSI &lt; -15) by <italic>srrm3/4</italic> loss-of-function in 5 dpf larva and/or retina (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>), in contrast to 82/136 (60.3%) and 122/317 (38.5%) exons of length 28-51 nts and longer, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 8.4e-22, two-sided Fisher's Exact test between microexons and long exons). A similar fraction of human orthologs (98/121, 81.0%) responded to the ectopic expression of the regulator in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1D</xref>). In addition, the genome-wide effect of <italic>srrm3/4</italic> loss-of-function in zebrafish is strongly biased towards small exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Ciampi, et al. 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Stable microexon deletions do not compromise viability and overall morphology</title><p id="P11">To investigate the functional impact of neural-specific <italic>srrm3/4</italic>-regulated microexons, we selected 21 highly conserved microexons for further characterization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). These microexons were selected based on various criteria, including sharp neural-specific inclusion and strong <italic>srrm3/4</italic> regulation in zebrafish, as well as high regulatory conservation in human, both in terms of tissue-specificity and <italic>SRRM3/4</italic> regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, we prioritized some microexons for which a molecular function had been reported (e.g., <italic>apbb1</italic>, <italic>itsn1</italic>, <italic>kif1b</italic>, <italic>mef2ca</italic>, <italic>src</italic>), and the host gene had no close paralogs (e.g., <italic>reln</italic>, <italic>madd</italic>, <italic>src</italic>) and/or had important roles in development and neurobiology (<italic>gli2b</italic>, <italic>gli3</italic>, <italic>cdon</italic>, <italic>mef2ca</italic>, <italic>shank3a</italic>, <italic>shank3b</italic>, <italic>reln</italic>). Moreover, we included representatives of the main enriched GO categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), such as vesicle transport and endocytosis (<italic>itsn1</italic>, <italic>src, vti1a</italic>), GTPase activity (<italic>vav2</italic>, <italic>evi5b, ap1g1, asap1b, madd, dock7</italic>), synapse organization (<italic>shank3a</italic>, <italic>shank3b</italic>) and microtubule binding (<italic>kif1b</italic>).</p><p id="P12">We generated stable zebrafish lines for the deletion of each of these microexons using the CRISPR-Cas9 system and designing pairs of guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting the neighboring upstream and downstream intronic sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). We selected two founders for each microexon showing a clean genomic deletion covering the entire microexon. Such deletions are expected to result in normal expression of the host gene but skipping the microexon in every cell, including neurons, which can be validated through RT-PCR assays with primers spanning the neighboring exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1</xref>). However, for three of these microexons (<italic>spock3</italic>, <italic>pus7</italic>, and <italic>dock7</italic>; asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), the genomic deletion led to the inclusion of cryptic sequences predicted to create frameshifts and thus gene downregulation, and were consequently excluded from subsequent phenotypic analyses. For comparison, we also included mutant lines for the master regulators of microexons, <italic>srrm3</italic> and <italic>srrm4</italic>, as well as the double mutant line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Our previous work on these lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Ciampi, et al. 2022</xref>) showed that mutation of <italic>srrm3</italic> has a major impact on microexon inclusion in the retina, whereas <italic>srrm4</italic> loss of function has a very small effect.</p><p id="P13">Initial characterization of the 18 microexon deletions revealed no gross morphological abnormalities and no differences in body size compared to their heterozygous siblings at the juvenile stage (~30 dpf, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Similar results were obtained for <italic>srrm4</italic> mutants. This contrasts with the <italic>srrm3</italic> mutant line, for which we had previously shown that homozygous mutants die between 12-20 dpf, likely due to feeding problems caused by their impaired vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Ciampi, et al. 2022</xref>). Here, we have reared these fish using special conditions that increase food availability, allowing them to reach the adult stage (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). However, adult <italic>srrm3</italic> homozygous mutants were subfertile, showed reduced body size at 90 pdf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.007, two-sided t-test) and had multiple locomotor and behavioral abnormalities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Video S1</xref> and see below).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Some microexons exhibit robust defects on neurite outgrowth <italic>ex vivo</italic></title><p id="P14">To begin investigating the impact of microexon deletions on zebrafish neurodevelopment, we assessed two phenotypes at the cellular level related to axon guidance and neurite outgrowth. Homozygous <italic>Srrm4</italic> KO mice showed severe defects on axonal midline crossing through the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Quesnel-Vallières, et al. 2015</xref>). Thus, to evaluate potential axon guidance alterations, we first studied Mauthner cells in individual 48 hpf larvae. All studied larvae for all microexon deletions appeared normal, as well as those from <italic>srrm3</italic>, <italic>srrm4</italic> and double mutant lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Next, we focused on neurite outgrowth, a phenotypic trait reported to be altered in primary neuronal cultures of homozygous <italic>Srrm4</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Quesnel-Vallières, et al. 2015</xref>), as well as for various loss-of-function models of individual microexons in mouse (e.g. <italic>Kdm1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zibetti, et al. 2010</xref>), <italic>Zfyve27</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Ohnishi, et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Ohnishi, et al. 2017</xref>), <italic>L1cam</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jacob, et al. 2002</xref>)). To robustly quantify neurite growth, we developed a new protocol to generate primary neuronal cultures from zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure 3 - figure supplement 1A</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). In brief, HuC:GFP-positive cells were isolated using Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) at 48 hpf and plated on Poly-D-Lysine coated 8-microwell glass slides (1cm<sup>2</sup>/well) at a density of 200,000 cells/well in Neurobasal (NB) supplemented media at 28ºC and 5% CO2. Isolated HuC:GFP-positive cells lose their neurites, which are then progressively regrown in culture, as observed by acetylated tubulin staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure 3 - figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). For each microexon deletion, as well as the regulator mutant lines, we measured the longest neurite for each cell at 10 and 24 hours after plating (hap) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). A few microexon deletion mutants showed significantly different neurite length distributions compared to control wild type (WT) larvae at 10 hap and/or 24 hap that were highly robust across replicates and founder lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure 3 - figure supplement 2</xref>).

In the case of the regulators, whereas neither <italic>srrm3</italic> nor <italic>srrm4</italic> individual mutants exhibited significant alterations in neurite length, the double mutant had strongly decreased neurite lengths at 10 hap compared to control siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure 3 - figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p id="P16">At the molecular level, the microexons in both ITSN1 and SRC have been shown to modulate interaction with DNM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dergai, et al. 2010</xref>), which is involved in synaptic vesicle recycling and is important for neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bodmer, et al. 2011</xref>). In the case of <italic>vav2</italic>, which encodes a Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), the deleted 15-nt microexon falls close to its RhoGEF domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Specifically, after 5 minutes of habituation, we recorded baseline activity in the light for 25 minutes, and then for five alternating intervals of 10 minutes of dark and light.

In particular, <italic>srrm3</italic> mutants had increased activity in baseline and light interval conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), whereas the double mutant showed only a significant, yet milder, increase during the light intervals. Interestingly, larvae with homozygous <italic>evi5b</italic> microexon deletion also showed mildly significantly increased baseline activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Finally, we also evaluated thigmotaxis, or the preference of a larva to be close to the wall of the well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>), since increased time spent in the periphery is generally associated with higher anxiety levels in multiple systems and model organisms. Surprisingly, both <italic>srrm3</italic> and <italic>srrm3/4</italic> mutants showed significant abnormalities in thigmotaxis, but they did so in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Therefore, we next set out to assess potential social defects in zebrafish mutant microexon lines. For this purpose, we implemented a custom version of the behavioral set-up developed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hinz and de Polavieja 2017</xref>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure 5 - figure supplement 1</xref>) and used <italic>idtracker.ai</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Romero-Ferrero, et al. 2019</xref>) to track activity and interactions of pairs of ~1 month old juveniles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). For all lines except for the double <italic>srrm3/4</italic> mutant, which could not reach this age, we aimed at blindly assaying at least 10 pairs of each genotype combination (two heterozygous [Het-Het], two homozygous for the deletion [Del-Del] or one of each [Het-Del]), when possible. For each fish on a pair, we quantified different parameters related to locomotion (speed, normal and tangential acceleration, distance traveled), anxiety (distance to the center of the arena) and leadership (time following the other fish in the pair). In addition, we quantified the distance between the two fish from a pair and the overall agreement between their movement vectors (polarization), both of which give a measure of their social preference. Specifically, WT juvenile fish display a very strong social behavior, with small inter-individual distances and highly concordant movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hinz and de Polavieja 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We found no statistically significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) for any locomotion or anxiety related parameter for any microexon deletion or for either <italic>srrm3</italic> or <italic>srrm4</italic> mutant lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). This was the case when comparing the average values of the two homotypic pairs (Het-Het vs Del-Del; same "S") or the values of Het and Del fish within heterotypic pairs (Het-Del; different "D"), although some potential trends could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure 5 - figure supplement 2-10</xref>). In contrast, <italic>srrm3</italic> mutants as well as two microexon deletions, <italic>vti1a</italic> and <italic>kif1b</italic>, showed significant defects in social parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B-D</xref>). In particular, homozygous Del fish for the three mutations exhibited significantly higher leadership, i.e., an increase in the time spent in front of a paired Het fish, as visually evident in the heatmaps of relative positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Increased leadership could, to some extent, be considered an autism-like phenotype, as it suggests reduced social preference in the Del fish compared to the Het one, which tends to follow its pair closely. In line with this, the inter-individual distance was increased in Del-Del pairs compared to other genotype combinations for <italic>srrm3</italic> and <italic>vti1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), while the polarization was decreased in <italic>srrm3</italic> mutant pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure 5 - figure supplement 9</xref>). These differences in social behavior were relatively minor for <italic>vti1a</italic> and <italic>kif1b</italic> mutants, but very strong for <italic>srrm3</italic> fish, which displayed a dramatically reduced social behavior, as it could be also visualized in recordings of groups of five homozygous mutants compared to groups of WT ones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Videos S2 and S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Transcriptomic analyses suggest potential compensatory changes through regulation of neural-related pathways</title><p id="P20">Given the minor phenotypes we observed for most microexon deletions, it is conceivable that defects in individual protein functions are compensated for by other molecular changes. Hence, we aimed at assessing global transcriptomic alterations in microexon mutants lines. For this purpose, we generated RNA-seq data for pools of ~10 5 dpf homozygous mutant larvae (Del) and wild type siblings (WT) for the 18 microexon deletions, as well as for the <italic>srrm3</italic> mutant line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure 6 - figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S6</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). As expected, all microexon deletions led to minor changes in expression for most genes (absolute delta corrected VST expression &lt; 0.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). To identify potential compensatory changes, we first focused on changes in the expression of the host gene as well as its closely related paralogs. A few microexon deletions resulted in substantial relative changes in the expression of the host gene (e.g., <italic>apbb1</italic>, <italic>mef2ca, kif1b</italic>), particularly towards increased levels, and/or of some of the paralogs (e.g., <italic>apbb1</italic>, <italic>evi5b</italic>, <italic>gli3, mef2ca, shank3b</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Some of these changes may have straightforward interpretation. For instance, inclusion of the 24-nt microexon in the human ortholog of <italic>mef2ca</italic> has been reported to increase its transactivation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zhu, et al. 2005</xref>); therefore, an increase in overall expression levels of the isoform without the microexon could conceivably compensate for the deletion of the microexon. Next, we reasoned that, while individual genes may not exhibit strong expression changes, coordinated changes in specific cellular pathways could identify significant patterns shared across multiple microexon deletions. For this purpose, we summed the absolute changes in expression (WT vs Del) for each gene across the 18 microexon deletions and performed a positive Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) with these joint differential expression values. This revealed various groups of related GO categories that showed coordinated gene expression changes across the microexon lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Remarkably, these categories were highly related to neuronal function and organization (e.g., channels, G-protein coupled receptor activity, synapse, axon, etc.). Many of these categories were also differently expressed in <italic>srrm3</italic> mutant larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). Importantly, the same coordinated changes were not observed in all microexon deletions or they did not occur in the same direction (up- or down-regulation)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). This is in line with the patterns observed for neurite growth (e.g. <italic>vav2</italic> and <italic>evi5b</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) or for other phenotypic traits (e.g., insulin secretion in beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Juan-Mateu, et al. 2023</xref>)), and it suggests that different microexons within the <italic>srrm3</italic>-regulated program may have opposite impacts. Finally, we looked at expression changes in manually curated gene sets of special relevance for neurobiology and/or embryo development, including gene orthologs associated with ASD or schizophrenia, as well as multiple signaling pathways. Some of these sets were widely significantly misregulated across microexon lines, particularly those related to ASD and the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). In summary, while microexon deletions lead to mild changes in expression of individual genes, they often result in significant, coordinated effects on specific neurally related pathways, which may suggest molecular compensation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">Despite the major defects observed for the loss-of-function models of their master regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Calarco, et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Nakano, et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Quesnel-Vallières, et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Nakano, et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Torres-Mendez, et al. 2022</xref>), it is still unknown how individual microexons underlie those phenotypes. In this study, we set out to address this question by generating and characterizing 18 microexon deletion zebrafish lines, along with mutant lines of <italic>srrm3</italic> and <italic>srrm4</italic>. To phenotypically characterize these lines, we implemented a battery of tests, aiming at evaluating a wide range of potential neural defects at multiple levels: cellular (neuritogenesis), tissue (gross morphology and axon guidance), behavioral (individual stimuli response, collective interactions) and molecular (transcriptome-wide gene expression patterns). These assays provide a clear picture: while loss of function of the master regulators had strong defects at nearly all levels, particularly for <italic>srrm3</italic> (consistent with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Nakano, et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Ciampi, et al. 2022</xref>)), all individual microexon deletions were viable and exhibited mild or no detectable alterations in nearly every feature we measured.</p><p id="P22">These results thus raise a major fundamental question: why do individual microexon deletions lead to such mild phenotypes? There are several potential explanations, most of which are not mutually exclusive. First, the easiest explanation is that most microexons could simply lack any relevant function. However, this is unlikely for the majority of the microexons we have studied, as they are conserved from zebrafish to human, for at least 450 million years of evolution. Moreover, functions at the protein level have been reported for the mammalian orthologs of few of these microexons, including the modulation of protein-protein interactions (<italic>apbb1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Irimia, et al. 2014</xref>), <italic>itsn1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dergai, et al. 2010</xref>), <italic>src</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dergai, et al. 2010</xref>)), transactivation activity (<italic>mef2ca</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zhu, et al. 2005</xref>)) or motor activity (<italic>kif1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Matsushita, et al. 2009</xref>)). In addition, we uncovered here a difference in GEF activity between the two isoforms of <italic>vav2</italic>, which are in accordance with the impact of the microexon deletion on neurite growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Moon and Gomez 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Second, another set of trivial explanations relate to the experimental design, and include that (i) we may not be assessing the traits that these microexons are impacting, (ii) we may not have the sensitivity to robustly measure the magnitude of the changes caused by microexon removal, and/or (iii) the effects may not manifest under optimal laboratory conditions. The latter has been shown to be key, for instance, for embryo growth phenotypes upon <italic>Mbnl3</italic> KO in mouse, which only manifested when the mothers were subjected to calorie restricted diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Spruce, et al. 2022</xref>), or for shadow enhancers in fruit fly, whose effects were only appreciated upon suboptimal temperature conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Frankel, et al. 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Third, related to the second point, it is also possible that relatively small perturbations can be compensated for by other molecular changes, particularly under optimal conditions. While this is a very complex hypothesis to test, we have uncovered substantial changes in gene expression in the host gene and/or related paralogs (a classic compensatory mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">El-Brolosy, et al. 2019</xref>)), as well as significant coordinated expression changes in gene categories enriched for neural functions. In this scenario, the mild effects of single microexon deletions could be neutralized. In contrast, the global microexon misregulation upon <italic>srrm3/4</italic> mutation would introduce a high number of small changes impacting multiple pathways that could not be properly compensated for altogether, thus causing large phenotypes. Interestingly, it is possible that, despite its many positive aspects as a model organism, zebrafish could be a less suited system to assess the mild phenotypic effects expected for microexon deletions, given the additional whole genome duplication of teleosts compared to most other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Amores, et al. 1998</xref>). This higher number of paralogs confers zebrafish much higher genetic redundancy compared to mammals, which can be used for potential compensatory changes. Consistent with this idea, various studies have identified robust phenotypes for individual microexon deletions <italic>in vivo</italic> in mouse models (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Wang, et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis, et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Poliński, et al. 2023</xref>)), although publication biases cannot be excluded (i.e., towards positive results (e.g. see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Matalkah, et al. 2022</xref>)) and due to the higher number of mouse vs zebrafish studies).</p><p id="P25">Finally, relatedly, another potential explanation may reside in the very nature of the molecular role of microexons. Given that they encode for only a few amino acids and they exhibit dramatic cell type specificity, microexon inclusion is expected to contribute to the specialization of a protein for a given context (e.g. the synapse) with respect to the broadly expressed microexon-skipping isoform. In this scenario, both protein isoforms would be partly redundant by definition, as they play equivalent roles but specialized for different contexts, much like two gene paralogs. Therefore, and particularly under optimal conditions, this redundancy is likely to mask the effects of the individual microexon deletions.</p><p id="P26">Nevertheless, whatever the explanation(s) behind the lack of strong phenotypes observed for most microexon deletions, the exceptional conservation of these exons for hundreds of millions of years can be considered an evolutionary paradox. This case is reminiscent of other highly conserved genomic elements, whose deletions usually lead to viable animals, with little or no alterations, such as the ultraconserved elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ahituv, et al. 2007</xref>) or some long non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Goudarzi, et al. 2019</xref>). Further research should solve this paradox by providing the missing pieces (i.e., lack of sensitivity or adequate conditions, compensation, redundancy), which will help to better understand the roles and physiological relevance of individual microexons and, more generally, of tissue-specific alternative exon programs.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Definition of neural-specific alternative exons</title><p id="P27">Inclusion tables for zebrafish samples were downloaded from <italic>VastDB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Tapial, et al. 2017</xref>) (vastdb.crg.eu).

It represents how fast the zebrafish is speeding up or slowing down without changing direction (associated scape response and group cohesion) measured in cm/s<sup>2</sup>. (iv) Distance traveled<italic>:</italic> distance traveled (cm). (v) Time in the periphery: Total number of frames that a fish was found in the periphery (border) of the arena. We defined the periphery as the ring defined from 0.8*R to the border, where R is the radius of the arena. (vi) Normalized distance to origin: Normalized distance to the center of the arena being 0 = center and 1 = border (walls). (vii) Ratio in front: The proportion of time that a fish has another fish in front. From a focal fish perspective, lower values are associated with higher leadership. (viii) Polarization: measure of how aligned the zebrafish are in terms of their movement direction. When polarization is low individuals are moving in random directions. When polarization is high most individuals in the group are moving in the same or similar directions. Unitless, range 0-1. (ix) Distance to neighbor: distance between the two fish measured in cm.</p><p id="P50">Measures i-vii corresponded to individual fish measures within a pair, while measures viii and ix are pair-specific. For statistical analyses, for the individual measures, we split them by genotype (heterozygous [Het] or homozygous [Del]) and according to the pair in which they were tested (homotypic Het-Het or Del-Del [same, S], heterotypic Het-Del [different, D]). For measures i-vi, a single value for each S pair was collected (the average of the two fish), to avoid double counting of nearly identical measures. For group features, we split them by pair type and compared Het-Het pairs against either Het-Del or Del-Del. For all comparisons two-sided Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests were used to assess statistical significant differences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Considerations regarding statistical analyses</title><p id="P51">Given the complex and diverse structure of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, as well as the associated supplemental figures, we took the following approaches. When a varying number of biological replicates of the same founder were present (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), we performed a permutation-based test to obtain the median of the p-value distribution of bootstrap resampling Wilcoxon tests. When the two founders were tested together (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>), we used ANOVA tests to assess the significance of genotype. Finally, for direct comparisons between the distributions of specific features between WT and Het/Del, we used two-sided Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and boxplots in the associated supplementary figures). Importantly, given the large amount of tests performed in those figures, and given that defining the level to which to apply the multiple testing correction (microexon, feature, figure, etc.) would be to a large extent arbitrary, we opted for reporting the nominal p-value and use this value not as a hard cut-off, but as a way to help identify and highlight potentially meaningful biological effects, along with the effect size of the difference and the consistency across replicates and founders (when available).</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Generation of RNA sequencing and transcriptomic analysis</title><p id="P52">To assess transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression, we generated RNA-seq for WT and Del 5 dpf larvae for all 18 microexon main founder lines, as well as 5 secondary ones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S6</xref>). In addition, we generated two biological replicates of <italic>srrm3</italic> WT and Del 5 dpf larvae. To produce these data, incrosses of heterozygous parents were set for each line, and larvae were genotyped by fin clipping (see above) at 5 dpf. Between 10-12 larvae of either WT or Del were pooled for each line and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74134), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Final RNA concentrations were quantified using a Qubit Fluorometer with the RNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Q32855). PolyA+ stranded libraries for RNA sequencing were generated at the CRG Genomics Unit, and sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq2500 machine to produce an average of 42.5 million 50-nt single end reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S6</xref>). For samples of the regulator mutants, 72.8 million 125-nt paired end reads were generated to allow for alternative splicing analyses. All RNA-seq samples were submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), identifier: GSE278690.</p><p id="P53">RNA-seq data was mapped with STAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dobin, et al. 2013</xref>) to the <italic>Danio rerio</italic> genome version danRer10 (Ensembl v91). Mappings were used for correcting bias due to the heterogeneous patterns of transcript degradation with the Bioconductor package named <italic>DegNorm</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Xiong, et al. 2019</xref>) using the gene annotations from Ensembl v91. Gene read counts were then normalized with the variance stabilizing transformation (VST) from DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Love, et al. 2014</xref>). Additionally, batch variation was removed using the Empirical Bayes-moderate adjustment for unwanted covariates from the R package WGCNA fitting WT samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Figure 6 - figure supplement 1</xref>). Differences between Del and WT samples were obtained from the subtraction of these values from each genotype after all corrections and normalizations. Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) were performed with the R-package <italic>fgsea</italic> using <italic>idep</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ge, et al. 2018</xref>) and <italic>shinyGO</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ge, et al. 2020</xref>) GO annotations. To select globally enriched GO categories across microexon deletion lines, we first sum the absolute differences between Del and WT across all main founders and performed a positive GSEA test. Jaccard distance was then calculated between enriched GOs (adjusted p-value &lt;0.01) and used for a complete hierarchical clustering, and tree cutting at a 0.9 height (&lt;10% shared genes between clustered GOs). Clusters with at least one term with a p-value &lt; 0.001 were filtered and named after the most significant term in it. Additionally, for each individual microexon deletion comparison, a GSEA was estimated for GOs enriched globally and merged cluster categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>, right plot). Finally, we selected various gene sets of interest to investigate their differential expression patterns among microexon deletions using GSEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). These gene sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S7</xref>) were obtained as follows: (i) ASD genes: zebrafish orthologs of SFARI category 1 and 2 genes [April 2020]; (ii) Schizophrenia genes: from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Thyme, et al. 2019</xref>); (iii) Immediate early genes: zebrafish orthologs of genes reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Piwecka, et al. 2017</xref>); (iv) Developmental pathways: from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Marlétaz, et al. 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Table S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS199691-supplement-Table_S1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d11aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Table S2</label><media xlink:href="EMS199691-supplement-Table_S2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d11aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Table S3</label><media xlink:href="EMS199691-supplement-Table_S3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d11aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Table S4</label><media xlink:href="EMS199691-supplement-Table_S4.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d11aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Table S5</label><media xlink:href="EMS199691-supplement-Table_S5.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d11aAcEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Table S6</label><media xlink:href="EMS199691-supplement-Table_S6.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d11aAcEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Table S7</label><media xlink:href="EMS199691-supplement-Table_S7.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d11aAcEhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS199691-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d11aAcEiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S34"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreements No 637591 and No 101002275, both to MI) and the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities through the State Investigation Agency (PID2020-115040GB-I00 / AEI / 10.13039/501100011033 to MI).
