While excessive atherogenic lipids in the arterial intima can trigger endothelial dysfunction in advanced lesions, the response of endothelial cells to ox-LDL in the early stages of atherogenesis remains unclear. Here, we conducted a comprehensive, genome-wide multi-omics characterisation of the cellular response to ox-LDL in primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Our results reveal that the exposure of HAECs to ox-LDL leads to pathogenic changes in metabolism, transcriptome and epigenome, but in the absence of a typical inflammatory endothelial phenotype. An integrative analysis implicates the role of AP-1, NFE-2 and CEBP transcription factors in regulating ox-LDL-induced transcription. We further demonstrate that ox-LDL activates endothelial cell migration through the epigenomic rewiring of transcription factor binding. Notably, these ox-LDL-induced dynamic binding sites are enriched for the genetic risk of coronary artery disease, enabling the discovery of the gene-environment interaction of rs62172376 and ox-LDL at the <italic>CALCRL</italic>/<italic>TFPI</italic> locus.

Endothelial cells (ECs) constitute the first barrier of the arterial vasculature, and are central to the initiation and the progression of atherosclerosis. In health, ECs tightly control vascular tone, prevent blood clotting and maintain redox balance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>; in disease or inflammatory conditions, damage to ECs triggers the recruitment of immune cells to the sub-endothelial space, further exacerbating the inflammatory and necrotic microenvironment within the arterial wall <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Cholesterol-carrying low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles are retained and chemically modified (e.g., notably by oxidation) in the vessel wall at lesion-prone sites during the initiation of atherosclerosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Due to their direct exposure to circulating blood, ECs have long been believed to be the first cell type to experience the pathogenic effects of LDL and its derivatives. Specifically, exposure to oxidised LDL (ox-LDL) has been linked to pro-inflammatory endothelial phenotypes, characterised by increased expression of cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, contrasting results showing no or context-dependent endothelial activation after ox-LDL exposure were also observed using the same models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Most of these early studies on ox-LDL and ECs were conducted using low-throughput approaches, with a narrow focus on specific pathways or functions hypothesised to be relevant. Therefore, these results have often been inconclusive. We reasoned that a comprehensive, unbiased assessment of the endothelial response to ox-LDL in primary human cells is crucial for a more complete understanding of this pathophysiological process underlying atherosclerosis.</p><p id="P6">The development of high-throughput multi-omics sequencing approaches enables unbiased, genome-wide investigation of the endothelial response to atherogenic lipids. One of the bioactive components of ox-LDL, oxidised 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ox-PAPC) has been extensively characterised <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), ox-PAPC has been shown to alter the transcriptome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, epigenome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, and metabolome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. While serving as a convenient synthetic alternative to the plasma-derived ox-LDL, ox-PAPC represents only a fraction of the lipid peroxidation products found in ox-LDL, and its pathogenic similarity with ox-LDL has not been systematically evaluated. Given that oxidised lipids do not act in isolation during atherosclerosis, measuring the overall effect of ox-LDL instead of its bioactive components might better reflect its multifaceted atherogenic properties <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P7">Decades of large-scale, genome-wide association studies have revealed a large heritable component of CAD, with more than 330 risk loci reaching genome-wide significance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. ECs are significantly associated with the genetic risk of CAD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, and a few EC-acting risk variants have been prioritised through fine-mapping studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, it remains poorly understood which other variants regulate which genes in endothelial cells to modulate disease risk. In particular, it is unclear whether any of these risk genes are regulated in response to atherogenic lipids in endothelial cells, or if they encode proteins that could potentially interact with these lipids.</p><p id="P8">In the current study, we employ a genome-wide, multi-omics approach to characterise the response of primary human endothelial cells to ox-LDL. We find only limited overlaps in the metabolic and transcriptomic effect between ox-LDL and ox-PAPC; ox-LDL-induced gene expression better aligns with the <italic>in vivo</italic> gene expression signatures in ECs from human atherosclerotic lesions. Using a combination of computational and experimental approaches, we find that ox-LDL triggers endothelial cell migration through epigenomic rewiring of transcription factor binding. In addition, we show that the endothelial response to ox-LDL is associated with the genetic risk of CAD, and prioritise CAD risk variants that overlap dynamic transcription factor binding sites.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ox-LDL accumulation triggers metabolic shift in HAECs</title><p id="P9">It is well-recognized that endothelial cells play an important role in the transcytosis of lipids from the circulation to the sub-arterial space <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. To test whether exposure to ox-LDL results in intracellular accumulation of lipids, primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were incubated with DiI-labelled ox-LDL and profiled using immunofluorescence microscopy. After 48 hours of DiI-ox-LDL treatment, lipid droplets were clearly visible in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), although the number of these droplets is considerably lower compared to what we have previously reported in primary human macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The dose-dependence of intra-cellular lipid accumulation was further confirmed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">A previous study has reported that oxidised 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ox-PAPC), a synthesised bioactive component of ox-LDL, disrupts amino acid metabolism in endothelial cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. To explore any potential metabolic consequences of ox-LDL exposure, we next measured the cellular respiratory rates and glycolytic rates using Seahorse assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>).</p><p id="P11">While the basal respiration rate remains constant, ox-LDL treatment drastically reduced the spare respiration capacity the cells can utilize when the energy demand is high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). In addition, cells exposed to ox-LDL displayed a significant increase in basal glycolytic rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>); the addition of rotenone and antimycin A, which inhibits electron transport complexes and thereby shuts down mitochondrial respiration, did not further increase the glycolytic rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results contrast with the metabolic activation effect of ox-PAPC reported previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, suggesting that ox-LDL induces metabolic stress and pushes the energy balance toward glycolysis.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Ox-LDL alone does not induce pro-inflammatory endothelial phenotypes</title><p id="P12">Previous studies have shown that ox-LDL induced endothelium dysfunction, an important pro-atherogenic process that is typically characterized by elevated expression of cellular adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, despite its intracellular accumulation and the metabolic consequences, ox-LDL-exposure was not found to affect the transcript nor protein level of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in HAECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A-D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We noticed that in one of the previous reports <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, activation of inflammation was only observed when the lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor 1 (OLR1) was artificially overexpressed in HAECs.

The most upregulated and most downregulated genes are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.

Consistent with our observation in macrophages, ox-LDL treatment triggered the anti-oxidative-stress NFE2 signalling pathway and inhibited intrinsic cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, we found that ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of necrosis associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased atherosclerotic burden <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, was one of the most up-regulated pathways following ox-LDL exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>).

Briefly, the transcriptomic profiles of individual endothelial cells from human carotid plaques or adjacent disease-free vasculatures were analysed and aggregated into pseudo-bulk populations for differential expression tests, and the plaque expression signatures were compared with the ox-LDL expression signatures using a Rank-Rank Hypergeometric Overlap test <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">It is important to note that the plaque endothelial cells were collected from advanced lesions, thus they were exposed to different microenvironments compared to our ox-LDL model. Despite this, we found that 65 out of the 304 differentially expressed genes induced by ox-LDL were also dysregulated in plaque (p = 3.25×10<sup>-16</sup>, Fisher's Exact Test). Specifically, we identified significant overlaps at both ends of the differential expression gene list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). This enrichment, however, was not evident in endothelial cells treated with ox-PAPC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, only limited overlaps were found between genes regulated by ox-LDL and those regulated by ox-PAPC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B-C</xref>). Clearly, our <italic>in vitro</italic> ox-LDL-exposure model provides new information that better characterises the role of endothelial cells in human atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Integrative analysis highlights a shared ox-LDL-response network between endothelial cells and macrophages</title><p id="P19">We next sought to characterise the potential regulators that drive the endothelial response to ox-LDL. To map the potential cis-regulatory elements in HAECs, we performed high-throughput sequencing experiments with Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) targeting the active enhancer marker H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac). Surprisingly, although the chromatin accessibility at transcription start sites positively correlates with the gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>), no region was confidently identified as differentially accessible in the ox-LDL group compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>).</p><p id="P20">We reasoned that gene expression changes in the absence of chromatin accessibility change could result from the re-organisation of transcription factor (TF) binding in pre-existing open chromatin. To investigate the underlying regulators driving the ox-LDL-induced gene expression, we performed in-silico deletion analysis using Lisa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, integrating both the RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In brief, Lisa first transforms open chromatin signals (or enhancer signals) into a gene-wise regulatory potentials score, based on the distance to the gene body and promoters. TF binding events, inferred from ChIP-seq datasets, are then deleted <italic>in silico</italic> from the original open chromatin signals. TFs are identified as potential regulators if their in-silico deletions lead to larger changes in regulatory potentials in the differentially expressed genes, compared to random background genes.</p><p id="P21">Consistent with the pathway enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) and with our previous findings in macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, TFs from the AP-1 and NFE2 family were identified as the top regulators of both ox-LDL-induced genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) and ox-LDL-repressed genes in HAECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also repeated the in-silico deletion analysis with the H3K27ac ChIP-seq data and observed similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Our previous work has linked the transcription factor CEBPB to the cellular response to ox-LDL in human macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. In HAECs, CEBPB displayed the strongest ISD effect on ox-LDL-induced genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), and was estimated to regulate about 20% of these genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>). The mRNA level of CEBPB, however, did not change after ox-LDL exposure in HAECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref>).</p><p id="P23">To determine whether the regulatory effect of CEBPB is shared across different cell types, we next conducted an ox-LDL-specific in-silico deletion analysis. That is, instead of masking all CEBPB binding signals, we limited the in-silico deletion to regions where CEBPB binding was altered in ox-LDL-exposed macrophages, which represent only 8.7% of the total binding sites (8,718 out of 100,602 peaks, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5D</xref>).

These DBSs were located across the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A</xref>), and were enriched for H3K27ac signals compared to average open chromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6B</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Consistent with previous results, AP-1 and NFE-2 family factors were globally activated in ox-LDL-treated endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), with an increase of 8% for AP-1 factor FOS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6C</xref>).

Overall, these results suggest that ox-LDL treatment triggers a moderate change in TF binding within the already accessible chromatin.</p><p id="P27">We next performed a pathway enrichment test in DBSs to explore the biological consequence of the observed change in TF binding. Notably, functional annotations related to endothelial migration were highly enriched in genes near both the ox-LDL-activated and ox-LDL-repressed DBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). To experimentally validate this finding, we further performed cell migration assays, and found that ox-LDL exposure in HAECs significantly increased endothelial cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). This experiment was also repeated with cells pre-treated with ox-LDL, and the effect of ox-LDL priming only lasted a few hours after the start of the assay, with no significant difference after 20 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). This observation echoes previous results where we detected no global alteration in chromatin accessibility, suggesting a fast and direct endothelial response to ox-LDL exposure.</p><p id="P28">Together, our computational and experimental results demonstrate that ox-LDL triggers a rapid activation of endothelial migration, potentially mediated by genome-wide epigenomic changes in transcription factor binding.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Prioritisation of CAD variants using the DBSs in endothelial cells</title><p id="P29">Endothelial cells are one of the most important arterial cell types that are enriched for the disease heritability of CAD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.

In this study, we offer the first comprehensive transcriptomic and epigenomic characterisation of the response to ox-LDL in primary human aortic endothelial cells. Our findings reveal that ox-LDL triggers changes in the transcriptome and cellular metabolism that are non-inflammatory. By integrating multi-omics sequencing data, we are able to identify the TFs that drive the ox-LDL response, which features a transcriptional regulatory network that is largely shared with human macrophages. The redistribution of these TFs also activates endothelial-specific pathways, including migration. Crucially, we demonstrate that changes in TF binding induced by ox-LDL are enriched for CAD heritability, and can be utilised as a leverage point to prioritise causal risk variants involved in the endothelial response to atherogenic lipids.</p><p id="P39">In HAECs, exposure to ox-LDL reduces mitochondrial respiration, thereby shifting the energy balance towards glycolysis. This effect is contradictory to the effect of ox-PAPC, a widely studied synthesised bioactive component of ox-LDL, which has been reported to increase the respiration and metabolic activity in HAECs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, we demonstrated a robust correlation between human atherosclerotic lesions and the effect of ox-LDL, but not for ox-PAPC. Clearly, the proatherogenic effect of ox-LDL is a combination of complex, sometimes opposing influences from individual components. Studying one single element within the ox-LDL mixture, despite the increased biochemical specificity and the ease of preparation, may miss the whole picture and so could lead to misleading conclusions.</p><p id="P40">With a comprehensive genome-wide footprinting analysis, we discovered an activating effect of ox-LDL on endothelial migration. This finding was functionally validated using live-cell microscopy. It is worth noting that contrasting phenotypes have been reported in different endothelial lines at ox-LDL concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 ug/mL <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. In HUVECs, ox-LDL stimulates migration at 5 ug/mL, but inhibits it at 40 ug/mL <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. On a molecular level, the impaired migration capacity was linked to the dephosphorylation of Akt in HUVECs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. However, increased Akt phosphorylation has been reported in HAECs after ox-LDL treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Given that HUVECs are venous cells derived from immune-privileged foetal tissue, they may be less tolerant to the oxidative stress compared to adult arterial endothelium. This could also account for the absence of endothelial activation phenotypes in our <italic>in vitro</italic> model using aortic endothelial cells. Nevertheless, we show that the non-inflammatory response to ox-LDL, which drives the migration phenotype, is significantly enriched for disease heritability. In other words, this supports the ox-LDL-induced <italic>in vitro</italic> migration phenotype being causally involved in the <italic>in vivo</italic> progression of human atherosclerosis.</p><p id="P41">Since many non-coding genetic variants influence disease risks by altering the function of regulatory DNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, profiling the colocalization of regulatory regions with genetic risk variants in LD offers a powerful approach to decipher the causal variants and their target genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. The prioritised risk locus around the <italic>CALCRL</italic> and <italic>TFPI</italic> gene is particularly interesting, as only one of the two coding genes is differentially expressed by ox-LDL exposure. The dynamic binding site containing the risk reference haplotype displayed significant activation after ox-LDL treatment, while the protective haplotype remained unchanged. This change in enhancer activity was not found under basal conditions, which may explain why rs62172376 was missed in previous variant prioritisation studies. In fact, our results illustrate a context-specific regulatory effect at this risk locus, underscoring the necessity to adapt experimental models with disease-relevant stimuli in the functional fine-mapping of GWAS results.</p><p id="P42">Overall, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptional regulation of ox-LDL response in human endothelial cells.
