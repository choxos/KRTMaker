TRAP transporters are composed of a substrate binding protein (SBP) and two unequally sized membrane components that exist as either separate proteins or are fused into a single polypeptide. Almost all TRAP SBPs exist as monomeric globular proteins that bind substrate and present it to the membrane component. Here, we describe the discovery and characterisation of a novel TRAP SBP from the TAXI subfamily with a previously unidentified architecture. BP0403 from the human pathogen <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> is a predicted lipoprotein composed of 3 distinct domains; an α/β globular domain with a unique fold, a long helical domain and a C-terminal TAXI SBP domain. Expression and purification of the full-length protein reveals that it forms a stable dimer. Structural modelling of the dimer interface and molecular weight analysis using size exclusion chromatography of the individual domains reveals that the interdomain helical region is solely responsible for dimerization. Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) and intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence reveal that BP0403 binds L-glutamate with nanomolar affinity. Unexpectedly, analysis of the genome context of BP0403 reveals the complete absence of characteristic genes for TRAP membrane components but co-localisation and translational coupling with <italic>gltS</italic>, encoding a Na<sup>+</sup>/glutamate symporter. In other bacteria, we identified fused BP0403-GltS homologues, strongly suggesting that this constitutes a completely novel SBP-dependent secondary active transporter. Structural comparisons suggest GltS operates by an elevator-type mechanism, like TRAP transporters; the association of an SBP with this class of secondary transporter is an emerging theme.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Substrate binding proteins (SBPs) are obligate components of many solute transporters in prokaryotes, where they deliver solutes to integral membrane transporters, often conferring stringent selectivity, high affinity and directionality to solute uptake. SBPs have been recruited by three main transporter families; the primary-active ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that hydrolyse ATP to power transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, and the secondary-active tripartite tricarboxylate transporter (TTT) and tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter families, both of which harness electrochemical ion-gradients to drive transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">TRAP transporters (TCDB ID: 2.A.56) are the largest and best characterised SBP-dependent secondary active transporter family and contribute to virulence of several human pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. TRAP transporters are composed of an SBP and two unequally sized membrane components that can exist as two separate proteins or fused into a single polypeptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The TRAP family can be further divided into two subfamilies; the DctP-type and the TAXI (<underline>T</underline>RAP <underline>a</underline>ssociated e<underline>x</underline>tracytoplasmic <underline>i</underline>mmunogenic) TRAP transporters; both subfamilies have homologous membrane components, but the SBPs share no amino acid sequence similarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. DctP-type TRAPs were the first discovered and are named after the first TRAP transporter identified, DctPQM from <italic>Rhodobacter capsulatus</italic>, which is C4-dicarboxylate specific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. DctP-type TRAP systems have been extensively characterised, revealing a diverse portfolio of substrates, most commonly aliphatic or aromatic organic acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Recent structural characterisation of fused DctP-type TRAP membrane components reveal that they are monomeric proteins composed of two domains, a scaffold domain and a transport domain, the latter of which houses all substrate binding residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.

Similarly to DASS family members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, liposome reconstitution of DctP-type TRAP systems has revealed that transport is dependent on the presence of a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The TAXI TRAP subfamily is relatively poorly characterised in comparison, with only a handful of substrates known or postulated and only two experimentally determined structures currently published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The TAXI TRAP systems differ in several ways from their DctP-type cousins. Whereas DctP-type TRAP transporters can have either fused or separate membrane components, TAXI systems invariably have a fused membrane protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, and while both DctP-type and TAXI TRAP systems are widespread in bacteria, the TAXI group are the <italic>only</italic> TRAP systems found in archaea. In contrast to the Na<sup>+</sup>-dependence of DctP-type transporters, at least one TAXI TRAP transporter harnesses the proton-motive force to drive transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In addition to these differences, a higher proportion of TAXI SBPs appear to be lipoproteins compared to DctP-type TRAP SBPs, although the significance of this is not clear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Although DctP-type and TAXI SBPs are unrelated at the sequence level their domain architecture and overall structures are similar. They are usually monomeric, 300-350 amino acids long and are invariably solely composed of 2 α/β globular domains and a hinge region, which closes upon interaction with substrate in a “venus flytrap”-like mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. While there are examples of ‘orphan’ TRAP SBPs, the vast majority of the genes encoding them are operonic, with the genes encoding the characteristic TRAP membrane proteins with which they interact. However, in this work we describe the discovery and characterisation of a novel elongated, dimeric TAXI SBP from the human pathogen <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, which has recruited an additional globular domain. We present compelling evidence that this unusual TAXI SBP binds glutamate but is not part of a TRAP transporter; rather, it utilises a member of the unrelated GltS family of Na<sup>+</sup> coupled glutamate symporters for uptake. This conclusion is strengthened by the identification of TAXI-GltS fusion proteins encoded in the genomes of other bacteria. This unprecedented architecture reveals for the first time the existence of a novel, previously uncharacterised type of SBP-dependent transporter.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Molecular Biology</title><p id="P7">Genes encoding full-length BP0403 (BP0403<sub>FL</sub>), BP0403 N-terminal domain (BP0403<sub>NTD</sub>) and BP0403 C-terminal domain (BP0403<sub>SBP</sub>) were codon optimised, synthesised and cloned into pET151 by Invitrogen GeneArt.

DSF analysis of conventional TAXI SBPs consistently produces a single trough, indicative of a single melting event, for example, with the L-glutamate specific TAXI SBP, VcGluP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <italic>inset</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, analysis of BP0403<sub>FL</sub> using DSF revealed an unusual double dip pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggesting the occurrence of two melting events with separable Tms of 43.7°C (Tm<sub>1</sub>) and 53.7°C (Tm<sub>2</sub>), which we reasoned likely reflects the independent melting of the globular SBP and N-terminal domains.</p><p id="P19">To identify the ligand binding specificity of BP0403<sub>FL</sub>, we screened a library of 14 different compounds consisting of a range of organic anions, with similar features to “classical” TRAP ligands, using DSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C and D</xref>). While the majority of the compounds induced no change in the position of either of the melt troughs of BP0403<sub>FL</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), we observed a pronounced rightward shift of only Tm<sub>2</sub> in the presence of L-glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). These data strongly support the conclusion that Tm<sub>2</sub> relates to the SBP domain and identifies L-glutamate as the ligand.</p><p id="P20">To determine which melt trough belonged to which globular domain, we performed DSF on the isolated domains, BP0403<sub>NTD</sub> (residues 20-139) and BP0403<sub>SBP</sub> (residues 208-503).

While neither of the Tms from the isolated domains corresponds exactly with the two Tms obtained from BP0403<sub>FL</sub>, comparison of these data with the double dip DSF data of BP0403<sub>FL</sub> indicates that Tm<sub>1</sub> likely corresponds with the BP0403<sub>NTD</sub>, and Tm<sub>2</sub> is likely the BP0403<sub>SBP</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P21">To confirm that Tm<sub>2</sub> corresponds with the BP0403<sub>SBP</sub>, we performed DSF individually on the BP0403<sub>NTD</sub> and BP0403<sub>SBP</sub> in the presence L-glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). While addition of 1 mM L-glu had essentially no effect on the Tm of BP0403<sub>NTD</sub>, the Tm of the BP0403<sub>SBP</sub> was increased by 4°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig, 3B</xref>), substantially less than the 9.9°C shift seen for BP0403<sub>FL</sub>’s Tm<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). To investigate this further, we performed an L-glutamate titration with BP0403<sub>SBP</sub> using DSF, which revealed the dose-dependent Tm increase expected for ligand binding to an SBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). To support the DSF-based ligand identification, we wished to perform tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy on BP0403<sub>FL</sub>. However, while BP0403<sub>FL</sub> contains 2 tryptophans, they are both located in the NTD, which does not bind ligand according to our DSF data. Specifically monitoring tyrosine fluorescence with BP0403<sub>FL</sub> was not possible due to the tryptophan emission masking any dose dependent fluorescence changes. Therefore, we monitored tyrosine fluorescence changes with the isolated SBP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Addition of 5 μM L-glutamate induced an 11% quench in the protein fluorescence, which was saturable, as there was no further quenching upon addition of 100 μM L-glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).

These data suggest that there is a fundamental difference in the arrangement of the SBP domain when isolated compared to when it is part of the full-length protein, and contrary to our working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), the DSF data do not support a tethered, but a freely mobile SBP.

We further purified each domain using SEC and compared the elution volumes to those of the molecular weight standards used previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C and D</xref>). This analysis revealed single peaks for BP0403<sub>SBP</sub> and BP0403<sub>NTD</sub> that correspond with proteins of 34.5 kDa and 18.9 kDa, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C and D</xref>). These data demonstrate that the isolated domains are monomeric in solution and fully support a model in which the dimer interface is formed via interaction between the helical domains.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>BP0403 is not associated with a TRAP membrane component but with GltS</title><p id="P28">TRAP SBPs must interact with an integral membrane transporter to move substrates across the cytoplasmic membrane. While some TRAP SBP genes are ‘orphans’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, the vast majority are co-localised in an operon with the gene(s) expressing the TRAP membrane component(s). Therefore, to identify the cognate membrane component(s) to accompany BP0403, we analysed the genome context of <italic>BP0403</italic>. To our surprise, there were no genes encoding TRAP membrane proteins in the <italic>BP0403</italic>-containing operon or immediate gene region. Instead, <italic>BP0403</italic> is downstream of <italic>BP0402</italic>, which encodes <italic>gltS</italic>, with the end of <italic>gltS</italic> overlapping with the start of <italic>BP0403</italic> by 3 bp, indicative of translational coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). GltS belongs to the glutamate:Na<sup>+</sup> symporter (ESS) family (TCDB ID: 2.A.27<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>), members of which are widespread in prokaryotes, but are not found in eukaryotes. Further analysis of genome context data using SeedViewer revealed a gene encoding GltS was also adjacent to genes encoding the elongated TAXI SBPs from multiple organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Furthermore, extending our search to include TAXI SBPs of conventional size, we found several operons in which a TAXI SBP gene was directly up- or downstream of a gene encoding GltS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Importantly, this genetic association is found in multiple disparate organisms across the prokaryotic phylogeny, strongly suggesting that the TAXI SBP and GltS are functionally coupled. Low resolution cryo-EM and blue native PAGE of <italic>E. coli</italic> GltS revealed that it is a dimer and functional characterisation showed preferential transport of L-glutamate, with D-glutamate and 2-methyl glutamate transported at much lower affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, strengthening the link with our dimeric L-glutamate-specific TAXI SBP, BP0403.</p><p id="P29">As there are no GltS structures available, we modelled the GltS dimer using Colabfold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, which revealed the presence of features strongly reminiscent of the Na<sup>+</sup>:succinate transporter VcINDY and TRAP transporter membrane components; namely, a scaffold domain and a transport domain characteristic of an elevator type mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, GltS has long been known to share a similar topology with the Na<sup>+</sup>:citrate transporter CitS, a member of the 2-hydroxycarboxylate (2HCT) family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, which operates via an elevator mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Based on the observation that both BP0403 and GltS are dimeric, we hypothesise that, upon binding glutamate, BP0403 presents the substrate to GltS, which uses an elevator mechanism similar to TRAP transporters, VcINDY and CitS to transport the substrate across the membrane.</p><p id="P30">To investigate the possible structural arrangement of the heterotetrameric BP0403:GltS complex, we modelled it using AlphaFold Multimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. The combined pTM+ipTM score of about 0.6 indicates that we can reasonably predict the overall fold and protein/protein interactions of the complex. Interestingly, our BP0403:GltS model suggests that BP0403 undergoes a substantial domain rearrangement upon interaction with GltS compared to when the BP0403 dimer is modelled alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). For each BP0403 protomer in the tetrameric complex, the NTD interacts with the transport domain of one GltS protomer and the SBP domain interacts with <italic>the other</italic> GltS protomer. The second GltS protomer is arranged as a mirror image of the first protomer. The helical domains overlay the scaffold domain where they intertwine to produce a SBP domain swap. In the physiological setting, BP0403 would be attached to a lipid headgroup via an N-terminal cysteine residue, and our tetrameric model positions this cysteine residues precisely where we predict the lipid headgroups would arrange, supporting the feasibility of such an arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). Both SBP domains in our model are positioned above the scaffold:transport domain interface, which is the likely position of the GltS binding site. Therefore, our tetrameric BP0403:GltS model provides a mechanically and structurally feasible way for these proteins to work in concert during transport.</p><p id="P31">While the functional coupling between the TAXI SBPs and GltS needs to be experimentally verified, our hypothesis is substantially strengthened by the existence of several examples of <italic>TAXI</italic>-<italic>gltS</italic> gene fusions in genomes of the bacterial family Lachnospiraceae, which result in an N-terminal TAXI SBP domain fused to a C-terminal GltS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). Presumably in this situation, GltS would still dimerise leading to a system reminiscent of the one we propose for BP0402/03.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P32">In this work, we have described the discovery and characterisation of a novel type of glutamate-binding SBP in the TAXI family with a domain architecture completely distinct from all other TAXI proteins characterised to date. Moreover, it is genetically linked with, and translationally coupled to, the Na<sup>+</sup>:glutamate symporter GltS and not with a conventional TRAP transporter. Our results, combined with the observation that some bacteria possess single protein TAXI-GltS fusions, strongly suggest that this unprecedented arrangement represents an entirely novel type of binding-protein dependent secondary transporter.</p><p id="P33">BP0403 is much larger than conventional TAXI SBPs. We have shown by AlphaFold modelling and biochemical analysis that it is composed of separate and independently folded domains at the N- and C-termini, linked by a central helical domain. The distinctive double trough in the DSF profile of the full-length protein was suggestive of independent melting events of two domains with different Tm values, which we confirmed by analysis of the isolated N- and C-terminal domains. Evidence from both structural alignment of the C-terminal domain with the conventional-sized TAXI SBP VcGluP and its ability to bind substrate, unequivocally identifies this domain as the SBP element of the protein. Our modelling indicates that the helical domain forms the dimerization interface, which is supported by molecular weight analysis of the SBP and NTD in isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). An outstanding question is what function the NTD serves as this domain does not have sequence or structural similarity to any functionally characterised proteins.</p><p id="P34">In contrast to DctP-type SBPs, the substrates bound by TAXI proteins are far less well characterised. The first TAXI SBP structure to be determined had a bound ligand consistent with either glutamate or glutamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, and subsequent characterisation of other TAXI SBPs demonstrate or suggest specificity for L-glutamate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, indicating this dicarboxylic amino-acid is a common ligand in this family. This is in keeping with our identification by DSF of L-glutamate as the ligand for BP0403. Moreover, we observed conservation of the key Y and Q residues in BP0403 that were shown to be crucial for L-glutamate binding in VcGluP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, characterisation of a TAXI-TRAP system from <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> revealed specificity for both 2-oxoglutarate and 2-hydroxyglutarate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, and a system from <italic>Azoarcus</italic> transports orthophthalic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, hinting at a greater diversity of substrates.</p><p id="P35">Most GltS proteins operate as Na<sup>+</sup>:glutamate symporters without the need for interaction with an SBP. BP0402 is the sole member of the ESS family present in <italic>B. pertussis</italic> but we do not yet know if it can operate independently of BP0403. What could be the physiological advantage of the interaction of these proteins? One possibility is that the SBP could bind a different ligand, thus effectively changing the substrate specificity of the membrane transporter. However, as we have shown that BP0403 binds L-glutamate and all characterised GltS systems transport glutamate, we find this unconvincing. A more likely explanation is that recruitment of the TAXI protein confers a higher affinity to the transporter compared with GltS alone. Indeed, our tyrosine fluorescence titrations of the isolated SBP indicate a sub-μM Kd for L-glutamate, whereas the Km of <italic>E. coli</italic> GltS for L-glutamate in membrane vesicles is 13.5-30 μM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P36">A higher affinity transporter would be advantageous in the scavenging of scarce nutrients. In the tissues of mammalian hosts, extracellular L-glutamate concentrations are relatively low as this amino-acid is rapidly transported and metabolised by eukaryotic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. As <italic>B. pertussis</italic> adheres to and grows on cell surfaces, rather than being intracellular, the association of GltS with a TAXI protein to scavenge glutamate could result in a competitive advantage for this pathogen. Glutamate has in fact long been known to be of major importance in the physiology of <italic>B. pertussis</italic>. The bacterium is unable to utilise carbohydrates due to the lack of genes encoding key glycolysis enzymes and a small selection of amino-acids that are degraded to 2-oxoglutarate are the best carbon sources for growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Of these, glutamate enhances growth rate and cell yield the most and is the key component in the standard Stainer-Scholte cultivation medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Glutamate availability is known to modulate expression of many genes in <italic>B. pertussis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, and Glu limitation (as would be experienced in vivo) leads to up-regulation of some key virulence factors, such as the type 3 secretion system (T3SS) as well as enhanced auto-aggregation ability that may be important in adhesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Thus, understanding glutamate transport pathways in <italic>B. pertussis</italic> is key to fully appreciating the relationship between this amino-acid, colonisation and pathogenicity. In this regard, in addition to the TAXI-GltS system identified here, there is evidence that <italic>B. pertussis</italic> possesses several alternative glutamate transporters, including at least one ABC system with an SBP (BP3831) that is regulated by a small RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. The structures of two DctP-type SBPs (BP1887 and BP1891) of uncharacterised TRAP transporters have been determined, both of which bind pyroglutamate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Pyroglutamate (5-oxo-L-proline) can be converted intracellularly to glutamate by pyroglutamase so this may represent an alternative strategy to obtain glutamate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Finally, <italic>B. pertussis</italic> encodes a large number of genes encoding SBPs of the tripartite tricarboxylate transporter (TTT) family; referred to as “Bugs” (<italic>Bordetella</italic> uptake genes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Most of the corresponding SBPs are of unknown function and substrate specificity, but the structure of BugE was obtained with bound glutamate, implying that this might be part of a TTT-type glutamate uptake system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. All of these mechanisms for obtaining glutamate in <italic>B. pertussis</italic> employ SBPs, consistent with high-affinity uptake, although mutant studies will be needed to reveal which are of the greatest physiological relevance.</p><p id="P37">In a diverse range of bacteria, we found genes for both elongated and conventional sized TAXI SBPs closely linked to <italic>gltS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). However, in some bacteria we identified TAXI-GltS gene fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>). Examination of the INTERPRO database reveals that of ~10,000 entries for GltS, only 14 have this TAXI-GltS fusion architecture and the majority of these are found in members of one family, the Lachnospiraceae. These bacteria are poorly characterised members of the gut microbiome but they are firmicutes which therefore (presumably) do not have a conventional periplasm. Thus, the evolution of a TAXI-GltS fusion protein may be rationalised as one solution to ensure tethering of the SBP to the membrane transporter in these bacteria.</p><p id="P38">Prior to this study, the only families of secondary transporters known to operate with a soluble SBP were the TRAP and TT transporters. Why are SBPs not more widely associated with other diverse types of secondary transporters? It is now known that TRAP transporters operate by an elevator type mechanism. TT transporters are structurally very similar and likely operate in an analogous way. Our modelling suggests that GltS has clearly discernible scaffold and transport domains, implying that it too is likely to work as an elevator. This might suggest that some intrinsic feature(s) of the elevator mechanism is required to allow an associated SBP to bind and release its ligand as part of the transport cycle. The identification of further novel classes of SBP dependent secondary transporters will allow this proposal to be tested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS201572-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d104aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>DJK acknowledges the receipt of a Leverhulme Emeritus Fellowship (EM/2024-005) from the Leverhulme Trust, UK.
