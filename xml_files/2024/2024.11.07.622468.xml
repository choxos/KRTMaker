The molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders remain incompletely understood, largely owing to the absence of models faithfully recapitulating the human disease. Here, we developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> human cartilage model using isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines carrying either wild-type or Arg719Cys <italic>COL2A1.</italic> Directed differentiation into chondrocytes yielded cartilage tissues that were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, SDS-PAGE, and RNA-sequencing. Tissues derived from Arg719Cys heterozygotes displayed a deficient matrix, closely reflecting the human disease phenotype. Arg719Cys procollagen-II was excessively post-translationally modified and partially retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to ER distention. Notably, despite introduction of an aberrant cysteine residue—expected to engage redox-sensitive folding and quality control pathways—Arg719Cys procollagen-II was not detectably recognized by the ER proteostasis network. The resulting inability to mount a quality control response, including activation of the unfolded protein response, indicates a failure in cellular surveillance. As a result, malformed procollagen-II both accumulates intracellularly and is secreted, contributing to the deposition of a structurally compromised extracellular matrix that drives disease pathology. The iPSC-derived cartilage model presented here provides a genetically defined and expandable, human-based system for dissecting the mechanisms of failed proteostasis in collagenopathies. These findings shed light on the types of substitutions in procollagen that cells can or cannot recognize, and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting cellular surveillance and collagen quality control pathways in <italic>COL2A1</italic>-related disorders and beyond.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Mutations in the gene encoding procollagen-II (<italic>COL2A1</italic>) cause a variety of disorders affecting joint health and skeletal development, termed type-II collagenopathies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> The vast majority of these diseases are caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the triple-helical region of procollagen-II.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> Mutations leading to Arg→Cys substitutions are a common subtype of collagenopathy-inducing mutations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> A prominent example is the <italic>COL2A1</italic> p.Arg719Cys substitution (exon 33 c.2155C&gt;T; previously Arg519Cys) substitution, which has been identified in several families from at least three distinct founders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> Affected individuals present with mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and precocious generalized osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Currently, there is no cure.

Much work in the field has focused on Gly substitutions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> which disrupt triple-helix folding by eliminating the essential Gly residue at every third position in the triple helix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> A recent report from our group described the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) storage defect created in a human cartilage model by the Gly1170Ser procollagen-II substitution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> In that genotype and system, the ER proteostasis network robustly recognized the slow-folding procollagen that accumulated in the ER, consistent with the need to re-initiate stalled triple-helix folding downstream of the Gly substitution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup></p><p id="P4">While less common than Gly substitutions, Arg→Cys substitutions in the triple-helical domain are among the most common disease-causing mutations in fibrillar collagens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> The mechanism by which Arg→Cys substitutions might cause collagenopathies is unclear, as disruption of triple-helix folding is not an obvious consequence of such a substitution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> One possibility is that the introduction of an aberrant Cys residue, capable of forming covalent bonds with diverse proteins in the oxidative ER environment, stimulates inappropriate disulfide bond formation and/or extensive interactions with the ER’s redox-related proteostasis machinery. Another possibility is that loss of the Arg residue is itself problematic. However, to date, only Arg719Cys is reported to be pathogenic despite substitutions of Arg719 to all of Leu, Gly, His, and Cys being observed at low frequencies within the population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> Further support for the idea that it is not loss of the Arg itself which is problematic is that this portion of the triple-helix is not known to lie in a recognition site for protein partners to interact with collagen-II in the extracellular matrix, as previously assessed by binding assays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">Efforts to uncover the molecular mechanism of disease have been hampered by the need for a relevant disease model of cartilage, the main tissue affected by the Arg719Cys substitution in procollagen-II.

Two related transgenic mouse models of this substitution have been developed, showing that mice homozygous for the human Arg719Cys procollagen-II transgene have disrupted growth plate organization and reduced collagen-II fibril density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> While useful, results from these models must be cautiously interpreted as they involve the expression of a mutated human <italic>COL2A1</italic> gene in a murine background. Overall, there continues to be a need for a model that accurately reflects the genetics of the disease in a relevant human cellular context, both to advance our understanding of the etiology of this collagenopathy and to enable the discovery of potential treatments.</p><p id="P6">Here, enabled by directed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> we introduce a human cartilage model of precocious osteoarthritis with mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and assess the effects of the heterozygous Arg719Cys substitution in procollagen-II.

Further experiments reveal, unexpectedly, that the ER proteostasis network does not differentially engage this disease-causing, redox-active residue-substituted procollagen-II – a failure that then propagates to disease-causing matrix defects. Beyond the mechanistic insights obtained on the types of procollagen mutations capable of evading cellular detection, the scalable human cartilage model introduced here provides a unique and phenotypically robust platform to, for the first time, develop and test therapeutic strategies targeting procollagen folding and secretion in collagenopathies driven by non-Gly substitutions in the collagen triple-helical domain.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Arg719Cys procollagen-II-expressing cells can be differentiated into chondrocytes that robustly deposit cartilage extracellular matrix</title><p id="P7">Using an established protocol,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> we differentiated previously validated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> genetically matched wild-type and Arg719Cys iPSC lines into chondrocytes.

Immunohistochemistry revealed no evident differences in the collagen-II or proteoglycan staining between genotypes. To further evaluate successful differentiation to chondrocytes and more broadly compare possible matrix composition defects, we examined expression of matrisome genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> by RNA-sequencing. Consistent with successful chondrocyte differentiation, cartilage-specific genes including <italic>COL2A1, COL9A1, COL11A1</italic> and <italic>ACAN</italic> were the most highly expressed matrisome transcripts in both lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Matrix genes specific to other tissue types were not substantially expressed, including <italic>COL1A1</italic> – an abundant matrix protein in bone and other tissues – confirming successful differentiation to chondrocytes. Moreover, comparison of gene expression across genotypes revealed only minor changes in matrisome expression associated with the pathologic Arg719Cys procollagen-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Just six matrisome genes were differentially expressed &gt;2-fold, consistent with the matrix composition being largely similar between genotypes. In sum, expression of Arg719Cys substituted procollagen-II prevented neither chondrogenesis nor bulk matrix deposition.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Arg719Cys procollagen-II leads to a deficient cartilage matrix</title><p id="P8">Given its association with disease, we anticipated that the Arg719Cys substitution would cause deposition of a defective collagen-II matrix. Hence, despite its apparently normal appearance when evaluated via low magnification immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), we still sought to examine the integrity of the collagen-II matrix more closely using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Whereas the wild-type matrix was rich in fibrils, we observed that the matrix of heterozygous cells expressing Arg719Cys procollagen-II was deficient by TEM. Representative images of the matrix of both genotypes are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>. In particular, collagen fibrils were notably sparser in the disease variant, indicating that the Arg719Cys substitution leads to deposition of a defective cartilage collagen-II matrix.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Arg719Cys procollagen-II is unexpectedly slow to fold and may accumulate intracellularly</title><p id="P9">Disease-causing Gly→Ser substitutions in procollagen’s triple-helical domain commonly result in slowed triple-helix folding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> a phenomenon typically attributed to disruption of the essential network of Gly-requiring hydrogen bonds that stitch together the three distinctive strands of the triple helix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> Arg→Cys substitutions are not expected to disrupt this network, and so slowed triple-helix folding is not a presumptive outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> Relatedly, Arg→Cys substitutions have been shown to have variable effects on the thermal stability of collagen-II based on their location within the triple helix;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> Arg719Cys in particular was found not to decrease the stability of the triple helix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> Still, given the defective cartilage-like matrix we observed, to evaluate this possibility we employed a gel-based analysis widely used in the field to assess the rate of triple-helix formation in cells. Specifically, as procollagen folds in the ER, its unfolded regions accumulate post-translational modifications, especially hydroxylated lysine residues that are then <italic>O</italic>-glycosylated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> Once the triple-helix forms, modification is halted. Thus, if a mutation slows triple-helix formation, the procollagen accumulates excess <italic>O</italic>-glycans, which are identifiable by a reduction in electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup></p><p id="P10">We extracted collagen from the iPSC-derived cartilage tissue and separated the protein using SDS-PAGE.

Using immunohistochemistry against procollagen-II, we noted that more procollagen-II is retained intracellularly in cells expressing the disease variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). For example, blinded quantification revealed that, on average, 51% of cells expressing Arg719Cys substituted collagen-II contained intracellular procollagen-II, compared to only 34% of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Co-staining with an ER marker revealed that the majority of the intracellular procollagen-II was retained in the ER. Moreover, when examined by TEM, we observed that cells expressing the disease variant generally exhibited dilated ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), further supporting the notion that the slow-folding Arg719Cys procollagen-II accumulates to some extent in the ER. We emphasize that both the intracellular retention and dilated ER phenotypes are relatively mild compared to other pathologic substitutions – including the predicted to be more severe Gly substitutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> Nonetheless, these observations correlate with the relatively mild phenotype of this collagenopathy (normal development and habitus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>) on the spectrum of chondrodysplasias, which, at their most severe, are perinatal lethal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Arg719Cys substituted procollagen-II is not recognized by the ER proteostasis network</title><p id="P12">Biochemically, introduction of a Cys in a domain of procollagen typically devoid of Cys could be very problematic, owing to the ability of the amino acid’s side chain to engage in unwanted disulfide bonds. Notably, the introduction of such an aberrant Cys residue opens additional opportunities for redox-active components of the ER proteostasis network, such as protein disulfide isomerases and other reductases, to engage the slow-folding protein. We therefore anticipated that Arg719Cys procollagen-II would be robustly engaged by the ER’s protein folding and quality control machinery.</p><p id="P13">To test this hypothesis, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to elucidate and compare the interactomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> of wild-type versus Arg719Cys-substituted procollagen-II under oxidizing conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Owing to the lack of immunoprecipitation-quality procollagen-II antibodies to enable this experiment in the more biologically relevant chondronoids, we performed this study using overexpression of epitope-tagged procollagen-II constructs in HT-1080 cells, which other work has shown are capable of properly handling fibrillar collagens, but that do not express meaningful amounts of endogenous interfering fibrillar collagen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup></p><p id="P14">Of the identified high-confidence procollagen-II interacting proteins, we first focused on those capable of engaging in a disulfide bond with the pathologic Cys719, including protein disulfide isomerases and dithiol-disulfide exchange enzymes. None of the six disulfide bonding-capable proteins detected interacted differentially with Arg719Cys procollagen-II compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that it is not covalent interaction with an unwanted partner during procollagen folding in the ER that slows folding and underlies pathology. Even more surprising, across all the &gt;40 high confidence procollagen-II interacting proteins identified, none of the interactors – disulfide-forming or otherwise – significantly differentially engaged Arg719Cys procollagen-II compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Thus, bearing in mind the limits of sensitivity in our analysis (which nonetheless covered the majority of known procollagen interactors), it appears that Arg719Cys procollagen-II is not differentially recognized by the ER proteostasis network (including chaperones, modifying enzymes, and proteins involved in quality control and degradation), at least in HT-1080 cells. Such a failure, in striking contrast to the Gly1170Ser-substituted procollagen-II that is robustly recognized by the ER proteostasis network,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> likely underlies the deposition of a defective matrix and disease.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Consistent with failed recognition by the ER proteostasis network, expression of Arg719Cys-substituted procollagen-II does not induce a global stress response</title><p id="P15">Accumulation of misfolding proteins in the ER is often associated with activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which maintains proteostasis in the secretory pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> On the other hand, the unchanged extent of interaction with BiP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), which controls UPR activation, suggested that such activation might not occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> Failure to mount a beneficial repair response could be damaging.

The relatively mild phenotype observed in this Arg719Cys procollagen-II cartilage model appears to be consistent with the severity of this disease on the chondrodysplasia spectrum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Moreover, the phenotypes described in this first human cartilage model of the disease are consistent with previous reports, including the observation of slow folding and hyper-modification of collagen-II extracted from patient cartilage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> the disruption of fibril formation <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and <italic>in vivo</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and even the delay in early hypertrophy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> Overall, this human iPSC-based cartilage model appears to accurately recapitulate the genetics and phenotypes of Arg719Cys procollagen-II pathology, rendering it a powerful system for mechanistic and therapeutic discovery.</p><p id="P20">While the sparse collagen matrix could be a result of reduced collagen-II secretion, it may also be associated with dysregulated fibril formation. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that homotrimers of Arg719Cys collagen-II do not assemble into fibrils, and their presence in a mixture of wild-type collagen-II alters the self-assembly time and morphology of fibrils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> While heterotrimers of wild-type and Arg719Cys procollagen-II are statistically far more likely than Arg719Cys homotrimers when expressed in disease-relevant cells heterozygote for the mutation, like those used here, the excess post-translational modifications from the slow folding of the triple helix could still contribute to defects in fibril formation and crosslinking. Lower expression of lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2), an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in formation of collagen crosslinks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> in chondrocytes expressing Arg719Cys procollagen-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) further supports the idea of a defect in crosslinking.

The aberrant Cys could engage in unwanted disulfide bonds with procollagen-II itself, via the C-propeptide domain, with Cys719 of another procollagen-II strand, or with a number of disulfide-forming proteins within the ER. Moreover, the Cys residue presents novel opportunities for redox-active components of the ER proteostasis network to recognize the presence of a misbehaving procollagen molecule. Strikingly, despite Arg719Cys procollagen-II’s slow folding and induction of ER dilation, it is not detectably recognized as misbehaving by the ER proteostasis machinery. No component of the procollagen-II interactome engages Arg719Cys procollagen-II more than the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). Instead, the misbehaving procollagen appears to evade cellular quality control entirely. Consistent with this conclusion, Arg719Cys procollagen-II does not elicit any organized cellular stress response, such as the UPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). In future work, it will be interesting to assess whether this behavior is recapitulated across other Arg→Cys substitutions, notably those engendering much more severe pathologies.</p><p id="P22">While we did not observe any robust stress response in our transcriptional analysis, gene set enrichment analysis did reveal modest downregulation of translation-related gene sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Speculatively, this seemingly non-UPR-mediated transcriptional downregulation may reflect an adaptive response to procollagen-II accumulation or ER dilation. That being said, the mechanisms by which this accumulation is detected and transcriptional downregulation of some translation-associated genes is initiated are not clear, as they apparently do not originate with the UPR. Nevertheless, the most substantial signature in our transcriptional data was a delay in maturation and early hypertrophy at day 44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). This observation is consistent with the retardation of skeletal development noted in one of the transgenic mouse models of this disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and may be associated with the mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia phenotype in patients that can be caused by slow skeletal development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Similarly, upregulation of <italic>OGN</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) could be a marker of the arthritic phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup></p><p id="P23">In fact, this experiment suggests that Arg719Cys is, from the perspective of the ER proteostasis network (at least to the sensitivity of our analysis), indistinguishable from wild-type procollagen-II.

A key caveat of the quantitative interactome experiment is that, owing to the requirement for high-quality immunoprecipitation and a lack of suitable collagen-II antibodies, it was conducted by overexpressing epitope-tagged procollagen-II constructs in HT-1080 cells rather than in the more physiologically relevant chondronoids. Perhaps we were unable to detect some key ER proteostasis network factor. Other possible explanations for the reduced Arg719Cys procollagen-II content in patient tissue are post-ER quality control mechanisms recognizing the pathologic strand, and/or degradation mechanisms within the matrix selectively targeting the protein after secretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup></p><p id="P24">Altogether, the novel human chondronoid model paired with an isogenic control reported and characterized here provides a robust and tractable platform for studying this disorder and a basis for modeling related Arg substitutions that drive other collagenopathies. Arg719Cys procollagen-II expression appears to cause an ER storage defect without inducing an associated ER stress response. Most significantly, it seems that the cell’s failure to effectively detect, much less resolve, the underlying protein folding challenge leads to the deposition of a defective collagen-II matrix. That defective matrix ultimately drives pathology. Thus, cellular strategies aiming to enhance detection and/or clearance of the problematic protein provide a novel therapeutic direction to explore.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> By virtue of its scalability, the chondronoid model reported here should prove valuable as a screening platform for interventions that correct or alleviate the disease phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>General Reagents</title><p id="P25">All media and cell culture reagents were obtained from Corning/Cellgro, unless otherwise noted.

Briefly, the dried tryptic peptides were resuspended in 100 mM triethylammmonium bicarbonate (TEAB) and then vortexed. Acetonitrile was added to each of the 10-plex TMT label reagents, and then samples were vortexed and briefly centrifuged. Peptides and labeling reagents were then combined in a 1:2 ratio and incubated for 1 h at rt, after which the reaction was quenched with 5% hydroxylamine for 15 min. Equal amounts of each channel were combined, dried by speed-vacuum, and resuspended in TEAB. Samples were then fractionated with Pierce High pH Reversed-Phase peptide Fractionation Kits (catalog #84868) using standard protocols, then dried and resuspended in 0.2% formic acid for injection on LC-MS/MS. Labeled tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC (Thermo Ultimate 3000) using a Thermo PepMap RSLC C<sub>18</sub> column (2 μm tip, 75 μm × 50 cm, PN# ES903) over a gradient before nano-electrospray injection onto an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo).</p><p id="P43">The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode. The parameters for the full scan MS were: resolution of 120,000 across 375–1600 <italic>m/z</italic> and maximum IT of 25 ms. The full MS scan was followed by MS/MS for as many precursor ions in a three second cycle with a NCE of 32, dynamic exclusion of 30 s and resolution of 45,000. Raw mass spectral data files (.raw) were searched using Sequest HT in Proteome Discoverer (Thermo). Sequest search parameters were: 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions; 0.05 Da for fragment ion mass tolerance; 2 missed cleavages of trypsin; fixed modification were carbamidomethylation of cysteine and TMT modification on the lysines and peptide N-termini; variable modifications were methionine oxidation, methionine loss at the N-terminus of the protein, acetylation of the N-terminus of the protein, methylation of histidine, arginine, and glutamine, hydroxylation of proline, and methionine-loss plus acetylation of the protein N-terminus; total PTM per peptide was set to 8. The false discovery rate was set at 0.01. Data were searched against a human database and a common MS contaminant database made in-house. Human Database: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640">https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640</ext-link>.</p><p id="P44">Raw abundance values were used for quantification. First, abundance of each protein in the negative control was determined as the average abundance of the four no-transfection control conditions. High confidence interactors were identified as any protein whose TMT intensities were highly correlated with those of the bait in wild-type samples,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> as assessed by a Pearson’s correlation g-value &lt; 0.02. For each experimental sample, the abundance of each protein was normalized to the abundance of bait (procollagen-II) to obtain a normalized abundance value. The fold-enrichment was calculated as the ratio of the average of normalized abundance values in the Arg719Cys procollagen-II IP to the average of normalized abundance values in the wild-type procollagen-II IP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> Significance was evaluated using an unpaired homoscedastic student’s <italic>t</italic>-test across the four biological replicates, and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using a two-stage step-up method of Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli with a desired FDR set to 1%.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS199980-supplement-Supplemental_Information.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d5aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Louise Kung, Lisa Sampurno, and Lynn Rowley, and Jinia Lilianty at Murdoch Children’s Research Institute for generously sharing their expertise and technical knowledge in iPSC culture, differentiation, and analysis.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance</title></caption><p>The p.Arg719Cys substitution in <italic>COL2A1</italic> is known to cause dominantly inherited precocious osteoarthritis with mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, but its molecular pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Prior work suggests disrupted fibrillogenesis as the molecular etiology, yet phenotypically relevant human models are lacking. Here, we use human iPSC-derived cartilage to uncover how the Arg719Cys substitution alters procollagen-II folding, modification, trafficking, and matrix deposition. We observe hallmark disease phenotypes, including a sparse collagen-II matrix and distended endoplasmic reticulum (ER), consistent with intracellular accumulation of procollagen-II. Surprisingly, the mutant procollagen-II does not appear to be differentially engaged by the ER proteostasis network, despite the incorporation of an aberrant and apparently non-disulfide bond-forming Cys residue, suggesting a fundamental failure of cellular surveillance. This unrecognized misfolding leads to secretion of defective collagen culminating in matrix dysfunction. These findings establish a mechanistic basis for disease etiology and highlight collagen quality control as a potentially tractable therapeutic target. The iPSC-based model provides a scalable, human-relevant platform for dissecting disease mechanisms and developing therapies for <italic>COL2A1</italic>-related disorders and other collagenopathies.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><bold>(A)</bold> Immunohistochemistry against collagen-II revealed that both the wild-type and heterozygous Arg719Cys procollagen-II matrices were rich in collagen-II.
