However, for <italic>ex vivo</italic> immune cell engineering, the need for either of the two is unclear. Previous reports have suggested that nucleic acids may be efficiently delivered to immune cells <italic>ex vivo,</italic> through a non-endosomal delivery route, but the need for base modification has not been determined. Herein, we demonstrate that when a non-endosomal delivery method is used, unmodified mRNA performs equally well to the commonly used base-modified mRNA, including the <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic> methyl pseudo-uridine modification, in terms of protein expression and inflammatory response in cells. However, if an endosomal delivery route is used, then <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic> methyl pseudo-uridine modification is necessary for high expression and low inflammatory response, as demonstrated by others as well. Overall, we show that non-endosomal mRNA delivery renders nucleoside modifications non-essential, and that unmodified mRNA combined with non-endosomal delivery route may be used for efficient <italic>ex vivo</italic> mRNA-based engineering of immune cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Macrophages</kwd><kwd>Neutrophils</kwd><kwd>Activation</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Base-modification</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA)-based therapeutics have emerged as a potential line of treatment for multiple diseases. While mRNA molecules are known for their instability and high immunogenicity, Kariko et al provided a breakthrough by introducing base modifications, which improved stability and reduced activation of the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Immune cell activation was thought to primarily occur through activation of Toll-Like Receptors (TLR) present in the endosomes of these cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. To reduce the TLR-based activation, among the many possible nucleoside modifications, Ψ (pseudo uridine) in place of uridine resulted in low immunogenicity, better stability and translational capacity of the mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Further improvements demonstrated that <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic> methyl Ψ works better than Ψ in terms of both stability and lower immune response of the resulting mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Hence, this modification has become the most used in mRNA therapeutics.</p><p id="P3">However, the need for extensive base modifications has been questioned more recently. For example, Kauffman et al have reported that if the therapeutic mRNA is encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle, then the unmodified and Ψ modified mRNA show no difference in immunogenicity or expression, <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The lipid nanoparticle was thought to protect the mRNA from both serum degradation and reduce its interaction with endosomal TLRs, hence rendering the need for modification unnecessary. This led us to ask the following question: are base modifications necessary only if the mRNA is delivered through the endosomal route and by extension not required if the delivery is non-endosomal?</p><p id="P4">To address this question, in the present study, we evaluate the immunogenicity and expression levels of unmodified or modified mRNA delivered through the endosomal route and compare them to those delivered <italic>via</italic> the non-endosomal route in immune cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our data show that non-endosomal delivery obviates the need for base modifications in mRNA, as both unmodified and modified mRNA show similar expression levels and minimal activation of immune responses. However, if the delivery is through the endosomal route, then base modification, especially with <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic> methyl Ψ, is necessary for better expression and lower immune response. In summary, this study provides evidence for the need for mRNA modification if the delivery is through the endosomal route, but not for non-endosomal delivery. This has implications for <italic>ex vivo</italic> modification of immune cells through delivery of exogenous mRNA.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P5">The mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7 (RAW), was cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; MP Biomedicals, California) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS-Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Anti-Anti-Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

In both the mouse macrophage and human neutrophil-like cell lines, mRNA expression was higher when the delivery was through the non-endosomal route as compared to the endosomal route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). The presence of <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic> methyl Ψ modification of mRNA did not significantly affect expression if the delivery was non-endosomal, but for the endosomal delivery route, modified mRNA was required for high expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2, S3</xref>). This observation is consistent with earlier studies which show better transfection efficiency rates with nucleofection (non-endosomal delivery)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Importantly, the non-endosomal route of delivery did not result in the increased mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6) in the mouse macrophage cell line when both unmodified and modified mRNA were used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Additionally, neither method was detrimental for the survival of the cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). We also observed a difference in expression levels between the two cell lines, which could be due to different immune cells having different capacities to take up and express foreign mRNA.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Type of base-modification does not dictate mRNA expression and immune cell activation when route of delivery is non-endosomal</title><p id="P21">To confirm the hypothesis that modification was necessary only if the delivery was endosomal, we used four standard base modifications (<italic>N<sup>6</sup></italic>-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytidine (m5C), pseudo uridine (Ψ), <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic> methyl Ψ) of the mRNA and tested the expression levels when these were delivered through endosomal or non-endosomal routes. In the mouse macrophage cell line, we observe that when delivery was non-endosomal, the expression of unmodified mRNA was comparable to that of all modified versions of mRNA (except m6A, which resulted in lower expression), at two different times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). When the delivery was endosomal, Ψ and <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic> methyl Ψ did indeed significantly increase expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>), but the modifications did not play a role when the delivery was non-endosomal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). These data confirm the hypothesis that base-modifications are not necessary when delivering through the non-endosomal route, but N1 methyl Ψ modification is important to obtain high expression when delivering through the endosomal route.</p><p id="P22">Next, to determine how the mode of mRNA delivery and the base-modifications affect the activation of cells, we measured the secretion of two inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Unlike mRNA expression levels, IL-1β protein levels were not detectable and hence the data is not shown. The non-endosomal delivery route resulted in lower TNF-α secretion when compared to the endosomal delivery route when unmodified, m6A modified and <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic> methyl pseudo uridine modified versions of the mRNA were used at both 6 and 24 hours post transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P23">When comparisons were made among only the endosomal delivery route (different modifications) or among only non-endosomal delivery route (different modifications), no significant difference was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S6 and S7</xref>). Surprisingly, at 6 hours, IL-6 secretion was increased in the non-endosomal delivery route as compared to the endosomal, upon the use ofunmodified and pseudo uridine modified mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, N1-methyl pseudo uridine modified mRNA resulted in no significantly detectable secretion of IL-6 at both 6 and 24 hours post-transfection. At 24 hours post non-endosomal delivery, the IL-6 levels in the unmodified mRNA group also dropped and were not different than other modifications apart from the pseudouridine modification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S8 and S9</xref>). These data show that a differential response in TNF-α and IL-6 secretion is observed when using unmodified mRNA and delivering it through the non-endosomal route as compared to the endosomal route. However, the use of <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic>-methyl pseudo uridine modification ensures that secretion of both these inflammatory cytokines remains undetectable.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Primary murine macrophage cells also show higher expression and lower cellular activation upon non-endosomal delivery</title><p id="P24">To validate the effect of non-endosomal delivery on expression and cellular activation, primary mouse macrophages were used.

Consistent with the cell line data, unmodified mRNA shows higher expression when delivered through the non-endosomal compared to the endosomal route, in primary macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic>-methyl Ψ modified mRNA did not have any significant differences in expression when either mode of delivery was used. Importantly, the non-endosomal delivery route resulted in no secretion of the inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6, when either unmodified or modified mRNA was used, however, the endosomal delivery route required modifications to not activate the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Sustained expression following non-endosomal delivery</title><p id="P25">Next, we addressed the question of whether delivery by endosomal and non-endosomal routes would result in sustained expression of mRNA.

To confirm that the observed effects were not due to a specific type of mRNA used for all previous studies (nano-luciferase mRNA), we utilized an mRNA that codes for enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP). The advantage of using this specific mRNA is that following transfection, flow cytometry may be performed to determine expression of mRNA at a single cell level. Unmodified or <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic>-methyl Ψ modified mRNA was transfected in RAW macrophages using the endosomal or non-endosomal routes, and protein expression was monitored using flow cytometry at 6 hours and 24 hours post transfection. This specific mRNA showed poor expression when delivered through the endosomal route. However, protein expression was observed when the non-endosomal delivery route was used, and importantly, the expression levels of both unmodified and modified mRNA were similar when using this route of delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig S3</xref>).</p><p id="P27">As all the previous studies were performed using mRNA that was prepared in our laboratory, we also verified our results of mRNA expression in immune cells when delivery is <italic>via</italic> the non-endosomal route, by using a commercially available mRNA (mRNA coding for Cypridine luciferase). In the studies using the purchased mRNA, we observe that the non-endosomal delivery route can sustain expression of mRNA for the same time duration as endosomal delivery. Additionally, using the <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic>-methyl Ψ modified version of this mRNA, we observed that non-endosomal delivery results in enhanced expression as compared to the endosomal delivery in both the mouse macrophage cell line and primary mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">With the success of COVID mRNA vaccines, there is a surge in interest on mRNA-based therapeutics. In such therapeutics, it is assumed that nucleoside modification, such as the <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic>-methyl Ψ modification, is necessary. However, <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic>-methyl Ψ modified mRNA is not very efficient when delivered directly <italic>in vivo</italic>. To further protect the mRNA from degradation, facilitate their uptake by specific cells in the body, and possibly enable sustained release, thereby enabling efficient <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of mRNA, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been described to be essential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">However, both base-modification and the use of LNPs add to the cost and complexity of developing mRNA-based therapeutics. For instance, LNPs utilize the endosomal pathway for delivery and consequently “endosomal escape” of mRNA at a pharmacologically relevant level, becomes a matter of further optimization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. While the need for both base-modification and LNPs when the mRNA-therapeutic needs to be delivered <italic>in vivo</italic> is unquestioned, it remains unclear if one or both are required for <italic>ex vivo</italic> cell engineering. When mRNA is being delivered to cells <italic>ex vivo</italic>, in culture, LNPs can be avoided through the use of electroporation or nucleofection. Nucleofection can deliver mRNA to different cell types with improved expression and lower toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. It has been observed that nucleofection helps to deliver nucleic acids to primary human T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, human pre-B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> as well as macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> efficiently, suggesting that non-endosomal delivery can facilitate delivery of mRNA to a wide variety of cell types, especially immune cells, which in general are difficult to transfect. The question that remains is when using non-endosomal delivery for <italic>ex vivo</italic> delivery of mRNA, is base modification necessary.</p><p id="P30">To address this question, here we compared the efficacy of expression and immune reactivity of unmodified and base-modified mRNA, delivered either through the endosomal or non-endosomal route. Our data shows that non-endosomal delivery of mRNA can lead to efficient protein expression, irrespective of nucleoside modifications. In the cell lines and primary immune cells that we evaluated, base modification was not necessary for high and sustained protein expression, when using the non-endosomal delivery route. Also, consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, we demonstrated that <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic>-methyl Ψ mRNA modification was necessary for higher expression and lower inflammatory responses in the same immune cells if an endosomal delivery route was used.</p><p id="P31">In their landmark paper in 2005, Kariko et al. demonstrated that base-modified mRNA (that are present in mammalian cells but not in bacteria) have a lowered activation of innate immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. This paper laid the foundation for the use of base-modified mRNA, and using such modified mRNA resulted in better <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of the coded protein. However, this and many other subsequent papers, including Andries et al. who showed that <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic>-methyl Ψ modification was superior for expression and had lower immunogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, have used a variant of liposome formulation or lipid nanoparticles for the delivery of the modified mRNA. Our results are consistent with all these studies, and we show that if mRNA is delivered using lipofectamine (endosomal delivery route), then base modification is necessary for higher expression and lower immunogenicity.</p><p id="P32">However, we demonstrate that such base modifications may be unnecessary if the mRNA is delivered through a non-endosomal route (electroporation) that potentially results in direct cytoplasmic delivery. Direct cytoplasmic delivery may be useful for <italic>ex vivo</italic> cell engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Our data on equally high expression of unmodified mRNA (as compared to modified mRNA) that is delivered through the non-endosomal route suggests the following. First, previous work demonstrating that specific RNA modifications that promote structural stability result in superior translation efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, may have promoted stability of the mRNA in the formulation and might not be necessary if direct cytoplasmic delivery is performed. Second, for <italic>ex vivo</italic> cell engineering, the requirement of new ionizable lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> or molecules that promote endosomal escape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> are likely to be unnecessary.</p><p id="P33">A noteworthy point is that a transient increase in IL-6 secretion by RAW macrophages was observed at early time points post transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3B</xref>) when using the unmodified mRNA, but the same was not observed in primary mouse macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that unmodified (and <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic>-methyl Ψ modifed) mRNA is likely to be non-immunogenic if delivered through a non-endosomal route. Interestingly, the pseudouridine modification (and not other modifications or unmodified version of the mRNA) resulted in an increased IL-6 expression regardless of the delivery route. Others have reported IL-6 secretion when pseudouridine modified mRNA is delivered through the endosomal route<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. When mRNA is delivered directly into the cytoplasm, it is possible that the pseudouridine modification results in higher IL-6 secretion due to an altered interaction with the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors like the Retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, but this remains to be verified.</p></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P34">Our data provides further evidence in support of the claim that when delivering mRNA through an endosomal route, <italic>N<sup>1</sup></italic>-methyl Ψ mRNA modification was better than several other nucleoside modifications in terms of mRNA expression and reducing the severity of inflammatory responses. We also demonstrate that both unmodified and base-modified mRNA result in equally high expression and low to absent inflammatory responses if a non-endosomal delivery route is used for <italic>ex vivo</italic> delivery of mRNA to specific immune cells. Together, our data suggests that non-endosomal delivery of mRNA might be an effective tool for <italic>ex vivo</italic> immune cell engineering, and in such an instance, base-modification will not be necessary.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary</label><media xlink:href="EMS199927-supplement-Supplementary.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work presented here was funded by the Ignite Life Science Foundation, India to RV and SJ.
