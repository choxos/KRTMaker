Yet, the supply of reduced nitrogen from particulate organic matter flux from the surface is insufficient to support the amount of nitrification required to sustain measured DIC fixation rates in the dark ocean. The aim of this study was to quantify the contribution of ammonia oxidizers to DIC fixation in the dark ocean. We used phenylacetylene - a specific inhibitor of the ammonia monooxygenase enzyme - to selectively inhibit ammonia oxidizers during two oceanographic expeditions in the eastern tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean spanning 35º N to 10º S. We show that ammonia oxidizers contribute only a small fraction to dark DIC fixation, accounting for 2 to 22% of the depth-integrated rates in the eastern tropical Pacific. The highest contributions were observed at the depth of the nitrification maximum, where ammonia oxidation could account for up to 50% of dark DIC fixation. Our results help to reconcile the observed discrepancies between nitrogen supply and DIC fixation at depth, and provide a new perspective on global ocean chemolithoautotrophy, revealing that the majority of DIC fixation within the lower euphotic zone and below 200 m depth is not fueled by ammonia oxidation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nitrification</kwd><kwd>DIC fixation</kwd><kwd>ammonia oxidizers</kwd><kwd>chemoautotrophy</kwd><kwd>Pacific Ocean</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Phytoplankton-driven ocean primary production is one of the most important biological processes converting dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) into organic matter, forming the base of the marine food web (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). While most of the DIC fixation in the surface ocean is fueled by light energy, non-photosynthetic DIC fixation (= “dark DIC fixation”) has been proposed to contribute substantially to the biological uptake of DIC in the ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), possibly increasing global ocean primary production estimates by up to 22% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). In surface waters, dark DIC fixation has been primarily associated with the activities of heterotrophic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), which can incorporate DIC into biomass via various carboxylation reactions involved in central metabolic functions such as carbon assimilation, anaplerosis and/or redox-balancing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Below the sunlit surface layer, the downward flux of particulate organic material is considered the main source of organic carbon (C) sustaining the dark ocean’s heterotrophic food web (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). However, current estimates point to a mismatch between organic matter consumption and supply in the dark ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), implying that additional sources of organic C are required to reconcile the C budget in the mesopelagic (defined here as the zone below the base of the euphotic zone) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). DIC fixation can be substantial in the dark ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) and often comparable in magnitude to microbial heterotrophic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). In aphotic waters, DIC fixation has largely been attributed to the activities of chemolithoautotrophic bacteria and archaea that use the energy released from oxidizing reduced compounds to fuel a variety of inorganic carbon fixation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Chemolithoautotrophic production is a source of particulate organic C to deep waters that could contribute substantially to the microbial heterotrophic C demand in the dark ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Additionally, chemolithoautotrophs release some of their recently fixed DIC as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), likely further supporting microbial heterotrophic activities below the euphotic zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). However, the activities of chemolithoautotrophic microbes are typically not well accounted for in mesopelagic C budgets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). An improved understanding of microbial processes in the mesopelagic is essential to better predict C export and sequestration, particularly under future climate change scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Organic matter remineralization releases ammonium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), which is the primary energy source for chemolithoautotrophy in most parts of the global ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Consequently, chemolithoautotrophic nitrification – the microbial oxidation of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) to nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) and further to nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) – is expected to be tightly linked to dark DIC fixation rates below the euphotic zone. However, dark DIC fixation and nitrification are not routinely measured on oceanographic expeditions – particularly not in combination – making it impossible to accurately infer such a relationship. Empirical conversion factors obtained from pure culture studies are often used to estimate dark DIC fixation rates from nitrification rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) and <italic>vice versa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Measurements of DIC fixation in the deep ocean are on average one order of magnitude higher than what could be supported by ammonium supplied by the sinking flux of particulate organic nitrogen (N), based on estimates of global ocean N export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). To address this large discrepancy, multiple hypotheses have been proposed, including 1) unaccounted sources of ammonium to the deep ocean, 2) energy sources other than ammonium support chemolithoautotrophy, and 3) heterotrophic microbes are a major contributor to dark DIC fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). However, direct evidence supporting any of these scenarios is thus far lacking.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we established a methodological framework to specifically inhibit ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in ocean samples and confirmed that the inhibitor phenylacetylene had no measurable effects on other community-level processes. We then quantified the fraction of dark DIC fixation fueled by ammonia oxidation during two oceanographic expeditions in the eastern tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean. Finally, we explored the relationships between rates of dark DIC fixation, nitrification and heterotrophic production. The results of this study help to reconcile the observed discrepancies between N supply and DIC fixation at depth, and advance our understanding of microbial processes in the mesopelagic ocean.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>Environmental context</title><p id="P6">We sampled the eastern tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean at eight stations spanning 35º N to 10º S during two oceanographic sampling campaigns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Sampling stations included regions of varying productivity, from productive coastal waters (Stn 1 and 3), the Equatorial upwelling region (Stn 10), to oligotrophic offshore stations in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP; Stn 6, 12 and 15) and South Pacific (ETSP; Stn 5 and 7). A thick oxygen-deficient zone (ODZ; O<sub>2</sub> ≤ 10 μM) was present at most stations, with the narrowest ODZ of ~50 m found at the equatorial station (Stn 10) (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S1</xref>). We observed pronounced deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) at all offshore stations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and secondary chlorophyll maxima at the two most northern offshore ETNP stations (Stn 6 and 15), reaching as deep as 125 m at Stn 15. Nitrification rates ranged between 0.4 and 64 nM d<sup>-1</sup>, showed typical maxima close to the base of the euphotic zone and sharply declined towards the mesopelagic, except at the most coastal station (Stn 1) where nitrification rates remained comparably high in deeper waters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P7">AOA of the <italic>Nitrosopumilaceae</italic> were the main ammonia oxidizers at all stations and depths, making up 7-23% of the microbial community below the euphotic zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), while bacterial ammonia oxidizers made up ≤ 0.15% of the microbial community throughout the water column. AOA abundances were low in surface waters and sharply increased to ~10<sup>7</sup> cells L<sup>-1</sup> at the base of the euphotic zone, coinciding with high nitrification rates and low to undetectable (&lt;10 nM) ammonium concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Within the mesopelagic, AOA abundances remained relatively constant, except for anoxic depths (&lt;1 μM O<sub>2</sub>) where their abundances declined substantially (<italic>e.g</italic>., Stn 12, 600 m depth). <italic>Candidatus</italic> Nitrosopelagicus (Water Column A Clade, WCA) was the dominant AOA genus in shallow waters, while members of the Water Column B (WCB) Clade dominated below 100 m depth and were often the only ammonia oxidizers in the mesopelagic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), in agreement with previous observations in the oligotrophic ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). <italic>Nitrosopumilus</italic> 16S rRNA gene sequences were detected in shallow waters at Stn 5 and 15, but not within the mesopelagic.

Phenylacetylene has previously been shown to inhibit cultures of terrestrial ammonia oxidizers by irreversibly binding to the ammonia monooxygenase enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), and is more practical for handling on oceanographic expeditions than the well-characterized inhibitor acetylene gas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). We first determined the effective inhibitory concentration of phenylacetylene on nitrification and DIC fixation activities of marine ammonia oxidizer cultures (≥5 μM, <italic>SI Appendix</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S3</xref>). We further evaluated off-target effects of phenylacetylene on other members of the microbial community. Phenylacetylene is known to inhibit other monooxygenase enzymes, including soluble and particulate methane monooxygenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). However, methane monooxygenases are only inhibited at 10 to 100 times higher effective concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) and relative abundances of putative methanotrophs were negligible at our study sites (&lt;0.02%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Data File S1</xref>). Phenylacetylene must be dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) due to its low solubility in water, which could further affect microbial activities; we therefore tested the effect of DMSO separately on community-level process rates at oceanographic stations spanning contrasting productivity regimes and depth layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). When 10 μM phenylacetylene in DMSO was added to whole seawater, nitrification rates were completely inhibited at all tested stations, while NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> oxidation and microbial heterotrophic production rates did not differ from those measured in control incubations without phenylacetylene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a and b</xref>). We further confirmed that the applied DMSO concentration alone had no measurable effect on microbial heterotrophic production and dark DIC fixation rates during the timeframe of our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b and c</xref>). Consequently, phenylacetylene appears to be an effective, specific inhibitor of ammonia oxidation activity in the ocean and can be used to infer the contributions of ammonia oxidizers to dark DIC fixation rates (=”ammonia-fueled dark DIC fixation”).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Total and ammonia-fueled dark DIC fixation rates in the eastern tropical Pacific</title><p id="P9">We measured total dark DIC fixation rates throughout the water column of four stations, spanning the ETNP, ETSP and Equatorial Pacific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Dark DIC fixation rates decreased with depth from the euphotic zone to the upper mesopelagic, with highest rates of ~11 nM d<sup>-1</sup> observed at 65 m (Stn 12) and 70 m (Stn 15) depth in the ETNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Throughout the mesopelagic, dark DIC fixation rates ranged between 0.3-1.8 nM d<sup>-1</sup>, with slightly increased rates in anoxic waters (O<sub>2</sub> &lt;1 μM) at Stn 5 and 12, possibly due to the activities of anaerobic chemolithoautotrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Depth-integrated dark DIC fixation rates ranged between 0.2-0.8 mmol C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, which is considerably lower than in the North Atlantic (1.8 to 3.2 mmol C m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>)). Compared to the eastern tropical Pacific, organic matter export from the euphotic zone is estimated to be higher in the North Atlantic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), leading to higher overall productivity and possibly higher ammonium availability, which could explain these observed differences.</p><p id="P10">We further determined the contribution of ammonia oxidizers to total dark DIC fixation in the epipelagic and upper mesopelagic. When phenylacetylene was added to incubation bottles, dark DIC fixation rates decreased on average by 33% (sd=18%, <italic>n</italic>=11) below the base of the euphotic zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), with the exception of Stn 7, where surprisingly no decrease was observed. Within the euphotic zone, dark DIC fixation rates decreased on average by 18% (sd=12%, <italic>n</italic>=11), suggesting that ammonia oxidizers contribute less to dark DIC fixation within the euphotic zone compared to waters below. Ammonia oxidizers are inhibited by light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>) and euphotic zone nitrification rates are typically low under <italic>in situ</italic> light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). However, AOA were abundant within the lower euphotic zone in our samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), and incubations were performed in the dark, excluding the possibility of acute light inhibition. In deeper waters (&gt;200 m), we only observed a decrease (29%) in dark DIC fixation at the Equator (Stn 10), while deep rates were not affected by phenylacetylene at the other three stations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). We hypothesize that this could possibly be due to the thick ODZ observed at all stations except for the equatorial Stn 10 (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S1</xref>), and the reliance of ammonia oxidation on O<sub>2</sub> availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Dark DIC fixation appeared to be slightly stimulated by phenylacetylene addition at Stn 5 at 300 m depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). We cannot rule out the possibility that DMSO might serve as an alternative electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration after depletion of nitrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). However, stimulation of DIC fixation after phenylacetylene addition was not observed at other stations or depths, and nitrate concentrations remained high (≥30 μM) throughout the mesopelagic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Data File S2</xref>). Alternatively, phenylacetylene could potentially be used as an energy source supporting heterotrophic growth. However, since heterotrophic production was not stimulated by phenylacetylene addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), it is unlikely to be a commonly used substrate for microbes in the dark ocean.</p><p id="P12">Overall, ammonia oxidation could account for only 2 to 22% of the depth-integrated dark DIC fixation rates in the eastern tropical Pacific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). This implies that other microbial metabolisms contribute substantially to the cycling of inorganic carbon in the oceanic water column. Consequently, dark DIC fixation rates cannot be used to infer nitrification rates. In contrast, ammonia-fueled dark DIC fixation rates could be inferred from nitrification rates if suitable conversion factors were available.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>DIC fixation yields of ammonia oxidizers in the ocean</title><p id="P13">We aimed to better constrain DIC fixation yields (moles C fixed per mole of N oxidized) of ammonia oxidizers in the ocean to improve conversion factors for biogeochemical models.

While our tracer additions were relatively low (70-200 nM <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium), we cannot rule out possible stimulation of ammonia oxidation, particularly in samples for which we measured high nitrification rates but did not observe any inhibition by phenylacetylene (i.e., Stn 10, 80 m depth; Stn 12, 80 and 100 m depth). A potential stimulation of ammonia oxidation may lead to lower observed DIC fixation yields when measuring rates from separate incubation bottles, with DIC bottles not receiving corresponding ammonium addition. This may have been the case on cruise AT50-10, where radioactivity safety protocols precluded combined rate measurements of nitrification and DIC fixation. In contrast, on cruise RR2104 <sup>13</sup>C-labeled bicarbonate was used to measure DIC fixation rates in more productive waters, allowing us to combine both measurements within the same incubation bottle. Even when only considering samples from cruise RR2104, the average DIC fixation yields (0.054) were almost identical to those calculated from all data points (0.048). We therefore consider DIC fixation yields of ammonia oxidizers in this study realistic environmental estimates for the eastern tropical and subtropical Pacific, which can be used to inform theoretical models to better constrain the relationship between C and N fluxes in the dark ocean.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Additional metabolisms contributing to dark DIC fixation</title><p id="P15">Ammonia is considered the primary energy source fueling water column chemolithoautotrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), due to the higher molar ratio of N in marine organic matter relative to other potential energy sources such as reduced sulfur (S) and iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Ammonia oxidizers supply nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) to nitrite oxidizers, and the two steps in the nitrification process are typically tightly coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Consequently, the inhibition of ammonia oxidation likely also results in the indirect inhibition of nitrite oxidation in the absence of an alternative NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> source. However, most of our stations were located in regions with pronounced ODZs, suggesting that NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> could also be supplied via nitrate reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). We assessed nitrite oxidation rates at selected depths at four stations (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig. S4</xref>) and used average DIC fixation yields of cultured marine nitrite oxidizers (0.036, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>)) to estimate their potential contributions to dark DIC fixation. We estimate that ammonia and nitrite oxidizers together could account, on average, for 82% (sd=30%, <italic>n</italic>=11) of dark DIC fixation below the euphotic zone, but only 40% (sd=4%, <italic>n</italic>=5) within the deeper portion of the euphotic zone.

Our data confirm that ammonia oxidation is an important process in the epi- and upper mesopelagic, but we show that it contributes a much lower percentage of dark DIC fixation than would be predicted based on the stoichiometry of sinking organic matter flux, amounting to 2-22% of the depth-integrated rates in the eastern tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean. When including high-end estimates of nitrite- and sulfur-fueled chemolithoautotrophy and heterotrophic DIC fixation, in total 58-113% of the depth-integrated dark DIC fixation rates could be explained (<italic>SI Appendix</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S1</xref>). Discrepancies remain particularly within the euphotic zone (≤80 m depth), where contributions of ammonia and nitrite oxidizers to total dark DIC fixation are comparably small, and in deeper waters (≥200 m depth), where the flux of particulate organic matter from the surface is often insufficient to provide the required energy sources to sustain measured dark DIC fixation rates at depth. Constraining the contributions of sulfur oxidizers and heterotrophs will be crucial to reconcile these observed discrepancies.</p><p id="P20">Our results improve our understanding of microbial processes in the dark ocean and give new insights into the main energy sources fueling dark DIC fixation in the ocean. Our findings have broad implications by providing critical conversion factors for biogeochemical models of the mesopelagic carbon budget, which is essential to better predict the impact of future climate scenarios on the biological sequestration of carbon in the ocean.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cruise track and dissolved nutrient analyses</title><p id="P21">Water samples were collected during two oceanographic cruises in the eastern tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean aboard the R/V <italic>Roger Revelle</italic> (cruise RR2104: June 15<sup>th</sup> – June 29<sup>th</sup> 2021) and the R/V <italic>Atlantis</italic> (CliOMZ, cruise AT50-10: May 2<sup>nd</sup> - June 9<sup>th</sup> 2023) at a total of eight stations spanning 35º N to 10ºS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).

Despite this importance, deciphering the contributions of different microbial metabolic processes to the oceanic carbon budget remains challenging. Particularly in the dark ocean, large discrepancies between organic matter fluxes and measured microbial metabolic rates are observed. We show that abundant chemoautotrophs – ammonia-oxidizing microbes – contribute only a small fraction to dark carbon fixation in the Pacific Ocean, challenging the current view that carbon fixation in the dark ocean is primarily sustained by nitrification. This work advances our understanding of microbial carbon processing, and offers new insights into the long-standing question of the main energy sources fueling carbon fixation in the dark ocean.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Cruise tracks and environmental context.</title><p><bold>a)</bold> Station map of cruises RR2104 (green) and AT50-10 (orange). <bold>b)</bold> Nitrification rates, chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> fluorescence (FL), ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) concentrations at eight stations during cruises AT50-10 and RR2104.

Note that the scales on the x-axis are different between different stations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS200179-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Relationships between dark DIC fixation, nitrification and heterotrophic production rates.</title><p><bold>a)</bold> Correlation between nitrification rates and the fraction of dark DIC fixation inhibited by phenylacetylene (=”ammonia-fueled dark DIC fixation”). NH<sub>3</sub>-fueled dark DIC fixation rates were calculated from subtracting triplicate phenylacetylene-inhibited measurements from triplicate non-inhibited measurements, error bars show the propagated error. <bold>b)</bold> Correlation between heterotrophic production and total dark DIC fixation rates. Error bars show the standard deviation of triplicate measurements. One data point (Stn 5, 200 m depth) was excluded from the plot due to unrealistically high heterotrophic production rates, possibly resulting from contamination or human error. Sample depth is color-coded with darker colors reflecting deeper depths. The two different cruises are differentiated by symbols (circle = AT50-10, triangle = RR2104). Heterotrophic production was only measured during cruise AT50-10.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS200179-f005"/></fig></floats-group></article>
