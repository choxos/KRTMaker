However, uncoupling whether divisions orient in direct response to force or indirectly via interphase cell shape remains challenging. By applying an external stretch to epithelial tissue and monitoring mitotic spindle dynamics, we show that the spindle orientation protein, NuMA, is recruited to the cell cortex earlier during mitosis in stretched tissue. This stretch-induced recruitment of NuMA coincides with the onset and subsequent amplification of dynamic spindle oscillations. We show by mathematical modelling that increased spindle oscillation indicates increased cortical force generation to orient the spindle. Additionally, we show that knockdown of NuMA reduces spindle oscillations and disrupts division orientation according to stretch and cell shape. Our results indicate that a mechanosensitive re-localisation of NuMA provides a direct response to mechanical force, fine-tuning spindle dynamics and orientation during mitosis and ensuring the accurate alignment of divisions with cell shape and anisotropic tension.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mechanical force</kwd><kwd>cell division orientation</kwd><kwd>NuMA</kwd><kwd>mitotic spindle</kwd><kwd>oscillation</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Oriented cell division, dictated by the dynamic positioning of the mitotic spindle, is a key process that contributes to embryonic development. Oriented divisions are important not only for individual cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cayouette and Raff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Segalen and Bellaiche, 2009</xref>) but also for tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Baena-Lopez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Concha and Adams, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Quesada-Hernandez et al., 2010</xref>) and tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Campinho et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, a failure to achieve the correct division alignment leads to abnormalities in morphogenesis and organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Baena-Lopez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Quesada-Hernandez et al., 2010</xref>) and is linked to cancer development in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Nakajima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Quyn et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P3">To produce an oriented division, the mitotic spindle is positioned in the cell via dynamic interactions between the spindle’s astral microtubules and core spindle orientation machinery localised at the cell cortex. This machinery canonically consists of a highly conserved ternary complex of Gαi-LGN-NuMA (LGN: Leucine-Glycine-Asparagine-enriched protein; NuMA: nuclear mitotic apparatus protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Du and Macara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lechler and Fuchs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Williams et al., 2011</xref>) which recruits and anchors dynein at the cortex providing a pulling force to position the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kotak et al., 2012</xref>). The placement of these “cortical force generators” therefore determines the orientation of the spindle and the ultimate division plane. Moreover, cortical force generation also leads to dynamic movements of the mitotic spindle and notably the existence of stereotypical oscillations of the metaphase spindle that coincide with achieving the final division alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Grill and Hyman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Grill et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hargreaves et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Larson and Bement, 2017</xref>). Mathematical modelling shows that changes to the oscillations of the mitotic spindle can be used as a read out of the factors influencing spindle positioning, such as the density of cortical force generators pulling the spindle into position, or the relative restoring forces generated by growing microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Grill et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hargreaves et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Overlaying the cell-intrinsic spindle orientation machinery is the external environment of the cell, and division orientation has been shown to be highly sensitive to external mechanical force. For example, when tissues are stretched, most divisions orient along the axis of greatest tensile stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Campinho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hart et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Nestor-Bergmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Wyatt et al., 2015</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism for how forces are sensed to orient divisions remains largely uncharacterised. Forces can be sensed either directly or indirectly – via cell shape changes – to orient divisions. A default mechanism of division orientation, seen in many cell types, is the alignment of the mitotic spindle along the long axis of cell shape, as dictated by Hertwig’s rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hertwig, 1884</xref>). Since stretch elongates cell shape along the axis of stretch, many studies have reported a cell-shape sensing mechanism for mechanosensitive division orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Godard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lam et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Minc et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Nestor-Bergmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Tang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Thery et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Wyatt et al., 2015</xref>). However, a growing body of work has also shown that force can be sensed independently of cell shape to orient divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Finegan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fink et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hart et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kelkar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Lisica et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Scarpa et al., 2018</xref>). A generalised mechanism therefore seems unlikely to capture the robustness of mechanosensitive division orientation. Indeed, a recent study has indicated that both force and cell-shape sensing can act in parallel within the same tissue to position the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P5">For cell-shape sensing, it is thought that cells align divisions to their interphase shape rather than mitotic shape because most cells lose shape anisotropy when they round-up upon mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Kunda et al., 2008</xref>). In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal notum, the memory of interphase shape is retained during mitosis by the core spindle orientation protein, Mushroom body defect (Mud), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of NuMA. In this tissue, Mud localises to the tricellular junctions (TCJs), and this localisation pattern is maintained during mitotic rounding providing a blueprint of interphase shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bosveld et al., 2016</xref>). However, Mud is not enriched at the TCJs in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Camuglia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Finegan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Scarpa et al., 2018</xref>), raising the question of how divisions are oriented in these tissues. Additionally, Mud has key differences with its vertebrate homologue, NuMA. While Mud is localised to the cortex throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bowman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Izumi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Siller et al., 2006</xref>), NuMA has a more dynamic spatiotemporal localisation and is localised to the nucleus during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kiyomitsu and Boerner, 2021</xref>). Therefore, whether Mud-like mechanisms of shape-mediated spindle orientation translate to NuMA in vertebrates is an open question. We have previously shown that LGN, the binding partner of NuMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Du and Macara, 2004</xref>), is concentrated at the tricellular vertices (TCVs; the meeting point of 3 or more cells) throughout mitosis in the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> animal cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Nestor-Bergmann et al., 2019</xref>). This TCV localisation of LGN corresponds with the ability of divisions to align with cell shape in this tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Nestor-Bergmann et al., 2019</xref>). However, whether NuMA localises, similarly to LGN, at the TCVs to orient divisions with cell shape remains unexplored.</p><p id="P6">Since the mitotic spindle is highly dynamic, a strong possibility is that, following the initial placement along the interphase shape axis, the spindle is reoriented via external cues, such as mechanical force. Indeed, recent studies have reported that the spindle may be dynamically repositioned during metaphase, independent of interphase shape although the mechanism controlling such repositioning remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Blanchard et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fink et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Scarpa et al., 2018</xref>). When considering a mechanism that ties spindle orientation with cell shape and external mechanical forces, NuMA emerges as a strong candidate. Indeed, previous studies on fixed keratinocytes have indicated that NuMA could be important for stretch-oriented divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Seldin et al., 2013</xref>). However, the dynamic role of NuMA in stretch and cell shape-oriented divisions remains uncharacterised especially in the context of complex living tissues.</p><p id="P7">Here, we investigate the role of NuMA in mechanosensitive spindle orientation using a combination of tissue mechanics, mathematical modelling, and live tissue imaging. We use the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryonic animal cap, a multilayered vertebrate epithelial tissue that maintains its tissue architecture <italic>ex vivo</italic> and is amenable to mechanical manipulation and imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Goddard et al., 2020</xref>). We discover that the cortical localisation of NuMA is sensitive to uniaxial stretch with earlier recruitment to the polar cortex during mitosis in stretched tissues. This temporal cortical recruitment is found to coincide with the onset and subsequent amplification of spindle oscillations, which we show by mathematical modelling to indicate an increase in cortical force generation. Crucially, knockdown of NuMA leads to reduced spindle oscillation and reduced accuracy of division alignment with both anisotropic tension and cell shape. Overall, we demonstrate that NuMA specifically links anisotropic tension with division orientation by fine-tuning the dynamics and position of the spindle during mitosis, thus ensuring an accurate alignment of division with cell shape and anisotropic tension.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cortical localisation of NuMA is dynamic and cell cycle dependent</title><p id="P8">To understand whether NuMA plays a role in mechanosensitive division orientation, we focussed on cortical NuMA since it is the NuMA-dynein complex at the cortex which exerts the pulling forces on astral microtubules to orient the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kotak et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies have reported that the localisation of NuMA varies throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kotak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Seldin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, we were able to visualise this dynamic spatiotemporal localisation by live-imaging GFP-tagged NuMA in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap, and looking at cell divisions in the superficial layer of this tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Video 1</xref>). During interphase, NuMA accumulates in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Video 2</xref>). However, when the nuclear envelope breaks down at the onset of mitosis, NuMA is released from the nucleus and localises to the spindle poles and weakly at the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Video 2</xref>). The cortical localisation of NuMA becomes more prominent as the cell progresses through mitosis, reaching a peak during anaphase at the cortex closest to the spindle poles. Following anaphase, NuMA is recruited away from the cortex and relocalises to the nuclei of the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Video 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>NuMA is not enriched at the tricellular vertices</title><p id="P9">To quantify the dynamics of GFP-NuMA localisation, we measured the fluorescence of GFP-NuMA at the cortex of each dividing cell at different stages of mitosis. Previously, it was shown that Mud (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of NuMA) localises to TCJs in the pupal notum tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bosveld et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether, in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap, NuMA localises similarly to the tricellular vertices (TCVs), where three or more cells meet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, we investigated whether this NuMA localisation was sensitive to mechanical force by measuring GFP fluorescence in both unstretched tissues and in tissues under a uniaxial stretch, applied using an approach described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Goddard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Nestor-Bergmann et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, our data revealed that, in contrast to Mud, NuMA is not significantly enriched at the TCVs relative to the cell edges in either uniaxially stretched or unstretched tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>; non-normalised data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A, B</xref>). In fact, we find that NuMA localisation is significantly reduced at the TCVs compared to the cell edges. Additionally, there was no difference in this localisation pattern between stretched and unstretched tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>; non-normalised data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A, B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cortical localisation of NuMA is sensitive to tissue stretch</title><p id="P10">In addition to the TCVs, we measured GFP-NuMA fluorescence at two other regions of the cortex - the polar cortex (closest to the poles) and the equatorial cortex (closest to the metaphase plate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We chose these regions to measure as, by eye, we could observe an enhanced cortical localisation of GFP-NuMA at the polar cortex during anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Video 2</xref>). Our quantification indeed revealed that, in unstretched tissues, GFP-NuMA was significantly enriched at the polar cortical regions at early anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>; non-normalised data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Moreover, when a stretch was applied to the tissue, this preferential enrichment of GFP-NuMA at the polar cortex occurred earlier, at late metaphase, and was maintained throughout early anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>; non-normalised data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>). To prevent selection bias, we used two different ROIs (polygon and oval) to measure the fluorescence of cortical NuMA. Importantly, the cortical localisation trend of NuMA observed between unstretched and stretched tissues was similar irrespective of the type of ROI used for fluorescence measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E, G, H</xref>). Additionally, we did not observe any change to the total fluorescence of GFP-NuMA at the cortex between stretched and unstretched tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E, F</xref>). This suggests that rather than an increase in overall cortical NuMA, there is a redistribution of cortical NuMA between the equatorial and polar cortex in the presence of tissue stretch. Together, these data demonstrate that rather than being enriched at the TCVs, NuMA is localised preferentially to the polar cortex. Uniaxial stretch, in turn, facilitates an earlier recruitment of NuMA at the polar cortex during mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Spindle oscillations are amplified by mitotic progression and by stretch</title><p id="P11">NuMA is known to function at the cell cortex as part of a complex with dynein which generates pulling forces on astral microtubules to position the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Okumura et al., 2018</xref>). Mathematical modelling by our group and others has shown that the combination of the attachment and detachment of these “cortical force generators” and the antagonistic centring forces of spindle microtubules results in dynamic movements of the spindle pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Grill et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hargreaves et al., 2024</xref>). By examining these dynamic spindle movements, we aimed to determine whether the temporal recruitment of NuMA to the cell cortex aligns with observed spindle movements, thereby implicating NuMA’s cortical localisation as a leading factor in spindle positioning under tension.</p><p id="P12">Coordinated dynamic movements of both spindle poles can result in rotational movements of the mitotic spindle. These movements can be split into two categories: overall spindle rotation from metaphase onset until the end of anaphase; and the finer movements which overlay the larger-scale movement. These finer movements may be oscillatory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Video 3</xref>) or non-oscillatory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Video 4</xref>). Both rotational movements have been observed in the animal cap at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hargreaves et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Larson and Bement, 2017</xref>). Crucially, mathematical modelling of spindle pole dynamics has shown that the oscillatory movement of the spindle is dependent on the number of cortical force generators (<italic>N</italic>) at the cortex, with small increases in <italic>N</italic> promoting a switch between non-oscillatory and oscillatory movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Grill et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hargreaves et al., 2024</xref>). Stochastic binding and unbinding of force generators promotes the onset of noise-induced oscillations outside of the stability boundary (purple shaded region to the left of the stability line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), making oscillations viable at smaller values of <italic>N</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hargreaves et al., 2024</xref>). The same model can be used to predict the relationship between oscillation amplitude and <italic>N</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), which is also extended at the stability boundary by the presence of noise. For a constant binding rate between cortical force generators and microtubules, a positive relationship between <italic>N</italic> and the amplitude of oscillation is predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hargreaves et al., 2024</xref>). The period of oscillation around the stability boundary is also shown to vary with <italic>N</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Our observation that NuMA is recruited to the polar cortex earlier in stretched tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E, F</xref>), would be predicted to correspond to an increase in <italic>N</italic> earlier in metaphase. We sought to determine if any related changes in spindle movement could be identified that might indicate a change in cortical force generation when the tissue is stretched.</p><p id="P13">To track spindle movements, we used the position and orientation of the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), which we found to be an accurate proxy for spindle movement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-F</xref>). The angle of the metaphase plate was shown to lie perpendicular to the angle of the metaphase spindle (89.7 ± 0.3º, mean ± SEM; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E</xref>) with highly correlated inter-frame angle displacements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D, F</xref>). We measured the rotational movement of mitotic spindles from metaphase onset until anaphase by following the metaphase plate angle in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2G, H, J</xref>). As expected, we typically observed an overall spindle rotation or trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> blue line), superimposed with finer movements. To determine how spindle dynamics change over the course of mitosis, we compared movements between early metaphase (defined as the first half of metaphase) and late metaphase (the second half of metaphase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). We first analysed the spindle trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> blue line) to determine whether the overall spindle rotation towards the ultimate division axis was impacted by the application of stretch. By calculating the root mean square (RMS) of the angular displacement between sequential timepoints, we saw biphasic behaviour whereby the spindle moves most in early metaphase, followed by a reduction in overall rotation in late metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Notably, this spindle rotation trend was unaffected by the application of stretch. This suggests that the application of stretch does not affect the overall rotation of the spindle toward its final orientation.</p><p id="P14">We next focussed on the smaller movements overlaying the overall rotation by removing the trend line from the spindle angle measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>). Spindles were determined to be oscillatory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Video 3</xref>) or non-oscillatory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Video 4</xref>) using an autocorrelation function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2I, K</xref>). The presence of significant peaks in correlated movements at increasing time-lags was used as an indicator for spindle oscillations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2I, K</xref>). In unstretched tissues we observed an increase in the percentage of spindles undergoing oscillatory movements as mitosis progresses, with significantly more spindles undergoing oscillatory movements in late compared to early metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). Moreover, in stretched tissues we saw a significantly larger fraction of spindles undergoing oscillatory movements in both early and late metaphase compared to unstretched tissues. Notably, in stretched tissues, the percentage of oscillatory spindles in early metaphase was very similar to that seen in unstretched tissues in late metaphase (64 ± 4% and 54 ± 5%, respectively, mean ± SEM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>), indicating that the increase in oscillatory spindles normally seen as mitosis progresses is accelerated by stretch.</p><p id="P15">To further investigate the dynamics of spindle oscillations, we defined an oscillation range by taking the upper and lower bounds of the signal, omitting outliers. The range spanned by the remaining signal provides a measure related to the oscillation amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>, oscillation range indicator). As mathematical modelling suggests that increasing <italic>N</italic> would result in an increase in the amplitude of a spindle pole oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), we utilised this measurement as an indicator of whether changes in the spindle movements could be a result of the temporal accumulation of NuMA. We observed that the oscillation range (amplitude) significantly increased between early and late metaphase in both stretched and unstretched tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>). Moreover, the oscillation range was observed to be significantly increased in stretched tissues compared to unstretched tissues in both early and late metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>). In addition, just as we saw with the percentage of oscillatory spindles, the oscillation range seen in stretched tissues at early metaphase was very similar to the range seen in late metaphase in unstretched tissues (24.8 ± 0.8º and 23.7 ± 0.7º, respectively (mean ± SEM); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The mathematical model highlights that the period of oscillation around the neutral curve has a non-linear relationship with <italic>N</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).

In early metaphase we observed no significant difference in period between stretched and unstretched conditions. This general trend is congruent with increasing <italic>N</italic> leading to an increased period of oscillation (upper branch of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). We highlight that the measurement of the period of oscillation is sensitive to noise, and less accurate for shorter time series. As the time series length was limited by the length of metaphase, we use the oscillation range as a more comparable and measurable change to the spindle oscillations.</p><p id="P17">Overall, our analysis of spindle rotational movement indicates that stretching accelerates and accentuates the changes in spindle oscillations normally seen as mitosis progresses. This acceleration in the oscillatory dynamics of spindles in stretched tissues mirrors the earlier recruitment of NuMA to the polar cortex that we see following stretch and indicates that the cortical forces acting on the spindle increase when the tissue is stretched.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Knockdown of NuMA affects embryonic development and spindle bipolarity</title><p id="P18">We next sought to functionally test the role of NuMA in mechanosensitive spindle orientation, by knocking down the expression of endogenous NuMA in early <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos.

The finessing of division alignment with cell shape that we observe in stretched control tissues was measured at the end of metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>).

In this work, we identify NuMA as a key link between external forces and spindle orientation. We show that NuMA has a mechanosensitive cortical localisation, with earlier mitotic recruitment to the polar cortex in tissues under uniaxial stretch. This early recruitment is shown to have a direct impact on spindle dynamics, increasing mitotic spindle oscillation and, therefore, increasing cortical force generation to position the spindle. Knockdown of NuMA reduces spindle oscillation in stretched tissues and reduces the accuracy of spindle alignment with a global axis of tension and with local cell shape. We therefore suggest that NuMA provides a critical link between anisotropic tension and the spindle to precisely orient cell divisions.</p><p id="P38">A significant proportion of our knowledge of spindle orientation mechanisms stems from fundamental studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bosveld et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bowman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Izumi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Siller et al., 2006</xref>). For example, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of NuMA, Mud, localises at TCJs to mediate spindle alignment with interphase cell shape in the pupal notum tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bosveld et al., 2016</xref>). We show that, unlike Mud, NuMA is not enriched at the TCJs in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap but is rather distributed around the cell edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Our previous work has suggested that LGN localisation may be more akin to Mud in vertebrate tissue, being enriched at cell vertices and important for shape-dependent spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Nestor-Bergmann et al., 2019</xref>). The differing localisation patterns of LGN and NuMA suggest, as has been shown in other systems, that NuMA may be targeted to the cortex independently of LGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bosveld et al., 2016</xref>). We speculate that the differential localisation of NuMA and LGN may be indicative of a layering of distinct mechanisms to efficiently orient the spindle with anisotropic tension: shape-mediated alignment by LGN and force-mediated alignment by NuMA. This layering of mechanisms provides robust and accurate division orientation.</p><p id="P39">We propose that the earlier recruitment of NuMA to the polar cortex seen when we stretch the tissue provides a mechanism to directly finesse spindle alignment with external force. Indeed, when NuMA levels are depleted, we observe a misalignment of divisions with the global axis of stretch, similar to the misalignment seen in a previous study on fixed keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Seldin et al., 2013</xref>). Crucially, this earlier recruitment of NuMA in stretched tissues coincides with spindles becoming more dynamic and undergoing an increase in oscillatory movement. Mathematical modelling has shown that increases in oscillatory movement reflect an increase in the number of cortical force generators (<italic>N)</italic> pulling on the astral microtubules to position the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Grill et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hargreaves et al., 2024</xref>). When a tissue is stretched, we see an earlier recruitment of NuMA and a concomitant increase in spindle oscillation, indicating increased cortical force generation to facilitate more accurate spindle positioning. Significantly, what we see in stretched tissue is an acceleration of what usually occurs in unstretched tissue: NuMA levels at the polar cortex increase as mitosis progresses to reach a maximum in anaphase, with a corresponding increase in spindle oscillation and, therefore, cortical force generation. This progressive focusing of NuMA localisation helps hone spindle position and also allows continual adjustment to the external environment. Indeed, building on previous work in single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fink et al., 2011</xref>), we show that spindle alignment with cell shape is not strictly determined at the onset of mitosis, but rather finessed by external force during metaphase, with a direct role for NuMA in this process.</p><p id="P40">Significantly, our results indicate that NuMA links spindle orientation directly to force, rather than indirectly via force-induced changes in cell shape. Since cell shape will reflect local forces within the heterogeneous epithelial layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Nestor-Bergmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Nestor-Bergmann et al., 2019</xref>), separating mechanisms reliant on cell shape from those involving direct force-sensing is challenging. To overcome this issue, we filtered cells according to cell shape and compared cells that were the same shape in unstretched and stretched tissue. We chose to concentrate on the most elongated cells as the shape of these cells can be most accurately measured. Crucially, we saw spindle alignment with cell shape improve when tissue is stretched, even in equivalently shaped cells, and we saw a loss of this stretch-induced improvement when NuMA was knocked down. Seeing this tension-dependent effect in elongated cells is interesting as, in other tissue models, the extent of cell elongation often overrides any direct force-sensing mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Campinho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Godard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Mao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Scarpa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Tang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Wyatt et al., 2015</xref>). Our data shares interesting parallels with findings from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal notum where cells in the midline, despite being the most elongated, are less efficient at orienting divisions with cell shape under low tissue tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lam et al., 2020</xref>). In these elongated cells, fewer spindles undergo Mud-dependent rotations toward the long axis compared to cells outside the midline under higher tissue tension. Additionally, upon increasing tension within the midline, the elongated cells become more efficient at orienting divisions with shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lam et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P41">An important remaining question is what facilitates NuMA’s earlier recruitment to the polar cortex in stretched tissues? Our findings of a mechanosensitive localisation of NuMA are reinforced by studies where cells on adhesive micropatterns localise NuMA to cortical regions that are in direct contact with the micropattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Machicoane et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, cortical distance-sensing mechanisms such as exclusion of NuMA from the equatorial cortex by a Ran-GTP gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>) and from the polar cortex by polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Sana et al., 2018</xref>) could be at play here. Interestingly, NuMA can be localised to the cortex dependent on its state of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gallini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Kotak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Matsumura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>) and interactions with actin-binding proteins may further facilitate NuMA/LGN localisation to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Carminati et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Machicoane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, NuMA also contains a large coiled-coil region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Compton et al., 1992</xref>) and, in other proteins, coiled-coils have been shown to be mechanosensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Craven et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Premchandar et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is interesting to speculate whether NuMA’s phosphorylation state, interaction with actin-binding proteins and/or coiled-coil domain have a role in localising NuMA earlier to the polar cortex in stretched tissues and these will provide important avenues for future study.</p><p id="P42">In conclusion, our findings support a model whereby anisotropic tissue tension drives earlier recruitment of NuMA to the polar cortex during mitosis. This enhanced cortical localisation of NuMA modulates increased spindle oscillations and, therefore, increased cortical force generation to pull the spindle into position. Ultimately, NuMA mediates a dynamic, force-dependent, finessing of spindle alignment with anisotropic tension to ensure accurate cell division orientation.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S15"><title>DNA constructs and morpholino oligonucleotides</title><p id="P43">pCS2+/mCherry-Histone2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kanda et al., 1998</xref>), pCS2+/GFP-α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Woolner et al., 2008</xref>), pCS2+/BFP-CAAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Larson and Bement, 2017</xref>), and pCS2+/GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Burkel et al., 2007</xref>) were gifts from Bill Bement (University of Wisconsin-Madison, US). pCS2+/GFP-CAAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>) was a gift from Ann Miller (University of Michigan, US). pCS2+/GFP-NuMA was generated by excising the NuMA sequence from pEGFP/C1-NuMA (Addgene, 81029) and ligating into Bgl2 and EcoR1 sites in pCS2+/GFP.
