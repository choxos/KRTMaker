Analyzing disease-related gene transcripts from patient cells would improve detection of mutations that have been missed or misinterpreted in terms of pathogenicity during routine genome sequencing. However, the analysis of transcripts is complicated by the fact that a biopsy of the affected tissue is often not appropriate, and many disease-associated genes are not expressed in tissues or cells that can be easily obtained from patients. Here, using CRISPR/Cas-mediated transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) we developed a robust and efficient approach to activate genes in skin-derived fibroblasts and in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individuals. This approach was successfully applied to blood samples from patients with inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD). We were able to efficiently activate several IRD-linked genes and detect the corresponding transcripts using different diagnostically relevant methods such as RT-qPCR, RT-PCR and long- and short-read RNA sequencing. The detection and analysis of known and unknown mRNA isoforms demonstrates the potential of CRISPRa-mediated transcriptional activation in PBMCs. These results will contribute to ceasing the critical gap in the genetic diagnosis of patients with IRD or other inherited diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F6" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS201625-f006"/></fig></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Related specialties</title><kwd>Genetics</kwd><kwd>Ophthalmology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><kwd>Diagnostics</kwd><kwd>Genetic diseases</kwd><kwd>RNA processing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Even in developed countries with modern molecular diagnostic equipment, up to 50% of patients with genetic diseases receive no or insufficient genetic diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). This excludes patients from established treatments and participation in clinical trials testing novel therapies for the respective diseases.</p><p id="P4">High-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, such as whole genome sequencing (WGS) or whole exome sequencing (WES) have facilitated the diagnostics of genetic diseases. Both WGS and WES, however, have key limitations. WES does not cover the non-coding regions (e.g. introns, promoters or other regulatory transcriptional elements), which are crucial for mRNA stability and processing. WGS is time and money-consuming, and the interpretation of the large amount of data obtained during this process is rather difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Even if potential disease-causing mutations can be identified in coding or non-coding regions of candidate genes using WGS, experimental validation of how these mutations influence the mRNA level is inevitable but laborious using currently available techniques (e.g. minigene assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) or patient-derived iPSC models). Single nucleotide variants can affect mRNA processing via different mechanisms. Among those, the most common one alters pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Splice site mutations are typically classified as such using standard splice prediction software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Nevertheless, bioinformatic prediction of the effects of mutations is often not reliable. Apart from false-positive results, splice prediction programs also yield an uncertain number of false-negative records. Many false-negative splicing mutations are classified as missense or silent variants located in (deep) exonic coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). However, such point mutations can also affect regulatory splice elements, ultimately leading to aberrant splicing, and should therefore be routinely tested at the transcript level, preferably in patient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Taken together, there is an unmet need for developing straightforward techniques focusing on detection and investigation of disease-associated mutations at the transcript level. The most convenient method to analyze the transcripts of the corresponding genes is to use patients’ tissue samples. However, taking biopsies of affected tissues may often not be reasonable and many disease-relevant genes are not expressed in cells which can be routinely obtained from the patients (e.g. blood cells or skin-derived fibroblasts). This applies in particular to IRDs, in which tissue collection from the affected retina for diagnostic purposes is generally not justified due to the invasiveness of the procedure, risk of iatrogenic damage and potentially sight-threatening complications. To circumvent these obstacles, we developed a <underline>C</underline>RISPRa-based <underline>a</underline>pproach for <underline>t</underline>ranscriptional <underline>a</underline>ctivation of genes in acutel<underline>y</underline> isolat<underline>e</underline>d human <underline>c</underline>ells (hereinafter referred to as CATALYTEC) to analyze single or multiple genes associated with IRDs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P6">To provide proof of principle for CATALYTEC, we initially focused on <italic>ABCA4</italic>, <italic>RPE65</italic>, <italic>MYO7A</italic> and <italic>USH2A</italic> for several reasons:

We were able to identify sgRNAs for efficient activation of each of these genes. Multiplexing experiments demonstrated that the combination of multiple sgRNA cassettes resulted in simultaneous activation of all genes without any substantial loss of activation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Using RT-PCR, we could amplify all fragments covering the entire coding region and parts of the untranslated regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B+C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>). The identity of all bands was confirmed by Sanger sequencing.</p><p id="P11">In the first attempts to establish a robust and simple protocol for the transfection of PBMCs and skin fibroblasts from healthy individuals, we tested various commonly used transfection techniques (e.g. calcium phosphate, lipofection and electroporation). For most of these approaches, however, we observed no or weak expression of the transfected GFP reporter gene.</p><p id="P12">Since lentiviral vectors (LV) have been shown to efficiently transduce non-dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), we investigated the efficacy of gene activation upon transduction with LVs. In our experiments, using dual LV vectors, each expressing GFP or dsRed, we obtained high co-transduction efficiencies for human skin fibroblasts and PBMCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Surprisingly, the dual LV approach for gene transcriptional activation in transduced HEK293T, fibroblasts and PBMCs led to a relatively weak transcriptional activation of <italic>ABCA4</italic>, despite numerous optimization steps (e.g. use of high multiplicity of infections (MOIs), different promoters etc., <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2C-F</xref>). These results suggest that dCas9-VPR delivered via LVs is substantially less efficient in activating target genes compared to delivery by plasmid transfection. To elucidate the causes for the low activity of dCas9-VPR in cells transduced with the corresponding LVs, we generated a HEK293T cell line stably expressing dCas9-VPR through genomic integration of the corresponding cassette (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3A</xref>). After transduction of these cells with LVs expressing only the sgRNAs targeting the individual genes, we detected a robust transcriptional activation of <italic>ABCA4</italic>, <italic>MYO7A</italic> and <italic>USH2A</italic>. A similarly high activation was also achieved in a multiplexing approach, in which all three genes were targeted simultaneously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3B</xref>). In combination with the results shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>, this indicates that the efficiency of transcriptional activation is not compromised by LV-mediated delivery of sgRNAs, excluding a general impact of LVs on gene activation. A possible explanation for our observation of low-level gene activation in all cell types upon LV-based administration of dCas9-VPR is that dCas9-VPR is not well tolerated by LV vectors due to its size (5.8 kb). To test this hypothesis, we used a shorter variant of this CRISPRa system, dCas9-VPRmini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3C</xref>). However, this approach also did not lead to increased activation efficiency compared to full-length dCas9-VPR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">From this set of unfavorable results, we concluded that the LV-based approach in combination with dCas9-VPR mediated transcriptional activation of genes is unsuitable for diagnostic purposes.</p><p id="P14">Achieving reasonable levels of transcriptional activation in PBMCs or skin fibroblasts from healthy individuals is a prerequisite for establishing a robust protocol for diagnostic purposes in patient cells. So far, although we initially obtained high activation efficiencies for the individual IRD-linked genes in transfected HEK293T cells, none of the previously described approaches has reached this goal. In another attempt to achieve this milestone, we used nucleofection for transferring sgRNA and transgene plasmids into our primary target cells. Nucleofection of a GFP-encoding cassette resulted in robust expression of this reporter in both cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4A</xref>). Next, we nucleofected the dCas9-VPR expression cassette together with sgRNAs targeting either <italic>MYO7A</italic>, <italic>USH2A</italic>, <italic>ABCA4</italic> or <italic>RPE65</italic>. Using RT-qPCR, we observed high activation efficiencies for <italic>ABCA4</italic> and <italic>RPE65</italic> in both cell types. Additionally, we were able to detect the entire coding and untranslated regions using RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 5</xref>). By comparison, we found that <italic>MYO7A</italic> is already endogenously expressed in human skin fibroblasts and in PBMCs, respectively, in sufficient amounts to be detected by RT-PCR. Nevertheless, after transcriptional activation a moderate increase in <italic>MYO7A</italic> expression was detectable via RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4B, C</xref>). For <italic>USH2A</italic>, we could only detect parts covering exons 1-7, 45-55 and the 3’-UTR of the corresponding mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4D, E</xref>).</p><p id="P15">For <italic>RPE65</italic> and <italic>ABCA4</italic>, in addition to the expected RT-PCR bands encoding the full-length proteins, we detected several splice variants, most of which resulted in frameshifts and premature termination codons (PTC, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Tab. 1 + 2</xref>). The corresponding bands could represent alternative splicing that might differ in PBMCs and in the retina.</p><p id="P16">To test how the splice pattern observed in PBMCs compared to that of human retinal cells, we performed RT-PCR of RNA samples isolated from human donor retinas and human retinal organoids using the same primer pairs. We observed a very similar band pattern compared to the RT-PCR results from skin fibroblasts and PBMCs, suggesting no major differences in mRNA splicing of <italic>ABCA4</italic> and <italic>RPE65</italic> between the different cell and tissue types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Although RT-PCR is a robust method for the qualitative detection of mRNA splicing defects, it is less suitable for the reliable quantification of the results. In addition, particularly for low abundant transcripts, it is susceptible to artificial variations, manifesting during cDNA synthesis and subsequent PCR amplification. To overcome the drawbacks of RT-PCR and to validate our results with additional methods, we analyzed RNA from PBMCs of several healthy individuals using two next generation RNA sequencing techniques: short-read RNA sequencing (Illumina) and long-read RNA sequencing (PacBio Revio, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Short-read sequencing of samples with transcriptionally activated <italic>ABCA4</italic> and <italic>RPE65</italic> showed a robust increase in gene expression for both genes in comparison to non-treated control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Splice junction analysis of <italic>ABCA4</italic> demonstrated that the level of transcriptional activation achieved with CATALYTEC is in principle sufficient to analyze the different transcript isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4F</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Analysis of long-read RNA sequencing data in healthy PBMC samples revealed that over 30% of detected splice variants exhibit incomplete splice matches, i.e. variants with partial alignment but differing at the 5’ or/and 3’-end of the transcript. Additionally, more than 30% of isoforms represent either novel combinations of known splice sites (classified as “Novel in catalogue”) or incorporate at least one previously unidentified splice site (“Novel not in catalogue”), highlighting the capability of long-read sequencing to identify novel splice isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Simultaneous transactivation of <italic>ABCA4</italic> and <italic>RPE65</italic> and single transactivation of <italic>MYO7A</italic> led to full transcript coverage by long-read sequencing, corroborating the increase in gene expression as previously determined via RT-qPCR and short-read RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). The respective consensus sequences, constructed by clustering similar reads and eliminating potential artifacts, were used to identify isoforms of biological relevance. For <italic>RPE65</italic> and <italic>MYO7A</italic>, several full-length isoforms were identified as consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 6</xref>). In contrast, only one consensus sequence was obtained for <italic>ABCA4</italic>, as multiple transcript reads were excluded in the filtering process.</p><p id="P20">Finally, we applied the described CATALYTEC protocol to one patient with confirmed biallelic <italic>RPE65</italic>-associated LCA (P1), two patients with the clinical phenotype of rod-cone dystrophy (RP, P2 and P3) but unclear molecular genetic diagnosis, and three patients with the clinical diagnosis of <italic>ABCA4</italic>-associated Stargardt’s disease (STGD1; P4-P6) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tab. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P21">All patients, except for P3, had previously undergone molecular genetic testing of whom only P1 and P4 had a definite molecular genetic diagnosis (compound heterozygosity), which was confirmed by segregation analysis.</p><p id="P22">P1 is a 6-year-old male who has been severely visually impaired from birth and received a genetic diagnosis of <italic>RPE65</italic>-associated LCA at the age of 5.

P2 and P3 are two female siblings who first experienced impaired vision (night blindness and in the further course of the disease visual field restriction) in their early 20’s with the clinical diagnosis of rod-cone dystrophy (RP) lacking a definite genetic diagnosis. In 2013, an initial molecular genetic testing via gene panel sequencing in P2 comprising 42 known IRD genes revealed one heterozygous variant of unknown significance in the <italic>RPE65</italic>, the <italic>CRB1</italic> and the <italic>RP1L1</italic> gene, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Tab. 1</xref>).

P1 carries c.11+5G&gt;A within the splice donor site of exon 1 in the <italic>RPE65</italic> gene. According to RT-PCR analysis, this mutation does not severely affect mRNA splicing at that position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). For the second mutation affecting the canonical consensus sequence of the splice acceptor site in intron 7 (c.726-2A&gt;T, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig.5A</xref>), RT-PCR analysis revealed a clear difference in the band pattern compared to the unaffected control sample, experimentally confirming the splicing divergence. Sanger sequencing of these bands revealed partial skipping of exon 8 and inclusion of intron 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B, C</xref>).</p><p id="P26">The c.1937+1G&gt;A mutation of P4 disrupts the splice donor site of exon 13 in <italic>ABCA4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). A previous case study has associated this mutation with severe phenotypes, including STGD and macular degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). A recent publication reported that it causes aberrant splicing by activating cryptic splice donor sites within exon 13 and intron 13, ultimately resulting in a 132 bp in-frame deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). This conclusion was based on data obtained with a minigene assay. Potential consequences at the protein level, such as p.[(Y.603_S646del, F647*)], have not yet been experimentally validated. For this mutation, we visually detected an increased ratio of alternative exon 15 splicing in comparison to healthy control samples in RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B, D</xref>). As described in Table 1, this alternatively spliced <italic>ABCA4</italic> variant leads to an in-frame skipping of exon 15. However, the significance of this deletion for ABCA4 protein expression, stability and function remains unclear and is outside the focus of this study. For all other patients carrying potentially pathogenic mutations in IRD genes analyzed herein, no obvious effects on splicing could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Taken together, these results suggest that our CATALYTEC is in principle suitable for the detection and quantification of splicing mutations in patients’ PMBCs.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P28">Here, we established CATALYTEC, a robust and simple approach for CRISPRa-based activation of genes in human PBMCs and skin fibroblasts suitable for diagnostic purposes.</p><p id="P29">CATALYTEC fulfills various criteria for use in diagnostics:

Compared to these studies, our method offers additional key advancements. We demonstrate for the first time that dCas9-VPR can effectively activate disease-associated genes in PBMCs readily isolated from patient blood samples. Skin fibroblasts have the disadvantage that their isolation requires invasive skin punching, which is more elaborate and associated with reduced patient compliance. Therefore, genetic testing of human skin fibroblasts is less suitable for broad routine diagnostics compared to PBMCs. Additionally, the isolation and cultivation of skin fibroblasts is more time-consuming. With our CATALYTEC approach, we achieved a turnaround time from blood collection to first RT-PCR results of 48-72h, ultimately increasing the convenience for patients and the healthcare system.</p><p id="P35">We have applied CATALYTEC to several common genes associated with IRDs, a heterogeneous group of genetic diseases affecting the retina. In particular, we have proven the ability of our approach to activate large genes like <italic>ABCA4</italic> and <italic>MYO7A</italic>. This is of great importance as deep intronic mutations in large genes are not covered by WES or, when identified by WGS, cannot be correctly interpreted in terms of their potential impact on mRNA splicing.</p><p id="P36">Our data shows that the level of transcriptional activation obtained with CATALYTEC is high enough to be combined with the most commonly used readout methods (RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, short- and long-read RNA sequencing). RT-PCR analysis provided the first evidence that CATALYTEC can be used to detect pathogenic splice mutations in PBMCs of IRD patients. Additionally, we show that short- and long-read sequencing can be used to analyze the expression and alternative splicing of transcriptionally activated genes in PBMCs. However, a meaningful and significant result for diagnostic purposes necessitates a more detailed analysis of isoforms, which could be achieved through higher coverage of the respective target genes.</p><p id="P37">We demonstrate that the splicing patterns of activated IRD genes in human PBMCs and fibroblasts are very similar to those observed in human retinas and retinal organoids. Yet, we cannot exclude the possibility that other activated genes in PBMCs might have different splicing patterns than in the cells in which these genes are naturally expressed. In addition, rare tissue-specific splicing events may have been missed by RT-PCR. More detailed investigations using short- and long-read sequencing of the human retina and organoid transcriptomes could provide valuable insights in this regard.</p><p id="P38">An attractive alternative to PBMCs would be an application of the CATALYTEC protocol in buccal epithelial cells, as their collection is technically even simpler and less invasive than blood sampling. It remains to be seen whether this goal can be achieved using CRISPRa or other methods for introducing DNA or RNA into these cells.</p><p id="P39">In summary, we provide proof of concept for a CRISPRa-based approach to activate IRD-associated genes in PBMCs in sufficient quantities. The resulting transcripts can be detected and quantified using standard methods and analyzed for structural variants and splicing defects. The CATALYTEC method is universally applicable, can be easily adapted to other target genes, and could help closing important gaps in the diagnosis of inherited (retinal) diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Sex as a biological variable</title><p id="P40">Our study examined men and women, as gender should not be an exclusion criterion due to the diagnostic background of the study.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Plasmids</title><p id="P41">The pcDNA3.1-CMV-dCas9-VPR and plasmids for LV production (pMDL, pRSVRev and pMD2.G) were obtained from Addgene (#63798, #12251, #12253, #12259).
