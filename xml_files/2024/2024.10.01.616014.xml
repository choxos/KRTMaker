Here we describe the generation of a Netrin-1 reporter chicken line (<italic>NTN1-T2A-eGFP</italic>) by targeting green fluorescent protein into the <italic>NTN1</italic> locus using CRISPR/Cas9 methodology. Our strategy gave 100% transmission of heterozygous (<italic>NTN1</italic><sup><italic>T2A-eGFP</italic>/+</sup>) embryos in which GFP localisation faithfully replicated endogenous <italic>NTN1</italic> expression in the optic fissure and neural tube floorplate. Furthermore, all <italic>NTN1</italic><sup><italic>T2A-eGFP</italic>/+</sup> embryos and hatched birds appeared phenotypically normal. We applied this resource to a pertinent developmental context - coloboma is a structural eye malformation characterised by failure of epithelial fusion during optic fissure closure (OFC) and <italic>NTN1</italic> is specifically expressed in fusion pioneer cells at the edges of the optic fissure. We therefore optimised the isolation of GFP expressing cells from embryonic <italic>NTN1</italic><sup><italic>T2A-eGFP</italic>/+</sup> eyes using spectral fluorescence cell-sorting and applied transcriptomic profiling of pioneer cells, which revealed multiple new OFC markers and novel pathways for developmental tissue fusion and coloboma.

Thus, accurate molecular profiling of <italic>NTN1</italic> expressing and responsive cells would permit in depth analyses for a range of developmental and broader biological processes.</p><p id="P4">Fusion of opposing sheets of cells during development is critical across all vertebrates, and failure of tissue fusion underlies a range of human developmental disorders, including spina bifida, cleft palate, septal heart defects and hypospadias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Ray and Niswander, 2012</xref>). In the developing vertebrate eye, the optic fissure (OF, also referred to as the <italic>choroid fissure</italic>) is a naturally-arising gap extending along the entire proximal-distal length of the early ventral eye cup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Chow and Lang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fuhrmann, 2010</xref>). Retinal epithelia at the edges of this fissure must completely fuse together to complete the spherical 3D circumferential eye structure and this is required for normal eye development. Incomplete closure of the OF causes ocular coloboma, manifested clinically as persistent open regions of the retina, optic nerve and/or iris, which may severely affect vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gregory-Evans et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Patel and Sowden, 2017</xref>). OFC involves a range of cell types from distinct origins that contribute either directly or indirectly to the fusion process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gestri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Patel and Sowden, 2017</xref>), but the recent identification of pioneer cells at the epithelial edges of the OF margins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Eckert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hardy et al., 2019</xref>) offers an opportunity to characterise genes and pathways that specifically regulate fusion. <italic>NTN1</italic> expression was recently shown to be spatially restricted to pioneer cells before and during fusion but was immediately downregulated in the nascently-fused fissure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hardy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Richardson et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, <italic>NTN1</italic> is a pioneer cell marker with specific spatial-temporal expression during fusion phases of OFC that is predicted to tolerate haploinsufficiency during development. We previously characterised OFC in the developing chicken embryo and showed that the size, developmental timing, and ease of segmental dissections within the chicken OFM, were major advantages over other existing models. Coupled to recent advances that have enabled the simplified and expedient generation of gene-edited germline chicken lines for developmental biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ballantyne et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Woodcock et al., 2017</xref>), we set out to make a reporter chicken line by targeting the <italic>NTN1</italic> locus with green fluorescent protein. Our aim was to apply this line to enable the selective isolation and molecular characterisation of pioneer cells to identify new genes and pathways that are active during fusion in OFC and use this approach as an exemplar for this tractable developmental resource.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>Recombining T2A-eGFP into the chicken <italic>Netrin-1 locus</italic></title><p id="P5">Endogenous <italic>NTN1</italic> is expressed in the optic fissure during chicken embryonic development, as well as the floorplate of the neural tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). To develop a <italic>NTN1</italic> fluorescent reporter chicken line, we applied a CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in strategy to deliver a T2A self-cleaving peptide and enhanced GFP (<italic>NTN1-T2A-eGFP</italic>) reporter gene in-frame into the endogenous <italic>NTN1</italic> locus to create a truncated non-functional <italic>NTN1</italic> allele and a cleaved cytoplasmic eGFP from the same locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). We first identified sgRNA sequences in <italic>NTN1</italic> exon 1, then cloned these into a CRISPR vector with combined <italic>Cas9</italic> expression and puromycin resistance. We separately generated a repair template construct with the T2A-eGFP open reading frame flanked at both 5’- and 3’- ends with 100 bp flanking homology sequences to the <italic>NTN1</italic> exon 1 cut site. These sequences were further flanked by recognition sequences for the sgRNA to enable high efficiency HDR into the <italic>NTN1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). We used these combined vectors in cotransfections of male primordial germ cells (PGCs), followed by puromycin selection and FACs to generate single-cell derived clonal cultures for expansion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental figure S1</xref>). We identified unambiguous knock-in events in 15 independent PGC lines (15 of 39 analysed clones) by allele-specific PCRs followed by Sanger sequencing; 11 of these were biallelic and 4 were monoallelic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental figure S1</xref>). We determined that 100% of all HDR events were in-frame and had no indels or other changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). We injected 12 embryonic day 2.5 iCaspase9 surrogate host chicken embryos with PGCs derived from one single biallelic (homozygous) <italic>NTN1<sup>T2A-eGFP/T2A-eGFP</sup></italic> clonal line, according to a previously reported protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ballantyne et al., 2021</xref>). Of these injected embryos, 4 healthy chicks were hatched, and the surrogate F<sub>0</sub> males (n=2) were reared to sexual maturity. Each F<sub>0</sub> cockerel was then placed in a breeding pen with wild-type (WT) female laying hens and F<sub>1</sub> eggs were collected daily for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>NTN1<sup>T2A-GFP</sup></italic> replicates endogenous developmental <italic>NTN1</italic> expression and is a pioneer cell reporter</title><p id="P6">We clearly detected expression of the integrated <italic>NTN1-T2A-GFP</italic> allele in dissected neural tube and optic fissure tissues by RT-PCR of F<sub>1</sub> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). Fluorescence stereomicroscopy revealed GFP expression in <italic>NTN1<sup>T2A-eGFP+</sup></italic> embryos in the optic fissure, floor-plate of the neural tube, and somite regions, at multiple stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g-h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>), faithfully recapitulating endogenous <italic>NTN1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). We also detected GFP and concomitantly reduced endogenous NTN1 at the protein level in <italic>NTN1<sup>T2A-eGFP/+</sup></italic> embryo tissues by western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>), consistent with loss of effective Netrin-1 translation from the gene edited allele. We then tested for embryo viability by macroscopic screening for embryonic defects. the first &gt;150 F1 embryos analysed at embryonic day 9 (~HH34) or later we observed 99.5 % viability (heartbeat at time of cull, no gross anatomical abnormalities; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). All embryos were heterozygous for the NTN1-T2A-eGFP edit (e.g. 100% were <italic>NTN1<sup>T2A-eGFP/+</sup></italic>), consistent with complete colonisation and germ-line activity of the introduced homozygous PGCs in the surrogate F<sub>0</sub> male gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Ballantyne et al., 2021</xref>). At day6/HH28, immediately prior to fusion and when the optic fissure margins meet, <italic>NTN1</italic><sup><italic>T2A-eGFP</italic> +</sup> embryos were phenotypically indistinguishable from WT controls and displayed normal anatomy in the optic fissure and no broad ocular abnormalities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>). Thus, the NTN1-T2AGFP line was sufficiently validated to faithfully recapitulate endogenous <italic>NTN1</italic> expression and produce GFP positive (GFP+ve) cells in the optic fissure pioneer cell domain. Furthermore, the introduced <italic>T2A-eGFP</italic> allele caused no observable deleterious phenotypes in heterozygous embryos and in &gt;120 hatched chicks. In combination, these approaches confirmed the reporter lines utility as a system for the study of <italic>NTN1</italic>-expressing cells during normal embryonic development.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Isolation of pioneer cells from <italic>NTN1</italic><sup><italic>eGFP</italic>/+</sup> embryonic eyes</title><p id="P7">The ocular GFP expression was confirmed to the pioneer cell region of the optic fissure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>). We then aimed to isolate these pioneer cells for molecular profiling using a dissection-dissociation and fluorescence activated sorting (FACS) approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Several protocols exist for generating single cell dissociations from chicken embryonic tissue but were optimised for young chicken embryos, and we found they were not suitable for dissociating ventral chick eye tissue at HH.28 (data not shown). Furthermore, RPE cells can auto-fluoresce at wavelengths that overlap with GFP spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bermond et al., 2020</xref>), potentially confounding specific GFP+ve cell isolation by FACS. Thus, to utilise the <italic>NTN1<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> embryos for accurate transcriptomic profiling of pioneer cells we first optimised the cell dissociation of dissected fissure margins, and then applied a spectral-sorting FACS strategy to accurately isolate GFP+ve cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>). For cell dissociation, we adapted a method published for mouse eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alsing et al., 2022</xref>) using a pre-treatment of dissected fissures with hyaluronidase, followed by two rounds of incubation in trypsin/EDTA. Cell suspensions were then analysed by FACS, first defined by the exclusion of debris and dead cells using forward and side scatter, then single cells were selected using side scatter profiling (SSC-A versus SSC-H). We first used wild-type (WT) OFM cell suspensions (i.e. no GFP) to set a conservative fluorescent gating for background fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>) and then repeated the process, this time with pooled dissected-dissociated OFMs from <italic>NTN1<sup>T2A-eGFP/+</sup></italic> embryos (<italic>n</italic> &gt;10 OFMs from independent embryos, per pool). <italic>NTN1<sup>T2A-eGFP/+</sup></italic> samples were further analysed by spectral flow cytometry to subtract autofluorescence from the populations and stringently define the GFP+ve population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>). We collected cells from both the GFP-ve and GFP+ve fractions from <italic>NTN1<sup>T2A-eGFP/+</sup></italic> embryos using this method. This approach successfully and reproducibly generated 5 replicate (<italic>n</italic>=5) sample groups each of GFP+ve and GFP-ve cells from the optic fissures of <italic>NTN1<sup>T2A-eGFP/+</sup></italic> embryos, with each group containing &gt;10,000 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Transcriptomic profiling of pioneer cells</title><p id="P8">We isolated total RNA from the sample groups and generated cDNA libraries for paired-end RNAseq which gave &gt;40 M reads per sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). We aligned reads passing QC to the chicken genome (ENSEMBL, Red Jungle Fowl GRCg6a). PCA analysis of the RNAseq data separated the samples by GFP+ve or GFP-ve for PC1 (62% of variance), and by library preparation for PC2 (29%); i.e. &gt;90% of the variance across the samples could be attributed to either “cell type” or library preparation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>). We then performed differential gene expression (DEG) analysis, comparing the two groups (GFP+ve vs GFP-ve) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). We found a total of 1701 DEGs (adj <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) across the dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S2</xref>), with 433 DEGs (LFC ≥ 1) in the GFP+ve cells and 1268 in the GFP-ve cells (LFC £1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). To assess broad-scale differences between GFP+ve and GFP-ve, we then assessed enrichment for cell-type specific markers based on gene ontologies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>). This analysis showed the GFP-ve cell populations had significantly higher expression of genes in ontology groups for neural crest migration (GO:0001755), epithelial to mesenchymal transition (GO:0001837), mesenchymal development (GO:0060485), neuroepithelial cell differentiation (GO:0060563), and erythrocyte development (GO:0048821), reflecting the enrichment for cells of the periocular mesenchyme, neural retina, and developing hyaloid blood vessels in the dissected tissue and the proportion of these cells compared to pioneer cells in the total dissected material. In contrast, both GFP+ve and GFP-ve showed similar gene expression for the ontology group retinal pigment epithelium development (GO:0003406), alluding to similar transcriptional identities of pioneer cells to RPE and the broadly equivalent cell numbers of each fraction. Furthermore, the GFP+ve enriched gene set included <italic>NTN1</italic> (LFC &gt; 5.01; <italic>p</italic>adj &lt; 6.3E-23) and <italic>PAX2</italic> (LFC &gt; 3.4; adj <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1.1E-07)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>), both of which had previously been associated with optic fissure closure and the only genes until now shown to have specific expression in pioneer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hardy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Richardson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Trejo-Reveles et al., 2023</xref>).

To confirm these differential gene expression profiles qualitatively, we used fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation on OFM cryosections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>).

Our analysis showed that all were specifically expressed in the pioneer cell domain of the optic fissure and were not detected in the broader ventral or dorsal retina, although <italic>FOXP2</italic> was detected in the dorsal periocular mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g</xref>). <italic>FOXP2</italic> also showed the most restricted expression domain within this panel, with signal in a region of the OFM located in the small group of cells adjacent to the folding point where pioneer cells are apically-tethered prior to fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hardy and Rainger, 2023</xref>).

This approach revealed enrichment for a range of processes and biological pathways of relevance to OFC and epithelial fusion, the most significant (adj <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.05) of which included: <italic>plasma membrane, signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases, signal transduction, signalling or receptor-ligand binding by G-coupled protein receptors, PI3K-AKT signalling, and various extracellular, plasma membrane, and ligand-receptor processes</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S2</xref>).

In combination, these <italic>in silico</italic> analyses suggested that HGF/MET and PI3K/AKT related signalling pathways may be active in chicken pioneer cells during fusion. HGF and MET are the secreted ligand and canonical receptor, respectively, for hepatocyte growth factor signalling (HGF, “scatter factor”), which upon ligand-receptor interactions induces a range of cellular responses, including proliferation, cell survival, and invasive growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Birchmeier and Gherardi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Trusolino and Comoglio, 2002</xref>).

We then performed dual fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation for <italic>MET</italic> and <italic>HGF</italic> and observed that both genes were indeed specifically expressed in the OFM, but their expression was localised to distinct domains along the proximal-distal axis in the pre-fusing fissure at both HH25 and HH28 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). At HH28, immediately prior to fusion, <italic>MET</italic> expression was clearly identified in RPE and neural retinal cells at the pioneer cell region in the medial OFM where fusion will subsequently initiate but was absent from the distal (iris) region where fusion does not occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S3</xref>). In contrast, at the same stage <italic>HGF</italic> expression was detected broadly in the ventral neural retina in the distal OFM (not RPE) but was not detected in the medial pioneer cell region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). Thus, despite both genes being expressed in the optic fissure margins, at no point along the proximal distal axis did <italic>HGF</italic> and <italic>MET</italic> expression overlap in the pre-fusing and HH28 OFM. Fusion is active and dynamic at HH30 in the chicken OFM, with all phases of fusion present: open fissure, fusion plate and a fused seam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hardy et al., 2019</xref>). Fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation at this stage revealed that expression of <italic>MET</italic> was still evident within the pioneer cells at the apposed fissure margins, in the fusion plate, and in the immediately adjacent (within 100 µm of the fusion plate) fused seam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>). In contrast, HGF expression was not detected in the in the pioneer cells but was expressed in a small domain at the junction between pioneer cells and the RPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>). Finally, to provide direct evidence for activity of the HGF/MET pathway in the fusing OFM, we used immunofluorescence against phosphorylated MET protein (phos-Tyr1234/phos-Tyr1235) in the HH30 chicken fissure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3g</xref>). In accordance with the adjacent expression of <italic>MET</italic> and <italic>HGF</italic> at this stage leading to autophosphorylation of the receptor at cell surfaces of ligand expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Trusolino et al., 2010</xref>), we observed fluorescence signal in the apical region of pioneer cells immediately prior to fusion and in the fusion plate but were unable to detect signal in the fusion seam &gt;100 µm from the fusion plate.

Lists of GO terms were ranked and plotted (-log10(pval)) with cut off values p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Huang da W, Sherman BT, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sherman et al., 2022</xref>). Plots were prepared using ggplot2 (version 3.4.2). For STRING (Version 11.5) protein-protein network analysis, we inputted all DEGs in the GFP+ve selection (log2 fold change ≥ 1.0 and an adjusted P-value ≤0.05) as gene names and used the following settings: Full STRING network; hide disconnected nodes; “evidence” to define network edges; “Textmining, Experiments, Databases, Co-expression and Neighbourhood” criteria selected as active interaction sources; Minimum required interaction score - Medium &gt; 0.400. Data shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S2</xref>. Figure prepared with extra node prediction by STRING, MCL clustering with inflation parameter of 1.5, for visualization proteins without linkage were dropped out. A total of 10 nodes were added, leading to the node (i.e. protein) number of 283, number of edges (i.e. functional association linkage) was 96 and a PPI enrichment score of 6.73 x 10<sup>-7</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental data</label><media xlink:href="EMS199192-supplement-Supplemental_data.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d71aAcDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to acknowledge the support and insightful scientific discussions with Françoise Helmbacher and Flavio Maina (Aix-Marseille Université), Brian Brooks (NIH, National Eye Institute), and Megan Davey and Tom Burdon (Roslin Institute).
