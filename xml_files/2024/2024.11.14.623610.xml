Genome-wide mapping of DNA replication origins has mainly been derived from population-based techniques, with only a few studies examining origin location and usage at the single-cell or single-molecule level. <italic>Leishmania</italic> are protozoan parasites where the first attempt to map DNA replication suggested the unprecedented use, for a eukaryote, of just a single origin per chromosome, while a subsequent approach suggested around 200-fold more origins. To reconcile these data and understand DNA replication dynamics in <italic>Leishmania major</italic>, we have applied DNAscent, a deep learning assay that uses long-read Nanopore sequencing to detect patterns of BrdU incorporation in individual DNA molecules, allowing the description of DNA replication fork movement and prediction of initiation and termination sites across the parasite genome. Our findings confirm the pre-eminence of a single locus of DNA replication initiation in each chromosome and reveal that this locus alone is constitutively activated in S-phase, with bidirectional forks emerging from discrete sites at the ends of multigene transcription units. DNAscent also reveals a much larger number of DNA replication initiation events that have not been detected in any previous mapping and are used stochastically, but whose abundance is greater as chromosome size increases. We show that each of these stochastic initiation sites localise to regions with high AT content, increased G-quadruplex levels and lower chromatin occupancy. In addition, we find markedly increased stochastic DNA replication initiation at sites with lower levels of nascent RNA transcripts. Finally, we show that all DNA replication initiation events result in mutagenesis. This work reveals a novel, bimodal strategy for DNA replication programming in <italic>Leishmania</italic> that drives genome transmission, replication timing and variation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Propagation of life depends upon the successful duplication of an organism’s genome. In cellular organisms, DNA replication initiates at defined sites in the genome termed origins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, which in eukaryotes are designated by the binding of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Unlike in bacteria and some archaea, where the whole genome is replicated from a single origin, each eukaryotic chromosome is normally replicated from multiple origins. This increase in origin number is associated with increased complexity in DNA replication organisation. With the exception of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and related yeasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, origins in eukaryotes differ from those in prokaryotes in that they are not conserved DNA sequences, but are defined by sequence-independent genomic features. In addition, though origins are designated by ORC binding in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and then activated in S-phase, not all designated origins are activated. Moreover, there is a temporal order to the time in S-phase when origins are activated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and, in the case of multicellular organisms, both the number and location of origins can vary during development and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Due to such complexity, mapping DNA replication origins in eukaryotic cells is technically challenging and results from different techniques are often discordant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Most approaches to detect origins rely on mapping the DNA replication machinery or capturing replicative DNA synthesis in populations of cells, with the potential that only frequently used origins are detected and cell-to-cell heterogeneity is overlooked<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. These limitations have be addressed by the recent development of both genome-wide single-molecule DNA replication mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and single-cell DNA replication sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> approaches, which have revealed previously undetected origins and informed on DNA replication timing. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, two related approaches (DNAscent and Fork-seq/NanoForkSpeed)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> used Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to detect incorporation of the thymidine analogue 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into newly replicated DNA, revealing that around 10-20% of DNA initiation events do not localise to previously reported origins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Whether these newly predicted initiation sites correspond with a predicted 15% of MCM binding sites that do not localise with sequence-conserved origins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> awaits testing. In the larger genome of humans, ˜80% of origins detected by DNAscent do not overlap with origins previously detected by population-level analyses (Carrington et al BioRXiv 10.1101/2024.04.28.591325), perhaps consistent with a model of highly stochastic DNA replication initiation derived from optical replication mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Single-cell DNA replication sequencing methods, such as scRepli-seq, measure copy number variation (CNV) between replicating and non-replicating DNA and, instead of mapping origin location, describe replication timing domains across S-phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. These approaches have been used in human and mouse cells and, overall, reveal conservation of DNA replication timing organisation in individual cells and equivalent populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, although timing domains differ between cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, despite origin activation being stochastic, the mammalian DNA replication timing program is spatially well defined, perhaps to ensure maximal efficiency of genome duplication and coordination with other processes, such as transcription.</p><p id="P4">Protozoans provide much of the diversity in the eukaryotic domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and only relatively recently has DNA replication been examined in a few select organisms in this grouping, with new insights into origin usage and DNA replication programming emerging. For instance, two nuclei are found in the single cells of <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>20, with highly distinct genome organisation and function found in the distinct nuclei of the latter. In both cases, DNA replication dynamics appear to differ between the nuclei, but no work has mapped origins genome-wide, and so how potentially distinct genome duplication activities are organised within a single cell remains unclear. The life cycle of the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is complex, containing four stages with distinct replicative strategies: hepatic and erythrocytic schizogony, gametogenesis, and sporogony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Recently, two studies have combined ChIP-seq of ORC subunits and NanoForkSpeed or DNAscent to detect origins in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> undergoing erythrocytic schizogony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, a process in which the parasite undergoes multiple rounds of asynchronous DNA replication and nuclear division without cytokinesis, resulting in a multinucleated schizont. Surprisingly, no clear consensus emerged from the two studies, perhaps suggesting that DNA replication during schizogony has unanticipated complexities. Arguably, the most advanced understanding of protozoan DNA replication has emerged within the kinetoplastids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, a ubiquitous grouping of flagellated organisms that includes both human and animal parasites of clinical and economic importance. DNA replication dynamics has been described and compared in three kinetoplastid parasites (see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> for reviews): <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and <italic>Leishmania</italic> sp.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Despite each of these parasites using a common, highly unusual form of gene expression where nearly every gene is expressed from a polycistronic transcription unit (PTU)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, and each genome sharing considerable synteny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, population-level DNA replication analyses suggest pronounced differences, in particular between <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The genome of <italic>T. brucei</italic> is primarily housed in 11 diploid ‘megabase’ chromosomes, each of which contains a highly transcribed core and two largely transcriptionally silent subtelomeres, which are variable in content between strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> and mainly harbour thousands of genes encoding Variant Surface Glycoproteins (VSGs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. <italic>T. brucei</italic> DNA replication has to date only been mapped genome-wide using population-level Marker Frequency Analysis sequencing (MFA-seq; equivalent to sort-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> in yeast)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. This approach predicts origins within the megabase chromosome cores at the boundaries ( ‘strand switch regions’, SSRs) of ~25% of PTUs. Consistent with these loci being origins, one subunit of <italic>T. brucei</italic> ORC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> has been shown to bind to all SSRs, suggesting that only a subset of ORC-binding sites are activated to initiate DNA replication in S-phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, with such origin selection being invariant between distinct life cycle stages and parasite strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Amongst these MFA-seq-predicted origins, those co-localising with centromeres are the earliest replicating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. More recent MFA-seq mapping suggests that most of the subtelomeric compartment of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome is late-replicating and more unstable than the core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Altogether, these data reveal incompletely explored links between DNA replication initiation, transcription, chromosome segregation and genome stability in this organism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Equivalent MFA-seq analysis in two <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, <italic>L. major</italic> (36 chromosomes) and <italic>L. mexicana</italic> (34 chromosomes), revealed a striking difference to <italic>T. brucei</italic>: only a single MFA-seq peak indicative of S-phase DNA replication initiation could be detected in each chromosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. As no study has mapped ORC in either <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome, it is premature to say that the MFA-seq signal in each chromosome represents an origin, but a range of observations are consistent with such a suggestion: first, as in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, each MFA-seq signal centres on an SSR; second, mapping the binding of the kinetochore subunit KKT1 is consistent with the single MFA-seq SSR in each chromosome being a centromere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, which are coincident with the earliest acting origins in <italic>T. brucei</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>; third, ˜40% of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> MFA-seq SSRs are syntenic with origin-active SSRs in <italic>T. brucei</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>; and, finally, the single MFA-seq peak in each chromosome overlaps with highly localised changes in base composition skews<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> as well as with increased mutagenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, each feature being consistent with sites of frequent DNA replication initiation. Beyond these data on the putative <italic>Leishmania</italic> origin-active SSRs themselves, average chromosome replication timing in <italic>L. major</italic> is unusual in that it correlates with chromosome length, with larger chromosomes being replicated later than smaller ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Such timing may be consistent with limiting DNA replication initiation to just a single locus in each chromosome, but such programming appears insufficient to allow duplication of the largest ˜40% of chromosomes during S-phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. At least in part, this limitation may be overcome by DNA replication activity proximal to the telomeres of each <italic>L. major</italic> chromosome that is detectable outside S-phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, two different approaches have suggested that MFA-seq may not detect all DNA replication activity in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. DNA combing has detected &gt;1 site of DNA replication initiation in single <italic>Leishmania</italic> DNA molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, and Short Nascent Strand-sequencing (SNS-seq) has mapped &gt;5000 putative origins throughout the <italic>L. major</italic> genome, with only limited overlap with MFA-seq mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. These discrepancies may arise from technical limitations in each of these methodologies. MFA-seq analyses CNV in replicating versus non-replicating cells, and therefore mainly determines the timing of DNA replication, with limited spatial resolution to pinpoint origins. DNA combing as reported to date in <italic>Leishmania</italic> is low-throughput and does not localise where in a chromosome, or even in what genome, DNA replication events are detected; indeed, it cannot exclude the possibility that the multi-origin molecules described are derived from abundant extrachromosomal elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> . Finally, SNS-seq mapping is known to be susceptible to G-quadruplex (G4) impediments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, which may be a particular concern given the high prevalence of G4s in the <italic>L. major</italic> genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Irrespective of technical considerations, the huge discrepancies between these studies in estimates of origin number and location raise questions about how <italic>Leishmania</italic> DNA replication is programmed, including why MFA-seq portrays such a stark difference relative to <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Here, we address these questions using DNAscent, a deep learning-based approach developed by Muller and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> that, by detecting BrdU in newly replicated DNA on ultra-long, single-molecule Nanopore sequence reads, provides high-precision mapping of DNA replication fork dynamics, allowing the detection of sites of DNA replication initiation, termination and pausing. Using this approach, we confirm that the single MFA-seq signal in each <italic>L. major</italic> chromosome represents the pre-eminent locus at which DNA replication initiates at the start of S-phase, and that such constitutive, cell cycle-dependent activity is supported by much more numerous and stochastic sites of DNA replication initiation. We also provide evidence that chromosome length-related DNA replication timing in <italic>L. major</italic> is reflected in differential density of the stochastic initiation events among chromosomes throughout S-phase, and that these events localise to regions with high AT content, increased G-quadruplex levels and lower chromatin occupancy. This imbalance between constitutive and stochastic DNA replication initiation appears extreme amongst eukaryotes described to data, and we provide evidence that such an unusual bimodal DNA replication programme relates to patterns of genome variation in <italic>L. major.</italic></p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>BrdU detection with DNAscent confirms pre-eminent DNA replication initiation at a single locus in each <italic>L. major</italic> chromosome</title><p id="P8">DNAscent relies on the detection of BrdU in DNA molecules through nucleotide analogue signal currents during Nanopore sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>). To establish that detection of BrdU incorporated into the nuclear genome <italic>Leishmania</italic> is possible (for instance, it is not impeded by signal from the hypermodified thymidine base, β-D-Glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil, also called base J)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, <italic>L. major</italic> promastigote (insect stage) cells were arrested at the G1/S-phase transition of the cell cycle by treatment with 5 mM hydroxyurea (HU) for 8 hours. Next, one sample was collected (no BrdU control), while the remainder of the cells were released from the HU block and grown for 15, 30 or 60 min in the presence of 150 μM BrdU (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1A</xref>). This treatment was followed by a thymidine-chase (1 mM thymidine, 60 min), DNA extraction, DNA sequencing on a ONT MinION, and BrdU calling with DNAscentv2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Barely any predicted BrdU signal was seen in the no BrdU control cells (0.17% of reads), while substantial BrdU signal accumulated, in a time dependent manner, in the BrdU labelled cells (1.33-2.24% of reads). Moreover, metaplots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1B</xref>) showed that most BrdU signal accumulated around the single SSR previously predicted by MFA-seq to be the single early replicating locus in each chromosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">To accurately predict replication fork movement, as well as initiation and termination sites of DNA replication, DNAscent relies on the detection of gradients of BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. We therefore modified the above experiments, again with <italic>L. major</italic> promastigotes, but this time reducing the length of the BrdU pulse to 2 mins: since the rate of replication fork movement in <italic>L. major</italic> has been calculated as ˜2.5-2.8 kb/min <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> , we expected BrdU labelled tracts of ˜5-5.6 kb, which is smaller than the N50 of 20.5 kb we recover from Nanopore sequencing. For this new experimental setup, we again arrested the cells with HU at the G1/S-phase transition and labelled with 150 μM BrdU at 0 min, 15 min and 60 min after release. In addition, we labelled cells with 150 μM BrdU for 2 mins without any HU treatment, allowing us to compare patterns of BrdU incorporation, and thereby DNA replication dynamics, in the absence of HU-mediated cell cycle synchronisation relative to the early-mid stages of S-phase after HU stall release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). (In all cases, the BrdU pulse was followed by a 1 mM thymidine chase of 60 min.)</p><p id="P10">Visual inspection revealed that BrdU signal enrichment across the chromosomes matched previous MFA-seq analysis, with the most prominent level of BrdU in unsynchronised cells found at a single locus in each chromosome that overlapped the SSR on which MFA-seq signal accumulates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2</xref>). After HU release, this most prominent BrdU signal was detected as two peaks of increasing separation with time, consistent with bidirectional progression of DNA replication from the SSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S2</xref>). To test these observations further, we generated metaplots of BrdU signal around the single SSR in each chromosome that displayed an MFA-seq peak (36 ‘early-replicating SSRs’), and around all other SSRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C,D</xref>; ‘late-replicating SSRs’). Very consistent levels of BrdU signal were apparent at the MFA-seq enriched, early-replicating SSR in each chromosome both before and after HU synchronisation: whereas BrdU signal was closely focused around the SSR in unsynchronised cells, two BrdU peaks of very similar amplitude and width were detected flanking the SSRs in the HU-synchronised cells, with the distance between the peaks increasing over time after release from HU arrest (most distal in the 60 min sample). Taken together, these data indicate highly coordinated initiation of DNA replication in S-phase at a single SSR in each chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>).

To test if DNAscent detects the same organisation of DNA replication, linear regression analysis was conducted on the BrdU density data, which revealed a significant correlation between chromosome size and average BrdU signal, with smaller chromosomes displaying higher BrdU levels than larger chromosomes in non-synchronized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, panel NT, coloured black). An even stronger correlation was observed in cells after release from G1/S synchronisation, demonstrating that the earlier replication of smaller chromosomes occurs across S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, panels 0, 15 and 60, coloured black).

Thus, heterogenous aspects of DNA replication that are lost in population-based methodologies as signals are averaged across many cells and molecules may be revealed. Visual inspection of individual Nanopore ultra-long reads after processing with DNAscent revealed DNA molecules containing multiple sites of DNA replication initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Moreover, comparison of reads derived from common regions of a chromosome suggest considerable variation in the locations of initiation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). By examining all reads obtained, DNAscent predicted ˜25,000 initiation sites in non-synchronised cells and ˜8,200-12,100 initiation sites in HU-synchronised cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2B</xref>). This difference is likely explained by the data from each HU synchronised sample capturing cells at a limited part of S-phase, whereas the non-synchronised sample consists of cells in all stages of S-phase (and indeed of the cell cycle). However, these predictions will overestimate of the total number of DNA replication initiation sites, as many reads overlap and therefore some sites will be overcounted as they are common to the overlapping reads.

Metaplot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2D</xref>) confirmed this: a pronounced accumulation of DNAscent ORIs was seen around the 36 MFA-seq, early-replicating SSRs immediately after HU release, with areas of high ORI density seen extending to both flanks of the SSRs in the 15- and 60-min samples, an effect highly comparable to BrdU density mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B,1C</xref>).

Finally, mapping of MNase-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> data showed that IZs were areas of low nucleosome occupancy, while TZs were enriched in nucleosomes. Each of these genomic features of IZs become more pronounced in more frequently used IZs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4B</xref>): when IZs were separated into 4 different groups according to their average OEM, the extent of AT enrichment, depletion of GC, G4 level and chromatin accessibility increased from low to high.

To address this question, we intersected the RFD profiles derived from DNAscent with annotated transcription direction, and thereby identified genomic segments where DNA replication and transcription travel in the same direction (co-directional), as well as segments where DNA replication and transcription are in opposition (head-on) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).

DNAscent has a number of advantages over previous approaches applied to <italic>Leishmania</italic>: it is much more sensitive than MFA-seq, in that it examines long single DNA molecules; it provides for genome-wide analysis, which DNA combing approaches used so far in <italic>Leishmania</italic> do not; and it relies only on the detection of BrdU incorporated into sequenced DNA, thus circumventing the need for processing and enrichment to detect replicating DNA molecules.</p><p id="P29">We suggest that the use of DNAscent more accurately predicts sites of DNA replication initiation in <italic>L. major</italic> than any previous analysis, based on two broad observations. The first observation is that DNAscent confirms and extends the findings of population-level MFA-seq mapping. Most prominently, BrdU signal density in Nanopore reads, allied to DNAscent analysis of the pattern of BrdU accumulation across the genome, shows that the only loci where signal is uniformly seen in unsynchronised <italic>L. major</italic> promastigote cells correspond to a single SSR in each chromosome, overlapping with MFA-seq mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S1</xref>). In addition, HU-mediated G1/S synchronization of the cells followed by release and synchronous progression across S-phase is consistent with coordinated bidirectional replication fork movement from only these loci and with remarkable consistency of movement between chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs.1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Finally, RFD predictions suggest that DNA replication initiates from relatively discrete locations within most of these SSRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S6</xref>). These findings show that DNAscent recapitulates and improves upon MFA-seq data, validating its effectiveness, and indicate that one SSR in each chromosome is the sole site of a coordinated DNA replication initiation in promastigote cells at the onset of S-phase. No study has yet described ORC genomic localisation in the <italic>L. major genome</italic>, and so we cannot say if these early-replicating SSRs are true origins or are instead loci at which wider initiation sites (see below) are concentrated. Nonetheless, a range of data lead us to hypothesise that these early-replicating SSRs are likely to be ORC-defined origins. As we have noted before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, a significant fraction of the early-replicating SSRs in <italic>L. major</italic> are syntenic with ORC-bound origins in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Here, we show that RFD shifts within most SSRs are notably abrupt, and thus appear more comparable to the RFD shifts seen at sequence-defined origins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> than the more diffuse RFD shifts seen in human cells (either because of greater heterogeneity of origin usage or clusters of origins)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. One study has suggested these SSRs are also the locations of centromeres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, which are also found in single copy in each chromosome of <italic>T. brucei</italic> and are notably early replicating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, even when they reside in the transcriptionally-silent subtelomeres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Thus, the earliest DNA replication activation event in S-phase of these two related parasites appears to rely on so-far unexplored links with centromere function, which is consistent with BioID analysis indicating proximity of the kinetochore and ORC in <italic>L. mexicana<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>.</italic> Where the parasites appear to differ is in how they programme DNA replication across the genome and cell cycle beyond such centromere-focused origin activity: in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, every SSR binds ORC and around 25% act as origins that can be detected by MFA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>; in contrast, none of MFA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, SNS-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> or DNAscent (this study) provide evidence that SSRs are equivalent, ubiquitous sites of DNA replication initiation in <italic>L. major</italic>.</p><p id="P30">The second reason for suggesting DNAscent provides a fuller understanding of DNA replication in <italic>L. major</italic> lies in the prediction of more widespread sites of initiation that MFA-seq or any other approach used to date. Theoretical predictions suggest that the relatively small number of ORC-localised origins detected at SSRs by MFA-seq in each <italic>T. brucei</italic> chromosome is around the minimum needed to complete copying of each chromosome in S-phase, and does not provide an excess of potential back-up origins, as seen in yeast, for example<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. Here, DNAscent indicates that <italic>Leishmania</italic> uses a different strategy to complete replication of each of its chromosomes: the constitutive activation of a single putative origin early in S-phase is supplemented with the abundant use of stochastic ORIs, which are distributed across chromosomes and do not specifically localise to SSRs. The total number of such stochastic <italic>L. major</italic> ORIs is hard to determine from the available data, as such measures will depend on sequence depth. Nonetheless, as DNAscent examines DNA replication patterns on single molecules, it is somewhat comparable to single molecule combing, which previously predicted inter-origin distances in <italic>L. major</italic> of ˜70 kb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> and ˜195 kb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>; here, DNAscent predicts an inter-origin distance of ˜20 kb, which is likely to be close to the minimum detectable by fibre analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, and suggests the use of substantially larger numbers of ORIs than any previous study has suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Most likely, the combination of the sheer number of such ORIs, allied to flexibility in their localisation in the genome, precludes their detection by MFA-seq. In addition, we also find limited overlap between DNAscent and SNS-seq predictions of ORIs in <italic>L. major</italic>, which contrasts with the good correspondence between SNS-seq and Nanopore-BrdU mapping in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cells undergoing schizogony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, the abundance of stochastic ORIs in <italic>Leishmania</italic> may be truly unusual amongst single-celled eukaryotes. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, only around 10-20% of origins mapped by BrdU-Nanopore sequencing cannot be aligned with known origins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, whereas 80% of DNAscent-predicted initiation events in human cells do not match a range of origin prediction approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. Thus, it is possible that <italic>Leishmania’s</italic> abundant use of stochastic DNA replication initiation may have parallels with at least some metazoans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P31">From the available data on DNA replication, we can only speculate on the nature of the abundant, non-constitutive ORIs in <italic>L. major</italic>. It is possible that the stochastic ORIs are also designated by ORC binding, and therefore <italic>L. major</italic> has a previously unanticipated abundance of ‘true’ origins. However, ORC designation of such widely dispersed origins may be problematic for <italic>Leishmania</italic>, since in other eukaryotes ORC associates with DNA and recruits the MCM helicase in G1. As most of the DNAscent-predicted ORIs are spread throughout the PTUs of <italic>L. major</italic>, they might be predicted to present a much greater impediment to transcription than in other eukaryotes, given the ubiquitous use of polycistronic transcription. It is possible that ORC might be loaded, perhaps at the single early-replicating SSR, in G1 but is loosely bound and mobile, and so moves throughout the genome until activation of DNA replication in S-phase, which could then occur highly flexibly, wherever ORC is found. Alternatively, and has been suggested by Lombraña and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, ORC recruitment of MCM might lead to a stable pre-RC complex only at the constitutive origins, with MCM in other locations free to move away from ORC and lead to initiation. Both above suggestions are consistent with the lack of any conserved sequence features of the stochastic ORIs, and the shifts in localised base and chromatin content, as well as native transcript levels, we observe might reflect loci where the replication machinery lingers in the genome. Finally, is it possible that stochastic initiation events are ORC-independent. Such activator-independent initiation of DNA replication has been described eukaryotes but is normally only readily detected as a ‘back-up’ reaction after mutation of the activator-origin machinery, or <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. How, then, <italic>Leishmania</italic> might programme the use of both ORC-dependent and -independent reactions into the normal course of DNA replication is unclear. We have previously reported subtelomeric DNA replication in <italic>L .major</italic> that appears to not be limited to S-phase and is dependent on Rad9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, but whether this might also account for all stochastic DNA replication reactions is unclear.</p><p id="P32">Whatever the nature of the abundant, stochastic ORIs detected by DNAscent, a further question raised by this study is why <italic>Leishmania</italic> has evolved a DNA replication programme that combines use of a single, constitutive site of replication initiation per chromosome supplemented with much more abundant, stochastic ORIs. An explanation may lie in directing patterns of genome change. Here we show that SNPs accumulate at all sites of DNA replication initiation, but these are most pronounced at the single constitutive origin in each chromosome, confirming and extending our previous analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. The same effect has been observed at human origins, with patterns of mutation differing in ‘core’ and cell-type specific origins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>. <italic>Leishmania</italic> may then have evolved to spread such initiation-induced mutagenesis across the genome, rather than focusing it at a small number of sites, as this could promote adaptation. Intriguingly, recent work using MFA-seq mapping has revealed distinct levels of predicted origins in the highly transcribed core and largely untranscribed subtelomere compartments of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> genome, with the latter compartment having MFA-seq peaks and displaying notably greater instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. No work has applied DNAscent in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, and so it remains unclear if subtelomere DNA replication may rely on similar stochastic origins that are found genome-wide <italic>in L. major</italic>. Nonetheless, the data we present here provides a mechanistic link between DNA replication programming and genome plasticity in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, which may have parallels with other kinetoplastids.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Parasite culturing and BrdU labelling</title><p id="P33">Promastigotes derived from <italic>Leishmania major</italic> V9 (MHOM/IL/80/Friedlin) strain were cultured at 26 °C in HOMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum.
