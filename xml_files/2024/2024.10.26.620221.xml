While both the plant water transport system and living tissues are vulnerable to freezing, we do not know whether damage to one or both of these systems causes death in leaves exposed to freezing. Whole saplings of <italic>Liriodendron tulipifera</italic> were exposed to freezing and thawing trajectories designed to mimic natural spring freezes. We monitored the formation of freeze-thaw xylem embolism and damage to photosynthetic tissues to reveal a predictable progression of ice formation across the leaf surface that is strongly influenced by leaf vein architecture, notably the presence or absence of bundle sheath extensions. Our data also show that freeze-thaw embolism occurs only in the largest vein orders where mean vessel diameter exceeds 30μm. With evidence of both freeze-thaw embolism and damage to photosynthetic tissue, we conclude that this dual-mode lethality may be common among other wide-vesseled angiosperm-leaves, potentially playing a role in limiting geographic distributions, and show that bundle sheath extensions may stall or even prevent freezing spread.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Embolism</kwd><kwd>Fluorescence</kwd><kwd>Freezing</kwd><kwd>Freeze-thaw embolism</kwd><kwd>Leaves</kwd><kwd>Optical imaging</kwd><kwd>Spring-freezing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Freezing is one of the strongest determinants of plant distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Burke, Gusta et al. 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Loehle 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Sakai and Larcher 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Muffler, Beierkuhnlein et al. 2016</xref>), owing to the unforgiving and often lethal nature of freezing in plant tissues that are not specifically equipped to avoid, resist or compartmentalise ice crystal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Burke, Gusta et al. 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Stegner, Buchner et al. 2023</xref>).

During freezing, gas bubbles become suspended in the xylem sap as the crystallization process pushes dissolved gasses out of solution. Upon thawing, these bubbles either dissolve back into solution or expand to fill xylem conduits and block water flow depending on the pressure of the surrounding liquid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hammel 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Sperry and Sullivan 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hacke and Sauter 1996</xref>).

There are a number of possible explanations for this. Larger vessels in stems have been shown to embolise earlier than smaller vessels exposed to freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Davis, Sperry et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cavender-Bares, Cortes et al. 2005</xref>), and smaller conduits have been shown, in some cases, to freeze at higher velocity which lead to smaller air bubbles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ewers 1985</xref>) which are more easily dissolved upon thawing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Sevanto, Holbrook et al. 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Winter deciduousness allows many angiosperm trees (and some gymnosperms) to avoid leaf-level freezing damage, but does not protect spring growth, nor leaves that persist into autumn.

First, ice formation in or around the living tissues poses a significant threat because of the potential damage to cell walls and membranes leading to electrolyte leakage, damage to organelles and the generation of reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wise 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lütz 2010</xref>). Second, embolism formation resulting from the freezing and thawing of the xylem sap could lead to complete failure of the leaf vein network thereby cutting off the supply of water to downstream tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Brodribb et al. 2021</xref>).

Given that ice crystallization is often lethal in living tissues and that leaf cells are also supplied by a vascular system that is vulnerable to freeze-thaw embolism, one of the goals of the present study was to provide a detailed characterisation of ice formation in leaf tissue by visualising freezing and thawing in the leaves of intact plants using a new application of an existing method, as used in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kane and McAdam 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Here we visualise the effects of freezing and thawing on both the living cells and the xylem in young leaves in <italic>Liriodendron tulipifera</italic>, a common deciduous tree in North America. To detect possible embolism and track ice crystal formation in leaves we used a combination of time-lapse imaging and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging to non-invasively study young leaves of <italic>L. tulipifera</italic> saplings exposed to freezing conditions, with minimum air-temperatures ranging from -1 to -5 °C.

Bundle sheath extensions compartmentalise the leaf lamina restricting the movement of gases therefore allowing gas exchange to occur independently across the leaf sufrace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Neger 1918</xref>), and have been shown to have numerous physiological and biophysical functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Karabourniotis, Bornman et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zwieniecki, Brodribb et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Buckley, Sack et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Trifiló, Raimondo et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kawai, Miyoshi et al. 2017</xref>). Notably, highly sclerified BSEs have been shown to prevent the lateral prorogation of ice in the lamina in <italic>Cinnamomum camphora</italic>, yet this is the only species in which this has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hacker and Neuner 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Barbosa, Chitwood et al. 2019</xref>).

It is possible that even the non-sclerified bundle-sheath extensions in <italic>L. tulipifera</italic> could act as a barrier to the ice crystallization front as it progresses across the lamina, which led us to attempt to determine their influence in this species.</p><p id="P10">Based on the known physical processes that govern ice nucleation and growth in laminar systems that superficially resemble leaves, we expected ice to first form in leaf regions with low solute content, and therefore a higher freezing temperature, such as the midveins containing numerous xylem conduits loaded with xylem sap. Ice would then propagate outward across the lamina as temperature decreases below the freezing point of the surrounding tissues with higher solute content. Given that the BSEs represent a physical barrier that would slow the movement of water toward the ice nucleation front, we hypothesised that BSEs would significantly influence the spatial pattern and progression of ice across the lamina, which would be most noticeable in the higher order veins where BSEs span both the upper and lower epidermis leading to patchy ice-spread. We developed two possible working hypotheses for freeze-thaw embolism: First, freeze-thaw embolism would occur upon thawing in a pattern resembling embolism caused by drought, where the lower vein orders embolize first, followed by the higher order veins. Second, embolism would occur only in veins with large vessel diameters (equal to or &gt; 30 μm) based on research in stems which shows a steep increase in freeze thaw embolism in conduits above this threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Pittermann and Sperry 2006</xref>). We predicted that ice crystal formation would lead to damaged cell walls and membranes and thus irreparable damage to the mesophyll, made visible by significant decreases in chlorophyll fluorescence shortly after thawing. If freeze-thaw embolism occurred, it would lead to cell death in any remaining un-frozen tissue but over a longer time period.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P11">This study comprised three core experiments, whereby we first exposed saplings to freezing and thawing cycles while monitoring leaf vein embolism and chlorophyll fluorescence.

A total of 13 well-watered trees were frozen to one of five temperature minima (-1, -2, -3, -4 or -5 °C). We selected this range of temperatures to both determine the temperature needed to fully freeze leaves, but also to test the effects of cold temperatures that did not induce freezing. We used the Optical Vulnerability Method (OVT) of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brodribb et al.

We imaged a total of 24 leaves, each tree was frozen as described below.</p><p id="P13">Saplings growing in pots were placed in an upright freezer (Model: FFFH20F2QWC, Electrolux, Stockholm, Sweden) which was attached to a thermostat (Model: ITC-310T-B, Inkbird Tech, Shenzhen, China) which was used to control the freezing trajectory.

Briefly, a digital Raspberry Pi camera (Model: V2, 9132664; Raspberry Pi Ltd., Cambridge, UK) was positioned to observe the adaxial leaf surface and transmitted light is provided by a digitally controlled set of LED lights that only illuminate during image capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brodribb, Bienaime et al. 2016</xref>). Cameras were set to capture images every 5 minutes during freezing and thawing, a process that was programmed to occur over 20 hours (see details below). These cameras had slightly different magnifications, allowing freezing to be captured at two different scales, but the results were still comparable with no significant difference found in the embolism of percentage of freezing detected between the cameras (ANOVA p&gt; 0.05). A custom-built temperature logger ‘envirologger’ run by a data-logger (Adafruit feather M0 Adalogger; Adafruit Industries LLC; New York, USA) was placed in the freezer to track the internal conditions with a temperature/humidity sensor (Model: AM2315 12C, Adafruit Industries LLC).</p><p id="P14">The freezing sequence and trajectory were based on winter/spring temperature data from a weather station (Model: CR300; Campbell Scientific, Utah, USA) monitoring windspeed, air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, soil moisture and soil temperature, averaged hourly over the measurement period) at nearby Yale Myers Forest (Union, CT, USA; 41° 57’ 8.2944” N, 72° 7’ 26.688” W), where <italic>L. tulipifera</italic> trees are known to grow, in order to mimic the freezing conditions experienced by this species under natural conditions. A representative night in 2019 where temperatures reached -5 °C was chosen as a reference. The temperature data from Yale Myers Forest (recorded half-hourly) was averaged and rounded to the nearest whole number to determine mean hourly temperatures. These temperatures where then used to inform a 12-step programmed freezing sequence. This resulted in a stepped freezing sequence that ran for approximately 20 hours (including an ~ 6 hour period at a positive temperature at the end) mimicking an overnight freezing event (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Imaging: Chlorophyll Fluorescence</title><p id="P15">To determine the physiological effects of freezing temperatures on leaves we used chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, which measures the status of the photosynthetic apparatus and its capacity for processing light. We performed dark-adapted Fv/Fm imaging on leaves in the laboratory both before freezing and thawing to provide a baseline reference measurement, and then again after freezing and thawing to determine how much the photosystems were damaged (Mini Imaging-PAM M-series, Walz GmbH, Germany). Before fluorescence measurements, a small piece of opaque tape was applied to a small section (~ 0.5x 0.5 cm) of the leaf, then the leaves were wrapped in aluminium foil to exclude light. The patch of opaque tape was used because initial testing showed that, as removal of aluminium foil was required to align the leaf under the imaging PAM, an initial measure was needed to maintain some leaf tissue in the dark-adapted state required for Fv/Fm measurements. The tape was removed seconds before measurement to ensure that the leaf tissue beneath the tape remained fully dark adapted until fluorescence was measured.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Imaging: Freezing and thawing in the leaf mesophyll</title><p id="P16">Image sequences were processed in FIJI software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Schindelin, Arganda-Carreras et al. 2012</xref>) to determine the spread and extent of ice crystallization during the experiments.

Freezing was detected as patches of brighter pixels in the leaf lamina, typically bounded by higher order veins.</p><p id="P17">To quantify the colour change in both mesophyll tissue that did and did not freeze, circular Regions of Interest (ROIs) of 40x40 pixels were selected in regions of both mesophyll that froze and that which did not in all leaves frozen to -4 °C. The mean grey scale value in these ROIs was calculated at three time-points, at the start of image capture, at -4 °C (at freezing) and immediately after thawing. The values at -4 °C and after thawing were expressed as a percentage of the initial mean greyscale value (from the start of image capture) and the average percentage of the initial value was calculated for both frozen and unfrozen mesophyll. Mean Fv/Fm for unfrozen, frozen and thawed tissues was calculated from measurements taken across all leaves that froze.</p><p id="P18">A similar method, utilising circular ROIs in FIJI, was used to track the change in mean greyscale area in the midveins and mesophyll of all leaves which experienced freezing.

This was repeated across the image stack or up to 250 images (where more images were recorded), with the ROI shifted using ‘edit&gt;selection&gt;specify’ when the leaf moved. The ‘Interpolate ROI’s’ option through the ROI manager was then used to interpolate between the selected ROIs for all images. The ‘measure’ function was then used to calculate the mean greyscale area in the selected ROI for each image. This was then repeated for a section of mesophyll adjacent to the midvein, using an ROI of the same area. The mean greyscale values across the images were expressed as a percentage of the initial (unfrozen) mean greyscale value in order to generate lines plots of changes in mean grey scale value before, during and after freezing.</p><p id="P19">The freezing extent was calculated in the image where the maximum amount of tissue was frozen, which corresponded with the minimum air temperature to which the leaves were exposed.

Freeze-thaw embolism was analysed using the same methodology which is used to highlight drought-induced embolism with leaf images analysed via an image subtraction, where each image is subtracted from the one before to reveal the changes between the images. As there is a change in light transmission as air rapidly replaces water in the xylem due to embolism, the image subtraction reveals these changes which can then be visualised through time.

This increase in brightness can be explained by the transition in optical density of the intercellular airspaces as the air is replaced with liquid and then solid water during the freezing process. This is the same principle that underpins the Optical Vulnerability Technique (OVT) for the observation of drought-induced embolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brodribb, Bienaime et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brodribb, Carriqui et al. 2017</xref>).

Therefore, the transition from darker to lighter tissue at freezing temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kane and McAdam 2024</xref>) can likely be explained by the movement of water/ ice into previously air-filled spaces. As the refractive indexes of liquid water (1.33) and ice (1.31) are very similar, the flooded intercellular space would appear brighter even after thawing, as we saw here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).
