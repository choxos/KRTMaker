Prompted by a highly confident prediction for a biologically meaningless, scrambled repeat sequence, we assessed AF2 performance on sequences comprised perfect repeats of random sequences of different lengths. AF2 frequently folds such sequences into β-solenoids which, while ascribed high confidence, contain unusual and implausible features such as internally stacked and uncompensated charged residues. A number of sequences confidently predicted as β-solenoids are predicted by other advanced methods as intrinsically disordered. The instability of some predictions is demonstrated by Molecular Dynamics. Importantly, other Deep Learning-based structure prediction tools predict different structures or β-solenoids with much lower confidence suggesting that AF2 alone has an unreasonable tendency to predict confident but unrealistic β-solenoids for perfect repeat sequences. The potential implications for structure prediction of natural (near-)perfect sequence repeat proteins are also explored.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Accurate protein structure determination is essential for understanding biological processes and protein-related disease. Protein structures are experimentally determined mainly by protein crystallography or cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) but these approaches can be very time-consuming, with single structures sometimes taking months or even years to solve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">McPherson &amp; Gavira, 2014</xref>). For this reason, there has been great interest in methods for computational structure prediction, especially the ab initio of de novo methods that are independent of the availability of already known similar structures (templates). In 2020, at the 14th Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP14), AlphaFold2 (AF2), a deep-learning based model, was introduced by Google DeepMind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Moult <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) and was recognised as a huge step forward in prediction accuracy in the absence of templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Jumper <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). AF2 was then deployed on a large scale resulting in the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Varadi <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) which has over 214 million models.</p><p id="P3">Like previous generations of modelling software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Marks <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), accurate template-independent structure prediction with AF2 depends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Jumper <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) on the availability of a sufficiently large and diverse multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Analysis of the MSA highlights amino acid covariance i.e., which pairs of residues have co-evolved and are therefore likely to be close in 3D space in the folded structure. In addition to coordinates, AF2 produces two quality estimates. The pLDDT (predicted Local Distance Difference Test; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mariani <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>) is a per-residue local structure confidence score, ranging from 0-100, which is returned in the B-factor column of the structure. By convention, pLDDT is coloured from blue (high confidence) to red or orange (low confidence). The second measure, the PAE (Predicted Align Error), informs on global structural prediction confidence e.g., whether inter-domain orientations can be trusted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Jumper <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P4">AF2 can be utilised to explore understudied proteins and plug gaps in our protein structural knowledge. Here we apply AF2 to repeat proteins, which possess sections of repetitive sequences called tandem repeats. These repeats are very diverse, from the repetition of a single residue to hundreds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Kajava, 2012</xref>). Despite occurring in ~14% of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Marcotte <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>), they remain poorly characterised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Luo &amp; Njveen, 2014</xref>). To address this, in 2014 the database RepeatsDB was launched to automate the annotation and classification of repetitive structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Domenico <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). It recognises five classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Kajava, 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Class I consists of crystalline aggregates which have short repeat units between 1-2 residues, often associated with neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Karlin <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Class II refers to fibrous structures with repeats between 3-4 residues, for example, collagen. The most researched class, class III, are elongated structures which have repeats between 5-40 residues, consisting of solenoid and non-solenoid proteins. Class IV are ‘closed’ structures that have repeat lengths overlapping with classes III and V, but fold circularly. Finally, class V or ‘beads on a string’ structures can fold into independent stable domains, such as the DNA binding Zinc-finger domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Recently there has been increased interest in beta-solenoid (β-solenoid) proteins within class III. With repeat units between 5-30 residues, β-solenoids display repeating parallel beta strands separated by tight turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kajava &amp; Steven, 2006</xref>), but due to their vast architectural diversity, they remain largely uncharacterised. In 2023, AF2 was used to predict the structures of several new β-solenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mesdaghi <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), highlighting disease-related repeats such as functional amyloids and the <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> protein PmpD.</p><p id="P7">As mentioned, for proteins that lack templates in the Protein Data Bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Berman <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), AF2 requires a sufficiently information-rich MSA for accurate structure prediction. Thus, for singleton proteins that lack homologues, AF2 typically struggles to make confident predictions. However, surprisingly, we observed that when the repetitive sequence of human protein mucin 22 is scrambled, AF2 still predicts a confident □-solenoid. Furthermore, the model appears implausible, showing uncompensated internal stacking of glutamic acid, which is unrealistic for natural and stable protein structures due to repulsion of the negative charges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Consequently, we hypothesised that AF2 may have a bias towards predicting □-solenoids, which could affect structure prediction of natural repeat proteins, including those involved in disease. This report therefore aims to investigate this potential blind-spot.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Sequence &amp; model generation</title><p id="P8">Firstly, the ‘RANDOM’ function in Python (v3.11) was used to create random 20-residue sequences, concatenated 10 times, producing 200-residue repeat sequences.

Of the 50 models generated, 36 resulted in a β-solenoid structure but there was some redundancy in the set as some sequences differed only at single positions with others. Nevertheless, these initial models served to identify interesting factors to explore, for example, investigating how model propensity for different secondary structure influences AF2 structure prediction. One particularly concerning observation identified involved the internal stacking of negatively charged residues within the protein core. Additionally, the protein structure validation software Verify3D highlighted several models as implausible, whilst alternative deep-learning modelling methods showed contradictory outputs to AF2. To test these observations on a larger scale, 78 sets of models were generated with AF2, covering a range of repeat unit lengths. The results for this dataset are presented below.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Expanding the exploration across different repeat unit lengths</title><sec id="S14"><title>AF2 generates confident β-solenoids across different repeat unit lengths</title><p id="P19">Following generation of the larger dataset in which the repeat unit lengths were altered, for each sequence modelled, the average propensity scores for alpha and beta secondary structure were determined and the model (here model refers to the rank 1 AF2 model), was fold classified by STRPsearch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). 32 of the 78 models were classified as β-solenoids, with a few having a potential repeat region identified by STRPsearch.</p><p id="P20">Despite being random repeat sequences that lack homologues, AF2 generates many confident β-solenoid models. With regard to secondary structure propensity, it appears that there is no strong pattern, with the exception that above a beta propensity of ~1.3, there are no low-quality models. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref> highlights that high pLDDT β-solenoids were produced across the size range in 32 of 78 (41%) proteins, suggesting that the potential blind-spot observed in the preliminary exploration may extend across β-solenoids of all lengths.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Initial model observations show potentially implausible structures</title><p id="P21">Upon close examination of the β-solenoid models, it appeared that some possessed problematic features. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref> shows a confident model (pLDDT 83.5) with several hydrophobic residues located on the protein surface and obvious clashing of atoms. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref> displays another confident model (pLDDT 82.4) with aspartic acids stacked internally. Both observations are unlikely to occur within natural and stable proteins. Commonly, hydrophobic residues are found within the protein core, minimising their contact with solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Tanford, 1962</xref>), and internal negatively charged stacking is energetically unfavourable due to repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Honig &amp; Nicholls, 1995</xref>). An exception would be calcium-dependent antifreeze β-solenoid proteins, which have internal negative stacking to coordinate calcium ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Garnham <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). AF2’s confidence may therefore be explained by the fact that these structures were present in the training data, misleading its predictions. Nevertheless, this does not explain other potentially problematic observations, which reinforce the suggestion that AF2 often produces confident but unrealistic β-solenoid predictions for artificial repetitive sequences.</p><p id="P22">When analysing the 5 models for each sequence (the number corresponding to the rank), for one interesting case, models 1 and 2 differed significantly in secondary structure. Model 1 displays the β-solenoid fold (pLDDT 91.9), but model 2 appears as a long α-helix (pLDDT 87.2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Theoretically, both models may be plausible as some proteins are able to adopt multiple conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Murzin, 2008</xref>) and proteins such as the prion protein (Prp) have both a normal and pathogenic form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Prusiner, 1998</xref>), which can differ in secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Rufai <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P23">However, these radically different predictions, both confident, more likely further highlight a contradiction in AF2’s predictions.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Model validation with Verify3D highlights model implausibility</title><p id="P24">To investigate the plausibility of the β-solenoid models further, they were validated quantitatively through Verify3D. Verify3D considers residue solvent accessibility, secondary structure, and the overall environment to determine whether a protein structure is plausible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Eisenberg <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). To establish the threshold for valid protein structures, seven β-solenoid crystal structures, chosen for the near-perfection of their sequence repeats, were first analysed. For three structures, Verify3D gave a categorical fail, possibly due to the much smaller number of β-solenoid structures available in the PDB when the software was developed. Nevertheless, all seven crystal structures received an average score &gt;0.1, allowing this to be adopted as threshold for interpretation of models.</p><p id="P25">After analysing the β-solenoid models, 20 out of 32 received an average score &lt;0.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), 16 of which had a pLDDT &gt;70. This highlights that AF2 generates confident β-solenoid models despite their scoring poorly by validation tools. It was hypothesised that models with a potential repeat region identified by STRPsearch may be more similar to natural proteins, as the software uses a library, and therefore receive a higher Verify3D score. However, no trend is observed.</p><p id="P26">As the Verify3D score for each model is an average, it was considered possible that problematic features may be neutralised by more favourable ones. For instance, two models received an average Verify3D score &gt;0.1, despite having charged residues stacked internally with high pLDDT. In one model, two internal histidine stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>), and in the other, several internal charged stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>) would likely cause significant repulsion. Consequently, AF2 models with a pLDDT &gt;70, but a Verify3D score &lt;0.1 or internal charged stacking, were defined as ‘problematic’.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Alternative modelling methods show a stronger disagreement for ‘problematic’ structures</title><p id="P27">Alongside AF2, several other deep-learning protein prediction programs have been released in recent years. These include ESMFold, which uses a language model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Lin <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), and AF3, which incorporates a diffusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abramson <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). As a comparison to AF2, all 32 sequences that gave a β-solenoid prediction with AF2 were modelled with both. The TM-scores between AF2 and ESMFold models and AF2 and AF3 models were then calculated for each sequence.

This set generally have much low pLDDT values (especially in the case of ESMFold) meaning that the sequences in question give high confidence β-solenoids with AF2, but very different and low-confidence predictions with the alternative methods. These results suggest that any blind spot AF2 may have with regard to perfect repeat sequences and β- solenoids, is not shared by ESMFold and AF3.</p><p id="P29">ESMFold also often predicted disordered structures. Additionally, AF3 sometimes generated long helical structures (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>), consistent with the observation that it can ‘hallucinate’ such structure for sequence that is in fact intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abramson <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). This led to the hypothesis (tested below) that these proteins may actually be intrinsically disordered, despite AF2’s confidence in the β-solenoid fold.</p><p id="P30">Finally, the sequences were modelled with RFAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Krishna <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). For a large majority of the β-solenoid sequences, RFAA predicted a disordered structure (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that these proteins if synthesised would be disordered.

For those, ESMFold, RFAA, or both also predicted a disordered structure. This reinforces AF2’s bias surrounding β-solenoids whilst also supporting the idea that AF2 may have a tendency to confidently fold these disordered proteins into secondary structure due to their unusual repetition.

It is possible that the different database search protocols implemented by the different Deep Learning-based methods are differently susceptible to detection of false positive hits. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Figure 13</xref> illustrates another example where HHpred found a chance similarity to PF19627 (Activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox protein N-terminal) domain sequences that may have influenced the RFAA prediction but not the others.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Molecular dynamics demonstrates model instability when compared to natural proteins</title><p id="P34">To test whether the models generated with high confidence, but internally stacked charged residues are unstable, all-atom MD was implemented with GROMACS.</p><p id="P35">Within the preliminary dataset, there were two high confidence models with internally charged stacks, both of which were the same size. These models were selected for simulation along with a natural β-solenoid crystal structure (PDB: 3JX8:A), in which there is no internal charged stacking.</p><p id="P36">The results of these simulations showed that the crystal structure remained stable throughout the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Figure 14</xref>). In contrast, the models with negatively charged stacks were unstable. The model with internal glutamic acids (model 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Figure 14</xref>) became twisted during the simulation, albeit without unfolding completely: it may be that the observed aromatic stacks prevent further distortions. For the model with internal aspartic acids (model 2), the instability is even more evident with unfolding starting around the charged stack and leading to a distorted structure that is bent along the solenoid axis. The clear instability of these β-solenoid structures, recalling their high pLDDT values, again argues that AF2 has a blind sport with regard to some sequence repeat structures.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>β-solenoid bias may impact structure prediction of natural repeat proteins</title><p id="P37">As highlighted throughout this report, AF2 seems to have blind-spot surrounding β-solenoids when given random but ‘perfect’ repeat sequences. This has been demonstrated by the appearance of implausible features such as stacked charged residues, and quantified with Verify3D, which highlights model unfavourability despite AF2’s confidence. Additionally, when modelling the sequences with alternative modelling methods, a clear disagreement in confidence (and sometimes in fold prediction) reinforces this hypothesis. To test whether this bias towards β-solenoids is likely to influence prediction of natural proteins (some of which contain very near-perfect sequence repeats) we asked if the same pattern of higher pLDDT from AF2 compared to other methods was observed for these.</p><p id="P38">Accordingly, the sequences of Pfam families that AF2 had confidently predicted as possessing the β-solenoid fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mesdaghi <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>), were modelled with the alternative deep-learning methods. For families PF07634, PF07012, PF02415, and PF01469, all four methods agreed structurally and in pLDDT, highlighting that these models are likely accurate. In each of these families the sequence repeats have diverged significantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Attention was then switched to near-perfect natural repeat sequences that may be influenced by this bias.</p><p id="P39">As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mesdaghi <italic>et al</italic>., (2023)</xref> show, AF2 predicts the human mucin proteins to adopt the β-solenoid fold with confidence. The sequence of mucin 1 in particular, closely resembles the artificial sequences in this study, consisting of an exact repetition of a 20-residue sequence twelve times. Despite this, AF2’s confidence is low. Mucin 22 on the other hand is less ‘perfect’, but AF2 predicts the β-solenoid fold with confidence. When modelling the whole protein in AF3, the confidence is lower, suggesting that this prediction may be problematic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Figure 15a, 15b</xref>).</p><p id="P40">Another pattern observed within this study was ESMFold and RFAA predicting disordered structures. Due to size constraints of ESMFold and RFAA, a fragment of mucin 22 (residues 185-433) was modelled for further comparison. Both AF2 and AF3 generated a β-solenoid model with confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Figure 15c, 15e</xref>); however, both ESMFold and RFAA predict a more disordered structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Figure 15d, 15f</xref>). This suggests that this blind-spot has impacted this protein’s structure prediction, which should therefore be considered with scepticism.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Conclusions &amp; further studies</title><p id="P41">The emergence of AlphaFold 2 provoked an earthquake in protein structure prediction, offering the capacity to model most proteins to unprecedented accuracy. Nevertheless, as with any new tool, it is important to consider its strengths and weaknesses and recent work has described its relatively poor performance on predicting coiled-coil protein topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Madaj <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) as well as a perceived blind-spot with regard to fold-switching proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Chakravarty <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Evidence presented here suggests that AF2 has an unreasonable propensity to fold perfect sequence repeat proteins into β-solenoid structures, many of which – despite containing unusual and unstable features – it assigns high pLDDT values to.</p><p id="P42">The evidence for an AF2 blind-spot regarding β-solenoids is that more than 40% of random repeat sequences over a range of lengths fold that way, a large majority with average pLDDT &gt;= 70 (moderate confidence) and several with pLDDT &gt;90 (very high confidence). In some cases, there are inconsistences within AF2’s sets of five predictions – sequences that highly confidently predict as a β-solenoid in one model, but a similarly confident α-helix in another. And the models themselves contain features – external hydrophobic stacks and, particularly, internal charged stacks – that are rarely observed in experimental protein structures. These peculiarities are detected, to some extent, by the structure validation tool Verify3D which assesses protein structural viability by considering the secondary structure-aware environments different amino-acids. The internal charged stacks are demonstrated to lead to structural instability by Molecular Dynamics simulations. A quarter of sequences folded by AF2 into β-solenoids, all but one of moderate confidence or above, had mean intrinsic disorder scores from AIUPred of ~0.5 or above suggesting that these sequences were in fact unlikely to have defined 3D folds. Finally, and importantly, alternative Deep Learning-based structure prediction tools, AF3, ESMFold and RFAA all behaved quite differently. Frequently, they produced quite different structure predictions but even when they did agree with the β-solenoid predicted by AF2 their confidence was much lower. Thus, only AF2 has the twin concern of implausible structure predictions combined with high confidence estimates.</p><p id="P43">These findings raise questions as to why AF2, but not other tools, exhibits this apparent blind spot. It is particularly interesting to compare the unreasonable internal stacking of charged residues in many models with the observation that AF2 is considered to have effectively learned an energy function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Roney &amp; Ovchinnikov, 2022</xref>). Conceivably, the explanation lies, as mentioned, with the internal calcium binding sites observed in some β-solenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Garnham <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) at which the charge of acidic residues is compensated by the bound ion. Even though the models discussed here contain no positions resembling natural metal binding sites, AF2 might have learned that stacked acidic residues are acceptable in the context of the β-solenoid fold. Ultimately, the welcome and impressive ability of AF2 to accurately model ligand binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Jumper <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), even though the ligands are absent from its calculations, may come at a price.</p><p id="P44">Another factor to consider is the potential for the randomly generated repeat sequences to accidentally resemble natural repeat proteins or known structures in general. The modelling methods used here differ in their approaches to capture known sequence-structure relationships, with AF3, for example, using a simpler procedure than AF2 to search for homologous sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abramson <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). However, chance resemblance to natural sequences and structures, revealed by HHPred analysis, appears to explain only a small part of the story: indeed, in the case of Pfam family PF13599 and its structure 6ZT4, only AF3 and RFAA models closely resembled the experimental structure.</p><p id="P45">Evidence from some natural repeat protein families suggests that the bias towards β-solenoids may only be consequential for repeat sequences that are (near-)perfect. Future work could explore whether this bias affects more imperfect sequences. For example, for the sequences in this study, each rung of the solenoid could be mutated randomly to disrupt their ‘perfection’ and the same methods applied, although whether this would meaningfully mimic the process by which repeat proteins become less perfect, post-duplication is open to debate. It would also be interesting to follow up this work with perfect repeat sequences that better followed natural amino-acid abundance rather than, as here, representing each amino-acid with equal frequency. Ultimately, experimental validation of β-solenoids predicted for natural proteins will be required for any confidence that the AF2 blind spot around β-solenoids affects only theoretical, perfect repeats.</p><p id="P46">Despite the fully justified excitement around AF2 and following structure prediction tools, it remains important to fully understand their strengths, weakness and quirks; particularly so since, like many Deep Learning-based tools, they have limited interpretability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Tan &amp; Zhang, 2023</xref>). Exercises focused on performance against specific fold types, especially those that might be under-represented in training sets, are therefore important for each new tool that emerges (eg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wojciechowska <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). As computed structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Varadi <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Steinegger <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>) become as broadly available as experimental structures, this validation is more important than ever: only when all limitations and biases are comprehensively understood, can computational methods illuminate all uncharted areas of the protein universe.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS199807-supplement-Supplementary_Material.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d95aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Funding</title><p>This research was supported by a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) PhD studentship to RP and by CCP4 collaborative framework funding for AJS.
