The timing of implementation of preventive measures is crucial, but as outbreaks are hard to anticipate, control efforts often start too late. The use of resilience indicators to anticipate infectious disease outbreaks has attracted attention in the past decade: they are generic, model-free indicators used to anticipate critical transitions in complex systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). These indicators typically rely on the theory of critical slowing down, stating that a system approaching a critical transition, such as the start of an epidemic, loses its resilience and recovers slower from external perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). In the context of infectious diseases, this translates into a longer time for minor outbreaks to resolve. This slow behaviour can be observed in trends of so-called resilience indicators, namely autocorrelation and variance. Such trends are usually calculated in the incidence time series using a rolling window. Resilience indicators have proven to be able to anticipate upcoming epidemics up to several months in advance for infectious diseases, including mosquito-borne diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). However, the large data requirements limit their use in practice.</p><p id="P5">Surveillance of multi-host diseases is challenging to achieve, as many, sometimes unknown, species can participate in the transmission, which leaves choices on which sources to sample from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). This is the case for West Nile virus for instance: the transmission burden can be monitored in mosquito pools by estimating the proportion of infected mosquitoes or the proportion of infected pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), but also by monitoring infections in humans, livestock, or wildlife through public health and veterinary surveillance systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Choices then must be made on where to direct sampling efforts. Collecting data from multiple sources would either increase the sampling costs and efforts, or reduce the quality or sampling frequency of each data source. Contrarily, focusing on one single data source enables the relevant authorities to concentrate all their efforts on sampling one source meticulously, but the information contained in other sources may be missed. Additionally, when several species act as enzootic hosts and react differently to the disease, one can wonder which species is the most informative for early warnings of future outbreaks.</p><p id="P6">When data from multiple sources are available, the information they contain can be combined to calculate multivariate indicators of resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Previous research showed that multivariate indicators signal upcoming critical transitions in the same way univariate resilience indicators do, using simulated plant-pollinator data with a generic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). These multivariate indicators rely on data reduction techniques to combine multiple data streams, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Maximum Autocorrelation Factors (MAF). Common resilience indicators such as autocorrelation and variance are then computed in the obtained combined time series. Similar multivariate indicators have been investigated in simulated incidence time series of metapopulation models and could signal upcoming epidemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). However, they have not been compared to univariate indicators. As multivariate indicators require a greater monitoring effort, researching the best monitoring strategy would be of use to inform monitoring practices.</p><p id="P7">That question is not limited to infectious disease outbreaks: anticipating critical transitions in multivariate systems is relevant for a diversity of research areas, such as ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) or finance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). In many complex systems, several entities interact, leaving choices on where to direct monitoring efforts. These entities can interact heterogeneously via complex networks, and the interactions between such entities are not always well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Additionally, some entities seemingly affecting the dynamics of the system more directly are not always the easiest to monitor. For instance, food webs or ecosystems that are nearing collapse often contain many interacting species, for which central endangered species are not always easy to monitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Previous research showed that some species can display more reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) and earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) signals using resilience indicators as early warning, but this has not been studied in epidemiology. Additionally, the prediction performance of multivariate and univariate indicators has never been compared.</p><p id="P8">West Nile virus (WNV) is a relevant example of a multi-host, vector-borne disease (VBD). WNV is transmitted between birds and mosquitoes, constituting the enzootic cycle. Humans and horses can get infected but do not transmit the virus onwards and are thus considered dead-end hosts. While human and horse cases can seem easy to monitor via public health and veterinary authorities, the small proportion of symptomatic cases results in low reporting probabilities ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). On the other hand, monitoring wild birds is often done by collecting and analyzing dead birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Monitoring live birds is also possible but requires a greater effort as they must be caught and sampled by bird ringers or citizen scientists, e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), and is thus more costly than sampling dead birds. Furthermore, the species contributing to the transmission of VBDs like WNV are not all known. Sometimes an unknown, hidden (i.e. not dying from the disease) reservoir can be central to the transmission dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Infected mosquito pools can be monitored via traps, but estimating the prevalence of WNV in mosquitoes is complicated by logistic and cost limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Finally, as the transmission is dependent on the ecosystem setting, such as the abundance of the different hosts and vectors as well as vector feeding preferences, changes in ecosystems can impact the transmission if, e.g., several host species or vector species compete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), making the task of identifying which species contribute most to transmission complex and context-specific. It is then relevant to know how to identify informative data sources to direct sampling efforts to anticipate future WNV outbreaks.</p><p id="P9">In the present study, we compare multivariate and univariate indicators of resilience under different monitoring scenarios as an early warning for upcoming epidemics of vector-borne diseases. We use WNV as a case study, as it affects multiple host and vector species, and can be monitored in numerous ways. A synthetic dataset is generated using a simple, well-studied WNV model. We explore several monitoring scenarios focusing on different data types, including data-poor scenarios with low reporting probability or resolution, and try to identify what makes a species more or less informative for early warnings.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S6"><title>Model</title><p id="P10">We used a well-known compartmental Ross Macdonald model of WNV for which the dynamics are well-studied. The model is adapted from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), and is used to generate time series. Our model considers the vector population and four host populations: two generic bird species acting as amplifying hosts, and humans and horses acting as dead-end hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). The two bird species differ in how they are affected by the disease. Bird species V is a visible, i.e. detectable, reservoir for the disease: 30% of the infected individuals die from infection (as can be the case for corvids, for instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>)). Bird species H is a hidden reservoir: it is preferred by mosquitoes but it does not die from infection, hence complicating the detection of transmission in this species through dead bird surveillance.</p><p id="P11">The mosquito population was subdivided into susceptible mosquitoes <italic>M<sub>S</sub></italic>, exposed mosquitoes <italic>M<sub>E</sub></italic>, and infectious mosquitoes <italic>M<sub>I</sub></italic>.

Additionally, we introduced biting preference coefficients <italic>p<sub>i</sub></italic> for each host species: bird H was the preferred host, followed by bird V, and humans and horses. We assumed that infected mosquitoes do not recover from the infection and that they are not affected by an additional disease-induced death rate.

R<sub>0</sub> was calculated using the Next Generation Matrix (NGM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary material, section Model details</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), and the biting rate values were chosen to obtain the desired R<sub>0</sub> values in the simulations described below. Five infectious individuals were introduced in the disease-free population at <italic>t=5</italic>, and the recovery time to the disease-free equilibrium (i.e. the absence of infectious individuals) was calculated based on the exponential decay of infectious individuals after the perturbation. The slope of a linear regression between the log number of infectious individuals and time with a fixed intercept was used to calculate the decay rate. The reciprocal of this number is the recovery time from a perturbation. We performed these experiments for both birds and mosquitoes.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Data simulations</title><p id="P15">For our analyses, we assumed that mosquito incidence, bird incidence and seroprevalence, human incidence and seroprevalence, and horse incidence and seroprevalence could be monitored, initially with high precision.</p><p id="P16">The biting rate varied over time to alter the R<sub>0</sub> and, thus, the resilience of the system. The biting rate is known to be influenced by temperature, which mimics a simplified representation of the emergence of WNV due to increasingly suitable climatic conditions (Paz &amp; Semenza, 2013). Other parameters affected by the temperature, such as the extrinsic incubation period or mosquito birth and death rates, are kept fixed to avoid interactions between the parameters obscuring the dynamics of emergence, and thus our understanding of the indicators. For the same reasons, seasonal fluctuations were omitted.</p><p id="P17">We simulated an approaching epidemic due to increasingly suitable conditions in single long runs, with the biting rate increasing slowly over time. These so-called “emergence time series” were used to measure the performance of the indicators as an early warning for upcoming epidemics. In these time series, R<sub>0</sub> gradually increased from 0.7 to 1 over 428 weeks with a weekly resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). As a control, we simulated “stable time series” under the assumption of a fixed R<sub>0</sub> over time, leading to no major outbreaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). We used R<sub>0</sub>=0.8 for that scenario. We simulated 100 stochastic repetitions for each R<sub>0</sub> condition.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Monitoring scenarios</title><p id="P18">We considered 10 data sources to be used in our early-warning signals: mosquito, bird species V, bird species H, human and horse incidence time series represented by model states M<sub>I</sub>, B<sub>VI</sub>, B<sub>HI</sub>, H<sub>I</sub> and E<sub>I</sub>, bird, human and horse seroprevalence time series represented by the states B<sub>VR</sub>, B<sub>HR</sub>, H<sub>R</sub> and E<sub>R</sub> as well as time series of dead birds species V represented by the state <italic>B<sub>VD</sub></italic>. We considered these time series individually to evaluate the performance of univariate resilience indicators. For multivariate indicators, three scenarios representing different data combinations were created. Scenario A represents an anthro-equine scenario, where all human and horse data (incidence and seroprevalence) are being collected (H<sub>I</sub>, E<sub>I</sub>, H<sub>R</sub>, E<sub>R</sub>). Scenario B represents a wildlife scenario where all mosquito and visible (i.e. detectable) bird data (incidence, seroprevalence and deaths) are being collected (M<sub>I</sub>, B<sub>VI</sub>, B<sub>VR</sub>, B<sub>VD</sub>). Finally, scenario C represents a hidden bird species investigation where the hidden bird species data is collected along with mosquito data (M<sub>I</sub>, B<sub>HI</sub>, B<sub>HR</sub>).</p><p id="P19">To try to identify what affects the prediction performance of a given species, we vary the feeding preference coefficient, affecting how much each species gets infected by a typical infectious individual. We generated time series of the model with six values for the feeding preference coefficient of mosquitoes towards bird species H. The feeding preference coefficient towards bird H is chosen as it has a direct, large effect on how much all the species get bitten by mosquitoes, and thus can get infected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary material, Fig S12</xref>). Additionally, it allows to explore how potential hidden reservoirs could obscure early-warning signals. For each feeding preference scenario, we quantified how much each species gets infected by a typical infectious individual, called the <italic>typical infection coefficient</italic> in the rest of this manuscript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S12</xref>). To estimate the <italic>typical infection coefficient,</italic> we used the corresponding coefficient in the eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue of the NGM (Supplementary material, Section model details). In the default emergence time series, bird H is preferred by the mosquitoes with a coefficient p<sub>BH</sub>=10,against p<sub>BV</sub>=5 for bird V, and p<sub>E</sub>=p<sub>H</sub>=1 for horses and humans. Additionally, we generated time series with p<sub>BH</sub>=5, 20, 30, 50, and 80. For each simulation, we adapted the range of values for the biting rate to keep a range of R<sub>0</sub> going from 0.7 to 1 for the emergence time series and R<sub>0</sub>=0.8 for the stable time series.</p><p id="P20">To investigate the limitations of resilience indicators as an early warning sign for upcoming epidemics in data-poor scenarios, we explored the effect of two additional complexities: (a) reduced resolution, and (b) reduced observation probability. For (a), the data were down-sampled from the full emergence time series by reducing the resolution. Thus, the R<sub>0</sub> gradient remains unchanged, but the number of data points decreases. Secondly, (b) was explored using the full emergence time series. For each data point, observation noise was added using a Poisson distribution of expectation <italic>λ=number of observations</italic> for that time step for that variable. To reproduce imperfect observations, we defined three observation probabilities: <italic>p<sub>1</sub></italic> = 0.1, <italic>p<sub>2</sub></italic>=0.01, and p<sub>3</sub>=0.001. Imperfect observations were then generated for each data point using a Poisson distribution of expectation <italic>λ=p<sub>i</sub> x number of observations.</italic></p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Resilience indicators</title><p id="P21">After detrending the emergence time series using a Gaussian kernel with the optimal bandwidth according to (Bowman &amp; Azzalini 1997), we analyzed the residuals to calculate the indicators of resilience over time. A rolling window of 50% of the size of the time series was used to assess the trends in the indicators over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). We then evaluated the strength of the trend in the indicators over time using the Kendall tau correlation. We used an implementation of the indicators in Matlab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We used a subset of the multivariate indicators described in Weinans et al. (2021).These indicators rely on different techniques to combine multiple time series. Some indicators use the maximum or average of a univariate indicator among all time series. For instance, the maximum variance (Max Var) and maximum autocorrelation (Max AR) calculate the variance (resp. autocorrelation) for all variables but keep only the maximum value of variance (resp. autocorrelation) for each window. Similarly, the mean variance (mean var) and mean autocorrelation (mean AR) take the mean of variance (resp. autocorrelation) over all variables for each window. The maximum covariance (max cov) is the maximum coefficient of the covariance matrix, and the mean cross-correlation (max abscorr) is the mean of all the absolute correlations between the variables. Furthermore, two more elaborate data reduction techniques were used to combine all the time series (PCA and MAF). PCA indicators were calculated in time series of the system projected in the direction of highest variance, corresponding to the first component of a principal component analysis. The variance (PCA var) and autocorrelation (degenerate fingerprinting, Deg Finger) were then calculated in the projected time series. Similarly, the direction of highest autocorrelation was identified using an MAF analysis (Max Autocorrelation Factor analysis, see Supporting Information) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). The minimum eigenvalue of the MAF analysis (MAF eig) was calculated for each window, and variance (MAF var) and autocorrelation (MAF AR) were calculated for the projected time series. We compared the performance of these multivariate indicators with the most common univariate indicators, namely autocorrelation and variance of each single time series.</p><p id="P23">We quantified the indicators’ performance as early-warning signals using ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves. Emergence time series with both R<sub>0</sub> conditions (increasing R<sub>0</sub> leading to an epidemic and fixed R<sub>0</sub> with no upcoming epidemic) were used to calculate the true positive and true negative rate for different cut-off values of the Kendall tau. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) was used to estimate the prediction performance of the different indicators under different data scenarios.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S12"><title>Perturbation recovery experiments</title><p id="P24">To investigate the presence of critical slowing down in the model, perturbation recovery experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>) were performed by introducing infectious birds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A, 2B</xref>) and mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>) to disturb the disease-free equilibrium. In both cases, the recovery time increased as R<sub>0</sub> approached the critical threshold, indicating a loss of resilience as the system approaches suitable conditions for an epidemic to spark.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Performance of the indicators as an early warning for upcoming epidemics</title><p id="P25">The Area Under the ROC Curve was used as a measure of the performance of the different indicators and scenarios, as it considers both the true positive rate (ability to correctly predict an upcoming epidemic) and the true negative rate (ability to predict that no upcoming epidemic is approaching). For univariate time series, we measured the performance for each time series and univariate indicator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). For multivariate time series, we measured the prediction performance for each monitoring scenario and multivariate indicator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B, 3C and 3D</xref>). The performance of univariate indicators ranges between 0.68 (Horse seroprevalence with autocorrelation) and 0.88 (Human incidence with variance). The performance of multivariate indicators ranges between 0.56 (Wildlife scenario with explained variance) and 0.94 (Hidden reservoir scenario with mean variance). Although the Hidden reservoir scenario yielded the best prediction performance across all indicators, there were no meaningful differences between the average prediction performance of the different multivariate scenarios. Interestingly, the difference in average prediction performance between the univariate indicators and the multivariate ones was only 0.02 (AUC of 0.79 for univariate indicators and 0.81 for multivariate, average across all scenarios and indicators), especially considering that multivariate indicators use up to four times more data points than the univariate ones, which requires a greater monitoring effort.</p><p id="P26">Variance and variance-based indicators outperformed autocorrelation and autocorrelation-based indicators for both univariate and multivariate monitoring scenarios. For univariate time series, variance yielded an average AUC of 0.86 over all the time series, against an average AUC of 0.73 for autocorrelation. Similarly, for multivariate indicators, variance-based indicators yielded an average AUC of 0.86 against an average AUC of 0.76 for autocorrelation-based indicators, and the three best-performing multivariate indicators were variance-based (mean variance, PCA variance and max variance). Due to the scarcity of cases far from the epidemic threshold, the time series contained long stretches of consecutive zeros, resulting in a highly variable autocorrelation, which altered the performance of autocorrelation and autocorrelation-based indicators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1 to S3</xref>).</p><p id="P27">For the rest of the analyses, we proceeded with the three best-performing indicators (variance for univariate indicators, and mean variance, PCA variance and maximum variance for multivariate indicators), the best multivariate scenario (hidden reservoir), and the best univariate time series (mosquito incidence, bird H incidence, seroprevalence, and humans prevalence).

A variation in the mosquito feeding preference towards bird H impacts the <italic>typical infection coefficient</italic> of all the species, i.e. how much they get infected, quantified using the corresponding value in the eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue of the NGM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S12</xref>). When the feeding preference towards bird H increased, the prediction performance slightly decreased for univariate indicators uniformly for all species. However, it remained stable for variance-based multivariate indicators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>, other scenarios and indicators in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material, Fig S13 to S16</xref>). Additionally, the prediction performance of the different univariate time series was unrelated to the <italic>typical infection coefficient</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>, other scenarios and indicators in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material, Fig S17</xref>). These results were robust to a reduced observation probability and resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material, Fig S18 and S19</xref>). Additionally, to make sure that the choice of the varying parameter does not impact the result, the same analyses were repeated by varying the relative abundances of bird H to bird V instead of the feeding preference. These analyses yielded analogous results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Material, Fig S20 to S25</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">Using a synthetic dataset, we found that both univariate and multivariate resilience indicators could signal upcoming outbreaks of WNV. Multivariate indicators outperformed univariate indicators, especially in data-poor scenarios. The accuracy of multivariate indicators ranged up to 0.94, and those of univariate indicators up to 0.88, assuming perfect observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>). When reducing the resolution or the observation probability, the difference in prediction performance between univariate and multivariate indicators broadened, suggesting that multivariate indicators are more robust to a decrease in the data quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). However, multivariate indicators require up to four times more data points as several hosts have to be monitored simultaneously. This study was the first to compare multivariate and univariate indicators, and the findings could have important implications for the surveillance of vector-borne diseases. As the model was kept purposefully generic, these results can be extended to other vector-borne diseases. However, future research should confirm the findings in data, including more complexities such as seasonality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) or complex observation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), as well as cost estimations and logistic ramifications of the different monitoring strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p id="P31">The prediction performance of the different multivariate monitoring scenarios, as well as univariate time series, remained stable regardless of how much a species is involved in the transmission cycle. Noticeably, increasing the mosquito feeding preference towards a given species or the relative abundances of the different species did not increase the potential for that species to signal upcoming outbreaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). Thus, the variability in the prediction performance of the different monitoring scenarios could not be explained by the typical infection coefficient, namely how much a species gets infected by a typical infectious individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>). In contrast to earlier findings, in this system, we found no evidence that species that are central to the transmission cycle are more informative for early warning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). A possible explanation could be the relatively high spillover rate to dead-end species assumed in the model, which is not always observed in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Additional research is needed to better understand what drives how informative a data source is in anticipating future disease outbreaks using resilience indicators. Answering this question is especially relevant for the surveillance of various infectious diseases, especially when silent transmission is ongoing in hidden reservoirs that are hard to monitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Variance-based indicators outperformed autocorrelation-based indicators and remained robust in data-poor contexts. This is consistent with previous studies that identified variance or related indicators as the best-performing indicators when researching the performance of resilience indicators to anticipate epidemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). In the present study, the poor performance of autocorrelation-based indicators was likely due to the excess of zeros, mainly when R0 is far from the critical threshold, leading to a high autocorrelation and thus obscuring the overall trend in autocorrelation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1 to S3</xref>). Additionally, the performance of autocorrelation-based indicators decreased when the resolution of the time series was reduced, in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4 to S6</xref>). Multivariate variance-based indicators of resilience showed stable performance, even when reducing the resolution of time series or the observation probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). This was especially true for indicators using the average of univariate indicators, consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Contrastingly, explained variance performed particularly poorly, probably because of the reactivity of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). As data requirements are a major factor limiting the use of resilience indicators in practice, multivariate indicators hold potential to improve the performance of resilience indicators as an early warning of upcoming epidemics using fewer data.</p><p id="P33">This study was limited to synthetic data. The model was purposefully kept simple to ensure the genericity of the results. The emergence of the virus was driven by biting rates increasing in response to increasing temperature. However, temperature has an impact on other parameters, such as mosquito population dynamics parameters and the extrinsic incubation period. However, resilience indicators are found to be robust to the choice of bifurcation parameter as long as the change is gradual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Further, seasonal fluctuations were omitted. Previous research with univariate indicators found a limited impact of periodicity on the prediction performance of resilience indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), which is likely to hold for multivariate indicators. Although indicators of resilience loss hold potential to improve the current practice of early warning for vector-borne diseases, these findings should be confirmed in datasets generated with complex models, but also real data specific to a certain pathogen.</p><p id="P34">Finally, multivariate indicators require sampling of many data sources simultaneously. This is complicated by cost and logistic limitations, but also coordination of the various authorities. The different data sources are often monitored by different institutions, such as public health authorities for human cases, veterinary authorities for domestic animals, and environmental authorities for wildlife. Coordinating the monitoring of different authorities and sharing data between the different institutions is sometimes challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Additionally, costs and logistics limit the monitoring of wild birds and mosquitoes, and it is thus impossible to cover a whole, often heterogeneous area. This was omitted in the model, which assumed homogeneous mixing as well as homogeneous spatial coverage of wildlife data. In the case of spatial disparities in transmission, it is essential to consider high-risk zones when choosing where to execute the monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). For instance, West Nile transmission can be affected by the local ecological context, such as the availability and abundance of different (competent and non-competent) hosts and vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), leading to spatial heterogeneities in transmission potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Finally, some data sources studied here inherently contain biases that were not accounted for in the model. The model assumed that the number of infected mosquitoes was reported over time. In practice, the number of infected mosquito pools is usually reported, reflecting the presence or absence of infected mosquitoes in a given area and not the number of infected mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Seroprevalence data is primarily informative about the past state of infection and could introduce biases if not sampled at regular intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Additionally, when multiple similar pathogens are circulating simultaneously, antibodies targeting one pathogen may also react to a different, similar pathogen in tested individuals. This phenomenon, called cross-reactivity, can lead to a non-random overestimation of seroprevalence in areas where several pathogens are co-circulating. The dynamics of the co-circulating pathogen could be captured in the seroprevalence data, potentially introducing biases when measuring resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Infected mosquito pools and seroprevalence data should thus be used with caution. While multivariate indicators have the potential to solve the challenge of large data requirements by monitoring several data sources instead of focusing on one sole source of information, many considerations remain in designing adapted surveillance programs. The final decision should be based on the specific challenges of a given area and pathogen, as well as whether the additional effort is worth the gain in prediction performance.</p></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P35">This study was the first to show that multivariate indicators of resilience outperform univariate indicators in anticipating future outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases, especially in data-poor contexts. As high granularity and quality of required data limit the use of resilience indicators in infectious disease epidemiology in practice, multivariate indicators hold the potential to improve the prediction performance of resilience indicators while dealing with data-poor contexts. However, adapting the surveillance programs to collect the relevant data for multivariate indicators of resilience entails new challenges related to costs, logistic ramifications and coordination of different institutions involved in surveillance. Ultimately, the aim is to inform effective monitoring strategies, and this study represents an initial step towards that objective.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS201853-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d137aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Marten Scheffer for the insightful discussions, his help with interpreting the results, and his contribution to the funding acquisition.

summary</title></caption><p>Vector-borne diseases (VBD) represent a significant proportion of infectious diseases and are expanding their range every year because of among other things climate change and increasing urbanization. Successful interventions against the spread of VBD requires anticipation. Resilience indicators are a generic, model-free approach to anticipate critical transitions including disease outbreaks, however the large data requirements limit their use in practice. Since the transmission of VBD involves several species interacting with one another, which can be monitored as different data sources. The information contained by these different data sources can be combined to calculate multivariate indicators of resilience, allowing a reduction of the data requirements compared to univariate indicators relying solely on one data source. We found that such multivariate indicators outperformed univariate indicators in data-poor contexts. Multivariate indicators could be used to anticipate not only VBD outbreaks but also other transitions in complex systems such as ecosystems’ collapse or episodes of chronic diseases. Adapting the surveillance programs to collect the relevant data for multivariate indicators of resilience entails new challenges related to costs, logistic ramifications and coordination of different institutions involved in surveillance.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>WNV model and simulated data</title><p>(A) WNV compartmental model used in the analyses.
