When digesting the cell wall, plant protoplasts form spherical shapes, further consolidating this model. Here we challenge this apparent opposition between animal and plant cells. We show that plant protoplasts can form protrusions. More precisely, using plasma membrane markers, we reveal that 27 ± 1% of the protoplasts show dot-like protrusions and 16 ± 7% of protoplasts show long (typically 1-20 μm, up to 200 μm) protrusions that we name “filopods”. We demonstrate that this behavior is independent of the plant species, the membrane marker or the osmolyte. Protrusions can host large and long structures, such as microtubule bundles, which in turn can impact the mechanical behavior of the protrusions. We find that filopods can form <italic>de novo</italic> when increasing osmolarity, that they most likely move passively, and that they can attach to artificial surfaces. Altogether, these observations show that forming and retaining protrusions is not exclusive to animal cells. This calls for revisiting the dynamics and probing ability of the plant cell cortex in different osmotic and mechanical environments.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">From a biophysical standpoint, plant cells can be caricatured as passive “bags of membrane”, pressed against a rigid cell wall by turgor pressure. Indeed, turgor pressure would burst the plasma membrane in the absence of the load-bearing cell wall. In contrast, animal cells do not have a cell wall and are mainly shaped by a cytoskeletal cell cortex that can actively deform the membrane, e.g. forming protrusions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Yet, plant cells can also form protrusions. Indeed, when plants are exposed to a hyperosmotic environment, turgor pressure is released, water leaves the cell, and the protoplast (i.e. the cell without its wall) retracts from the cell wall in a process called plasmolysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. During this process, the plasma membrane stays connected to the cell wall via the Hechtian structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), comprised of membranous tubes called Hechtian strands, a network-like structure close to the cell wall called the Hechtian reticulum, and discrete points connecting the plasma membrane to the cell wall, called Hechtian attachment sites. These protrusions appear as a consequence of pre-attachment sites on the wall and do not imply an autonomous ability of plant protoplasts to generate protrusions. This is what we explore here.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Protoplasts robustly form protrusions</title><p id="P3">When releasing the cell wall by digestion in a hyperosmotic buffer solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>), smooth protoplasts are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). Taking a closer look at Arabidopsis protoplasts from whole seedlings using a plasma membrane marker line, we discovered that, to our surprise, many protoplasts exhibited membrane-encased protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,d,e</xref>). These took either the form of short, round protrusions that we named “dots” (27 ± 1% of all alive protoplasts, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>) or of long, thin protrusions that we termed “filopods” (16 ± 7% of all alive protoplasts, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>), as their shape recalls the shape of filopodia observed in animal cells. Typically, dots had a diameter between 0.5 and 3 μm and filopods had lengths between 1 and 20 μm. The longest filopods we could observe were up to 210 μm long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P4">We observed both kinds of protrusions in protoplast suspensions contained in custom made polymer (NOA73) containers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-e</xref>), NOA73 microwells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-d</xref>) as well as between a glass slide and cover slip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). Furthermore, protrusions were also observed when using sorbitol instead of mannitol as an osmolyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). Last, beyond <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-f</xref>), protrusions were readily observed in protoplasts obtained from the bryophyte <italic>Physcomitrium patens</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>) as well as the monocotyledon <italic>Zea mays</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>), when stained with the lipophilic dye FM4-64. Incidentally, this also shows that the formation of protrusions is independent from the fluorescent marker.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Protrusions originate from the plasma membrane of living protoplasts</title><p id="P5">Surprised by this observation, we wondered whether the protrusions were a sign of cell death. In order to test for protoplast viability, we used vital stains. To image the same protoplasts before and after staining, protoplasts were contained in microwells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. We used two different vital stains with different mechanisms of action. Fluorescein diacetate readily crosses the plasma membrane and is cleaved inside the cytosol of alive cells, releasing the brightly fluorescent fluorescein, that is retained inside alive cells. Fluorescence inside of protoplasts with filopods confirmed their viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). On the other hand, Evans blue does not penetrate the plasma membrane of live cells. While we observed dead protoplasts containing Evans blue staining, protoplasts with protrusions did not show Evans blue staining, again confirming their viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). These data show that protoplasts with protrusions are alive.</p><p id="P6">To further test protoplast viability, we analyzed their long-term behavior by following all three categories of protoplasts – smooth protoplasts, protoplasts with dots, and protoplasts with filopods - over a time course of 12 hours, taking an image once per hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, showing images every 4h). Analyzing the category filopods, we noticed that filopods can be retracted over time or, in very rare cases, emerge over time. The majority of protoplasts was viable over ≥12 h, and there was no major difference in viability between the three protoplast categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). We thus conclude that protoplasts with protrusions are not more likely to die than smooth protoplasts and thus, that protrusions are not related to cell death.</p><p id="P7">Next, we hypothesized that the protrusions might be sticky material from the suspension, e.g. originating from pieces of membrane from disintegrated protoplast in the suspension. To test this hypothesis, we mixed plants with plasma membrane markers with two different fluorophores (#1: <italic>p35S::GFP-LTi6B</italic> and #2: <italic>pUBQ10::LTi6B-TdTomato</italic>) during the digestion and analyzed the suspension of mixed protoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Across N = 3 independent experiments with a total of n = 574 alive protoplasts, we did not find a single green protoplast (#1) with magenta protrusions or a single magenta protoplast (#2) with green protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3</xref>). We thus conclude that the protrusions are part of the protoplasts and continuous with their plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Composition of the protrusions reveals cortical identity</title><p id="P8">In theory, protrusions could be pure membrane extensions as they are encased by plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). Further investigating the content of the protrusions, we found that they can contain large structures such at ER and cytoskeletal elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Figs. 6</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">7</xref>). Note that not all protrusions contained ER or cytoskeletal elements. In particular, filopods containing microtubules were rare. However, the fact that protrusions can contain ER as well as microtubules shows that not only the plasma membrane of the protrusion is continuous with the protoplast, but also that the cytoplasm of the protoplast is continuous with the protrusions and confirmed again that protrusions appeared independent of the genetic marker.</p><p id="P9">Focusing on microtubules, we used two different marker lines: <italic>p35S::GFP-TUA6</italic>, which marks tubulin <italic>α</italic> and <italic>p35S::GFP-MBD</italic>, which marks microtubule bundles. The presence of microtubule arrays at the protoplast cortex could be verified in maximum intensity projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). In the <italic>p35S::GFP-TUA6</italic> marker line, microtubules are distinguishable from diffuse tubulin fluorescence by their straight shape and an increased GFP-TUA6 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). The fact that we additionally observed microtubules in filopods with the microtubule bundle marker <italic>p35S::GFP-MBD</italic> clearly established the presence of microtubule bundles in a subpopulation of protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7b</xref>). Furthermore, the filopods that contained microtubule signal, with either <italic>p35S::GFP-TUA6</italic> or <italic>p35S::GFP-MBD</italic> markers, appeared straighter than the average filopod marked by a plasma membrane marker. This increased persistence length suggests that protrusions can be mechanically reinforced by the presence of microtubular cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Taken together, the cytoplasmic continuity between the protoplast and the protrusion further strengthens the point that the protrusions are not debris sticking to the protoplast membrane but indeed are continuous with the protoplasts. Furthermore, it reveals that the protrusions can have a cortical identity, begging the question of how they are formed, whether they can actively move and how they are regulated.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Protrusion shape can be regulated by cytoskeleton</title><p id="P11">The previous analysis suggests that the protrusions can be diverse not only in shape (dots/filopods), but also in content. Can this be modulated? In order to modulate the shape of the protrusions, we aimed to stabilize the microtubule cytoskeleton. We focused our analysis on the <italic>p35S::GFP-TUA6</italic> line, in which microtubules are most likely to be slightly destabilized to start with<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. We treated the plants with the microtubule stabilizing drug taxol for 1h prior to digestion and kept the protoplasts in taxol throughout the experiment. Control plants were treated with equivalent concentrations of DMSO.</p><p id="P12">Analyzing the GFP-TUA6 signal in the DMSO control condition (n = 300 protoplasts across N = 3 independent experiments), we observed diffuse GFP-TUA6 signal in 32 ± 5% of the protoplasts, as well as diffuse GFP-TUA6 signal with some microtubules in 46 ± 7% of protoplasts. Protoplasts with a strong microtubule signal were rare (8 ± 5%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref>). The taxol-treated protoplasts (n = 298 protoplasts across N = 3 independent experiments) exhibited a significant stabilization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, as evidenced by a much higher frequency of protoplasts with strong microtubule signal (51 ± 13%), together with a similar level of diffuse GFP-TUA6 signal with some microtubule signal (30 ± 9%) and a strongly reduced fraction of protoplasts with diffuse GFP-TUA6 signal (6 ± 6%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref>). These data confirm that taxol treatment stabilizes the microtubules in these conditions.</p><p id="P13">Next, we analyzed the protrusions containing a GFP-TUA6 signal. The overall number of protrusions (dots + filopods) containing any GFP-TUA6 signal was similar in taxol-treated protoplasts vs. DMSO control (17 ± 2% vs. 15 ± 3%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref>). Note that this is the fraction of protrusions marked with GFP-TUA6, which is much lower than the fraction of protrusions marked with a plasma membrane marker, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>. Analyzing the frequency of filopods containing a GFP-TUA6 signal, the DMSO data confirm that filopods containing a GFP-TUA6 signal is a rare event (6 ± 3%). The frequency of filopods containing a GFP-TUA6 signal was increased in the taxol-treated protoplasts (13 ± 1%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref>). In particular, the frequency of filopods containing a strong GFP-TUA6 signal and thus likely microtubules was increased in taxol-treated protoplasts: 10 ± 3 %, compared to only 1 ± 1 % in the DMSO control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 a</xref>). Note that these filopods had a remarkably straight shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), similar to what we observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>, either sticking out from the round protoplast, or occasionally deforming the whole protoplast towards the filopods. Consequently, the fraction of protoplasts with tubulin containing dots was higher in the DMSO control compared to the taxol-treated protoplasts (9 ± 2% vs. 4 ± 1%). Thus, taxol seems to affect the distribution between tubulin-containing dots and filopods. Taken together, this shows that microtubule stabilization with taxol does not change the overall number of protrusions, but instead shifts the shape of the present protrusions towards microtubule-containing, straight filopods compared to more tubulin containing dots in the control condition, confirming that microtubule status can regulate the shape of the protrusions.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Dynamics of the protrusions: passive movement</title><p id="P14">Next, we wanted to understand the dynamics of the protrusions. First, in timelapse movies, we observed that the filopods move (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>, Video S1). We thus wondered whether this movement is active or passive. In order to better understand how strong a passive movement to expect in our setup, we analyzed fluorescent polystyrene beads in the microwells in the same hyperosmotic buffer that we used for the protoplasts. Over time, the beads sank to the bottom of the wells and/or adsorbed to the side walls of the wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>). However, the fraction of beads that was free in the hyperosmotic buffer without contact to the walls of the wells stayed mobile and moved substantially, showing that there is considerable thermal motion in our system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>). Comparing the movement of the beads to the movement of the filopods, we found that the motion is qualitatively similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). This is consistent with the hypothesis that the observed motion of filopods is passive. While this does not completely exclude the possibility of an active movement, the most parsimonious conclusion is that of passive movement.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Controlling the protrusions with osmolarity</title><p id="P15">Beyond cytoskeleton, a more obvious candidate regulator of the protrusions is osmolarity, as subjecting plant tissue to a hyperosmotic solution induced plasmolysis and reveals protrusions. To test the effect of osmotic changes on protoplasts, we subjected protoplasts (n = 97 protoplasts across N = 3 independent experiments) to cycles of hyperosmolarity (600 mM D-mannitol ~ 720 mOsmol/kg) and close to iso-osmolarity (280 mM D-mannitol ~ 340 Osmol/kg). We made use of the microwell system that allows to observe the exact same protoplasts at different osmolarities. We analyzed the behavior of the protoplasts during a decrease in osmolarity (i) from 600 mM to 280 mM D-mannitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, left), followed by an increase in osmolarity (ii) from 280 mM to 600 mM D-mannitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, right). After either transition, a third of the protoplasts did not change in terms of number and type of protrusions (white in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). A third of the protoplasts appeared sick or dead at any point during the experiment and were disqualified. A third of the protoplasts decreased the number or size of protrusions following the initial decrease in osmolarity (i), and a third of the protoplasts increased the number or size of protrusions during the following increase in osmolarity (ii) (green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). We did not observe protoplasts increasing the number or size of protrusions following a decrease in osmolarity and rarely observed a decrease in the number/size of protrusions following an increase in osmolarity (red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>); Taking both transitions together, we further asked whether the same protoplasts both decreased their protrusions with a decrease in osmolarity and increased them with an increase in osmolarity (20 ± 6%), or whether they only did one (10 ± 7%) or the other (10 ± 9%). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref> shows examples of each of these categories. Taken together, more than half of the alive protoplasts show at least either a decrease in protrusions in lower osmolarity or an increase in higher osmolarity. This demonstrates that protrusions are regulated by osmolarity.</p><p id="P16">To further challenge this conclusion, we observed protoplasts (n = 76 protoplasts across N = 3 independent experiments) subjected to increasing final concentrations of D-mannitol, increasing from 600 mM (~720 mOsmol/kg) over 700 mM (~850 mOsmol/kg) to 800 mM (~980 mOsmol/kg) using the microwell system. As a control, we added hyperosmotic buffer solution of the same concentration, i.e. keeping the protoplasts at 600 mM D-mannitol (~720 mOsmol/kg) during the whole experiment (n = 97 protoplasts across N = 3 independent experiments). We then analyzed whether the type, number and size of the protrusions stayed constant (white in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), increased (green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref> for examples), or decreased (red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>) with the addition of buffer, i.e. with increase in osmolarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, left), vs. keeping the same osmolarity in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, right). Protoplasts that looked sick or dead at any point in the experiment were disqualified (grey in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Comparing the increase of osmolarity to the control, we saw that the fraction of protoplasts that increase the type, number or size of protrusions with increasing osmolarity is much higher than those spontaneously increasing their protrusions in the control (37 ± 2% vs. 11 ± 2%). Conversely, the large majority of protoplasts in the control stayed unchanged (63 ± 4%), while this was only the case for 28 ± 2% of the protoplasts subjected to osmotic changes. We can further observe that changing the osmolarity is a stress for the protoplasts, as the fraction of dead protoplasts increased in the protoplasts experiencing an increase in osmolarity (33 ± 4% vs. 21 ± 2% in control). Taken together, these observations confirm that osmolarity can regulate the protrusions. Importantly, the population of protoplasts with increasing osmolarity showed 7/76 protoplasts across the N = 3 experiments that developed <italic>de-novo</italic> filopods from smooth protoplasts. This only occurred in 2/97 protoplasts in the control. This shows that protoplasts can develop protrusions <italic>de novo</italic> and that this behavior is increased by an increase in osmolarity.</p><p id="P17">Taken together, these data show that increasing osmolarity can not only induce extension of existing protrusions, but also lead to the formation of new protrusions. Thus, protoplasts are able to form <italic>de novo</italic> dots and filopods. This shows that protoplasts do not require a plasma membrane-cell wall attachment site to pull out the membrane during plasmolysis to form filopods.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Filopods can attach to the microwells</title><p id="P18">The discovery that a significant fraction of protoplasts makes protrusions opens the question of their biological functions in plant tissues. These functions are likely numerous, and some may echo the proposed role of Hechtian structures in mechanosensing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> or in acting as a reservoir of membrane during plasmolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Because we can see protrusions emerging d<italic>e novo</italic>, another, non-exclusive, function may relate to a role in actively reshaping the cell cortex in plants. This might include the local remodeling of the cell wall, the definition of new contact sites, or even the formation of secondary plasmodesmata. To support this claim, the formation of protrusions is not sufficient; protrusions must also attach to the cell wall. Accordingly, we would like to report our occasional but persistent observation that filopods can attach to the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-c</xref>). This was most obvious when the tip of the filopod did not move over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). The rare formation of very long (&gt;30 µm) filopods might be attributed to attachment to the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Sometimes, the tips of the attached filopods also showed small extensions, widening the surface area of the tip at the site of attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b,c</xref>).

Membrane tubes can be experimentally pulled out of membrane vesicles or cells by locally applying a force, e.g. using optical tweezers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> to pull a bead away from the membrane, by micropipette aspiration of a vesicle bound to a rigid surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> or holding a vesicle by a micropipette and exerting a force by a fluid flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, as well as by scaffolding the plasma membrane with membrane deforming proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, and by pulling on vesicles with molecular motors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In plants, the emergence of Hechtian strands can be regarded as tube formation by pulling the membrane away from a contact: the membrane is attached to the cell wall at discrete attachment point, the Hechtian attachment sites, from where the Hechtian strands are pulled out as the protoplast retracts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Beyond the Hechtian strands, protrusions can be induced artificially in protoplasts by overexpressing remorin, with the rationale that clusters of remorin would constrain the shape of the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">Here we showed that plant protoplasts readily form protrusions that are continuous with the protoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), can contain ER and cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), and are regulated in shape by the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) and in abundance by osmolarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c-f</xref>). They further support the hypothesis that filopods might be forming <italic>de novo</italic> Hechtian attachment sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Our discovery thus suggests that protrusion formation is not a rare event, but rather a normal behavior observed in plants from different taxa. Our discovery therefore challenges the depiction of plant cells as “passive” and calls for a re-evaluation of our understanding of the role of the plant cell cortex.</p><p id="P21">Protrusions in plant protoplasts have been observed in specific contexts, notably when overexpressing remorin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, but why have protrusions not been observed earlier in normal protoplasts? Among many hypotheses, one can propose that (i) protrusions are small, dynamic structures and thus difficult to see in a sea of protoplasts, in particular in the absence of a bright plasma membrane marker (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>), (ii) “clean”, i.e. smooth protoplasts are usually selected as canonical protoplasts, and (iii) high centrifugation speed in the protoplast preparation protocol may damage protrusions. Our work might trigger re-analyses of previous results, which in turn may shed a new light on the role of these protrusions in specific contexts.</p><p id="P22">Are the protrusions Hechtian structures? The fact that new protrusions can emerge in hyper-osmotic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>) suggests that protrusions are not simply remaining Hechtian strands from a plasmolyzed cell undergoing cell wall digestion. Yet, we will need to question the relation between filopods and Hechtian structures in further studies. The attachment of filopods to the surface of the microwell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-d</xref>) suggests that protoplasts exhibit a competence to stick to surfaces through these protrusions, a behavior that is more animal-like than generally pictured.</p><p id="P23">The protrusions observed in plant cells can echo focal adhesions in animals, with the major difference that plant filopods appear passive. Yet, plant protrusions remain attractive candidates as mechanosensing hubs: the Hechtian attachment sites might bundle mechanical forces at discrete points on the plasma membrane; the protoplast protrusions might probe the environment for potential attachment sites. This also recalls the relation between adhesion and tension at the tissue scale, which is observed across kingdoms of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Our work suggests that this may very well be true at cellular scale, too. Conversely, the increasing appreciation of the role of osmolarity in animal cell and tissue morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> might in turn echo the observed protrusions in plant protoplasts, further reflecting more universal behavior than anticipated.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Plant lines and growth conditions</title><sec id="S11"><title>Arabidopsis thaliana</title><p id="P24">For our analysis, we used the following stable transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> lines:</p><p id="P25"><italic>pUBQ10::LTi6B-TdTomato</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, Col-0 background</p><p id="P26"><italic>p35S::GFP-LTi6B</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, Col-2 background (NASC ID N84726)</p><p id="P27"><italic>pUBQ10::DDRGK1-GFP</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, Col-0 background</p><p id="P28"><italic>p35S::GFP-TUA6</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, Col-0 background (NASC ID N6551)</p><p id="P29"><italic>p35S::GFP-MBD</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, WS-4 background</p><p id="P30">Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized in 70% ethanol for 10 minutes, dried on filter paper and transferred to ½ MS plates (Murashige &amp; Skoog Basalt salt mixture, Duchefa), 3 mM MES hydrate (Sigma), 0.8% plant agar (Duchefa), pH adjusted to 5.7 using KOH, without sugar or vitamins).
