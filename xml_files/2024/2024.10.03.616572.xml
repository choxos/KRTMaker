Here, we show that MMRd tumours harbour long-deletion signatures (≥2-5+ base pairs deleted in repetitive regions), which provide new insights into MSI evolution and enable sensitive MSI detection particularly in challenging clinical samples. Long deletions, accumulated through stepwise DNA slippage errors, are significantly more prevalent in metastatic MMRd tumours compared to primary tumours. Importantly, we show that long-deletion signatures harbour features that are distinct from background noise, making them robustly detectable even in shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS, ∼0.1X coverage) of formalin-fixed samples. We constructed a machine learning classifier that uses these distinct features to detect Microsatellite Instability in LOw-quality (MILO) samples. MILO achieved 100% accuracy in detecting MSI in sWGS data with only 2%-15% tumour purity and demonstrated promise in identifying MMRd clones in precancerous intestinal lesions. We propose that MILO could be clinically used for the sensitive monitoring of MMRd cancer evolution from early to late stages, using minimal sequencing data from both archival and fresh-frozen samples with low tumour content.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) is a well-recognised mutagenic process that has been found in cancers across more than 20 tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). MMRd cancers generally exhibit a more favourable prognosis and typically respond positively to immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). However, significant heterogeneity exists in clinical outcomes, including prognosis, response to chemotherapy, and sensitivity to immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). This heterogeneity highlights the urgent need for subtyping MMRd cancers and monitoring how MMRd tumours evolve over time and through therapy.</p><p id="P4">During DNA replication, the newly synthesised DNA strand can transiently dissociate from the template strand, causing misalignment and a phenomenon known as strand slippage error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Microsatellite (MS) regions, due to their repetitive DNA sequences, are particularly susceptible to these errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). This process causes the formation of small loops in DNA strands: if the loop forms on the new strand, it can cause an insertion, while on the template strand, it leads to a deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The MMR machinery typically corrects post-replicative slippage errors; however, in cells with impaired MMR, this process is disrupted, resulting in microsatellite instability (MSI), characterised by a significantly elevated mutation rate of small insertions and deletions (indels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Further, MMRd tumours accumulate single base substitutions (SBSs) in particular sequence contexts reflecting the intrinsic bias of the MMR system to identify and repair mismatched bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Consequently, MMRd tumours show distinctive mutational signatures of both indels and SBSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Uncorrected slippage errors in MS loci create an ‘archive’, recording the evolutionary history of MMRd cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). The burden of slippage events, termed ‘MSI intensity’ (usually measured as the proportion of mutated MS loci), is positively associated with immunotherapy response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Consequently, MSI characterisation may be useful to guide therapeutic decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Current methods for MSI detection and characterisation struggle with challenging samples, particularly those with limited tumour cellularity and poor DNA quality, for example, samples from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Here, we explore the mutational signatures and evolution of MSI. We found that the accumulation of microsatellite slippage events serves as a surreptitious record of tumour evolutionary history and leads to distinct indel signatures, providing an exquisitely sensitive route for tracking MMRd tumours.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S4"><title>Novel long-deletion signatures enriched in metastatic MMRd cancers</title><p id="P8">We characterised the spectrum of indel mutations in primary and metastatic MMRd cancers using deep sequencing of <italic>n</italic>=554 MMRd tumours from four publicly available datasets (EPICC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>): <italic>n</italic>=39; PCAWG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>): <italic>n</italic>=31; GEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>): <italic>n</italic>=355; Hartwig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>): <italic>n</italic>=119), collectively comprising <italic>n</italic>=425 primary tumours and <italic>n</italic>=119 metastatic lesions. Samples included in the EPICC and GEL cohorts were derived from colorectal cancers (CRCs), whereas samples from the PCAWG and Hartwig cohorts were pan-cancer.</p><p id="P9">We derived the indel mutational spectrum for each cancer, represented as a vector of mutational frequencies across 83 mutation channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). These channels were determined based on the size of the indels and their surrounding sequence contexts. We then conducted a dimensionality reduction analysis using these indel profiles and observed a clear separation in the reduced-dimensional manifold between metastatic and primary MMRd cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). By exploring the normalised indel profiles of CRCs in each cohort, we noted the prevalence of long deletions in the metastatic cohort that were absent from primary MMRd tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Next, we performed <italic>de novo</italic> mutational signature extraction and identified five indel signatures from the combined MMRd datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). Two of the newly-derived signatures closely matched known MSI signatures (COSMIC v3.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>): ID1-like and ID2-like, with cosine similarities of 0.98 to signatures ID1 and ID2, respectively. The ID1-like signature features dominant 1 bp insertions of T/A in homopolymer (HP) regions, while the ID2-like signature features dominant 1 bp deletions of T/A in HP regions.</p><p id="P11">The other three signatures (MSI_ID_sig3, MSI_ID_sig4, and MSI_ID_sig5) are characterised by predominant features of longer deletions (ranging from 2 bp to more than 5 bp) at repetitive regions (microsatellites). Collectively, we will refer to these signatures as the ‘long-deletion signatures’. Among them, MSI_ID_sig3 and MSI_ID_sig5 are distinct from previously reported ID signatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), while MSI_ID_sig4 shares some similarities with signature ID12 (cosine similarity of 0.87), which has an unknown aetiology. We noted that in MSI_ID_sig3, the mutational frequencies of longer deletions increase with deletion lengths from 2 to over 5 bp, whereas in MSI_ID_sig4 and MSI_ID_sig5, these frequencies decrease as deletion lengths increase.</p><p id="P12">We assessed the contributions of these newly identified indel signatures in our primary and metastatic MMRd tumour cohorts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). We found that the average contribution of the long-deletion signatures was significantly higher in metastatic tumours (∼42%) than in primary tumours (∼4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In contrast, the ID2-like signature significantly decreased in relative contribution from ∼92% in primary to ∼47% in metastatic MMRd cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We observed that ID1-like, MSI_ID_sig4, and MSI_ID_sig5 signatures generally made smaller mutational contributions, but their activity was relatively increased in metastatic tumours compared to primary tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P13">There was a markedly greater variability in the relative contribution of the long-deletion signatures among metastatic cancer cohorts (standard deviation (SD) of 0.2) compared to primary MMRd tumours (SD of 0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). We found that the origin of the primary tumour was a crucial factor affecting the contributions of long-deletion signatures in metastatic MMRd lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). MMRd metastatic samples originating from a colorectal primary exhibited the highest prevalence of long-deletion signatures, with a mean proportion of 58.4%, followed by breast-origin tumours and urinary tract tumours with mean proportions of 39.8% and 37.7%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In contrast, nervous system MMRd metastases showed the lowest proportion, with only 7%.</p><p id="P14">Across colorectal cancers (<italic>n</italic>=34) and prostate cancers (<italic>n</italic>=27), the two types of cancer with the greatest number of metastatic MMRd samples in the Hartwig cohort, there was a strong non-linear positive correlation between the contributions of the long-deletion signatures and total indel mutation counts (Spearman’s <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.61 for CRCs, <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.85 for prostate cancers) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Focusing on CRCs, we observed that the overall number of deletions showed a slight but non-significant increase in metastases compared to primaries (<italic>p</italic> = 0.08; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). However, stratifying the deletions by length (1 ∼ 5+ bp), showed a higher prevalence of 1 bp deletions in primaries vs metastases, while metastatic cancers displayed a substantial enrichment of long deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>; <italic>p</italic> ≤ 1.6 × 10<sup>−5</sup>), in agreement with the relative activities of MSI_ID_sig2 and the long-deletion signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Long deletions are likely accumulated through stepwise slippage events over time</title><p id="P15">Our analysis revealed a significant increase in the frequency of long deletions in metastatic MMRd tumours compared to primaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c &amp; g</xref>). Previous work in MMRd cell lines and mouse models has shown that long deletions occur through stepwise slippage errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Here, we examined evidence of repeated slippages in five patients in the Hartwig cohort (four with prostate cancer and one with CRC) who had multiple longitudinally collected metastatic samples.</p><p id="P16">The frequency of motif deletions was inversely proportional to deletion size, with deletions longer than 20 bp being extremely rare (0.03%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Stratifying deletions by odd vs even length showed that 90% of odd-length indels and 85% of short even-length indels (≤10 bp) were composed of mono-nucleotide repeats (1 bp motifs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The majority (63.7%) of the longer even-length indels (&gt;10 bp) were formed by di-nucleotide repeats (2 bp motifs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). Therefore, most of the longer indels in advanced MMRd cancers consist of multiple repeats of smaller motifs (1 or 2 bp).</p><p id="P17">We examined the evidence for accumulation of repeated slippage events. For each patient, we searched for unique MS loci where slippage events were detected at both time points, referring to these as ‘shared mutated MS loci’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The ‘slippage size’ refers to the number of repeat motif units differing between the two indels. Across the five longitudinally sampled patients, an average of 57% of the mutated MS loci were shared within the paired samples from each patient, with a wide range spanning from 19% to 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This variation may reflect differences in the divergence time between samples or the intra-tumour heterogeneity.</p><p id="P18">Within the shared mutated MS loci, there was a substantial number of ‘new’ slippage events (mean of 8,752), where the later sample had a different number of motif repeats compared to the earlier sample, occurring in approximately 10% of shared MS loci across four out of five patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). New deletions (86%) were more common than new insertions (14%) on average.</p><p id="P19">We examined the slippage size across different motif lengths for all detected slippage events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Slippages of size one was the most common (with a mean of 85%) and the overall frequencies decreased exponentially with larger slippage sizes. The deletions primarily consisted of 1 bp motifs (98.7%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Additionally, 2 bp motifs expanded more frequently than 1 bp motifs, with a mean frequency of 63% and 32%, respectively, for sample pairs with more than 20 slippage events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Notably, we found examples where an MS locus had undergone deletion of one motif at the first time point, but then later showed insertion at the same locus, and vice versa (slippage size &lt; 0; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). It indicates that both insertions and deletions can occur within the same MS loci over time (a similar observation is reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>)), and the observed deletions and insertions from one biopsied sample are actually net changes after accounting for both types of events. Overall, due to the higher rate of deletions compared to insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), we observed a prevalence of long deletions as the disease progresses. These observations likely result from repeated slippage events over time in clonal microsatellite mutations. We acknowledge that convergent evolution of different MMRd clones, although very rare, can also contribute to these findings.</p><p id="P21">Following the stepwise model, we expected that tumours with longer evolutionary time (since MMRd onset) and/or higher slippage rates would exhibit a greater number of total slippage events compared to those with more recent MMRd initiation or have slower slippage rates. We indeed observed a significantly higher number of slippage events in metastatic vs primary MMRd CRC tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>), whereas the total indel mutation burden alone was not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Overall, our results suggest that measurements incorporating the estimated number of slippage events may provide more informative insights into MSI evolution.</p><p id="P22">Next, we explored the indel accumulation pattern (calculated as log<sub>10</sub> ratio of deletion numbers by size between later and earlier timepoints) in MMRd cell line and patient data. A stepwise slippage model predicts many 1 bp deletions of T/A in HP regions during the initial stage of MMRd onset and few deletions of 2+ bp (requiring slippage errors occurring at the same MS locus twice or more). Published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) where DNA was sequenced from a <italic>MSH6</italic> knockout (KO) cell line at three time points (15, 30, and 45 days post knockout), was consistent with the stepwise slippage model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P23">In our EPICC cohort of CRCs, we observed increased 1 bp deletion burden in MSI carcinomas compared to their precursor MSI adenomas, and a small increase in 2 bp deletions, with no noticeable difference in deletions &gt;2 bp in two patients, C536 and C552 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a-b</xref>). We found that histologically normal tissues from three MSI patients (C516, C548, and C552) exhibited a strong MSI signal (&gt;10,000 1 bp T/A deletions in HP regions), albeit at lower levels than adenomas and carcinomas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a, c &amp; d</xref>). This suggests either contamination by tumour cells, or that MMRd can precede morphological changes, indicating a window for early detection of MMRd cancer clones.</p><p id="P24">In two metastatic cancer cases originating in the prostate (HMF000458 and HMF003047 from the Hartwig cohort), longitudinal biopsies were taken with an interval of 14 months and 10 months between samples, respectively. The later samples showed an increased burden of both short (1 bp) and long (2 ∼ 5+ bp) deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a-b</xref>). The Hartwig cohort includes three other longitudinal sample pairs from MMRd cancers (without documented biopsy intervals) all of which showed a significant change in long deletions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9c-e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Higher long-deletion intensity correlates with better clinical outcomes in advanced MMRd cancers</title><p id="P25">The proportion of unstable MS loci has previously been shown to correlate with patient survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). We evaluated the potential of long deletions as a prognostic marker for patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). We performed overall survival (OS) analysis using <italic>n</italic>=100 Hartwig samples (19 samples were omitted due to missing information). We calculated the ‘long-deletion intensity’ (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>); this measurement considers both the prevalence and length of long deletions, with the latter providing an estimation for the number of slippage events.</p><p id="P26">We then assigned the samples into high (top 50%) and low (bottom 50%) long-deletion intensity subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We found that Hartwig MMRd patients with high long-deletion intensity had significantly better overall survival compared to the low long-deletion intensity group (<italic>p</italic>=0.04; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>). In contrast, neither TMB nor the frequency of 1 bp deletions significantly stratified this cohort by overall survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-c</xref>). We observed that long deletions are enriched in high-TMB tumours whereas 1 bp deletions are progressively depleted as TMB increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d-e</xref>), suggesting long deletions are more effective in predicting metastatic MMRd patient outcomes than a conventional marker such as TMB.</p><p id="P27">We also examined the association between long-deletion intensity and progression-free survival (PFS) using samples from 36 metastatic patients with documented treatment and response information. We found that when tumours were treated with chemotherapy, the majority (65%, 11 out of 17) experienced disease progression, regardless of their long-deletion intensity levels. However, when given therapies other than chemotherapy (19 cases, including nine who received immunotherapy), those with higher long-deletion intensity had longer PFS, although the difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Long-deletion signatures remain distinct MMRd signals even in low-quality samples</title><p id="P28">While primary MMRd cancers exhibit a lower prevalence of long-deletion signatures compared to metastatic MMRd cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c &amp; g</xref>), they nonetheless harbour significantly more long deletions than MMRp tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 5.3 × 10<sup>−239</sup>). Although these differences are not visually discernible in indel signature profiles due to the dominance of ID2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), they suggest that long-deletion signatures may serve as ubiquitous markers for MMRd even in primary tumours.</p><p id="P29">Therefore, we explored the detectability of long deletions in shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) data from primary tumours. Firstly, we examined real and synthetic sWGS data from two CRC patients in the EPICC cohort: one with MMRd and one with MMRp. We down-sampled the reads from the deep-sequenced data (coverage of 45X) to generate synthetic sWGS (coverage of 0.1X and 0.01X) data (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). The EPICC cohort also contains genome data from the same tumours that were experimentally sequenced to 1X coverage. We applied a bioinformatics pipeline to call mutations in these sWGS samples (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>), and considered variants as true somatic mutations (the ‘signal’) if they were also detected by the deep-sequenced data from the same cancer; otherwise, they were classified as ‘noise’ mutations.</p><p id="P30">We found that, at 1X coverage, the MMRd tumour, as a hypermutator phenotype, had significantly more true somatic mutations and a much higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than MMRp tumour (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). Surprisingly, our synthetic ultra-shallow samples (coverage of 0.1X and 0.01X) exhibited similar SNRs compared to real sWGS samples with 1X coverage, and their signal mutation patterns were well preserved relative to the benchmark mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 13-15</xref>).

In both FFPE and FF cohorts, the indel profiles obtained from sWGS biopsies provided more insight into MMR status than the SBS profiles, probably due to the dominant background noise present in SBS mutation calls. The mean indel profiles for MMRd tumours were highly similar between FFPE and FF cohorts (cosine similarity of 0.92; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), whereas the similarity was lower for MMRp tumours (cosine similarity of 0.83; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Batch effects on indel profiles were much more pronounced in MMRp samples in both the FF and FFPE sWGS cohorts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 17-18</xref>).</p><p id="P35">We investigated which indel mutation features were most informative for MMRd status in sWGS data using a feature selection approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). Among the top ten key features, nine were shared between FFPE and FF cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 19</xref>). These include the dominant ID2 signature peak and the long deletions (2 ∼ 5+ bp) in repetitive regions—which were also prominent in our long-deletion signatures derived from deep-sequenced MMRd tumours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). These key features effectively distinguished MMRd from MMRp samples in both FF and FFPE sWGS data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 20</xref>).</p><p id="P36">We noted that long-deletion signals were barely visible in indel profiles derived from deep-sequenced primary MMRd tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a-c</xref>), but were readily detectable in indel profiles from our sWGS primary MMRd cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 17b &amp; 18b</xref>). To investigate this discrepancy, we carefully examined each mutation calling step for 214 deep-sequenced EPICC samples. We found that long deletions were in fact called for all 32 MMRd tumours by the mutation caller, Mutect2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), but had been filtered out as they were labelled as ‘multiallelic’ without a ‘PASS’ tag (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 21</xref>). Long deletions were mostly enriched in multiallelic indels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 21</xref> c-d), providing further evidence for stepwise accumulation of short slippages leading to long deletions. Longer deletions had lower allele frequencies than shorter deletions, consistent with the idea that the repeat slippages occurred progressively (later) in tumour evolution. However, for sWGS samples, we included all detected mutations, which are typically covered by only a single read. As a result, multiallelism is extremely rarely detected; therefore, the ‘multiallelic’ flag was not used for filtering.</p><p id="P37">We compared the number of indel and SNVs that were filtered out in deeply sequenced MMRd and MMRp tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 21a</xref>). We observed that indels were filtered out three times more frequently in MMRd cases compared to MMRp tumours, whereas the number of filtered-out SNVs was only slightly higher in MMRd tumours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 21a-b</xref>). This strongly suggests over-filtering of indel mutations in MMRd tumours. When combining all indels detected in MMRd samples, the long-deletion signature features appeared at low frequencies, similar to what we observed in sWGS EPICC samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 21e-f</xref>).</p><p id="P38">Next, we sought to determine whether these long-deletion features enable sensitive detection of MMRd in low purity sWGS samples. We first examined 88 sWGS samples from six MMRd CRCs in the EPICC cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Of these, 47 were excluded in our original publication due to having ultra-low tumour cellularity and were not used in analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>. Clustering analysis of the 88 indel signature profiles revealed a distinct separation between samples with low purity and those with higher tumour purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p><p id="P39">The mean indel profiles of 32 low-purity MMRd samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>; purity &lt; 15%) demonstrated notably lower similarity to the mean high-purity MMRd profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>; purity &gt; 90%; <italic>n</italic>=9), with a cosine similarity of 0.74. Instead, they aligned closely with indel profiles in MMRp samples (cosine similarity of 0.99; top panel of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 18a</xref>), suggesting that the MMRd signal is diluted by the prevalent MMRp (stromal) cells in these low-purity biopsies. To unveil the masked MMRd signals in low-cellularity MMRd samples, we subtracted the MMRp ‘noise’ from the indel mutation profiles using the methodology from ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). This noise correction method treats the observed indel profile as a linear combination of signal (MMRd) and noise (MMRp) signatures, removing the noise indel signature to reveal the signal profile. The corrected profile closely resembled that of high-cellularity MMRd samples (cosine similarity of 0.98; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p><p id="P40">We then examined the correlation between indel mutation count and tumour cellularity to better understand the noise levels, particularly in low-purity samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d-e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 22</xref>). Here, we analysed a total of 474 sWGS samples from the EPICC cohort (consisting of 88 MMRd samples and 386 MMRp samples). This includes 267 samples presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and an additional 207 samples that were excluded from the original study due to ultra-low tumour purity. We noted that sequencing coverage could be a confounder: samples with higher sequencing coverage, regardless of their MMR status, exhibited a greater number of indel mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 22</xref>). After coverage normalisation, we identified a strong correlation between tumour purity and both long deletion and total indel mutation counts in MMRd samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d-e</xref>), whereas no such correlation was found with MMRd SNV mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 23</xref>).</p><p id="P41">We observed that MMRp cells contribute a nearly constant number of indel mutations, which can be considered the background noise level in impure MMRd samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d-e</xref>). Notably, the noise source for long deletions exhibited much less variance (SD of 568) compared to that of all indels (SD of 9,870). Additionally, formalin fixation introduced significantly less noise to long deletions compared to that introduced to other indels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). These results indicate that long deletions stand out above all types of noise in these low-quality samples—such as unfiltered germline mutations, PCR and sequencing errors, and FFPE artefacts—making them ideal markers for detecting MMRd signals in low-quality samples. Based on these observations, we estimated that the detection limit for long-deletion signatures in low-purity MMRd samples is about 2% for FF samples and 5% for FFPE samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>MILO accurately predicts MMR status of low-purity sWGS samples</title><p id="P42">We consolidated these findings into a computational method termed ‘MILO’ (Detecting <bold>M</bold>icrosatellite <bold>I</bold>nstability in <bold>LO</bold>w-quality samples).

We simulated 20,000 FF and 20,000 FFPE samples by mixing MMRd (the ‘signal’) and MMRp (the ‘noise’) indel profiles together (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). For each cohort, half (10,000) of the samples were MMRd samples with varied tumour purities, and the other half were MMRp samples.

This suggests clonal expansion over time and through disease progression: at time point 1, the biopsy was classified as non-dysplastic, with the weakest MSI signal, indicating either that the MMRd clone was low cellularity or it accrued few indels; at time point 2, biopsies were classified as low grade dysplasia (LGD, a cancer precursor), and subsequently by time point 3, a CRC had developed.</p><p id="P47">In clade 1, MILO predicted that nearly half of biopsies (five out of eleven) were non-MSI.

Two biopsies were assigned a high probability of being MSI (0.88 and 0.82), while four biopsies were categorised as having low-confidence MSI status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>).

Although these long-deletion signatures occur at low frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>), they collectively provide strong, robust, and unique MSI signals in pan-cancer MMRd tumours, especially in samples with low cellularity. This makes them ideal markers for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) using cfDNA and for early screening of precancerous lesions using inexpensive sWGS data.</p><p id="P49">The prevalence of long deletions varies between individuals and across different tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

The above two metrics were derived from the solutions provided by the NMF algorithm for each model. To determine the actual number of active signatures, we choose the solution with lower reconstruction dissimilarity as well as a relatively lower cosine similarity between the inferred signatures. The inferred signature activities were further obtained using the refitting function implemented in our previously developed tool, FFPEsig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Evidence of stepwise slippage events</title><sec id="S23"><title>Sequence composition and slippage events</title><p id="P65">We developed in-house scripts to count the indel mutations at different lengths, and to extract the motif size &amp; motif repeat units from the Variant Call Format (VCF) files obtained from Hartwig medicine foundation.

The percentage of shared MS loci is calculated as the ratio between the number of shared MS indels and the total indel count within the biopsy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).

The survival duration is calculated as the difference between the biopsy date and the ‘DeathDate’ (if the patient is deceased). For patients who are alive, we used the ‘treatmentEndDate’ (if available) or the last updated date in the clinical file (‘2017-07-15’).</p><p id="P70">We also conducted a disease progression-free survival analysis on 39 cancers in the Hartwig cohort with documented treatment information. For these cases, the event is defined as whether the disease progressed after the initial treatment. Samples labelled ‘PD’ were considered progressors, while those labelled ‘SD’ or ‘PR’ were considered non-progressors. The duration is calculated as the time difference between the ‘responseDate’ and the ‘biopsyDate’.</p><p id="P71">The Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and the case numbers at risk in this study were derived from the ‘KaplanMeierFitter’ function from the ‘lifelines’ library, based on the ‘event’ and ‘duration’ data. We grouped samples into ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ categories using the median of different metrics as a cutoff, including long-deletion intensity, TMB (total number of SBSs and indels), and the frequency of 1 bp A/T deletions at HP regions. The statistical significance of the differences between the ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ subgroups in each KM curve was assessed using the ‘pairwise_logrank_test’ function from the ‘lifelines.statistics’ library in Python.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Feature selection in sWGS samples</title><p id="P72">We employed a previously published feature selection method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) to identify significantly informative features for MMRd classification. Firstly, we obtained the true feature importance of the 83 indel signature channels using the original datasets with correct labels of MMR status. We then generated <italic>n=</italic>50 randomly permuted datasets with shuffled labels and computed the feature importance distribution for each signature feature (also termed as ‘null importance’ distribution). The feature score is the log ratio of the true feature importance to the 95% quantile value of the null-importance distribution. We repeated the above process 20 times on the different training sample sets using random five-fold splits from the original dataset. This feature selection process was independently conducted for FFPE and FF cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Noise correction in low-purity sWGS samples</title><p id="P73">To mitigate the noise in MMRd indel profiles with low tumour content, we employed our previously developed tool, FFPEsig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). We derived the background noise profile by computing the average indel profiles from MMRp samples in the EPICC cohort. Subsequently, the observed indel profile of low-purity MMRd samples along with the derived noise profile served as input for FFPEsig to predict signal profile and the weight of signal. To address potential noise contamination in longitudinal IBD MMRd samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>), we applied a similar approach where high-confidence MMRp samples from the same FFPE cohort served as the noise profile. This noise correction step, now available as an optional feature within MILO, allows users to apply either our default or a customised noise pattern to their own samples.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Development of MILO</title><sec id="S29"><title>Simulation of sWGS indel profiles</title><p id="P74">Given the limited number of real sWGS samples, especially MMRd cases with low tumour purity, we simulated an additional 10,000 MMRd and 10,000 MMRp samples with varying purity levels to train automatic classifiers for MMRd detection. Out of 10,000 MMRd cases, 5,000 samples had relatively low purity (&lt;0.2).</p><p id="P75">To generate synthetic MMRd samples, we mixed MMRd (the ‘signal’) and MMRp (the ‘noise’) profiles together. The signal profile was based on the averaged high-purity (&gt;0.9) MMRd profiles from the EPICC cohort, while the noise profile was randomly selected from MMRp samples in the FFPE or FF datasets. The noise indel count remained nearly constant, with ∼42,100 and ∼127,839 noise mutations for FF and FFPE samples, respectively, at 1X coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d-f</xref>). The signal mutation count was predicted using the linear regression model as trained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>, with tumour purity as the input variable. A simulated indel profile with purity <italic>i</italic> (randomly chosen from a uniform distribution) was then created by multiplying the signal profile by the signal mutation count and adding it to the product of the noise profile and the noise mutation count. We added Poisson noise to the noise &amp; signal levels as well as to each 83 indel profile channels. For simulating MMRp samples, no MMRd signal was added, and the rest of the procedure remained the same.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Developing and testing MILO</title><p id="P76">Firstly, we generated a set of simulated samples only using MMRp samples randomly selected from two out of three FF or FFPE cohorts: T1-CRC and UC-IBD for FFPE, and ‘Gland’ and Mseq for FF. The third cohort (Duodenal for FFPE and EPICC for FF) was reserved for independent testing to assess whether classifiers trained on the simulated samples could accurately predict MSI status in an unrelated cohort.</p><p id="P77">To select the most effective approach, we trained three classifiers: RandomForestClassifier (RF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), GaussianNB (NB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>)—from the ‘sklearn’ package on the simulated samples. Their performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. False positive and true positive rates were generated using the ‘roc_curve’ function in ‘sklearn’, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated for each Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. This process was repeated 50 times with different random seeds. Our results showed that the random forest classifier performed best. Therefore, we used the trained random forest model to predict MMR status in the third independent FF or FFPE cohort, with the predicted results and true labels used to derive the confusion matrix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 25</xref>).</p><p id="P78">Next, we re-simulated a new set of 20,000 samples using MMRp samples from all three FFPE/FF cohorts. We trained two Random Forest classifiers—one for FF samples and one for FFPE samples—on these synthetic and real low-pass samples. These classifiers are now implemented in MILO, and they provide the probability of each sample being an MSI, termed as Prob(MSI). In MILO, the categorical classifications are based on Prob(MSI): ‘non-MSI’ (&lt;=0.5) ‘MSI’ (&gt;=0.75; high-confidence) and ‘Maybe’ (&gt;0.5 &amp; &lt; 0.75; low-confidence). Additionally, MILO can optionally estimate and report MSI intensity of predicted MMRd samples using their noise-corrected indel profiles.</p><p id="P79">Finally, we compared MILO performance on low-purity samples to that of a widely used MSI detection tool, MSIsensor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), following their recommended protocol with ‘-c 1’ in the command line. Samples with a minimum ‘somatic_site’ percentage of 20% were considered MSI-positive.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS199227-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d74aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S33"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>QG received a postdoctoral fellowship (Schottlander Cancer Breakthrough Award) from the Schottlander Foundation via the Institute of Cancer Research.
