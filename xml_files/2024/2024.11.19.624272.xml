The tumor targeting event involving BTN2A1 and BTN3A1 dimers on the tumor cell surface is critical, leading to full activation of the TCR. Although the molecular mechanisms governing TCR engagement and T cell activation are well-characterized, the role of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in cancer immune surveillance remains to be fully elucidated, particularly the mechanisms that enable these cells to discriminate between healthy and malignant cells at an early stage of malignant transformation. We employed two independent, genetically engineered step-wise mutagenesis models of human colorectal and breast cancer that mimic the transformation steps leading to tumor formation. We demonstrate that various single oncogenic mutations introduced into healthy organoids or cells, are sufficient to upregulate surface expressed BTN2A1 and enable Vγ9Vδ2 TCR binding to tumor cells. However, full activation of T cells through a Vγ9Vδ2TCR required additional subsequent phosphorylation of juxtamembrane (JTM) amino acids of BTN3A1, leading to the activating heterodimerization of BTN2A1 and 3A1. Using a protein interactome mapping pipeline, we identified PHLDB2, SYNJ2 and CARMIL1 as key players in controlling these delicate dual surface dynamics of BTN2A1 and 3A1 during early transformation. This mode of action allowed Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells to control tumors <italic>in vitro</italic> and in vivo, emphasizing the crucial role of these molecules from early mutagenesis, to advanced cancer stages, and highlighting the therapeutic potential of a Vγ9Vδ2TCR.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Increasing evidence shows that human γδT cells have an essential role in cellular stress sensing and immune surveillance, for both microbial and autologous stress (e.g. tumorigenesis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Infiltration of γδT cells in various tumors has been shown to have a favorable prognostic value<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and plays an important role in the immunosurveillance of early tumor development in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, indicating that γδT cells are most likely at the first line of defense during transformational processes of a healthy to a cancer cell. However, it remains unclear which process triggers γδT cells during early transformation, even though the anti-tumor role of γδT cells has been implicated in various tumor models with established tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Vγ9Vδ2T cells, which are considered the most innate-like subset of gamma delta T cells in general<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, are activated by intermediate metabolites of the isoprenoid/mevalonate pathway, such as isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, also referred to as phosphoantigens (pAgs), which can build up in cancerous- or virally-infected cells due to disruption of the mevalonate pathway. Aminobiphosphonate (ABP) drugs, such as pamidronate (PAM), can also further increase cellular pAg levels, by inhibiting farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), an essential enzyme in this pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Because of the broad, but tumor-specific recognition of malignantly transformed cells, and the lack of MHC-restriction, Vγ9Vδ2T cells harbor great clinical potential as an immunotherapy for cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Although it is well-established that the γδTCR itself is essential for recognition of pAgs, the exact mechanism of ligand-receptor interaction has not been discovered, yet intracellular pAgs are bound to the B30.2 domain of butyrophilin-3 isoform A1 (BTN3A1) which leads to complex formation with BTN2A1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. BTN2A1 has emerged as a key protein for recognition of tumor cells by Vγ9Vδ2-T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> where it is directly bound by the gamma chain of Vγ9Vδ2TCR. The role of the small GTPase RHOB was previously demonstrated to relocalize to the membrane, and interact with BTN3A1 upon pAg build-up<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. This is associated with cytoskeletal changes and reduced mobility of BTN3A1 in the membrane, implying a sort of “membrane trapping” mechanism. It is thought that direct binding of pAgs to the intracellular B30.2 domain enables heterodimerization of BTN3A1 with BTN2A1. The subsequently induced joint conformational and spatial changes stabilize BTN2A1-homodimers, which are then available for interaction with the γδ-TCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Even with the identification of BTN2A1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, the understanding of BTN3A1 regulation through RHOB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, and the most recent observation that pAgs glue BTN3A1 and BTN2A1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, it is not fully elucidated how this mechanism is regulated. Recently, it has been shown to be partially controlled by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, and activation of this pathway led to increased transcription of both molecules, BTN3A and BTN2A1, followed by enhanced activation of Vγ9Vδ2T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Although these new insights defined a signature which is predictive for recognition of tumors in cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, the signature could not clarify at which stage of transformation from and a healthy cell to a cancer cell the BTN-pathway is turned on. Therefore, we used a step-wise mutagenesis model for colon and breast cancer, which remodels different steps during mutagenesis, to characterize expression patterns of BTN2A1, BTN3A1 and RHOB during transformation, which identified PI3K activity as essential step to upregulate BTN2A1. This model also allowed us to hunt for novel players regulating, in particular, the heavily orchestrated BTN3A1 molecule by an innovative proximity proteomics approach. To properly analyze recognition of a tumor cell through Vγ9Vδ2TCR and overcome diversity in innate receptor expression and diversity in function of natural Vγ9Vδ2T cells, we used soluble Vγ9Vδ2TCR formats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> as well as αβT cells expressing a high affinity Vγ9Vδ2 TCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. This strategy enabled us to characterize the orchestration of BTN2A1 and BTN3A1 during early transformation and late-stage cancers where BTN2A1 traffics early during mutagenesis to the cell membrane, in close proximity to BTN3A1, a process heavily regulated by PHLDB2, SYNJ2 and CARMIL1.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells target early transformation events in colorectal cancer (CRC) and these features are preserved in late CRC stages to enable targeting by Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells</title><p id="P6">We investigated both the <italic>a priori</italic> sensitivity of tumors to recognition by a Vγ9Vδ2TCR, as well as the presence of an altered mevalonate pathway in healthy versus diseased tissues by adding Pamidronate (PAM). In screenings to assess tumor recognition in the absence and presence of PAM, αβT cells expressing Vγ9Vδ2TCR exhibited the production of IFNγ when co-cultured with a variety of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, and patient derived tumor organoids selectively in the presence of PAM (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To discern whether recognition by a Vγ9Vδ2TCR is also a general mechanism of healthy colon tissues or a distinct feature of malignant transformation, we utilized a colon organoid model derived from normal tissues, which were altered to carry <italic>APC</italic> (APC<sup>KO</sup>), <italic>KRAS</italic> (KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>), <italic>TP53</italic> (p53<sup>KO</sup>) and <italic>SMAD4</italic> (SMAD4<sup>KO</sup>), referred to as AKPS mutant, simulating a fully developed CRC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. IFNγ production after co-incubation of Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells was exclusively observed in AKPS mutants in the presence of PAM, implying that recognition of tumors by a Vγ9Vδ2TCR is a hallmark of malignant transformation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A-B</xref>). Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells were also able to control CRC outgrowth for at least 43 days after tumor injection (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) <italic>in vivo,</italic> and improved overall survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>) when NSG-mice were engrafted with APKS mutant CRC organoids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">To delineate whether sensitivity to Vγ9Vδ2TCR after PAM-treatment is already imprinted in organoids after malignant transformation, and whether PAM treatment acts differently on healthy versus malignant tissues, we conducted RNA-sequencing from the normal (healthy) and AKPS organoids, with and without PAM. We applied a Wilcoxon rank sum test over the enrichment scores of a gene set variation analysis (GSVA) focusing on HALLMARK gene sets (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The test comparing normal and AKPS organoids without PAM treatment resulted in a p-value of 0.02312, indicating a statistically significant difference in pathway enrichment between WT and AKPS under ‘no PAM’ conditions, and implying that malignant transformation does create a different molecular imprint on cells. The major changes associated with the AKPS mutation covered biological terms related to signaling. We noticed that the highest enrichment score was calculated for the ‘CHOLESTEROL_HOMEOSTASIS’ term in the mutated samples, representing genes of the mevalonate pathway (ACAT, HMGCS1, MVK, PMVK, MVD, IDI1, FDPS).Comparing either healthy or AKPS-mutants with, or without PAM showed significant differences in enrichment scores in the normal (pval=0.0005891) and in the AKPS conditions (pval= 7.761e-09), mainly associated with the cell cycle, and implied that PAM acts on gene expression of both healthy and malignant tissues. However, when comparing the PAM-treated normal and PAM-treated AKPS-mutant organoids, there was no significant change in enrichment scores (p-value of 0.8822), suggesting that PAM’s effect on the gene expression landscape was consistent across both normal and AKPS conditions, as far as the HALLMARK scores are concerned, and that the different underlying molecular profiles in healthy and transformed tissues are the primary reason for PAM-responsiveness, and are not a selective effect of PAM on tumor cells only. Within this context, differential expression analysis comparing the effects of PAM treatment on gene activity demonstrated that normal organoids had a larger array of PAM-responsive genes, both induced and repressed (404 and 578 genes, respectively), than AKPS mutant organoids, which showed changes in 131 and 466 genes respectively (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). BTN genes, which are pivotal in the recognition of target cells by ψ8T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, demonstrated the most pronounced expression in AKPS mutants (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). The BTN2A1 gene encoding for the main interacting protein with the Vγ9 chain, but not BTN3A1/2 genes, was already significantly elevated after malignant transformation in the absence of PAM, and was not further increased by PAM (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). The addition of PAM significantly increased BTN3A1 gene expression levels in AKPS-mutants (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental 1D</xref>). However, patterns of other gene expression had little overlap with the ‘killer signature,’ a set of genes previously found in an extensive CRISPR-screening in the context of immune-mediated tumor cell destruction upon PAM treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, implying that the recently published killer signature does not fully explain the general sensitivity upon malignant transformation to Vγ9Vδ2TCR-mediated recognition.</p><p id="P8">To assess at which stage malignant transformation can be made susceptible to Vγ9Vδ2TCRs, we made use of a step-wise mutagenesis colon organoid model, where the introduction of single mutations of <italic>APC</italic> (APC<sup>KO</sup>), <italic>KRAS</italic> (KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>), <italic>TP53</italic> (p53<sup>KO</sup>) and <italic>SMAD4</italic> (SMAD4<sup>KO</sup>) into normal (healthy) colon organoids represented models for pre-cancerous lesions, while the AKPS mutant served as a fully developed CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> model. After co-incubation of Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells with organoids treated with/without PAM, a single gene mutation introduced in the normal colon was already able to induce IFNγ production after addition of PAM (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A-B</xref>). We chose APC<sup>KO</sup> and AKPS mutant CRC organoids to represent very early and late stages of CRC development, respectively, to further characterize the capacity of a Vγ9Vδ2TCR to potentially sense early or late-stage cancer development. On both APC<sup>KO</sup> and AKPS mutants, we found an enhanced expression of BTN2A1 protein at the cell membrane in the absence of PAM (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Also, the PAM-induced redistribution of intracellular RhoB which we previously described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> was already detected in single <italic>APC</italic>-mutant organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To validate our observation that early malignant transformation primarily impacts BTN2A1 expression in pre-cancerous lesions in humans, we consulted existing single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets from patients at various disease progression stages of CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Analysis of pseudo bulk profiles of the epithelial cell population revealed that BTN2A1 expression levels were always heightened in pre-cancerous (polyp) stages when compared to the “unaffected” baseline in both of the studied patients (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>), which parallels the increased BTN2A1 expression seen at comparable stages in our model. We could also observe that in one pre-cancerous lesion, BTN2A1, BTN3A1 and BTN3A2 were increased.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT1 activity during early transformation is a prerequisite of BTN2A1 upregulation</title><p id="P10">To confirm that single oncogenic mutations generally mediate susceptibility to Vγ9Vδ2TCR recognition, we tested the effect of single <italic>ERBB2</italic> mutations, and overexpression in breast tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.

This suggests that it is not the transformation event in general that promotes susceptibility to recognition by a Vγ9Vδ2TCR, but rather very specific mutations that also differ, depending on the cellular phenotype of the tumor. Since mutations in <italic>ERBB2</italic> often result in PI3K pathway activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> we pre-treated MFC10a ErbB2<sup>V777E</sup> tumor cells with PI3K inhibitor (Pictilisib), which led to significant reduction of IFNγ production of Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells upon co-culture, while HER2 CAR-T cell reactivity remained unaffected <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). Surface expression of the Vγ9Vδ2TCR ligand, BTN2A1, was significantly increased upon ErbB2<sup>V777E</sup> mutation in the absence of PAM. This increase was dependent on PI3 kinase activity in MCF10a cells, since pan PI3K inhibition depleted BTN2A1 surface expression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). BTN3A surface expression, however, did not change either upon ErbB2<sup>V777E</sup> mutation or PI3K inhibition, but it significantly decreased upon any oncogenic mutations induced into benign cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). We could confirm the dependence of BTN2A1 and independence of BTN3A1 expression, respectively, on PI3K signalling in multiple targeted cell lines in the absence of PAM <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">(Supplementary Figures 2B and C)</xref>. When analysing phosphorylation of AKT in MCF10a HER2 mutants, we found that while AKT was phosphorylated on position Ser473 in all lines, in the presence of full culture medium containing growth factors, only a mutation in position V777E had already induced phosphorylation in the absence of growth factors (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>),</bold> confirming the special role of this mutation. To further clarify the downstream signalling cascade of PI3K that is necessary for PAM-dependent activation of Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells, we blocked various key kinases that might be activated by PI3K in the subsequent experiments. In all tumor cell lines, inhibition of both PI3K and AKT1 significantly reduced PAM-dependent Vγ9Vδ2TCR activity, while specific MEK inhibitors did not alter recognition of the tumor cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Pre-treatment of epithelial (HT-29, SKBR3) and hematological (Daudi, K562, RPMI-8226) tumor cell lines with blocking reagents of mTOR reduced recognition significantly, with a similar or even higher potency, as inhibiting AKT activity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Inhibition of both mTOR-involved complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, by inhibitor Torin1, was superior in reducing activation of Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells compared to inhibition of only mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) by Rapamycin (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Since BTN2A1 surface expression was solely dependent on PI3K activity in tumor cell lines, while Vγ9Vδ2T cell activation was triggered by the combination of increased PI3K pathway activity and the presence of PAM, we wondered whether the activity of this pathway is exclusively transformation dependent. The expression patterns of genes of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway over our AKPS-models displayed varied trends in terms of being induced by PAM, or by transformation. However, the key components of the pathway (PRKCA/B, PIK3CA, PAK1, AKT2) were predominantly influenced by the transformation process itself (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>) and thus highly correlated with BTN2A1 expression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting that as the disease progresses, these key pathway components and BTN2A1 expression are linked. These combined data indicate that PI3K/AKT/mTOR activity in the early onset of malignant transformation drives BTN2A1 surface upregulation on tumor cells, and therefore makes them susceptible for Vγ9Vδ2TCR targeting.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>BTN3A1 phosphorylation is required for full activation of the Vγ9Vδ2 TCR</title><p id="P11">To this end we revealed that transformation induced AKT/mTOR activity promotes cell surface expression of BTN2A1, which is a prerequisite for binding of the Vγ9 TCR chain. However, in all models, full activation of Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells required PAM treatment. Although we have not been able to identify the driver of PAM-mediated BTN3A1 upregulated (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>) we could further characterize molecular mechanisms once BTN3A1 is upregulated, by revisiting previously generated mass spectrometry data generated to assess PAM-induced changes in surface proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. This analysis identified two potential phospho-sites on the juxtamembrane (JTM) region of the BTN3A1 molecule; the residues S296 and T297 that were phosphorylated upon PAM (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The juxtamembrane region of BTN3A1 is important for Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation, and is predicted to form a coiled-coil dimer, with the JTM of either BTN3A2 or BTN3A3. This heterodimerization is also important for the surface expression of BTN3A1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, but also plays a key role in the interaction of BTN3A1 with RhoB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In order to determine whether phosphorylation of S296 and/or T297 could contribute to interhelical electrostatic interactions, and thereby favor heterodimerization, a coiled-coil model of the 3A1 and 3A2 JTM was generated. Neither S296 nor T297 are located at the interface, and there are no positively charged residues located at the interface of the 3A2 helix (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). As enhanced coiled-coil stability of the phosphorylated residues is less likely, the alternative of providing an improved scaffold for RhoB to bind, could be a valid alternative. To separate the functional impact of PAM-induced phosphorylation on BTN3A1 from other events induced by endogenous phosphoantigen (pAg) levels, we constructed modified versions of the BTN3A1 sequence that mimic protein conformation of either a phosphorylated (phospho-mimic variant) or an unphosphorylated state (phospho-deficient variant). These phospho-variants were developed by substituting residues S296 and T297 with aspartic acid, which is known to function similarly to phosphorylated serine and threonine (D, phospho-mimic), or alanine which is employed regularly to inhibit residue phosphorylation (A, phospho-deficient) To understand whether phosphorylation mimicking of the residues investigated here is required for BTN3A1 membrane orchestration, we performed FRET measurements that showed that phospho-deficient BTN3A1 is unable to interact with RhoB, another important player in the orchestration of BTN3A1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) suggesting a significant role of JTM phosphorylation of BTN3A1 in enabling Vγ9Vδ2TCR full activation., Functional introduction of the phospho-mimic BTN3A1 variant resulted in higher activation of Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells upon PAM (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>). To assess potential regulators of this phosphorylation we used gene expression profiles of the normal and AKPS-mutated colorectal organoids, and identified protein kinase C theta (PRCKQ) as the only kinase that follows PAM-treatment, and upregulates by PAM, regardless of the mutational status of the tissue (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). This data led to the hypothesis that PAM-induced kinase activation results in phosphorylation of the S296 and T297 motifs of BTN3A1.

As a first step, we made use of a proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> by overexpressing BTN3A1 fused to bacterial biotin ligase BirA* to its the C-terminus in HEK293F cells. Cells were treated with 100 µM PAM and 50 µM biotin for 24h, which led to biotinylation of BTN3A1-close proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A and B</xref>), after which cells were lysed, and biotinylated proteins were pulled down, using streptavidin beads. Proteins were identified by mass spectrometry, analyzing quadruplicate samples, which resulted in a list of 60 candidate proteins including 31 hits under no treatment, 19 upon PAM treatment, and 10 hits that occurred upon both conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>). To determine if candidate proteins play a physiological role in tumor targeting by Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells, we knocked down each candidate protein in HEK293F and MZ1851RC cells, using siRNAs and used these cells as targets against Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells in the presence of PAM, and calculated to what level KD influenced IFNγ production by Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). We used the same target cells against Wilms tumor 1 specific (WT-1) αβTCR T cells after loading them with WT-1 peptide, to exclude that candidate proteins are not involved in general T cell-target cell interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>). The summary of these knock-down experiments provided evidence that eight candidate proteins, namely PHLDB2, PKP2, SYNJ2, CARMIL1, PA2G4, TANC1, SDK2, HNRPC, have a functional impact on PAM-dependent activation of Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells, as possible additional modulators of the BTN3A1-RhoB axis.</p><p id="P13">We wondered if PAM-induced spatial rearrangements of BTN3A1-related proteins, as observed with BioID-tagging, could be partially the result of post-transcriptional or post-translational regulation of proteins in tumor cells. Therefore, we assessed changes of expression of the candidate proteins upon PAM treatment in a panel of Vγ9Vδ2TCR-activating tumor cell lines, including breast cancer line MDA-MB 231, HEK293FT, renal cell carcinoma cell line MZ1851rc and head and neck cancer cell line SCC9, by performing Western blot analysis. In addition to BTN3 and RhoB we focused our further analysis on five out of eight new candidate proteins, against which reliable antibodies were available (PHLDB2, PKP2, SYNJ2, CARMIL1, PA2G4) that allowed both Western blot and cellular expression analysis. We found that PAM treatment induced a significant increase of RhoB and SYNJ2 protein, and decrease of PHLDB2 protein expression in all tested cell lines in the presence of PAM (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5D</xref>). Next, we compared protein expression in HEK293FT wt and HEK BTN3 KO cells in the presence, and absence of PAM, of the newly identified proteins, and observed a partial loss of expression of SYNJ2, suggesting that its expression is partially co-regulated with BTN3A1 <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 5E</xref>). To further map how BTN3A interaction dynamics occur with our new five candidate proteins in a PAM-dependent manner, we analyzed co-localization between BTN3A membrane clusters and each of the candidate proteins, using confocal microscopy in MZ1851RCcells. Examples of the region of interest selections and representative images are shown in (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6A and B</xref>). We found that while PHLDB2 moves out of BTN3A membrane clusters upon PAM treatment, SYNJ2 and CARMIL1 moves into them, within the range of approximately 200 nm (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</bold> To confirm if PHLDB2, SYNJ2 and CARMIL1 truly interact with BTN3A1 in tumor cell membranes, we studied interaction at higher resolution, measured by Proximity ligation assay (PLA) which can visualize protein interactions within approximately 40 nm. Similarly to the previously described small GTPase RHOB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, SYNJ2 and CARMIL1 both showed a significant PAM-dependent interaction with BTN3A1, while PHLDB2 showed no significant interaction with BTN3A1 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6C</xref>). To understand whether next to spatial regulation at the protein level, the expression of the genes investigated here is regulated similarly to BTNs, we examined the AKPS mutant CRC model gene expression data. While CARMIL1 and RHOB gene expression strongly correlated with BTN3A1 gene expression both in our normal colon and AKPS CRC models, PHLDB2 and SYNJ2 expression did not seem to be linked to these changes, suggesting that the involvement of these molecules in BTN3A1 expression is regulated entirely post-transcriptionally (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</bold> To demonstrate that the BTN3A1-network identified here is significant for the immunosurveillance of Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells in a clinically more relevant setting, we knocked out the individual candidate genes in AKPS mutant organoids using the CRISPR/Cas system, and tested Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells reactivity against them.

One of these is how tumor recognition is triggered, and another is how exactly it is regulated.</p><p id="P16">Here, we have demonstrated that potential sensitivity to the Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells is imprinted as early as after single mutations in a variety of oncogenes. We show that AKT phosphorylation and mTOR activity via enhanced PI3K activity in transformed cells results in enhanced BTN2A1 surface expression, the ligand for the gamma chain of Vγ9Vδ2TCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, and thereby makes early transformed cells susceptible for Vγ9Vδ2TCR recognition. However, this step alone is not sufficient for recognition by Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells, and requires additional upregulation of BTN3A1. We found that in primary pre-cancerous lesions, cells can express either BTN2A1 alone, or BTN2A1 together with additional molecules of the BTN3 complex, which implies earlier tumor control by Vγ9Vδ2T cells in some, but not all pre-cancerous lesions. This observation supports our implication that full activation of T cells via the Vγ9Vδ2TCR requires additional parallel steps. These additional steps include increased levels of intracellular phospho-antigens (pAg), which can be mimicked by aminobisphosphonates, like PAM. Although we could not characterize the natural trigger of BTN3A upregulation, the PAM-model system implied that phosphorylation of the juxtamembrane (JTM) region of BTN3A1 is essential in achieving full recognition by Vγ9Vδ2T cells, and provided a group of kinases most likely responsible for this step. Together, these molecular events result in a tightly regulated composition of membrane expressed BTN2A1 and BTN3A1, which is fed by a constant intracellular protein pool. While intracellular pAg-induced changes in total expression of BTN proteins were minimal, we found additional series of spatial rearrangements directly related to BTN3A1, and identified three novel functionally relevant proteins, CARMIL1, SYNJ2, and PHLDB2, that showed PAM-dependent spatial dynamics.</p><p id="P17">Our data, in line with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> imply that BTN2A1 and BTN3A1 membrane expression dynamics are tightly regulated together in human cells. It has been previously suggested that various pathways including AMPK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> or EBV-induced activation of JNK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> can influence BTN surface expression by enhancing transcription of BTN2A1 and BTN3A. To the contrary, we found the total BTN2A1 protein pool does not differ between normal (healthy) and transformed cells, however, in normal cells we found either no, or low surface expression. And despite the contribution of these studies to an increased understanding of regulation of Vγ9Vδ2T cell targeting, it is still unknown at exactly what stage of tumorigenesis Vγ9Vδ2T cells begin to recognize and eliminate transformed cells. In this study, we show that single mutations that induce higher PI3K activity were sufficient to allow expression of BTN2A1 at the cell membrane, and enable sustained binding of the gamma chain of the Vγ9Vδ2TCR. This observation implies that Vγ9Vδ2TCR-based therapies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> are targeting tumors with oncogenic mutations promoting PI3K activity even with low mutational load. The fact that not only artificial organoids mutated for all tumor associated genes, but also patient derived colorectal organoids are recognized by Vγ9Vδ2TCR cells, shows that these molecular rearrangements are preserved during tumor development, and will allow for targeting of primary, and most likely, metastatic lesions as well. Our data demonstrating that depletion of PI3 kinase activity, (in particular AKT phosphorylation and mTOR activity), in tumor cells impairs Vγ9Vδ2TCR reactivity, implies that targeted therapies acting on the PI3K pathway should be carefully designed, as they might interfere with endogenous innate responses against the tumor. On the other hand, PI3K activation in tumors, next to PAM treatment, might provide a new avenue to possibly sensitize tumors for Vγ9Vδ2TCR-driven attack. Combining the knowledge from these studies with next generation engineering strategies such as TEGs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, and Gamma delta TCR anti-CD3 bispecific molecules (GABs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> may provide the opportunity to to maximize the targeting potential via Vγ9Vδ2TCRs.</p><p id="P18">In contrast to the previously mentioned JNK pathway, which is a downstream signaling pathway of PI3K/AKT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, AMPK and AKT are often seen to act as antagonists in regulating autophagy and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.

It is also possible that for the initial trigger, BTN2A1 surface expression, an oncogenic PI3K-activating mutation is necessary, but that further regulation and enhancement can be achieved by other pathways, such as AMPK.</p><p id="P19">While PI3K activity directly affected re-localization of BTN2A1 to the cell membrane, BTN3A1 surface expression remained unaffected by this oncogenic offset. Although we have not been able to identify the precise molecular steps needed for upregulation of BTNs, we show that the ability to be susceptible to Vγ9Vδ2T cells is imprinted early in pre-cancerous lesions. We show that accumulation of intracellular pAg is required, and that dysregulation of the mevalonate pathway is a frequent hallmark of malignant transformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, and that it leads to this accumulation of pAgs. We used aminobisphosphonates (ABP), like PAM as a model system to characterize the next molecular steps. Therefore, the oncogenic-regulated translocation of BTN2A1 to the cell surface and the subsequent binding of pAg to the B30.2 domain of BTN3A1 upon ABP treatment, eventually leads to heterodimerization of BTN2A1 and BTN3A1, and ultimately to TCR binding and activation.</p><p id="P20">Recently, pAgs were shown to act as the glue between BTN molecules BTN2A1 and BTN3A1 to activate Vγ9Vδ2T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and previously, the juxtamembrane (JTM) region was identified as being sensitive for translating pAg-induced inside-out-signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. We have now identified two amino acids that are likely to be phosphorylated specifically upon PAM treatment, and phosphorylation of these sites was associated with higher IFNγ production by Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells upon co-culture.</p><p id="P21">Furthermore, our data suggests that phosphorylation of JTM BTN3A1 sites promotes interaction with RhoB and heterodimerization of BTN3A1 and BTN2A1, which will ultimately stabilize BTN2A1 at the cell surface, and will further increase in membrane surface clusters of BTNs that together will form immunological synapses that enable proper T cell activation. These events are not only present in very early transformation events, but are likely also preserved in the late stages of tumors, since colorectal organoids mutated for all four colon cancer associated oncogenes are equally recognized by Vγ9Vδ2TCR T cells as single <italic>APC</italic> mutated.</p><p id="P22">A closer look at downstream mechanisms after expression of BTN2A1 and BTN3A1 at the cell membrane surface allowed us to reveal that BTN2A1/BTN3A1 surface dynamics are tightly regulated by spatial rearrangements of intracellular modulators which have not yet been described, but are functionally essential to allow Vγ9Vδ2TCR targeting. In this study we established a detailed ABP-dependent interactome of BTN3A1-related proteins using various protein proximity techniques that resolved spatial interaction hierarchies among the studied proteins. PHLDB2 was found, as the only protein of all of the candidates to occupy BTN3A1-proximity membrane clusters, without showing detectable direct close interaction with BTN3A1, implying its role in tissues when no functional recognition by Vγ9Vδ2T cells can yet occur. PHLDB2 dissociates from these clusters either once PAM is present, or in tumor lesions with increased pAg levels, suggesting a complementary role in preventing the accumulation of BTN protein membrane clusters, as also suggested by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P23">We have shown in the past, that active RhoB relocates to the cell membrane in the vicinity of BTN3A1 dimers, and plays a crucial role in the high turn-over of BTN3A1 in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.

While we found proof on multiple levels for co-localization or interaction with BTN3A1 in a PAM-dependent manner with CARMIL1, SYNJ2 and PHLDB2, their relationship to BTN2A1 remains unclear.

We found that an activated PI3K pathway in single oncogene mutated tumors creates the basis for the susceptibility of cancer cells to Vγ9Vδ2TCR. However, this step is not sufficient for recognition. Increased levels of pAgs, either induced by PAM or endogenously increased as often observed in cancer cells, are essential for recognition by Vγ9Vδ2TCR. Within this context we identified phosphorylation of the BTN3A1 JTM region as an additional independent mechanism needed to achieve a complex recognized by a Vγ9Vδ2TCR. We identified three novel key players, namely CARMIL1, SYNJ2 and PHLDB2, that directly regulate BTN3A1 surface expression, and therefore control BTN2A1-BTN3A1 dimer dynamics on the cell surface. These findings not only shed light on the role of Vγ9Vδ2T cells during early cancer immune surveillance, but also have implications for all Vγ9Vδ2T cell based immune therapies.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Antibodies</title><p id="P26">The following antibodies were used: Anti-CD277/BTN3A Alexa Fluor 647 (FAB7316R, Clone 849203), Anti-CD277/BTN3A PE MAb (FAB7316P, Clone 849203), anti-CD277/BTN3A (clone 20.1, LSC106569), pan-γδTCR PE (IMMU510, B49176), Granzyme B APC (QA16A02, 372204), CD107a PE (H4A3), CD8a PerCP-Cy5.5 (RPA-T8, 301032), anti-RhoB mouse monoclonal (C-5, sc-8048), anti-RhoB rabbit polyclonal (abcam, ab170611), anti-CD3 (clone: OKT3), Goat-anti-Rabbit AF488 IgG (H+L), anti-Rabbit AF488 Fab fragment, Goat-anti-Mouse AF488 IgG (H+L), anti-LRRC16A/CARMIL1 Rabbit polyclonal IgG (NBP1-91221), anti-PHLDB2 Rabbit polyclonal IgG (NBP2-38238), anti-CASKIN1 Rabbit polyclonal IgG (HPA055990), anti-HNRNPC mouse monoclonal IgG (AMAb91010), anti-PKP2 Rabbit polyclonal IgG (PA553144), anti-ANKRD26 Rabbit polyclonal IgG (PA559240), anti-VPS13A Rabbit polyclonal IgG (PA554483), anti-TANC1 Rabbit polyclonal IgG (PA557797), anti-SDK2 Rabbit polyclonal IgG (ABIN1386438), anti-NBEA rabbit Polyclonal IgG (HPA040385), anti-PA2G4 Mouse monoclonal IgG (ABIN518579), anti-SYNJ2 Rabbit polyclonal IgG (PA556784).

Cells were washed once and then split into two samples: donor and donor+acceptor. Donor samples were incubated with FACS buffer and donor+acceptor samples were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature, with an antibody conjugated with the acceptor fluorochrome at 50μl staining volume. After washing with FACS buffer twice, samples were fixed with 1% PFA. The donor fluorescence was measured using a FACS Canto-II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) where donor fluorescence of the donor+acceptor (double stained) samples was compared with one of the samples labeled only with the donor antibody. FRET efficiency was calculated from the fractional decrease of the donor fluorescence in the presence of the acceptor. Background noise in the donor fluorescent channel due to spectral overlap with different fluorescence channels was excluded from the calculations, by subtracting the measured mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on unlabeled and single stained samples from the MFI of the donor and donor+acceptor samples respectively. The centrifugation steps during washes were done at 1500RPM for 5 minutes, and the antibodies were diluted in FACS buffer.

Percentage of activation was normalized at each experiment to wild type target cells HEK 293T or MZ1851rc. Each gene is ranked according to the fold change in mean activation level relative to the control condition denoted as ‘Scrambled’. The genes are displayed in descending order of this fold change. Color coding indicates the direction of change compared to the ‘Scrambled’ baseline. (median is represented in box-and-whisker plots). A linear model (lm()) was employed to assess the differences in activation levels across the (knocked-down) genes. To dissect the differences between each gene and the ‘Scrambled’ control, estimated marginal means (EMMs) were calculated for each gene using the emmeans() function from the emmeans R package. Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were conducted employing Dunnett’s test. The results from these pairwise comparisons were summarized to include confidence intervals and adjusted p-values: Each comparison was annotated with significance markers to visually denote the level of statistical significance: **** for p &lt; 0.001, *** for p &lt; 0.01, ** for p &lt; 0.05, * for p &lt; 0.1, empty (ns) for non-significant results.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS200701-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Candidate proteins differentially colocalize with BTN3A in membrane clusters.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Protein expression on 5 different targeted tumor cell lines was determined in the absence and presence of PAM by Western Blot, expression differences (PAM vs no PAM) as ratios are depicted in the figure<bold>.
