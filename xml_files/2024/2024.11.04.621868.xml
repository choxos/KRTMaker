Little is known about the <italic>Leishmania</italic> replication stress response. In this study, we reveal the global dynamics of the replication stress response in <italic>L. major</italic> promastigotes by performing ChIP-seq on three key replication stress response proteins, γH2A, RPA1 and RAD9, in the absence and presence of replication stress. We show that common ‘hotspots’ of replication stress correlate with DNA replication initiation and transcription termination in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. When DNA replication is stalled, replication stress response factors accumulate at early S-phase origins, with a signal pattern reminiscent of bidirectional replication fork progression. Under conditions of chronic replication stress, increased accumulation of replication stress response factors emerges at wider sites of transcription initiation, suggesting <italic>Leishmania</italic> may possess compensatory strategies to limit the effects of replication stress and ensure DNA replication can complete under these conditions. In contrast, chronic replication stress enhances RSR factor accumulation at transcription termination sites, highlighting these regions as key replication stress ‘hotspots’ in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Lastly, variations in RPA dynamics in ATR-deficient cells uncover crucial roles of this protein kinase in managing polycistronic transcription and DNA replication, particularly under replication stress, in <italic>Leishmania.</italic></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RPA</kwd><kwd>yH2A</kwd><kwd>9-1-1</kwd><kwd>ChIP-seq</kwd><kwd>replication stress</kwd><kwd><italic>Leishmania</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In most eukaryotes, DNA synthesis begins at the onset of S-phase from multiple DNA replication origins per chromosome licensed during late mitosis and G1 phase[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. At replication forks (RFs), the replicative helicase moves along the leading DNA strand to unwind the double helix, exposing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and the DNA is copied through the actions of DNA polymerases. If these activities become uncoupled, the exposed ssDNA becomes susceptible to nucleolytic attack, base damage, and secondary structure formation that undermine genome stability if unresolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. To preserve ssDNA integrity, single-stranded binding proteins (SSBs) bind to and protect ssDNA, a role primarily fulfilled in eukaryotes by the highly conserved heterotrimeric complex Replication Protein A (RPA), consisting of three subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. RPA-coated ssDNA then recruits the kinase Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3 Related (ATR) and RSR factors including, but not limited to, the heterotrimeric clamp 9-1-1 (RAD9-RAD1-HUS1) and an obligatory interacting partner for ATR (e.g., ATR-interacting partner; ATRIP) protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Activated ATR phosphorylates a myriad of downstream factors to halt cell cycle, stabilise RFs and slow origin firing, ultimately limiting the formation of harmful double-strand breaks (DSBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]: inhibiting ATR or following prolonged periods of replication stress (RS) induces ssDNA-RPA accumulation, increased origin firing, and a rise in stalled and collapsed RFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Given the importance of RPA during DNA replication and in the RSR, this complex has been instrumental in mapping the genome-wide distribution of collapsed RFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], and wider regions of DNA damage[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Mapping the dynamics of yH2A and 9-1-1 during RS has also been used previously to locate damaged RFs and DNA breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p id="P3"><italic>Leishmania</italic> are parasitic protozoans that cause the neglected tropical disease (NTD) Leishmaniasis, which is endemic in ~ 90 countries across the tropics and subtropics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Unusually, <italic>Leishmania</italic>, and related kinetoplastids, completely rely on polycistronic transcription of their genome, an arrangement that potentially poses a unique challenge for the management of replication-transcription conflicts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Marker Frequency Analysis followed by next generation sequencing (MFA-seq) revealed a single early-S replication initiation site per chromosome, located within a strand switch region (SSR) rich in acetylated histone H3 (AcH3), Base J, and the kinetochore factor KKT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], suggesting these sites additionally support centromere formation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Moreover, MFA-seq also supports the co-orientation of the leading strand with transcription, potentially enabling <italic>Leishmania</italic> to avoid machinery collisions within the chromosome cores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Mapping origin sites using Single Molecular Analysis of Replicated DNA (SMARD) revealed multiple origins per chromosome, but their locations relative to transcriptional activity are unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] whereas Short Nascent Strand (SNS-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]) suggests that <italic>Leishmania</italic> chromosomes possess hundreds of origins, though these sites overlap with features related to mRNA maturation, leaving their role in replication initiation unclear. To date, no study has fully described the <italic>Leishmania</italic> DNA replication program or its interactions with the parasite’s multigenic transcription landscape. In addition, little is known about how <italic>Leishmania</italic> manage interactions between DNA replication and transcription machineries. Genomic regions at the ends of multigenic units (Strand Switch Regions; SSRs), are used to regulate both replication and transcription activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Transcription initiation sites are marked by acetylated histone H3 (AcH3;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]) and transcription termination sites by the glycosylated thymidine base J [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. However, little is known about the RSR in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. The <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome encodes a complete 9-1-1 complex, RPA complex, and the ATR kinase, suggesting core aspects of the RSR are retained, with functional studies of these factors revealing roles in cell cycle progression, RS and the response to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. However, <italic>Leishmania</italic> appears to lack a CHK1 homolog (downstream target of ATR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>] and additionally harbours divergent 9-1-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] and RPA functions, raising questions as to the specific dynamics of their RSR. In fact, the remarkable plasticity endured by the <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome, such as extensive chromosome and gene copy number alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>], single nucleotide polymorphisms, and the production of extrachromosomal DNA elements in the form of linear or circular molecules of DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], suggests otherwise, indicating a less stringent RSR, particularly given subtelomeric duplication may require components of the 9-1-1 complex in <italic>Leishmania</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P4">RPA1 in <italic>Leishmania</italic> is required for telomere protection, the DNA damage response and ssDNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>], whereas investigations into RPA2, in <italic>T. brucei</italic> reveal functions associated with both DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]and the RSR[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>] suggesting the RPA complex has broad functions pertaining to genome stability in these parasites. However, given RPA1’s demonstrated capacity to interact and bind ssDNA in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, we reasoned that RPA1, as a proxy for the RPA complex, would enable the global profiling of the interactions between a protein that is located directly at RFs and is functionally linked to the RSR in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. In this study, we performed ChIP-seq on <italic>L. major</italic> promastigote cells with endogenously tagged RPA1, in the absence and presence of acute and chronic conditions of RS induced by Hydroxyurea (HU). To assess genotoxic stress and putative sites of DNA damage, we additionally mapped the locations of RAD9 (9-1-1 complex) and yH2A, a marker of DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. Additionally, to investigate the process under sustained RS, we analysed RPA1 dynamics in an ATR-deficient mutant.</p><p id="P5">We show that RPA1 accumulates at DNA replication sites during early-S phase, in keeping with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Altogether, our work highlights key events of replication-transcription conflict or replication initiation found at the boundaries of polycistronic transcription units (PTUs), reflecting the unique organisation of gene expression in this and related kinetoplastids. The relative lack of such interactions within the PTUs suggests undetected mechanisms to minimise conflicts between actively moving DNA replication and transcription machineries. The data may also suggest a means to ensure copying of at least the larger chromosomes during RS conditions. Furthermore, variations in peak sizes and signal distribution in ATR-deficient cells reveals key roles for this kinase in the management of multigenic transcription and genome duplication, exemplified by induction of RS, in <italic>L. major</italic> promastigotes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>Leishmania</italic> RPA1 forms nuclear foci under Replication Stress</title><p id="P6">To investigate whether RPA1 responds to RS in <italic>L. major</italic>, we performed immunoblotting on total protein extracts from cells exposed to either acute (5 mM; 2 and 8 hrs) or chronic (0.5 mM; 8 and 20 hrs) HU treatment and probed for RPA1 (using <italic>L. major</italic> anti-RPA1) and yH2A (using <italic>T. brucei</italic> anti-yH2A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. Both acute and chronic HU treatments increased the levels of yH2A, relative to controls, indicating enhanced DNA damage due to HU stress. However, the total protein levels of RPA1 remained unchanged compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SFig. 1A</xref>). We hypothesized that under replication stress, the RPA complex might reorganize into nuclear foci, similar to the behaviour of RPA after exposure to DNA damage in <italic>T. brucei</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] and <italic>T. cruzi</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. To investigate RPA1 foci formation in <italic>L. major</italic> cells, we generated a 3xMyc-RPA1 cell line (referred to as RPA1myc) by fusing three copies of the Myc epitope to the N-terminus of RPA1 using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). PCR confirmed the correct integration of the tag into the locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>), and immunoblotting with anti-Myc (Fig. S1D; left) and anti-RPA1 (Fig. S1D; right) antibodies verified the expression of the fusion protein at the expected molecular mass (~56 kDa). RPA1myc cells did not show any significant growth or cell cycle defects relative to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E&amp;F; Supplementary Data 3</xref>), indicating expression of the fusion protein does not affect parasite proliferation.</p><p id="P7">In unperturbed RPA1myc cells, indirect immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) revealed a diffuse Myc signal (green) localizing exclusively at the location of the larger DAPI signal (blue) from the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>; <bold>left panel;</bold> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1G and H</xref> show untagged control cells), confirming that RPA1 is a nuclear protein in <italic>L. major</italic>. When parasites were subject to replication stress conditions via treatment with 5 mM HU for 10 hours, we detected distinct nuclear foci of Myc signal in approximately 25% of the cells, compared to less than 1% in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <bold>right panel;</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). The presence of nuclear RPA foci suggests enhanced recruitment of RPA1 to the chromatin. To assess whether the 3xMycRPA1 protein becomes chromatin-enriched under replication stress, we performed chromatin fractionation with and without HU treatment. Following the acute HU treatment, we observed an ~3-fold increase in Myc signal associated with the chromatin fraction, while the signal in other soluble fractions decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1I</xref>). These findings demonstrate that RPA1 in <italic>L. major</italic> becomes enriched on chromatin and forms nuclear foci in response to HU treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ATR-deficiency enhances replication stress in <italic>Leishmania</italic></title><p id="P8">Accumulation of RPA-coated ssDNA promotes activation of ATR in response to RS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Considering that ATR inhibition leads to excessive origin firing and accumulation of ssDNA in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], we investigated the dynamics of RPA1 in an ATR-deficient RPA1myc cell line. We opted to truncate one allele of ATR in RPA1myc cells by removing a C-terminal proportion of the ORF encoding the kinase domain using CRISPR/Cas9 editing, generating the cell line 3xMycRPA1<sup>ATRDC+/-</sup> (referred to hereafter as ATRΔC+/-) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). Truncation of one allele of ATR in the ATRΔC+/- cells was confirmed by PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>) and Southern blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). We found no significant alteration to parasite proliferation in ATR-deficient cells, nor enhanced sensitivity to HU (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D&amp;E</xref>). To determine if ATRΔC+/- cells show other signs of ATR deficiency, we asked if ATRΔC+/- cells accumulate ssDNA by assessing ssDNA levels using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>) and IFA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F&amp;G</xref>) through the detection of incorporated IdU (a thymidine analogue) under native conditions. In the absence of HU-induced replication stress, we detected a ~ 5-fold increase in ssDNA levels in ATRΔC+/- cells compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). After HU exposure, the percentage of ssDNA positive cells significantly increased compared with untreated controls at 8 hrs 5 mM HU (acute) and 8 hrs 0.5 mM HU (chronic). A similar trend was observed by IFA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1F&amp;G</xref>) where ssDNA positive cells increased in ATRΔC+/- cells compared with controls after HU exposure. In addition, we detected a significant increase in the fluorescence intensity of the RPAmyc signal in ATRΔC+/- cells, relative to controls, which significantly increased under conditions of RS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2G</xref>). Altogether, these findings suggest that ATR deficiency enhances replication stress in <italic>L. major</italic>, even in the absence of HU.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Genome-wide mapping of yH2A, RPA1 and RAD9 in unperturbed <italic>L. major</italic> reveals RPA1 at sites of DNA replication initiation</title><p id="P9">To delinate the RSR in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, we first sought to map the genome-wide distribution of RPA1 in asynchronously dividing promastigotes by ChIP-seq, targeting the 3xMycRPA fusion protein expressed in both RPA1myc and ATRΔC+/- cells using ChIP-grade anti-myc antiserum. To evaluate the implications of the localization, we also investigated the global dynamics of yH2A using anti-yH2A antiserum, aiming to identify sites of pronounced replication stress and/or DNA damage[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Additionally, we examined the location of the 9-1-1 complex, which is recruited to damaged RFs and DNA breaks under RS conditions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. We also used RAD9 as a proxy for the 9-1-1 complex by performing ChIP-seq in a cell line expressing 12xMyc epitope fused to the C-terminus of RAD9 (RAD9myc[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]). Two independent experiments were performed for each 3xMyc-RPA1-expressing cell line and for the yH2A ChIP-seq, with high reproducibility between replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A-D</xref>). ChIP-sep of RAD9 was performed once, with ChIP-seq of the HUS1 subunit provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref> as support for the locations of RAD9. Whole chromosome plots are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 2</xref>.</p><p id="P10">RPA1 ChIP signals from RPA1myc and ATRΔC+/- cells and RAD9 ChIP signal from RAD9myc cell line were strongly correlated (Pearson coefficient: 0.88 - 0.92; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>), suggestive of a similar enrichment pattern. To investigate this correlation further, we centered the ChIP signal from RPA1-enriched regions in RPA1myc cells (defined by MACS2) and analyzed the profile of yH2A, RAD9, and RPA1 in ATRΔC+/- cells in relation to these RPA1-bound sites. We used k-means clustering to group regions with similar signal patterns for γH2A, RPA1, and RAD9. Consequently, we identified three distinct signal clusters, encompassing a total of 89 enriched regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In cluster 1, which exhibited the strongest and broadest RPA1 enrichment, approximately 97% of the regions overlapped with the previously mapped early-S phase DNA replication initiation sites[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>], suggesting that one of the major sites of RPA accumulation are coincident with single DNA replication origins detected by MFA-seq in S- phase in <italic>L. major</italic>. These sites also showed co-enrichment with RAD9, indicating RS and/or DNA damage at DNA replication initiation sites. We found no evidence of yH2A accumulation upstream or downstream of the early-S DNA replication origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Cluster 2, which also showed both RPA and RAD9 accumulation, primarily matched transcription termination sites, with approximately 80% of the enriched regions overlapping with sites decorated with BaseJ alone or by both BaseJ and AcH3. SNS-seq predicted DNA replication initiation at transection termination sites that was not detected by MFA-seq[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]; since these sites accumulate both RPA and RAD9, it is more likely that replication stress and not DNA replication initiation is being detected, perhaps suggesting that transcription termination sites are ‘pronounced sites of RS. Only ~ 6% of the enriched regions in cluster 2 overlapped with AcH3 alone (sites associated with transcription initiation only). Lastly, in cluster 3, which exhibited the weakest enrichment signals, approximately 62% of the regions overlapped with various other genomic features including inter-CDS sites and UTRs, indicating wider sites of DNA instability and/or repair which could be associated with trans-splicing activity and/or polyadenylation. These regions also accumulate RNA-DNA hybrids in both <italic>Leishmania</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>] and <italic>T. brucei</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>], and are therefore likely more prone to elevated levels of ssDNA formation.</p><p id="P11">MACS2 was then used to call peaks across all samples, after which the peaks were filtered to exclude regions of high coverage (‘shade areas’[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]), resulting in the identification of 81 RPA1 peaks in RPA1myc cells and 153 RPA1 peaks in ATRΔC+/- cells, as well as 205 RAD9 peaks in the RAD9myc cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B&amp;C</xref>). The approximately 1.8-fold increase in RPA1 peaks in ATRΔC+/- cells compared to the RPA1myc cell line aligns with the increased ssDNA signal observed in earlier data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F&amp;G</xref>), indicating heightened RS and/or damage when ATR is deficient. Notably, of the 63 common RPA1 and RAD9 peaks found exclusively in ATRΔC+/- and RAD9myc cells, over 50% (33 peaks) co-localized with SSRs associated with transcription initiation, including 8 peaks located at subtelomeric sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E</xref>). This suggests that ATR function is particularly relevant for stabilizing these specific regions. Unique RPA1 peaks were found in RPA1myc (3 peaks) and ATRΔC+/- cells (13 peaks), while unique RAD9 peaks were observed in RAD9myc cells (70 peaks). These unique peaks were associated with various genomic features (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3F</xref>), including intergenic regions and gene coding sequences, which we propose reflect spontaneous genome instability events across the genome. Consistent with the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, nearly all the common RPA1 and RAD9 peaks (71) identified in both RPA1myc and ATRΔC+/- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) were located at the boundaries of polycistronic transcription units (PTUs). Specifically, 48% of these peaks (34) were associated with early-S origins. Additionally, 49% (32) were found at sites of transcription termination (head-to-tail and convergent SSRs). Only about 4% of the common peaks were located at sites of transcription initiation, either within the interior of chromosomes (divergent SSRs, 2.8%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) or at subtelomeres (AcH3 Telo, 1.4%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>)</p><p id="P12">Metaplot analysis confirmed broad enrichment of each protein at the early-S origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>), with RPA1 signal from RPA1myc and ATRΔC+/- cells largely overlapping. This suggests that ATR deficiency does not affect RPA1 accumulation at early-S DNA replication initiation sites in unperturbed cells. We noted a reduction in yH2A ChIP signal at the center of these sites, and little accumulation 20 kb +/- the regions, likely because these replication initiation sites are nucleosome-depleted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3E</xref>), preventing the generation of yH2A modification. In contrast, metaplot analyses of the other SSRs revealed sharp peaks for RPA and RAD9, but not yH2A, at sites where transcription initiates and/or terminates (AcH3/BaseJ or BaseJ sites) with markedly reduced peak sizes at transcription initiation sites (AcH3). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). No significant accumulation of either RPA or RAD9 was detected across the subtelomeres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3G</xref>).

To next investigate the dynamics of the RSR, we examined the localisation of yH2A, RPA1 and RAD9 following HU treatment, which inhibits dNTP synthesis and induces RS[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. We first treated RPA1myc, ATRΔC+/- and RAD9myc cells with 5 mM HU for 2 hrs and 8 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Under these conditions, the <italic>L. major</italic> cell cycle is stalled during G1/early-S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. We detected a strong correlation between replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>). Like untreated cells, normalized ChIP signals from RPA1myc, ATRΔC+/- and RAD9myc cells after 2 hrs and 8 hrs of HU exposure were highly correlated, indicating a consistent enrichment pattern (Pearson coefficient: 0.69-0.97; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B</xref>). Full chromosome signal plots are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 3</xref>.</p><p id="P15">By centering the ChIP-seq signals on RPA1-bound regions identified 2 hrs and 8 hrs after HU exposure in RPA1myc cells, we found that the ChIP signals largely remain in proximity to the RPA1-bound regions for 2 hrs, whereas at 8 hrs post HU treatment, we detected a wider enrichment of RPA1 around the origins in WT and ATRΔC+/- cells, while RAD9 remained more proximal to the origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3B&amp;C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4C</xref>). We investigated these observations further we examined the locations of the peaks called using MACS2 at 2 and 8 hrs after HU exposure for RAD9 and RPA1. At 2hrs, MACS2 identified 249 peaks in RPA1myc cells, 199 RPA1 peaks in ATRΔC+/- cells, and 249 RAD9 peaks in RAD9myc cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4D</xref>), after filtering, as described in the methods. The threefold increase in RPA1 peaks in RPA1myc cells compared to untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) indicates a significant enhancement of RS. In contrast, ATRΔC+/- cells showed a smaller increase (~30%) in RPA1 peaks. After 8 hrs of HU exposure, we observed 373 RPA1 peaks in RPA1myc cells, 237 RPA1 peaks in ATRΔC+/- cells, and 230 RAD9 peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4D</xref>). The 50% increase in RPA1 peaks in RPA1myc cells further highlights the active replication stress response in these cells. Despite the rise in RPA1 peaks at both time points, the number of RAD9 peaks only slightly increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We then analyzed ChIP signals associated with previously mapped early-S origin regions. After 2 hrs of HU exposure, we identified 155 common RPA1 and RAD9 peaks in both RPA1myc and ATRΔC+/- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). After 8 hrs, 188 common RPA1 and RAD9 peaks were observed between these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Approximately 20% of these common peaks colocalized with early-S origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D&amp;E</xref>), as nearly all early-S origins were enriched for RPA1 and RAD9, and in ATR-deficient cells. Thus, when compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), HU treatment induces a broader enrichment of factors to locations beyond the known sites of DNA replication initiation activity which themselves robustly recruit these two replication stress response factors. A more detailed analysis of signal enrichment at the origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F-G</xref>) revealed several key observations. First, as HU treatment progressed from 2 to 8 hours, the RPA1 signal significantly extended from all origins in both RPA1myc and ATRΔC+/- cells. This increase in RPA signal on both sides of the predicted origin regions indicates that RS, a known effect of HU exposure, is occurring. Second, RAD9 signal was also present around the early-S origins, but a modest broadening of the RAD9 signalling was only evident after 8 hrs of HU exposure, suggesting this RAD9 signal pattern reflects the parasites response to the accumulation of RPA-bound ssDNA. Finally, whilst untreated cells exhibited no definable yH2A signal accumulation in proximity to the origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>), HU treatment led to a modest increase in signal accumulation distal to both sides of the origins, mirroring that of the RPA1 signal and showing that HU treatment results in DNA damage around the origins (Fig. F&amp;G).</p><p id="P17">In ATRΔC+/- cells, the RPA1 signal was similar to untreated cells after 2 hrs, but at 8 hrs, though we detected a significant increase in peak size, compared with untreated ATR-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>), the peak appeared more restricted, and the peak sizes were overall shorter than RPA1 origin-associated peaks under the same treatment conditions. In all, we show that though ATR is not crucial for replication initiation, it is likely necessary for maintaining fork progression and/or stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Analysis of early origin-associated peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>) revealed a significant increase in the average size of the RPA1 peaks. After 8 hrs of HU treatment, RPA1 peaks were 10 times broader compared to untreated cells, while RAD9 peaks exhibited a 3-fold increase in width under the same conditions. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that the single origin previously identified by MFA-seq is a major locus of RPA and RAD9 accumulation, suggesting it is the most pronounced site of RS in each chromosome.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Acute replication stress drives RPA1 accumulation at transcription initiation sites</title><p id="P18">The chromatin binding profile of RS markers has been utilized previously to study events at unstable genomic regions, including at sites of DNA replication and transcription machinery collisions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Our data above shows that acute HU treatment, which causes cell cycle stalling, leads to a broader localization of RPA1 and RAD9 compared to untreated cells. In unperturbed cells, RPA1 and RAD9 enrichment was observed at early-S origins of replication (48%) and transcription termination sites (49%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, F</xref>); and only 1% of the RPA1 and RAD9 enrichment were found at transcription initiation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Therefore, we next explored the basis of the broader signals detected following acute HU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4</xref>). Our analysis of MACS2 peak localisation revealed that 2 hrs of HU exposure resulted in a 30-fold increase in peaks at transcription initiation sites, accounting for approximately 30% of the total common peaks. Additionally, around 26% (41 peaks) were found at both transcription initiation and termination sites, while only about 14% (21 peaks) were at transcription termination SSRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). A similar pattern emerged at 8 hrs post HU exposure, with ~28% of common peaks at transcription initiation sites, ~23% at both initiation and termination sites, and ~10% at transcription termination-only sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Overall, ~56% of the peaks at 2 hrs and ~50% at 8 hrs were associated with transcription initiation. The reduction in common peaks at transcription termination sites after HU treatment likely reflects HU slowing of DNA replication, leading to amelioration of transcription-replication conflicts at these locations. Conversely, the unscheduled interactions between DNA replication and transcription caused by HU-mediated replication inhibition can lead to wider instability. This is illustrated by the increased number of RPA1 and RAD9 peaks across various genomic regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Metaplot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>) revealed pronounced peaks of RPA1 and RAD9 at transcription termination sites (BaseJ; left panel), with a modest accumulation of yH2A flanking the center of these regions. However, at transcription initiation sites (AcH3; right panel), the peaks of RAD9 and especially RPA1 extended outward from a modest peak at the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). Minimal yH2A signal was observed flanking the center of these sites. At sites with both transcription initiation and termination activities (AcH3/BaseJ; middle panel), we observed broader peaks of RPA1 and RAD9. Overall, the RPA1 and Rad9 peak sizes at transcription termination sites (BaseJ) remained consistent across all samples and HU treatment time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). In contrast, RPA1 peaks at transcription initiation sites (AcH3) showed a significant increase in size at both 2 and 8 hrs of HU treatment compared to unperturbed cells. A similar, though less pronounced, pattern was observed at sites with both transcription initiation and termination activities. RAD9 exhibited a modest increase in peak size at 8 hrs post HU exposure at both AcH3 and AcH3/BaseJ sites. It is noteworthy that in ATRΔC+/- cells, RPA1 peaks were overall broader than those identified in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). This pattern further supports an elevated level of DNA damage and/or increased RS present in these cells. We next examined subtelomeric sites at both 2 and 8 hrs 5 mM HU exposure, revealling an accumulation of both RPA1 and RAD9 at chromosome ends under RS conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A-C</xref>). As these sites are nucleosome depleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] we consequently noted a reduction of yH2A in proximity to the subtelomeric region. Little difference was observed between RPA1 signals across ATR competent and ATR-deficient cells. When examining ChIP signal for RPA1, RAD9 and yH2A across subtelomeric-associated transcription initiation sites, we detected an accumulation of RPA1 and RAD9, with a very modest accumulation of yH2A emanating from the region center outwards bidirectionally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7D</xref>). From 2 hrs to 8 hrs the peaks of RPA1 significantly broadened relative to untreated cells and that in ATRΔC+/- cells, RPA1 peaks were overall broader. Though no significant increase in RAD9 peak size was detected, at 8 hrs the peaks we overall broader than 2 hrs and in untreated cells.</p><p id="P20">Taken together, these findings reveal that while transcription initiation sites are not major stress loci in untreated cells, they exhibit broad and bidirectional accumulation of RPA1 and RAD9 in HU-treated cells, resembling the pattern seen at early-S origins of replication. Under conditions of acute DNA replication stalling, the increased levels of RPA and RAD9 accumulation indicate that sites of transcription initiation are also putative sites of RS, in common with the origins and transcription termination sites.

We hypothesized that RS might trigger a compensatory adjustment in the density of initiation events. Therefore, we asked what effects are seen when cells are under mild RS conditions that are permissive for DNA replication. <italic>L. major</italic> promastigotes were exposed to a lower dose of HU to induce chronic RS (0.5 mM HU for 8 hrs). We confirmed by FACS analysis an accumulation of cells in S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Under these conditions, where DNA replication from early origins will have progressed, we can explore the dynamics of the cell’s response to RS. We investigated the accumulation patterns of RPA1 in RPA1myc and ATRΔC+/- cells, as well as the RAD9 signal in RAD9myc cells exposed to 0.5 mM HU for 8 hrs (ChIP-seq signal across each chromosome is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>). Under these chronic RS conditions, we observed a poor correlation between the RPA1 signal in RPA1myc cells and ATRΔC+/- cells. In contrast, the correlation between the RAD9 signal in RAD9myc cells and the RPA1 signal in ATRΔC+/- cells remained consistent; together this suggests that the pattern of RPA1 enrichment is altered in ATRΔC+/- cells exposed to chronic HU treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8A</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Centering the ChIP-seq signals on early-S origins revealed that, after exposure to 0.5 mM HU, the RPA1 and RAD9 signals were primarily enriched in a relatively narrow region around the origins, as observed in untreated cells. Additionally, the origin-proximal enrichment of RPA1 signal, within 70 Kb upstream or downstream, seen at the 5 mM HU treatment, was not detected in cells treated with 0.5 mM HU (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8B</xref>). Instead, these cells exhibited more distal, wider and less intense enrichment of RPA1, within 0.2 Mb from the origin site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B-D</xref>). Metaplots confirmed these similarities and differences around the mapped origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>) suggesting that the primary effect of chronic HU exposure is accumulation of RPA at RFs that eventually progress bidirectionally from putative replication iniation sites but are likely perturbed due to reduced levels of nucleotides. We found little difference in RPA1 signals between ATR competent and ATR-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Analysis of ChIP mapping beyond the early-S origins revealed that chronic HU treatment led to widespread accumulation of RPA1 and RAD9 across the genome, with a significant portion of the signal concentrated at PTU boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6</xref>). At transcription termination sites (BaseJ only), sharp peaks of RPA1 and RAD9 were detected, indicating these regions are a consistent hotspot for RS and/or DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). At transcription and termination sites (AcH3/BaseJ), sharp peaks of RPA1 and RAD9 were detected, along with a broadened signal extending towards the base of the peak across all cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). Notably, we detected broad peaks of RPA1, RAD9, and yH2A, which were observed upstream and downstream, extending approximately equivalent distances from the transcription initiation sites (AcH3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A and 6B</xref>). This pattern is reminiscent of the broad peaks identified after acute HU treatment at these AcH3-enriched sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), particularly at early-S origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Moreover, in ATR-deficient cells, we observed a modest decrease in peak amplitude compared to RPA1 in ATR competent cells, suggesting that ATR could play a role in maintaining RF stability at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). At subtelomeric regions, we identified an accumulation of RPA1 under chronic RS conditions, albeit at a more modest level when compared to acute RS conditions, with a slight reduction in RPA1 signal in ATR-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>). We found little accumulation of RAD9 at these sites and limited yH2A signal, likely due to the reduced nucleosome content within these regions. Thus, though RPA is recruited to ssDNA at these sites, the limited recruitment of RAD9 suggests mild RS exposure may be insufficient to trigger the RSR.</p><p id="P24">Altogether, we suggest that slowing of DNA replication by low levels of HU reveal that SSRs in <italic>Leishmania</italic> are sites for transcription-replication conflicts or replication initiation sites where sensing accumulated ssDNA stretches might be necessary to protect the RF integrity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">The organisation of transcription in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, and indeed in all kinetoplastids, is unique amongst eukaryotes, with virtually all genes transcribed from polycistrons. A consequence of this organisation is that RNA Pol must traverse long distances and, if transcription overlaps with S-phase, it is especially at risk from being impeded by DNA replication. This is the first study that has mapped the consequences of polycistronic transcription in both the absence and presence of RS conditions, uncovering dynamic interactions between DNA replication and transcription in these organisms.</p><p id="P26">Our global mapping of RPA1 dynamics in the absence of HU highlighted sites of DNA replication initiation during early S-phase as pronounced sites of RS. In the immediate origin centre, we detected sharp peaks of RPA1 and RAD9, indicative of localised DNA damage. Under condition of acute RS, the sharp peaks of RPA1 and RAD9 persisted within the origin centre, and additionally, bi-directional expansions of yH2A and RPA1 emerged, spread outwards from the origin centre. For yeasts and metazoans, and also <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>), the origin region is commonly nucleosome depleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>], therefore we were unable to map yH2A signal within the central portion. However, at 8 hrs (5 mM HU) the loss of yH2A immediately proximal to the origin region expanded, indicating the chromatin is more open. These signal patterns began accumulating at 2 hrs post HU exposure, suggesting this response is dynamic. The accumulation of yH2A and RPA1, suggests the presence of expanded ssDNA tracks, and therefore wider stalling of RFs; ssDNA accumulation is commonly a consequence of impaired DNA replication during which the DNA double strand is unwound but uncoupled from DNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].</p><p id="P27">Under these conditions, RAD9 in <italic>Leishmania</italic> primarily localises to origins, but we noted an expansion of the RAD9 peak, suggesting the recruitment of 9-1-1 to the immediate vicinity of the early-S phase origin likely due to enhanced RS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The recruitment of RSR factors to the origin, even in normally replicating promastigotes, suggests DNA replication initiation here induces especially pronounced levels of RS in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, which is exacerbated after HU treatment. It is likely that the prominence of RSR factors at these single sites in each chromosome reflects their constitutive activation during S-phase and explaining why they are so readily detected by MFA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. As these are also sites of both transcription initiation and termination activities, their constitutive use as origins will impose especially focused encounters between the transcription and replication machineries. Though leading DNA strand replication in <italic>Leishmania</italic> moves co-directionally with transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], during lagging strand duplication, head-on collisions between the replisome and the transcription machinery may become more common, inducing DNA breaks; however, we lack strand-specific information from our ChIP-seq analyses to confirm this hypothesis. Efficient, early origins in human cells are associated with enhanced mutagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>] and mutagenic DNA replication initiation coincides with genome evolution, influencing gene expression. As gene expression regulation in <italic>Leishmania</italic> is largely post-transcriptional, the consequences of enhanced RS and likely DNA breaks, within early origins on the regulation <italic>Leishmania</italic> gene expression are unknown. Could origin instability explain in part the frequency of aneuploidy in these parasites, by altering the behaviour of the kinetochore interaction thereby inducing mis-segregation of chromosomes? Enhanced levels of DNA breaks within early origins could increase the level of chromosome fusions, recombination events and genome instability, as reported frequently in DNA repair defective <italic>Leishmania</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>]. In the ATR-deficient mutants, RPA1 tracks were highly reduced in length. Though under these conditions, ssDNA becomes exposed, our data suggests that these cells are subject to enhanced fork collapse.</p><p id="P28">Additionally, under acute HU-induced RS, we uncovered an enhanced accumulation of RPA1 and RAD9 at SSRs, detecting a sharp peak of RAD9 and RPA1 confined to transcription termination sites. The peak amplitude and shape remained largely consistent at 2 and 8 hrs post HU exposure, suggesting these sites are constitute sites of RS, regardless of exposure length. In contrast, at sites of transcription initiation/termination or initiation only, we noted a sharp peak of RPA1 and RAD9 at the centre, which broadened outwards bidirectionally at 8 hrs. At sites of initiation only, the sharp peak at the centre was reduced in amplitude when compared to termination and initiation sites. In both instances, the lack of yH2A signal accumulation and the broad loss of yH2A at the central region outwards suggests a more open chromatin environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). We have not measured DNA replication under these conditions, and no previous work has detected DNA replication activity at all SSRs, even after HU stress[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], but these patterns of RSR enrichment at transcription initiation sites are reminiscent of the accumulation of these factors at the early-S origin, albeit more modestly. Moreover, increasing reduction of yH2A signal at the immediate centre outwards suggests increasingly open chromatin, a feature of sequence consensus-free DNA replication initiation sites[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. Perhaps, then, these data provide evidence for activation of ‘dormant’ origins at SSRs, which occurs at levels below MFA-seq detection. However, equally these data could be explained by the fact that the activity of RNA polymerase is not inhibited by HU treatment. Thus, under RS the transcription machinery can collide with HU-stalled DNA polymerase wherever it remains in the genome. As transcription start sites are the major sites of RNA polymerase loading, the accumulation of RSR factors to these regions may reflect this. In contrast, at sites of transcription termination, the lack of expanded RPA1 and RAD9 signals suggests localised damage (discussed below in more detail). When we examined the RPA1 signal in ATR-deficient cells, we noted, in contrast to the early-S origin, an increase in peak size at both 2 and 8 hrs relative to RPA1 in ATR competent cells. Thus, ATR may maintain the stability of the sites to prevent excessive ssDNA formation.</p><p id="P29">Conditions of mild RS (8 hrs, 0.5 mM HU) slow the progression of DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>]. We did not detect a broad enrichment of yH2A, RPA1 or RAD9 at the early-S origins, only a sharp central peak, suggestive of persistent RS within these sites. Instead, RSR factors accumulate broadly and extend outwards from transcription initiation exclusive SSRs. This pattern was absent at SSRs associated with transcription termination. Instead, sharp peaks of RPA1 and RAD9 were detected, irrespective of HU exposure indicating these sites are constitutive regions of instability and RS. In contrast to initiation sites of transcription, RNA polymerase is unloaded at sites of transcription termination and therefore should not be affected by HU treatment however in human cells, DNA replication terminates at sites of transcription termination[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>], perhaps suggest that the instability detected within <italic>Leishmania</italic> could reflects the same process, though more work is required to test this. Given these cells are primarily mid-S phase, the early-S origins have likely fired and progressed, explaining the loss of expanded, bidirectional peaks of yH2A and RPA1 at these sites. RS is associated with the firing of dormant origins in other eukaryotes to ensure replication completion and compensate for stalled RFs if the constitutive origin firing becomes inadequate. Thus, the accumulation of RSR factors largely at transcription initiation sites under chronic RS conditions might provide further evidence that these loci could act as dormant origins, ensuring DNA replication completion under stress. Indeed, evidence for the firing of a single putative dormant origin under RS has been shown in the related pathogen <italic>T. brucei</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>]. One possible benefit of placing a dormant origin at a transcription initiation site is the reduced possibility of head-on collisions with the transcription machinery thereby limiting the formation of DNA damage at these sites[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. The continuous presence of RAD9 at these sites is indicative of enhanced RS and DNA breaks, suggesting these sites may coincide with enhanced mutagenesis. We found a mild reduction in peak amplitude in ATR deficient cells, suggesting ATR is likely required to maintain the stability of these regions highlight the continual importance of ATR in <italic>Leishmania.</italic></p><p id="P30"><italic>Leishmania</italic> subtelomeric duplication appears compartmentalised, operating throughout the cell cycle and driven by RS-associated factors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. The clear accumulation of RPA1 and RAD9 signals within subtelomeric regions in both the absence of and during RS is suggestive of a direct relationship between enhanced RS and subtelomeric regions. Moreover, subtelomere-proximal sites of transcription initiation show similar patterns of RPA1 that are suggestive of replication initiation activity. Commonly, expanded gene families like the antigenic genes of pathogens are often located within the subtelomeres[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>] thus enhanced RS within subtelomeric regions may diversify multigene families however <italic>Leishmania</italic> subtelomeres are devoid of such genes, thus the importance of enhanced RS within such sites remains unclear.</p><p id="P31">In conclusion, our study provides the first detailed insights into the dynamics of RSR signalling proteins on the chromatin of <italic>Leishmania</italic>. We identify two major findings. First, the main sites of RS are the boundaries of the PTUs, where RNA polymerase is loaded and unloaded. Second, we observe limited accumulation of RSR factor within the PTUs, even following HU treatment. The alterations in RPA, RAD9, and yH2A signals at SSRs post-HU may suggest increased collisions resulting from DNA polymerase stalling, while RNA polymerase continues its loading and movement; however, these changes might also relate to DNA replication processes, such as the presence of putative ‘dormant’ origins at transcription initiation sites. A possible explanation for having a primary main origin per chromosome could be to minimize collisions between DNA replication and transcription at the few sites where their assembly and disassembly are synchronized. Furthermore, our findings may indicate the existence of previously unrecognized pathways that rapidly resolve conflicts between DNA replication and transcription within PTUs, ensuring continuous RNA polymerase movement and efficient gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Lead Contact and Materials Availability</title><p id="P32">All enquiries regarding additional information/reagents and resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Prof. Luiz R.

However, cells need ways to rapidly adapt and respond to stimuli. In some cases, these beneficial adaptations come from problems during replication. <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites cause serious neglected infections in humans and animals across the world’s tropics and sub-tropics. Remarkably, recent evidence suggests that <italic>Leishmania</italic> DNA experiences enhanced stress during replication that can drive its ability to rapidly adapt in response to stress. How L<italic>eishmania</italic> respond to DNA replication stress is still poorly understood. Here, using a genome-wide approach to map the locations of key proteins that manage DNA replication stress and maintain genome integrity, we show ‘hotspots’ of DNA replication stress coincide with start sites of DNA replication and regions of transcription termination.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>RPA1 forms nuclear foci in the presence of replicative stress</title><p>(A) Immunoblot showing RPA1 and yH2A signal after exposure to HU at two concentrations (0.5 mM and 5 mM) at the times shown in the figure.
