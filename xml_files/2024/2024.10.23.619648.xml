We show that <italic>Malat1</italic> is required for appropriate cytokine expression in female but not male Th2 cells. <italic>Malat1</italic> deficiency impairs <italic>in vitro</italic> Th2 differentiation of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from female mice, characterised by transcriptome-wide effects and suppression of cytokine expression, particularly IL10. Upon IL10R blockade a pronounced effect is also seen on IL4 and IL13. Mechanistically, naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> female mice demonstrate altered early activation kinetics and impaired early differentiation gene expression, including up-regulation of an interferon stimulated gene (ISG) module. This is followed by suppression of IL2Rα and IL2Rγ expression and IL2-mediated differentiation. Mimicking the effect of <italic>Malat1</italic> loss by maintaining early ISG expression in <italic>WT</italic> cells with IFNβ treatment partially phenocopies the effects of <italic>Malat1</italic> deficiency. A subset of the effects of <italic>Malat1</italic> loss in female cells is also observed in male cells. However, this does not affect endpoint Th2 differentiation. Male CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells demonstrate stronger early activation, higher ISG expression during early differentiation, maintenance of IL2Rα expression independently of <italic>Malat1</italic>, and lower sensitivity to exogenous IL2 during late differentiation compared to female cells. <italic>In vivo</italic>, female, but not male, <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice demonstrate altered Th2 cytokine expression characterised by a reduction in IL10<sup>+</sup> Th2 cells in both lung and spleen following priming and challenge with <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> eggs, a model of lung type 2 inflammation. Overall, these findings reveal <italic>Malat1</italic> as a novel determinant of immune sexual dimorphism.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Th2 cells</kwd><kwd>Immune sexual dimorphism</kwd><kwd>lincRNAs</kwd><kwd>IL10</kwd><kwd><italic>Malat1</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Biological sex is a known determinant of immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Higher incidence or severity of autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) in females and infectious diseases in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) are commonly reported. The main drivers of immune sexual dimorphism are sex hormones (extrinsic) and X or Y chromosome-linked genes (intrinsic). For example, it is thought that females favour Th2 responses and males Th1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) and that this is due to hormonal regulation of immune genes such as IL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), and function of X chromosome-linked genes including the long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) <italic>Xist</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), which was recently shown to form ribonucleoprotein complexes that are directly involved in autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Other mechanisms including those occurring at the post-transcriptional level, have been proposed, yet very little has been experimentally tested and validated. Overall, little is understood about cell intrinsic mediators of sexual dimorphism in Th cells that are not directly linked to sex hormone-mediated or sex chromosome-driven regulation.</p><p id="P5">Thousands of long non-coding transcripts, including lincRNAs, have been discovered in mammalian transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In most cases, these are medium to lowly expressed transcripts displaying poor conservation across mammals. Our studies have focused on <italic>Malat1</italic>, a 7.5kb-long transcript discovered through an association with cancer progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). <italic>Malat1</italic> is localised in nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), which are nuclear foci enriched in factors involved in pre-mRNA splicing and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). It was initially thought that <italic>Malat1</italic> controls in mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). However, <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice develop normally and are viable and fertile without apparent defects in splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). We previously discovered that <italic>Malat1</italic> is a key regulator of Th1 cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). We showed that <italic>Malat1</italic> is down-regulated upon initiation of Th cell differentiation, yet its complete loss results in stronger immune responses through suppression of IL10 expression in mouse models of type 1 immunity to parasitic infection, including visceral leishmaniasis and malaria. In humans, <italic>Malat1</italic> downregulation is a hallmark of proliferative CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Others have linked <italic>Malat1</italic> to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell function, particularly in Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), and to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In our previous report, which focused on Th1 cells, we showed that <italic>Malat1</italic> loss also affected IL10 expression in <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiated Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Although expressed by all effector Th cells, IL10 expression is highest in Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), which we have also shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). However, the role of <italic>Malat1</italic> in Th2 cell differentiation and function remain under-explored. Here, we aimed to test how loss of <italic>Malat1</italic> affects Th2 differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> and in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of type 2 inflammation, <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> (<italic>S. mansoni</italic>) egg injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). We report that <italic>Malat1</italic> deficiency leads to impaired Th2 differentiation with widespread effects across the transcriptome and a notable suppression of IL10 expression only observed in female-derived Th2 cells. Although some effects caused by <italic>Malat1</italic> deficiency are shared between male- and female-derived CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, <italic>Malat1</italic> loss has more profound effects on female Th2 cells. This is due to a female-specific impaired regulation of an early differentiation interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression programme, suppression of IL2 receptor (IL2R) expression in <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, and increased sensitivity of female cells to IL2-driven cytokine production.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animals and ethics</title><p id="P7">Animal care and experimental procedures were regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (revised under European Directive 2010/63/EU) and were performed under U.K. Home Office License (project license number PP0841992 for breeding and PP9423191for <italic>S. mansoni</italic> egg injections) with approval from the University of York Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body.

As shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), IL10 levels were suppressed in <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> Th2 cells compared to <italic>WT</italic> controls (Log<sub>2</sub> fold change LFC = - 0.882, p = 0.034, for female-derived cells and LFC = 0.03, p = 0.932 for male-derived cells), although this did not reach significance after multiple testing correction. This was further confirmed by qRTPCR for the sequenced samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S1B</xref>), suggesting that this bulk RNAseq analysis provided a conservative representation of the effect of <italic>Malat1</italic> deficiency on Th2 gene expression. Focusing on genes that were differentially expressed between Th2 and naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from <italic>WT</italic> mice (Th2-differentiation associated genes) we observed a transcriptome-wide blunting of Th2 gene expression upon <italic>Malat1</italic> loss in female but not male cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G – H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Tables S3 – S5</xref>). Analysis of all (FDR&lt;0.001) or the top (by FDR) 500 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between <italic>WT</italic> Th2 and naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells demonstrated that most genes that were up-regulated during <italic>WT</italic> Th2 differentiation were overall expressed at lower levels when comparing <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> Th2 cells to <italic>WT</italic> Th2 cells, and, conversely, genes that were suppressed upon <italic>WT</italic> Th2 differentiation were overall more highly expressed in <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Tables S3 – S5</xref>).

Taking a stricter threshold for DEGs between Th2 and naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from female mice (FDR&lt;0.001 and absolute LFC&gt;2), we found 524 Th2-differentiation associated DEGs in both <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Malat1<sup>- /-</sup></italic>, 469 DEGs only in <italic>WT</italic>, and 139 DEGs only in <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> Th2 cells. We noted that common and <italic>WT</italic> only Th2 DEGs were mainly up-regulated, whereas <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> only Th2 DEGs were mainly down-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S1C – D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Tables S3 – S5</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Furthermore, when looking at common DEGs, we found that the vast majority of up-regulated genes showed a smaller LFC in <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> Th2 cells compared to <italic>WT</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. S1E</xref>).

Overall, these results indicated that, as observed in our <italic>in vitro</italic> Th2 differentiation experiments, <italic>Malat1</italic> deficiency resulted in a female-specific impairment of Th2 cytokine expression, predominantly demonstrated by reduced IL10 expression in Th2 cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">Understanding cell intrinsic mediators of sexual dimorphism in lymphocytes is critical to addressing differences in incidence and severity of immunopathologies between females and males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). We demonstrate that <italic>Malat1</italic>, one of the most highly abundant transcripts in mammalian cells, exerts a sex-specific function in Th2 differentiation, affecting early differentiation and end-point cytokine expression in female cells, predominantly IL10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). <italic>Malat1</italic> deficiency has also some effects in male-derived cells, for example a modest suppression of early GATA3 expression and a suppression in IL2Rγ expression, yet these do not translate in changes in endpoint cytokine expression or gene expression programme. Furthermore, the female-specific effect due to <italic>Malat1</italic> deficiency is observed in the <italic>S. mansoni</italic> egg injection model, as biological sex is a determinant of immune responses in the context of human schistosomiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). We also note that, although <italic>Malat1</italic> loss is associated with suppression of IL10 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, other effects of <italic>Malat1</italic> deficiency, for example a modest suppression of IL4, are only observed <italic>in vitro</italic>. This can be due to compensatory mechanisms and multiple effects contributing to cytokine expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. For example, through IL10R blockade we found <italic>in vitro</italic> that IL4 and IL13 levels in <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are likely to reflect both the loss of <italic>Malat1</italic> and reduced IL10 levels from Th2 cells. This is in agreement with reports demonstrating that IL10 suppresses activation of Th2 cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). We speculate that <italic>Malat1</italic> might play a critical role in Th2 differentiation in type 2 immunopathologies, especially those characterised by impaired IL10 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). In addition, IL10 has been shown to be expressed later than other effector cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) and from heterogeneous populations of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). As such, discrepancies between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> cytokine expression can be due to the time-point assessed and kinetics of Th2 cell emergence in the <italic>S. mansoni</italic> egg injection model. Nevertheless, the observed impairment of cytokine expression during <italic>in vitro</italic> Th2 differentiation and in the <italic>S. mansoni</italic> egg injection model strongly support a cell-intrinsic function of <italic>Malat1</italic> in controlling Th2 differentiation in a sex-specific manner.</p><p id="P31">Despite the limitation of not capturing the complexities of <italic>in vivo</italic> Th2 cell differentiation, <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to Th2 cells allowed us to demonstrate that <italic>Malat1</italic> loss results in a sex-specific impairment of differentiation in a cell-intrinsic manner. Mechanistically, down-regulation of IL2R upon <italic>Malat1</italic> loss, prior to exposure to exogenous IL2, results in a transcriptome-wide suppression of the Th2 differentiation programme. Although down-regulation of IL2Rγ is observed in both male and female cells, IL2Rα, which is necessary for formation of the high affinity IL2R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), is only suppressed in female cells. <italic>In vitro</italic>, male Th2 differentiating cells are less responsive to IL2 with regards to cytokine expression, providing an additional potential explanation of the sex-specificity of the observed effect. Evidence for sexual dimorphism in response to IL2 in other immune cell types has been already reported. Female group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells demonstrate increased proliferation in response to IL2 when compared to male ILC2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), and female NK cells produce higher levels of IFNγ than males in response to increased levels of IL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).</p><p id="P32">We postulated that the observed downregulation of IL2Rα and IL2Rγ on day 4 is preceded by impaired early differentiation (days 2-3) of <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, an effect which is more pronounced in female cells. To probe how early <italic>Malat1</italic> deficiency impairs Th2 cytokine expression we used long-read RNA sequencing as a superior method in identifying effects on gene expression and, particularly, splicing. <italic>Malat1</italic> deficiency had minimal effects on DTU at day 2 post-differentiation induction. We did not analyse our endpoint (day 6) short read RNA sequencing experiments for DTU because (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) our data showed that it was the effect of <italic>Malat1</italic> on early Th2 differentiation that was driving the phenotype of <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) any effects would most likely be a result of impaired response to IL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) rather than a direct effect of <italic>Malat1</italic>. Indeed, rather than changes in splicing, we found that early differentiation of female <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells is characterised by impaired suppression of an ISG cluster. It is notable that Th cells demonstrating ISG (including expression of <italic>Ifit3, Irf7, Stat1</italic>, but not <italic>Ifng</italic>) have been described in type 2 inflammation both in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) and in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). In all cases, these Th cells represent a distinct population to Th2 cells indicating that this signature needs to be suppressed in Th2 cells, which in agreement with our findings in <italic>WT</italic> cells. Interestingly a recent publication identified an interferon-experienced population of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that show impaired response to TCR stimulation, as seen here for <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Another report demonstrated that these cells exist constitutively including in germ free mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). The 50-gene signature that defines interferon-experienced naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) displays substantial overlap with the <italic>Malat1-</italic>regulated gene cluster (at day 2) identified here (26/50 genes, including <italic>Irf7</italic> and <italic>Stat1</italic>). Taken together with the observed effect of IFNβ on Th2 differentiation here (partially phenocopying of <italic>Malat1</italic> deficiency), this suggests that suppression of this ISG signature in naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is necessary for optimal Th2 differentiation and regulated by <italic>Malat1</italic> in female-derived cells. Of note, sexual dimorphism in IFN responses and ISG expression have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). It will be interesting to further investigate how <italic>Malat1</italic> promotes specifically down-regulation of ISGs in female cells during early CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation. It has been shown that <italic>Malat1</italic> can promote gene set-specific Polycomb Repressor Complex-mediated epigenetic silencing in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). It could be explored whether this is also the case for ISGs in naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p id="P33">Our results suggest that the impairment of early Th2 differentiation in female <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells is associated with a stronger but shorter-lived initial activation (0-24h) as measured by CD69 expression. Indeed, strong TCR stimulation in the presence of CD28 co-stimulation has been previously linked to impaired Th2 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). During the first 24h of activation, male <italic>WT</italic> cells demonstrate CD69 expression kinetics similar to female <italic>Malat1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, while deletion of <italic>Malat1</italic> does not cause any further increase in CD69 expression in male cells. Overall, we propose that <italic>Malat1</italic> downregulation upon activation of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells facilitates activation, potentially through release of associated proteins that contribute co-transcriptional processing. However, in female cells, complete loss of <italic>Malat1</italic> alters activation kinetics, which in combination with failure to suppress expression of ISGs, leads to impaired Th2 differentiation and subsequent suppression of IL2R and IL2-mediated cytokine expression. Male cells are not sensitive to <italic>Malat1</italic> loss, at least partly, due to their higher early activation threshold, higher ISG expression during early differentiation, and, lower sensitivity to exogenous IL2 during the later stages of differentiation.</p><p id="P34">We cannot exclude additional female-specific mechanisms being affected by <italic>Malat1</italic>, for example with regards to regulation of X Chromosome-linked genes and the role of X chromosome inactivation during Th2 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Furthermore, it will be essential for our results to be validated in other models of type 2 immunity and in human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Despite these limitations, our study reveals that female Th2 cells show a specific dependence on <italic>Malat1</italic>, a highly expressed lincRNA not located on a sex chromosome and displaying similar expression in male and female CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This can have far reaching implications for our understanding of immune sexual dimorphism and provide novel routes for sex-specific manipulation of adaptive immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS199698-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d71aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS199698-supplement-Supplemental_Tables.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d71aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by the Hull York Medical School (PhD studentship to MG and additional funding to DL), the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) White Rose doctoral training partnership (to KAW, reference BB/J014443/1), and the Medical Research Council (to JPH, reference MR/W018578/1).
