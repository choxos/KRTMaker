However, the specific physiological mechanisms underlying hippocampal dysfunction in AD remain poorly understood and improved knowledge may aid both diagnosis and help identify new avenues for therapeutic intervention. We investigated how disruptions in hippocampal reactivations relate to place cell stability and spatial memory deficits in an AD mouse model. Using the APP knock-in mouse model ‘NL-G-F’, we conducted simultaneous behavioural and electrophysiological recordings in a radial arm maze. NL-G-F mice exhibited significant impairments in memory performance, demonstrated by an increased propensity to revisit arms, compared to wild-type controls. These memory deficits were associated with a reduction in the stability of hippocampal place cells, which occurred over short timescales and was accentuated across rest. While the rate of hippocampal reactivation events during rest was unchanged, the structure of these events was significantly degraded in NL-G-F mice. The decreased structure of reactivations was predictive of decreased stability in place cell firing. These findings suggest that disrupted reactivation sequences may act as a mechanism of memory disorder in AD.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The hippocampus plays a central role in memory for places and events, spatial navigation, and system-level memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Morris et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Scoville &amp; Milner, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Squire, 1992</xref>). A key functional basis of the hippocampal role in navigation and spatial memory is the stable, spatially selective activity of place cells, primarily found in hippocampal regions CA3 and CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Muller &amp; Kubie, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">O’Keefe &amp; Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>). The population activity of these cells is considered a core element of a cognitive map, providing a representation of self-location necessary to support flexible navigation to remembered goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">O’Keefe &amp; Nadel, 1978</xref>). During quiescence, place cells engage in transient bursts of activity, reactivating temporally compressed trajectories through the environment (replay). These reactivation events, often synchronised with cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Ólafsdóttir &amp; Barry, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rothschild et al., 2017</xref>), are widely considered a central mechanism supporting consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Girardeau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jadhav et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wilson &amp; McNaughton, 1994</xref>). Within the hippocampus, replay events modulate synaptic efficacy, stabilising place fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">O’Neill et al., 2008</xref>). Disruption of reactivations leads to place field destabilisation, underscoring the essential nature of these precise temporal sequences in maintaining spatial representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Girardeau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jadhav et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P3">This understanding of the role of reactivation in memory consolidation has implications for understanding the nature of the memory deficit that is the hallmark symptom of early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Gauthier et al., 2021</xref>), which is in turn consistent with the hippocampus and associated medial temporal lobe regions being the first to manifest neurodegeneration and neuronal loss in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Braak &amp; Braak, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Braak &amp; Del Tredici, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Thal et al., 2002</xref>). The advent of anti-amyloid immunotherapies as the first wave of new therapies with the potential to modify disease and delay progression to dementia has increased the importance of early disease detection, given disease-modifying treatments are of greatest benefit in earliest stages of AD when the extent of irreversible neurodegeneration is lowest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Sperling et al., 2011</xref>). In this context, greater understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying the earliest cognitive deficits in AD will benefit efforts to deliver tests with superior ability to detect the disease in its initial stages. However, identification of hippocampal pathophysiological changes would have benefits beyond early diagnosis alone, in that it would provide a mechanistic target against which to direct future symptom-targeted interventions.</p><p id="P4">Building upon our understanding of hippocampal function and its relevance to AD, studies in rodent AD models have reported a range of abnormalities in place cell firing characteristics. These include changes to spatial information, field size, and firing rate, which precede changes in other brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Broussard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cacucci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cheng &amp; Ji, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Mably et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). While there is a some variability in results arising from different mouse models, reflecting differences in the expression of AD molecular pathology and associated neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cheng &amp; Ji, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Ciupek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Jun et al., 2020</xref>) the most consistent finding across studies is the deterioration of place cell stability over various time-frames, both between and within recording sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Broussard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Ciupek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Mably et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Given that hippocampal reactivation is critically involved in maintaining place field stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dupret et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">O’Neill et al., 2008</xref>), disrupted reactivation sequences may contribute to the reduction in field stability seen in AD. Earlier studies have identified a decrease in the quantity of sharp-wave ripples in several rodent AD models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Booth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Ciupek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gillespie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Iaccarino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Witton et al., 2016</xref>). However, these transient features in the local field potential only indirectly measure reactivation events - they do not assess content or quality, and likely underestimate their occurrence. As such, the relationship between the actual content of reactivation - the information it conveys - and its impact on place cell stability remains unclear. Beyond this, the existing findings regarding reactivations require validation in modern knock-in AD models, which offer more physiologically relevant protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Saito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sasaguri et al., 2017</xref>). To better understand the link between hippocampal dysfunction and memory deficits in AD, three key aspects require further investigation: (1) the relationship between place cell instability and spatial memory impairments; (2) the temporal progression of these deficits throughout environmental exposure and experience; and (3) the direct mechanism and role of disrupted reactivations in mediating this relationship.</p><p id="P6">Here we investigated offline reactivations as a mechanism contributing to place field instability in an AD mouse model, and, in turn, the link to memory impairment. We explored place cell stability across different timescales in a familiar 8-arm radial maze while simultaneously evaluating two distinct forms of memory performance on the maze. To ensure clinical relevance, we employed an APP knock-in model, circumventing the problems associated with APP overexpression seen in many amyloid models of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hsiao et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Saito et al., 2014</xref>). In order to directly assess hippocampal reactivations, we identified epochs of multi-unit activity (MUA) from single cell recordings in CA1 during rest. We found an initial deficit in place cell stability in AD mice within a familiar environment, which improved over time. This instability was closely linked to impaired memory performance on the radial maze, particularly in the inability to recall previously visited arms within trials. Contrary to previous reports of sharp-wave ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Ciupek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gillespie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jura et al., 2019</xref>), analysis of reactivations during rest periods between behavioural sessions uncovered that there was no reduction in the overall number of reactivations. Rather, we observed a degradation in the structure of reactivations, which predicted the reduction in place cell stability. These findings illuminate the relationship between place cell activity, reactivation patterns, and memory performance. Our findings build upon previous studies by providing a complete link from cognitive deficits in AD, specifically memory impairments, with hippocampal place cell instability and disrupted sequences within reactivation events. This suggests that alterations in reactivation patterns could serve as an early indicator of hippocampal dysfunction and a potential target for therapeutic interventions in AD.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>NL-G-F mice show a reduced preference for unvisited arms in a radial arm maze task</title><p id="P7">Eight male APP<sup>NL-G-F</sup>/Chat-cre mice (from here on referred to as ‘NL-G-F’) and nine age matched wild-type littermate controls (two-sample t-test: M<sup>WT</sup>=12.22 months, Range<sup>WT</sup>=8,17; M<sup>AD</sup>=11.50 months, Range<sup>AD</sup>=7,15; t=0.50, p=0.63) were trained to run on an 8-arm radial arm maze until they were consistently running to the ends to receive rewards. During training, all arms were rewarded. Concurrently, extracellular electrodes (64 channels per mouse) were gradually lowered until they reached the CA1 cell layer (neural recordings performed in 15 of the mice; 8 wild-type and 7 NL-G-F). Once competency had been achieved and the cell layer reached, mice progressed to the experimental recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). Therefore, for all mice at the start of testing the maze was a familiar environment but the task was novel.</p><p id="P8">Mice completed a total of 3-5 test days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). On each test day, four of the arms were randomly selected as reward arms. The reward configuration remained consistent throughout all 10 trials in a test day, but changed across days. Running behaviour was evaluated based on two parameters: mean running speed and the number of arm entries per trial. No significant differences were observed between NL-G-F mice and wild-type controls in either running speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>; two-sample t-test: M<sup>WT</sup>=10.09 cm/s, M<sup>NL-G-F</sup>=9.98 cm/s, t=0.10, p=0.92) or number of arm entries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1C</xref>; two-sample t-test: M<sup>WT</sup>=6.48, M<sup>NL-G-F=</sup>6.44, t=0.03, p =0.97).</p><p id="P9">To complete the task efficiently, mice should enter only the reward arms and avoid revisiting any arm, thus minimising travel distance and time. We assessed memory performance using two key metrics: the preference for visiting reward arms and the preference for visiting unique, previously unvisited, arms. For each of these, we developed a metric scored between 0 and 1, expressing animals’ preference for reward or unvisited arms whilst controlling for the total number of arm entrances (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). The score represents the probability that an animal choosing the same number of arms at random would make a greater number of errors than observed. These scores allow us to quantify the animals’ ability to remember both the location of rewards and their previous choices, independent of their overall activity level. These metrics were analysed across 10 trials within each day, and across different days using linear mixed-effects models which represent the effect of a predictor variable on outcome, and accounted for individual variability among the mice.</p><p id="P10">Both wild-type and NL-G-F mice demonstrated an increase in their preference for reward arms over the course of the 10 trials within a day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>; Estimate=0.026, SE=0.010, t(675)=2.667, p &lt;0.01), indicating that they were capable of learning the reward configuration. However, there was no effect of genotype and interaction effects were not significant (Genotype: Estimate=0.188, SE=0.101, t(675)=1.869, p=0.062; Day: Estimate=0.034, SE=0.021, t(675)=1.636, p=0.102; Trial x Day: Estimate=-0.004, SE=0.003, t(675)=-1.078, p=0.281; Trial x Genotype: Estimate=- 0.025, SE=0.014, t(675)=-1.729, p=0.084; Day x Genotype: Estimate=-0.052, SE=0.031, t(675)=-1.697, p=0.090).</p><p id="P11">In contrast to wild-type animals, NL-G-F mice were more likely to return to arms they had already visited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1F-G</xref>; Estimate=-0.243, SE=0.105, t(675)=-2.315, p=0.021). We also saw significant main effects of Trial and Day, with unique arm preference decreasing over time and trials (Trial: Estimate=-0.024, SE=0.010, t(675)=-2.413, p=0.016; Day: Estimate=-0.060, SE=0.021, t(675)=-2.892, p=0.004). Equally, significant interactions existed between trial and day (Estimate=0.01, SE=0.003, t(675)=3.02, p=0.002) and day and genotype (Estimate=0.070, SE=0.030, t(675)=2.296, p=0.022), but not trial and genotype (Estimate=0.017, SE=0.014, t(675)=1.177, p=0.240). Collectively, these results demonstrate that NL-G-F mice specifically failed to avoid revisiting arms. Although both genotypes showed an increased likelihood to revisit arms across trials and days, this was less pronounced in NL-G-F mice, as their score improved relative to wild-types.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Deficits in place cell stability predict memory performance in NL-G-F mice</title><p id="P12">Place cells were recorded from mice navigating the radial arm maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.1</xref>; total across days: n<sup>WT</sup>=965, n<sup>NL-G-F</sup>=806), with key firing properties assessed only on the first test day to avoid repeated inclusion of cells (n<sup>WT</sup>=232, n<sup>NL-G-F</sup>=222).

Notably, a significant interaction between genotype and day was observed, suggesting that while the stability of NL-G-F place fields was initially poor, it improved across test days (Estimate=0.02, SE=0.01, t(1765)=2.39, p&lt;0.05).</p><p id="P14">Odd-even minute correlations were also lower in NL-G-F mice, reflecting reduced stability relative to wild-types over shorter time periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2E</xref>; Estimate=-0.23, SE=0.06, t(1767)=-3.57, p&lt;0.001). We also saw a primary effect of day, indicating that odd-even minute stability increased in both groups (Estimate=0.02, SE=0.007, t(1767)=3.12, p&lt;0.01) - with no interaction between genotype and day (Estimate=0.007, SE=0.01, t(1767)=0.75, p=0.45).</p><p id="P15">Both stability measures showed a strong positive association with a preference for unique arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2G,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig.2</xref>; Odd-Even Correlation: r(50)=0.55, p&lt;0.0001; Session Correlation: r(50)=0.48, p&lt;0.001) - indicating that animals with more stable place fields were less inclined to revisit arms.

Correlations between ratemaps at different temporal delays were assessed through linear mixed-effects modelling (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>), allowing us to examine how stability changed over time and differed between genotypes.</p><p id="P17">Consistent with our previous analyses, overall, correlations were lower in NL-G-F mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3A-B</xref>; NL-G-F Estimate=-0.098, SE=0.003, t(295980)=-3.24, p=0.001), corresponding to a general reduction in the place cell stability in NL-G-F animals. We also saw two additional main effects, a negative influence of temporal delay (Estimate=-0.005, SE=0.0003, t(295980)=-16.27, p&lt;0.0001) and a positive effect of session (Estimate=0.04, SE=0.03, t(295980)=16.60, p&lt;0.0001). Indicating, as expected, that place cell responses became increasingly dissimilar over more distant time points and that spatial responses tended to be more stable in the second session of the day.</p><p id="P18">Notably we found significant interactions between session and genotype (Estimate=-0.03, SE=0.004, t(295980)=-5.77, p&lt;0.0001) and between temporal delay and genotype (Estimate=0.003, SE=0.0005, t(295980)=5.46, p&lt;0.0001). These interactions suggest that the improvement in ratemap stability across sessions was less pronounced in NL-G-F mice compared to wild-type mice, while the decline in stability over increasing temporal delays was less steep in NL-G-F mice, although this effect was relatively small.</p><p id="P19">To further characterise these differences, we grouped correlations into 5-minute blocks and compared stability over short (&lt;5 minutes; Fig.C,E) and long (10-15 minutes; Fig.D,F) temporal delays. During session 1, the stability of ratemaps separated by short temporal delays (&lt;5 minutes) was not different between genotypes (M<sup>WT</sup>=0.20, M<sup>NL-G-F</sup>=0.18 r-value; two-sample t-test, t(1351)=1.11, p=0.27). However, ratemaps separated by 10 to 15 minutes were less stable in NL-G-F mice compared to wild-type mice (M<sup>WT</sup>=0.22, M<sup>NL-G-F</sup>=0.17 r-value; two-sample t-test, t(1685)=5.14, p&lt;0.0001). This indicates that ratemaps in wild-type mice were stable over longer intervals. In session 2, following a sleep break, NL-G-F place fields were less stable than wild-type cells even at short temporal delays (&lt;5 minutes; M<sup>WT</sup>=0.27, M<sup>NL-G-F</sup>=0.20 r-value; two-sample t-test, t(1738)=5.70, p&lt;0.0001), with the size of the effect increasing over longer temporal delays (M<sup>WT</sup>=0.28, M<sup>NL-G-F</sup>=0.15 r-value; two-sample t-test, t(1617)=13.50, p&lt;0.0001). These results suggest that, following rest, place fields from wild-type mice had higher initial levels of stability, and that stability was maintained over longer intervals.</p><p id="P20">Collectively, these findings indicate a general reduction in place cell stability across longer temporal lags within a session, an effect which was more prominent in NL-G-F mice. Furthermore, place fields in wild-type animals became more stable after the rest period between sessions, while NL-G-F mice failed to show this improvement. We therefore hypothesised that variations in sleep reactivations between genotypes might contribute to the observed disparities in ratemap stability.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Coherent sleep reactivations stabilise the hippocampal map</title><p id="P21">The stabilisation of place fields has been attributed to reactivations of place cells during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dupret et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">O’Neill et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting a potential mechanism for the observed disparity between wild-type and NL-G-F mice. To explore this, we identified epochs of elevated multi-unit activity (MUA), which encapsulate reactivations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Ólafsdóttir et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">2018</xref>), and assessed them for differences in quantity, cell recruitment, and structure.</p><p id="P22">The rate of MUA events was identical between wild-type and NL-G-F mice (MUA rate: M<sup>WT=</sup>0.36Hz, M<sup>NL-G-F=</sup>0.36Hz, bootstrapped differences in AUC: p=0.50). However, we observed a significant difference in how individual neurons participated in these events;place cells in NL-G-F mice were recruited to a lower proportion of events than in wild-type mice. (M<sup>WT</sup>=36.06%, M<sup>NL-G-F</sup>=33.06%, bootstrapped differences in AUC: p=0.001).</p><p id="P23">To assess how cell populations were recruited to MUAs, we developed an MUA structure score to evaluate the likelihood of cell pair co-activity under a null hypothesis of statistical independence. In essence, this quantifies the extent to which the observed joint probability of cell pairs being active in MUAs differed from the expected probability based on their individual activation frequencies (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). A score of zero would indicate no difference from random combinations of cell pairs within MUAs, while higher scores suggest more structured, non-random co-activations. MUA structure in wild-type animals was significantly greater than in NL-G-F mice (M<sup>WT</sup>=2.24, M<sup>AD=</sup>1.91, bootstrapped differences in AUC: p&lt;0.0001), suggesting that MUAs recorded from wild-type mice are more ordered, plausibly conveying more information.</p><p id="P24">The relationships between cell recruitment to MUAs, MUA structure, and place field stability between sessions were assessed using linear mixed-effects models (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). These models demonstrated that both factors were significant positive predictors of across-session place field stability (MUA Structure: Estimate=0.06, SE=0.01, t(1725)=4.13, p&lt;0.0001; MUA Inclusion: Estimate=0.003, SE=0.0005, t(1725)=5.00, p&lt;0.0001). Together, these findings indicate that the ability to recruit and coordinate the firing of cell pairs within reactivations during rest plays a crucial role in maintaining stable neural activity across sessions. Thus, the degraded ability to recruit and structure cells into MUAs in the NL-G-F model of AD reveals a potential mechanism underlying the deterioration of place field stability and associated memory impairment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">In this study, we employed a multifaceted approach combining behavioural assessment in a radial arm maze task with simultaneous single-cell extracellular recordings to investigate hippocampal function, including reactivations, in a NL-G-F mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We identified a direct relationship between place field stability and memory performance, both of which were impaired in NL-G-F animals. Notably, we observed a time-dependent deterioration of place field stability. Over short time frames, place fields in NL-G-F mice were stable comparable to those in wild-type animals. However, over longer periods, the stability of place fields in NL-G-F mice was markedly reduced relative to controls. This deficit was particularly pronounced following rest periods, after which the stability of place fields in wild-type animals increased whereas in NL-G-F mice it did not, resulting in a widening disparity between the two groups over longer temporal delays. To investigate the mechanisms underlying these differences, we examined reactivations during rest periods. We found that place cells were recruited to fewer multi-unit activity (MUA) events in NL-G-F mice, and that those MUAs were less structured, with cells reactivating in less consistent combinations. Linear modelling revealed that both MUA recruitment and MUA structure were predictors of across-session stability, suggesting a crucial role for coordinated reactivations in maintaining place field stability.</p><p id="P26">Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying memory impairment has major implications for AD management, not just in terms of yielding outcomes that may aid early diagnosis or track response to treatment but also in potentially identifying a target for future interventions aiming to restore normal physiological function. As such, a key aim of this study was to investigate the link between neural changes and memory performance. Using a radial arm maze task, we were able to evaluate different facets of memory, revealing a specific deficit in the preference for unique arms, rather than reward arms. This finding aligns with previous research that has shown reduced performance in alternating Y-mazes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Saito et al., 2014</xref>) and Morris-water-maze tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mehla et al., 2019</xref>) in the same NL-G-F mouse model. Tasks such as these target short-term spatial memory, and have been shown to be more sensitive to impairment in AD than tests of reference memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P27">While the neural distinctions between these types of memory remain unclear, our findings suggest that the observed deficits are linked to the varying timescales required for learning different aspects of the task. In this study, preference for unique arms is an intra-trial measure of memory, relying on rapid, one-shot learning of ‘just visited’ but familiar locations. In contrast, preference for reward arms involves repeated learning across multiple trials within a day, showing improvement with practice. Consistent with this distinction, we saw that the stability of spatial representations reduced rapidly in NL-G-F mice, over short enough time periods to impact performance within a trial - such as odd vs even minutes. Indeed this reduction in place cell representation stability was explicitly correlated with a decreased preference for visiting unique arms. Conversely, across longer time periods - repeated days of exposure - the stability of place representations in NL-G-F animals recovered towards normal levels. Broadly this suggests that AD animals retain sufficiently normal neural dynamics to benefit from cumulative learning across multiple exposures to an environment, which may explain the relative preservation of reference memory observed by us and other researchers in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Notably, the most pronounced difference between the two genotypes was in the stability of place cells after the 45-minute rest period - place cells in wild-type animals increased in stability, whereas those in NL-G-F mice did not. Hippocampal replay - compressed reactivations of hippocampal sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Louie &amp; Wilson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Nádasdy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wilson &amp; McNaughton, 1994</xref>) - typically occur during quiescence and are known to play a central role in maintaining place field stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dupret et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jadhav et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Karlsson &amp; Frank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">O’Neill et al., 2008</xref>). Prior work in AD rodent models has seen deficits in the occurrence of sharp-wave ripples - transient LFP phenomena that often co-occur with reactivations - in APP transgenic mouse models of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Iaccarino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jura et al., 2019</xref>), tau models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Booth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Ciupek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Witton et al., 2016</xref>) and an APOE4 knock-in model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gillespie et al., 2016</xref>). However this is far from a consistent finding across studies, likely because accurate measurement is confounded by differences in the oscillatory frequency of sharp-wave ripples between AD and wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Benthem et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Caccavano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cayzac et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Nicole et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Multi-unit activity (MUAs), the method used here, provides a more reliable indicator of reactivations than sharp-wave ripples used in previous studies, being a direct measure of hippocampal pyramidal cell activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Ólafsdóttir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Widloski &amp; Foster, 2024</xref>). Importantly, single unit recordings enabled us to directly assess the content of reactivations. Using this measure, we found no difference in the rate at which MUAs occurred between AD and wild-type animals. However, we observed that both the ability to recruit place cells into MUAs and the structure of cell co-firing within MUAs was reduced in NL-G-F animals. ‘This suggests that MUAs in NL-G-F mice conveyed less information than those in wild-type animals - factors which predicted place cell stability between sessions, which in turn was correlated with animals’ ability to avoid previously visited arms.</p><p id="P30">Whilst lacking a causal relationship, this triad of results strongly suggests the ability to recruit appropriate cells to MUAs is crucial for stabilising spatial maps during rest, which in turn provides a basis for subsequent short term spatial memory performance. The functional deficit in this AD model lies not in the ability of hippocampal networks to generate reactivations but in their precise ordering and internal structure. It follows that this aberrant activity is insufficient to engage the normal plastic processes required to stabilise the activity of place cells.</p><p id="P31">Further work is needed to fully clarify the causes of disrupted MUA structure in AD mice. A complete demonstration of this pathway, from mechanism to behaviour, would provide valuable insights into the memory impairments seen in AD. Moreover, it could reveal potential targets for symptom-specific therapeutic interventions, opening new avenues for understanding and treating dementia.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Animals</title><p id="P32">All mice used in this study were from the APP NL-G-F/ChAT-cre genetic strain, generated by crossing the APP NL-G-F Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Saito et al., 2014</xref>) with ChAT-IRES-Cre (B6;129S6-Chattm2(cre)Lowl/J) mice. The ChAT-IRES-Cre line was established from a homozygous pair obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (ME, USA; Stock no: 006410). The colony was maintained by breeding pairs homozygous for ChAT-IRES-Cre and heterozygous for APPNL-G-F. APPNL-G-F homozygotes constituted the experimental group, while wild-type littermates served as controls. Electrophysiological recordings were performed on 15 male mice: 8 wild-type and 7 APP NL-G-F.

During this period, they were housed communally under a 12-hour reversed light-dark cycle. After surgery, each mouse was housed individually and food-restricted to 90% of their free-feeding body weight, or to 35g for those classified as obese.

Tetrodes were formed of twisted 12 μm polyimide coated nickel-chrome wire (California Fine Wire Co., CA, USA) which were platinum-plated to reduce impedances to below 150kΩ. Microdrives were formed of a single body (Axona Ltd., St Albans, UK) mounted to a screw which allowed all tetrodes to be advanced through the brain simultaneously.</p><p id="P35">Anaesthesia was induced in a chamber through which an isoflurane-oxygen mix (3ml/min) was administered. Once induced, analgesia was administered subcutaneously (carprieve – 5mg/kg, 1:9 solution in sterile saline). Mice were head-fixed on a stereotaxic frame and the anaesthetic gas mix was lowered to between 0.5 and 3 ml/min which was maintained throughout the surgery. Mice were placed on a heat-pad to maintain body temperature and were visually monitored for colour or breathing rate changes. Following surgery, Metacam (Meloxicam - 1mg/kg) was given in a Jelly suspension for a minimum of three days.</p><p id="P36">Following induction and placement in a stereotaxic frame, an incision was made along the midline to expose the skull, followed by the creation of three craniotomies. One craniotomy was used for the insertion of a screw attached to a metal pin which would be used for grounding, and the other two were used for the insertion of screws to stabilise the implant. A trephine drill was then used to create a craniotomy above the left hippocampus, where a single drive was implanted (coordinates: 2.0 mm posterior to bregma, 1.8 mm lateral to the midline, 0.8mm dorsal from the brain surface). Following insertion, a metal sheath was lowered over the exposed tetrodes for protection and the surgical site was covered with dental cement to fix the microdrive to the skull.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Place Cell Screening</title><p id="P37">Following a one week post-surgery recovery period, mice were handled and habituated to the experimental room. The drive was then connected to the recording system and mice were allowed to forage freely in an open-field environment (80cm diameter). Neural and position data were recorded for 20-40 minutes, until the mouse had sufficiently covered the environment. During this time the neural data were reviewed for signatures of hippocampal activity (theta when running, sharp-wave ripples, pyramidal cell waveforms and bursts of cell activity). Spikes were initially clustered into cells using the automatic clustering algorithm KlustaKwik (Kadir et al., 2014) and reviewed manually in Tint (Axona Ltd., St Albans, UK) or using the Waveform software (d1manson.github.io/waveform). Over-clustering was corrected by merging clusters with similar waveforms and cross-correlograms indicating common spikes. Following this process, the number of cells with spatial fields, determined by eye, was assessed. If sufficient spatial cells were identified (a minimum of 20 spatial cells active in the open field environment), or if the number of spatial cells began to consistently decrease across recordings, the animal progressed into the experiment. If spatial cells were not identified, the tetrodes were lowered by turning the screw in the microdrive. Tetrodes were initially advanced up to 65μm between screening sessions, and later when neural patterns typical of the hippocampus were identified, they were advanced 30μm between screening sessions. This was performed up to three times in a day, with delays of at least two hours between each session.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Behavioural Training</title><p id="P38">Experiments were performed on a radial eight-arm maze; arms were 80 cm × 10 cm, connected by an octagonal centre platform with sides of 10 cm and diameter of 24.7 cm.

A second reward well was placed behind the end block of each arm which were all filled, to obscure odour cues.</p><p id="P39">Following a one-week post-surgery recovery period, mice were habituated to the experimental set up. On the first exposure mice were allowed to explore the radial arm maze without being connected to the recording tether. Subsequently, mice were connected and allowed to forage freely on the maze for eight-minute periods. Between exposures they were contained in a holding box for two minutes whilst the maze was cleaned and reward wells replenished. The holding box was made from a plastic flower-pot, with the bottom removed and split down one side so that the mouse could be contained and released without being picked up or untethered. The mouse was contained in this holding box in the centre of the maze, and the position of the side-opening was rotated randomly for each release to avoid route learning.</p><p id="P40">During the habituation phase a reward was provided on all arms of the maze to encourage exploration. If an animal visited an arm but did not eat the reward, the reward would be removed to discourage repeated visits. Habituation was performed on a minimum of two days and maximum of seven. The habituation phase was ended when the animal was able to consistently run to the ends of multiple arms within a single exposure and was regularly eating the reward. Once this habituation phase had been completed, mice progressed into the test phase.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Behavioural Task</title><p id="P41">On each test day, reward wells on four of the eight possible arms contained a reward. The reward arms were selected randomly each day with the caveat that at least two arms must be different from the previous days configuration and there must be at least one unrewarded arm between the reward arms (i.e. not four consecutive arms). Once selected, this configuration remained for all trials within a day for that mouse. Reward arms were baited with half a chocolate vermicelli strand. Secondary reward wells behind all arm ends were also filled with a chocolate strand to mask the scent. On each day mice performed a total of ten trials, with the aim being to find all four reward arms on each trial.</p><p id="P42">At the start of a test day, the mouse was put in the holding box in the centre of the maze prior to being released for an 8 minute ‘exploration’ phase. This allowed the mouse to learn that day’s reward locations. They were then returned to the holding box for 2 minutes whilst the maze was cleaned and reward wells replenished. This re-setting procedure was performed between all exposures to the maze.</p><p id="P43">All test days consisted of two behavioural sessions and two sleep recordings.

Each trial lasted for four minutes or until all four reward arms had been visited, whichever occurred first. At the end of each trial the mouse was returned to the holding box for two minutes and the maze re-set. During the behavioural task, the position of the mouse was tracked using an overhead camera and arm entrances were also manually recorded. Sleep recordings lasted 45 minutes. During this time, the mouse was held in a cylindrical rest box, placed on the centre platform of the maze to maintain position tracking. The mouse was monitored remotely during sleep recordings.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Electrophysiology Recordings and Spike Sorting</title><p id="P45">Each microdrive contained two 32 channel Omnetics connectors to which Intan headstages could be attached. Headstages amplified and transmitted the neural signal to an Open Ephys acquisition board.

Initial clusters were assigned using the Kilosort 2.0 algorithm (Pachitariu et al., 2016; Stringer et al., 2019) which uses template matching to classify spikes into cluster based on putative cell identity. Clusters were then manually refined using Phy, an open-source spike sorting software package (Rossant et al., 2016). Amplitude, waveform and temporal autocorrelation of spikes were analysed to manually reassign spikes and to correct for over-clustering. After the spike sorting process was completed, spikes were reassigned to each trial in Matlab.</p><p id="P47">As the impact of Alzheimer’s disease on the firing properties of cells was unknown, a broad set of criteria was applied when allocating the cell assignments. Initially, clusters were categorised as either a pyramidal cell or interneuron based on the width of the waveform; a histogram of all peak to trough waveform durations was calculated and two clear peaks identified. The lower limit for inclusion of a cell as pyramidal was set to the minima between these two peaks (400μs). All cells with a waveform duration less than this threshold were categorised as interneurons.</p><p id="P48">The subset of cells considered putative pyramidal cells were assessed for spatial firing properties to determine whether they would be classified as a place cell. Firing fields were classified as areas on the maze of at least 9 connected 2cm bins, in which the firing rate of the cell exceeded twice its mean firing rate. In addition to having at least one firing field, cells were required to have a peak firing rate greater than 1Hz but less than 50Hz, and a mean firing rate of less than 5Hz to be considered a place cell (based on Tanni et al., 2022).</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Position Tracking</title><p id="P49">Headstages were fitted with two infra-red LEDs which provided a signal of the mouse’s location which was tracked using an overhead night-vision infrared webcam.

Muller &amp; Kubie, 1989). For across session stability, separate rate maps were generated for sessions one and two on each recording day for each place cell. These were compared using bin-wise Pearson correlations, excluding unvisited bins. Odd-even stability was assessed by generating separate rate maps for data recorded in ‘odd minutes’ (e.g., minutes 1, 3) and ‘even minutes’ (e.g., minutes 0, 2), then correlating these as before. To assess temporal dynamics of place cell stability, individual rate maps were created for every minute of recording across both sessions. Within a single session, all pairwise comparisons at different time lags were performed using the same correlation method.</p><p id="P62">Stability change across days, trials and between genotypes was assessed using linear mixed effects modelling.

To assess the changing level of multi-unit activity across the recording, a histogram of the spike activity of all cells, with 10ms time bins, was generated and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (σ=15ms). The activity level was z-scored and potential MUA events were identified as periods of activity which exceeded 3 standard deviations above the mean.</p><p id="P65">Peaks of activity passing this threshold were identified, and the boundaries of the MUA were extended in both directions until the firing rate returned to baseline, providing the outer limits of the MUA. The total time between these limits was used to measure the duration of the MUA event. For inclusion as an MUA event, the duration was required to be greater than 40ms. For a cell to be considered active in an MUA, it must have fired at least one action potential within the duration of the MUA. These criteria were selected in line with previous studies (Bush et al., 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Ólafsdóttir et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>MUA Structure</title><p id="P66">To determine the structure of MUA content, we developed a score measuring the extent to which place cell co-firing differed from chance expectations assuming statistical independence.
