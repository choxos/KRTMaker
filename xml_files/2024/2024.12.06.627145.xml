We performed ultra-high resolution quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) with histological validation on <italic>post mortem</italic> brains from captive and wild chimpanzees with a broad age range. We mapped developmental myelination and age-related iron accumulation across regions and layers of the neocortex. Compared to humans, chimpanzees showed more myelination and iron deposition in motor and premotor cortices, while the auditory cortex was more strongly myelinated in humans. Our model suggests that chimpanzees’ cortical myelination was largely completed by the age of nine years, while iron accumulation continued throughout the lifespan. The regions with highest adult levels of myelin and iron took the longest to mature, challenging the widespread assumption that highly myelinated regions complete their development first. The reported maps and developmental curves provide a foundation for comparative neuroscience research and understanding of human brain evolution.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The evolution of unique human skills, such as syntax-based language<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, sophisticated tool use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, and complex social cognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> came with the expansion and differentiation of the hominin brain. Fossil records show that humans evolved from australopiths with brains that had chimpanzee-like folding patterns, and adult endocranial volumes that were on average 20% higher than in chimpanzees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The brains of chimpanzees differ from human brains substantially on the macroscopic and microscopic levels with differences in size and cortical surface area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, prefrontal cortex morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, neocortical dendritic morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and projections of white matter tracts supporting language processing in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. These differences in neuroanatomy may be the result of divergent ontogenetic trajectories between species. Cross-species comparison of brain lifespan trajectories on the macro- and microscale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> is indispensable to identify the evolutionary changes that facilitated the development of skills in the more recent stages of hominin evolution or contributed to the emergence of human-specific pathologies associated with certain developmental periods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, our knowledge about macroscopic and microscopic lifespan trajectories of great ape brains are limited, and data which can be compared between human and great apes are scarce, mostly due to methodological and ethical limitations.</p><p id="P3">Previous ontogenetic studies in chimpanzees using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have focused on macroscopic measures of gray and white matter volumes. They suggest less rapid early development of the prefrontal white matter in chimpanzees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, less aging-related changes in neocortical gray and white matter in chimpanzees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and negligible developmental changes in gray and white matter volume between ages 8 and 53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, volume changes are macroscopic measures, which reflect and conflate many factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, as brain ontogeny involves many processes that shape the brain, on both the macroscopic and microscopic level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Here, we characterized the microscopic changes in the chimpanzee neocortex using <italic>post mortem</italic> quantitative MRI at ultra-high resolutions by using ethically and sustainably sourced brains from chimpanzees after their death in captivity or in the wild. We quantified two major processes in the brains across the lifespan - developmental myelination and age related iron accumulation.</p><p id="P5">Myelination is a developmental process that starts before birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and continues into adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. In the cortex, the level of myelin can provide information on the functional specialization of cortical areas. Primary sensory and motor areas are myelinated more highly and presumably earlier in development than association areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Low cortical myelination seems to be a factor beneficial to cortical plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and areas low in myelin expanded most during evolution from macaques to humans, as well as during ontogenetic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and are particularly sensitive to neurodevelopmental abnormalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Not only the total cortical myelin content changes with development, but also myelination patterns across cortical layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">One postulated characteristic feature of human brain development is a prolonged period of cortical myelination compared to chimpanzees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, particularly pronounced in higher level areas such as the prefrontal cortex. However, previous studies on cortical myelination in chimpanzees are limited to manually analyzed histological tissue sections with stereology from only a small subset of cortical regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and have not considered layer-dependency of cortical myelination.</p><p id="P7">Another hallmark of brain lifespan trajectory is iron accumulation with age. In the brain, iron plays a dual role. On the one hand, iron is a co-factor facilitating crucial processes in the brain including myelin synthesis, energy production and neurotransmitter synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Due to its involvement in myelination, iron often colocalizes with myelin in the cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. On the other hand, when present in high concentrations, highly reactive iron is a source of oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.

As cortical segmentation was not possible for the 0.1 year and 1 year old brains due to the minimal gray-white matter contrast, median parameter values across the entire brains were used instead.

Our model has three parameters: a constant term describing quantitative MRI parameters at birth; an amplitude, indicating how much the MRI parameter values change from birth to old age; and a rate, indicating how fast the developmental changes are happening.

The time constants suggest a slower iron accumulation in chimpanzees than what was reported by Hallgren and Sourander<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> in human cortices. Our results indicate that cortical iron accumulation, a process related to neurodegeneration in human aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, is also present in chimpanzees. One reason why humans are more susceptible to neurodegenerative disease may be this faster iron accumulation and the generally longer lifespan that also leads to the inverted U-shape trajectory of myelination found in imaging studies. This shape is driven by an increase of myelin into early adulthood and a decline from age 60<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>, both in white matter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> as well as in cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>. We did not observe this U-shaped trajectory in our chimpanzee data, and one reason may be that the oldest chimpanzee in our sample was 52 years old, reflecting the generally longer lifespan in humans and the challenges in comparing aging processes between the species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P37">The ultra-high-resolution quantitative MRI revealed strong intra-cortical variation in myelination. In particular, area-specific myeloarchitectonic features like the highly myelinated stria of Gennari in the primary visual cortex, and borders between areas with known cyto- and myeloarchitectonic differences (such as primary and secondary visual cortex) were clearly visible. Intracortical profiles obtained from various regions defined by the histology-based cortical Bonin-Bailey chimpanzee atlas clearly differed from each other, which was also reflected in the derived skewness measures. Negative skewness indicates preferentially stronger myelination in middle to deep layers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. In line with this, we found the strongest negative skewness in the motor cortex, followed by visual and auditory cortex, with the weakest negative skewness in the Broca homologue and frontal pole. The distribution of skewness across the cortex corresponds well with a previous study in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The R2*-based skewness distribution showed the opposite trend, potentially providing a complementary histological measure.</p><p id="P38">We also explored intracortical ontogenetic development, which has been studied in humans in previous histological work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>, and recently <italic>in vivo</italic> with MRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> which showed that the cortical development is not only reflected in an increase in myelin-sensitive parameters, but also in a decrease in the skewness of the intracortical profiles, which is likely a result of preferential developmental increases in myelin in mid- to deep cortical layers. In our data, skewness in the MTsat-based profiles also decreased with the chimpanzee development from childhood to adulthood.</p><p id="P39">The MRI findings suggest that our whole brain ultra-high resolution approach provides a feasible addition to histological studies on cortical microstructure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. In contrast to previous studies in chimpanzees, our imaging approach has the following advantages: its multi-modality provides three different quantitative parameters that differ in their sensitivity to various tissue characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, which allowed us to study different biological aspects of cortical maturation. It captures whole chimpanzee brains, whilst histological studies rely on few specimens and on small regions or are limited to specific cutting planes and are not quantitative in nature. The creation of population-based cortical parcellations for chimpanzees could therefore in the future be achieved with our MRI approach that covers different microstructural aspects. QMRI is also the method of choice used in human developmental studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, facilitating between-species comparison through literature comparison or the combination and harmonization of datasets.</p><p id="P40">Several caveats are worth highlighting. While our sample size is comparable to previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, it was not sufficiently large to be able to test and select from a variety of possible developmental models, or to statistically compare model parameters across cortical regions. In some atlas regions, the model did not perform well (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref> for modeling parameters for all BB38 atlas regions).</p><p id="P41">The employed qMRI parameters are indirect markers of myelination and iron that may be influenced by different factors, especially in case of pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. However, the careful histological validation within the specific setting of this lifespan study indicates that the qMRI parameters can be regarded as reliable microstructural markers.</p><p id="P42">The comparison of chimpanzee and human lifespan changes required the harmonization of the <italic>post mortem</italic> chimpanzee and <italic>in vivo</italic> human data, in order to compensate for differences due to the different data acquisition conditions.</p><p id="P43">Our tissue collection strategy implies some uncontrollable variation in <italic>post mortem</italic> intervals and fixation conditions between sourced brains, which may influence the observed inter-individual differences in the quantitative parameters. MRI data suggested high tissue quality in most brains despite sometimes challenging tissue collection conditions in African field sites. Data from three individuals had to be excluded to severe MRI-visible cortical pathologies, induced by systemic bacterial infections causative for the animals’ death. Additionally, in three brains, fixation-related artifacts were observed in the R1 maps only, but not in the other parameters. R1 seemed to be the most prone to artifacts that are probably related to fixation. This may have led to pronounced inter-individual variability which obscured the developmental trajectory. Previous work has confirmed a link between fixation protocol and quantitative MRI parameters, in particular for R1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. While we kept the fixation protocol as consistent as possible, some factors still varied between the brains, such as the interval between time of death until fixation, constant fixation temperatures and non-standardized formaldehyde solutions purchased in the country of brain sourcing. This highlights the advantage of multi-parametric mapping, where several metrics are obtained that capture different physical properties of the tissue.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P44">We showed qMRI-based myelin and iron distribution across the entire cortex in chimpanzee brains and differences to humans in motor and premotor cortices.

All parameters show an exquisite contrast between gray and white matter. The high resolution allows identification of detailed neuroanatomical features (e.g., cortical sheet, basal ganglia, cerebellar folia) and the assessment of differences in microstructure between cortical areas and across cortical depth.

Areas of low cortical thickness include the visual cortices and the postcentral gyrus. In humans, visual cortex (V), auditory cortex (A) and insular cortex (I), areas around the motor cortex (M; including Brodman areas 4 and 6), somatosensory cortex (S; including Brodman areas 1 and 3) stand out as highly myelinated.

Profiles of the parameters MTsat and R2* show similar trends but distinct differences that are reflected in the skewness distributions. <bold>B.</bold> The profile skewness averaged across chimpanzees and within each atlas region is shown here. Note the particularly negative values in myelin-based (MTsat) skewness for primary motor and primary visual cortices and the least negative values in the prefrontal cortex, comparable to<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the iron-based (R2*) skewness shows a different, inverse, distribution across the cortex. <bold>C.</bold> For each chimpanzee and region, the skewness of the intracortical profile was quantified. A linear decrease in skewness measures from childhood to adulthood was found for MTsat-based skewness. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref> shows average intracortical profiles grouped by the chimpanzee ages for illustration.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201800-f006"/></fig></floats-group></article>
