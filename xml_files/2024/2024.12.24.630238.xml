While most well-characterized phages have narrow host ranges, broad-host-range phages represent an intriguing component of marine ecosystems. The genetic and evolutionary mechanisms driving their generalism remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed Schizotequatroviruses and their <italic>Vibrio crassostreae</italic> hosts, collected from an oyster farm. Schizotequatroviruses exhibit broad host ranges, large genomes (~252 kbp) encoding 26 tRNAs, and conserved genomic organization interspersed with recombination hotspots. These recombination events, particularly in regions encoding receptor-binding proteins and antidefense systems, highlight their adaptability to host resistance. Notably, some lineages demonstrated receptor-switching between OmpK and LamB, showcasing their evolutionary flexibility. Despite their broad host range, Schizotequatroviruses were rare in the environment. Their scarcity could not be attributed to burst size, which was comparable to other phages <italic>in vitro</italic>, but may result from ecological constraints or fitness trade-offs, such as their preference for targeting generalist vibrios in seawater rather than the patho-phylotypes selected in oyster farms. Our findings clarify the genetic and ecological trade-offs shaping Schizotequatrovirus generalism and provide a foundation for future phage applications in aquaculture and beyond.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">Bacteriophages (or phages)—viruses that infect bacteria—are attracting renewed attention due to their ecological significance, impact on human health, and potential applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Effective therapeutic use of phages requires a host range that encompasses the genetic diversity of bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Host range is primarily determined by the phage’s ability to bind specific bacterial receptors, with variations in receptor-binding proteins broadening or narrowing this range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Bacterial defense mechanisms (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>)) also influence phage infection, and phages evolve rapidly to counter these defenses, with environmental context shaping the co-evolutionary dynamics between phages and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Phages exhibit a wide range of host specificities, from those with highly restricted host ranges to others with broad infectivity, though most well-characterized model phages tend to have narrow host ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Studies of broad-host-range marine phages and metagenomic analyses of diverse environments suggest that such phages may be more common than previously thought in natural ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Yet, little is known about the genetic determinants, evolutionary dynamics, trade-offs, and factors shaping host tropism that underlie the generalism of these phages in natural ecosystems.</p><p id="P6">Our previous research showed that juvenile oysters impacted by Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) are infected by diverse virulent genotypes within the <italic>Vibrio crassostreae</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). These virulent strains are largely organized into distinct phylogenetic clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), or ‘phylo-pathotypes,’ and carry the virulence plasmid pGV, which encodes a T6SS responsible for cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). We also found this <italic>V. crassostreae</italic> population to be highly dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), sparking our interest in the role of phages in shaping its abundance and diversity. To investigate, we collected marine phages and <italic>V. crassostreae</italic> hosts over a time series from an oyster farm and assessed their host range through cross-infection studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). This analysis revealed a highly modular infection network, where phage adsorption is governed by specific matches between phage genus and vibrio clades. Following adsorption, intracellular defense systems further narrow the range of strains that are successfully infected and lysed.</p><p id="P7">One phage in our study, 6E351A, piqued our curiosity as the only isolate among 242 (0.4%) capable of infecting not only <italic>V. crassostreae</italic> strains outside any specific clade, but also strains from other <italic>Vibrio</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Genome sequencing identified this phage as part of the Schizotequatrovirus family (previously known as giant vibriophages or T4 giant phages). These viruses, exhibiting a Myoviridae morphotype, are characterized by large capsids and double-stranded DNA genomes of approximately 250 kbp, with a quarter of their coding regions showing homology to T4 phage genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). The best-known member of this group, KVP40, is notable for its broad host range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). This finding suggests that Schizotequatroviruses may generally include broad-host-range phages. However, research on these phages is limited by the small number of isolated phages and hosts and the considerable genetic diversity within this family.</p><p id="P8">In this study, we established a collection of Schizotequatroviruses and their <italic>V. crassostreae</italic> hosts to investigate the fine-scale diversity and evolutionary dynamics within this family. Uncovering the genetic mechanisms and evolutionary processes that enable these phages to maintain a broad host range, along with understanding the potential trade-offs that may explain their low prevalence, will provide valuable insights into their role in shaping bacterial eco-evolutionary dynamics and inform their potential applications.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Isolation and identification of Schizotequatroviruses</title><p id="P9">Sampling was conducted from an oyster farm in the Bay of Brest (Pointe du Château, 48° 20’ 06.19” N, 4° 19’ 06.37” W) between June 28 and September 15, 2021, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Specific Pathogen-Free juvenile oysters were deployed in consecutive batches, to monitor mortality linked to seawater temperature increases above 16°C, a threshold for oyster mortalities. Samples were collected on each sampling day from living oysters within a batch showing &lt;50% mortality. Hemolymph was collected from 90 living oysters, centrifuged (10 min, 17,000 g) and the supernatant filtered through a 0.2 μm filter and stored at 4°C until the phage isolation stage. Concurrently, 10 liters of seawater were collected and size fractionated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) and viral particles were concentrated using 0.2 μm filtration and iron chloride flocculation, respectively, following standardized protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Virus-flocculates were suspended in 10mL 0.1M EDTA, 0.2M MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2M oxalate buffer at pH6 and stored at 4°C until the phage isolation stage.</p><p id="P10">A total of 153 <italic>V. crassostreae</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) were used as bait to isolate phages across 35 sampling dates. For each date, a mixture of 10 μL seawater viral concentrate (equivalent to 10 mL of seawater, concentrated 1,000-fold) and 10 μL of oyster plasma derived from a pooled sample of 90 oysters was tested. Phage infections were identified by the formation of plaques using soft agar overlays on bacterial lawns. We purified one phage per plaque morphotype and combinations (host and date), leading to a final collection of over 1,200 phages. Phages were then re-isolated three times on the sensitive host to ensure purification. High-titer stocks (&gt;10<sup>9</sup> PFU/mL) were prepared via confluent lysis in agar overlays and stored at 4°C, with an additional aliquot stored at -80°C in the presence of 25% glycerol.</p><p id="P11">We prioritized sequencing phages targeting strains within clades V1 to V8, successfully obtaining over 1,000 new phage genomes (manuscript in preparation), none of which were identified as Schizotequatroviruses. To bridge this gap, we designed three primer sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) targeting conserved regions of Schizotequatrovirus genomes available in the NCBI RefSeq/GenBank database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). These primers were tested on crude lysates of phages infecting strains outside clades V1–V8. This targeted approach enabled the detection of 17 phages, each yielding PCR products of the expected size with at least two primer pairs. Morphological analysis by electron microscopy and genome sequencing further confirmed their classification.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Electron Microscopy</title><p id="P12">To characterize the morphology of the different phages, 20 μl of phage concentrates were adsorbed for 10 min to a formvar film on a carbon-coated 300 mesh copper grid (FF-300 Cu formvar square mesh Cu, delta microscopy). The adsorbed samples were negatively contrasted with 2% Uranyl acetate (EMS, Hatfield, PA, USA) before observation under a Jeol JEM-1400 Transmission Electron Microscope equipped with an Orious Gatan camera.

The resulting pellet was resuspended in 300 μL SM buffer (100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O, 50 mM Tris-Cl). Concentrated phages were then treated with DNAse (10 μL, 1000 units, Promega) and RNAse (2.5 μL, 3.5 mg/mL, Macherey-Nagel) at 37°C for 30 minutes. DNA extraction included protein lysis (0.02 M EDTA pH 8.0, 500 μg/mL proteinase K, 0.5% SDS) for 30 minutes at 55°C, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. DNA was visualized on a 0.7% agarose gel (50V, overnight at 4°C) and quantified using Qubit.</p><p id="P14">Phage sequencing was performed at the Biomics platform of the Pasteur Institute (Paris, France). DNA was fragmented using Covaris (target size: 500 bp), and libraries were prepared with the TruSeq™ DNA PCR-Free High Library Prep Kit. Due to inefficiency in adaptor ligation, an amplification step of 14 cycles was added using Illumina P7 and P5 primers (IDT).

This phylogeny was derived from the concatenated multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of 2,879 CDSs found in single copy in at least 99% of the genomes –this threshold was found to capture the majority of conserved single-copy gene families.

These two regions include core loci inferred to have undergone 9 recombination events during the diversification of the phage.</p><p id="P46">To assess if high sequence divergence is caused by episodes of positive selection, we estimated the gene-wide strength of selection acting against amino-acid substitution in core genes with Hyphy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). This was obtained from the dN/dS ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution fixation rates. A dN/dS ratio below 1 suggests purifying selection, and a ratio higher than 1 suggests positive selection. All persistent genes had a dN/dS below 0.4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). While this does not exclude positive selection at a few sites in the proteins, it does reveal a strong imprint of purifying selection inconsistent with the observation that some RBP BBHs share less than 60% identity in the clade of the 17 closely-related phages while the minimal pairwise identity in the vast majority of core BBH groups is above 90% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). To confirm this conclusion, we compared the mean pairwise identity between BBHs within the most divergent core BBH groups (defined as a mean pairwise identity &lt; 95% in the clade of 17 phages) and the number of inferred recombination events and the dN/dS ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). The results show a significant association of divergence with recombination and no association with the dN/dS ratio. This further suggests that divergence in core genes of Schizotequatroviruses is associated with recombination processes and not caused by selection for rapid accumulation of amino-acid substitutions from ancestral alleles.</p><p id="P47">In line with these findings, the branch lengths and topology of the phylogeny inferred at the DNA level from all persistent genes present in the 18 genomes is substantially different than the recombination-free phylogeny inferred by Gubbins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>), and only the latter is congruent with the robust phylogeny inferred at the protein-level from conservative BBH groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This affects the position of the phages K566 and K567 since recombination accounts for most nucleotide substitutions between their core genes and those of the 15 members of the sister subclade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). When recombination signals are removed by Gubbins, the two subclades appear to have diverged at the same rate of nucleotide substitution from their last common ancestor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). The inferred history of gene gains, duplications and losses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>) identified another founding event of the shift of K566 and K567: the replacement of an ancestral antidefense island (VP6E351A_0314 to _0326) by another one (VPK566_0302 to _0314 in phage K566) providing new functions, e.g. a glycosyltransferase and genes involved in Lipid A biosynthesis (VPK566_0309 and _0313 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Hence, the emergence of the sub-clade K566 and K567 is associated with events of recombination and acquisition of several genes. Together, these results suggest that recombination played a critical role in establishing polymorphism within Schizotequatroviruses.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Variations in host range</title><p id="P48">To finely quantify the host range of the 18 Schizotequatroviruses isolated from <italic>V. crassostreae</italic>, we first measured the titer of each phage on 157 <italic>V. crassostreae</italic> strains, including 124 isolates from the same location (Brest, France) and 33 isolates from a different location (Sylt, Germany) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

A cocktail of specialist phages might provide more robust protection. Nonetheless, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying Schizotequatroviruses’ broad host range—particularly antidefense systems—holds promise for engineering phages tailored to specifically target phylo-pathotypes sustainably and effectively.</p><p id="P71">In conclusion, Schizotequatroviruses reveal complex trade-offs that may be inherent to generalist phages. Their broad host range, genomic adaptability, and ecological dynamics highlight both their potential and limitations in diverse bacterial landscapes. Combining insights from natural diversity with targeted engineering holds potential for developing biocontrol strategies that balance efficacy with sustainability, offering promising avenues for future applications in microbial management.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS202346-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d71aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS202346-supplement-Supplementary_Tables.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d71aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S32"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We warmly thank Marc Monot and Laurence Ma (Biomics Platform, Institut Pasteur, France), Sophie Le Panse (MERIMAGE, Station Biologique de Roscoff, France), Peter Weigele and Yan-Jiun Lee (New England Biolabs, USA), and Denis Faubert and Marguerite Boulos (Proteomics Discovery Platform, Montreal Clinical Research Institute, Canada) for their invaluable technical assistance.

Rows represent phages, while columns represent hosts, ordered based on their respective core genome phylogeny.

The color of each cell on the heatmap indicates the efficiency at which a phage can infect a host (in Plaques Forming Units (PFU) / mL), as indicated in the legend at the bottom left corner. A light grey cell signifies that the host is resistant to the phage, while a dark grey cell indicates that the host is impaired when challenged by high phage titers, but no production of viable phages is observed.
