At the same time, lower respiratory tract infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Acute viral respiratory infections induce transitional changes in the lung; however, the impact of these changes on metastasis initiation and cancer progression remains unclear. Using primary murine MMTV-PyMT breast cancer cells in an experimental lung metastasis model, we show that changes induced by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection impair tumor cell seeding and early establishment in the lung, resulting in lower number of metastatic nodules. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this reduction of metastases is due to alterations in the lung environment mediated by type I interferons (IFNs) that are produced in response to RSV infection. Consistent with that notion, intranasal administration of recombinant IFN-α recapitulates the anti-tumor effect of RSV infection. Type I IFNs change the lung cellular composition and induce an Interferon Stimulated Gene (ISG) driven response, creating an alveolar environment that is less supportive of tumor cell growth. Indeed, epithelial cells from mice infected with RSV or intranasally exposed to IFN-α, are less supportive of tumor cell growth <italic>ex vivo.</italic> Altogether, our results suggest that type I IFNs induced by infection with some respiratory viruses perturb the lungs and consequently interfere with the ability of tumor cells to successfully initiate metastatic colonization.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>virus infection</kwd><kwd>lung metastases</kwd><kwd>immune cells</kwd><kwd>epithelial cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The lungs are anatomically positioned at the body-environmental interface where they play an essential role in gas exchange. The constant flow of air into the lower airways constantly exposes the lung cells to microbes, allergens, noxious gases and pollution particles. To prevent overexuberant immune response, the lung environment has a high threshold for immune cell activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). This provides an optimal niche for distant cancer cells to successfully start metastases, making the lungs the second most frequent site of metastasis for many malignancies, including colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, breast cancer and melanoma(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is the second leading cause of death globally(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), with invasive breast cancer being the leading cause of cancer deaths among women(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Lower respiratory tract infections caused by both viral and bacterial pathogens are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Respiratory viruses, such as coronavirus, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) commonly cause infections in the upper respiratory tract that can progress to the lower tract and result in severe bronchiolitis or pneumonia(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Seasonal vaccines for influenza virus and coronavirus are available worldwide for high-risk populations, including the immunosuppressed and the elderly, and there are recently-approved vaccines against RSV(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). RSV infection is often associated with childhood bronchiolitis. However, the elderly and immunocompromised are at high risk of developing severe disease and show increased mortality rates(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that RSV infections in older adults result in increased admissions to intensive care units compared to influenza virus infections(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Lung metastases and lower respiratory infections both have an impact on the lung environment and they can co-occur, yet the interplay between them remains unexplored. An association between pneumonia and bronchiolitis and higher risk of lung cancer has been suggested(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). However, these epidemiological findings have been based on selfreported pneumonia and primary lung cancer and do not consider the timing, number and types of infections or the stage of lung cancer. Thus, efforts are needed to decipher how changes induced in the lungs by viral infections and lung malignancies impact on the outcome of disease.</p><p id="P6">Many respiratory viruses infect lung epithelial cells and quickly induce a pro-inflammatory response that results in the activation of resident cells and the recruitment of innate immune cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). This rapid innate immune response limits viral replication and orchestrates the adaptive immune response, generating cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and a humoral response, important for viral clearance and for protection against subsequent infections(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). These immune responses change the lung environment and could therefore have an impact on lung cancer initiation, progression, as well as on metastatic spread to the lungs from different primary tumors. Cuff <italic>et al.,</italic> showed that influenza virus infection enhances the development of experimental lung metastasis in the B16 melanoma model by activation of bystander CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells not specific for the tumor antigens(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). However, Newman <italic>et al.,</italic> described that a productive influenza virus infection leads to a potent immune response that reduces the number of B16 metastatic nodules in the lungs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Although both studies used the same metastatic cancer model, infections were conducted at different times prior or after tumor cell injection, suggesting that the interplay between these diseases is temporally dynamic. Deciphering the mechanisms underlying the different outcomes in these studies could provide insights on how to improve cancer treatments.</p><p id="P7">Type I interferons (IFNs) comprise IFN-β and many IFN-α subtypes and are important anti-viral cytokines(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). During RSV infection, alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the main producers of type I IFNs, responding to the virus via mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-coupled retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Type I IFNs inhibit viral replication but are also involved in the recruitment of antiviral monocytes and activation of immune cells, which all together control infection and disease severity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Due to the ability of type I IFNs to modulate innate immune responses and to efficiently orchestrate the adaptive immune responses, their role in cancer immunosurveillance and their anti-tumoral and pro-tumoral effects have been extensively studied(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). However, the role of type I IFNs induced by respiratory viral infections in metastasis initiation and progression remains unclear.</p><p id="P8">We hypothesized that the early type I IFN-driven proinflammatory response induced by RSV infection influences the lung seeding and growth of breast cancer metastases. We therefore studied the ability of intravenously inoculated mouse mammary tumor virus-polyoma middle tumor-antigen cells (MMTV-PyMT cells) to seed and grow in the lungs of RSV-infected mice. We show that RSV infection a day before cancer cell injection reduces the seeding of the MMTV-PyMT cells in the lung, resulting in lower number of metastatic nodules. Moreover, we demonstrate that this reduction is due to type I IFNs changing the lung environment, generating less supportive conditions for metastatic initiation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>RSV infection reduces the number of metastatic nodules in the lungs</title><p id="P9">To investigate if RSV infection impacts the ability of metastatic cells to seed the lungs, survive and proliferate, we synchronized cancer cell seeding by using an experimental lung metastasis model. Primary breast carcinoma cells (MMTV-PyMT cells) were injected intravenously (i.v.) into FVB/N or C57BL/6J mice 24h after intranasal (i.n.) infection with RSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Tumor burden was assessed 28 days after cell administration by histological analysis and macroscopic nodule quantification. Interestingly, we found that FVB/N and C57BL/6J mice displayed lower number of metastatic nodules in the lungs when they were previously infected with RSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>). However, the metastatic nodules that did develop in RSV infected showed a similar size distribution to those in control mock-infected (PBS instillation) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-D</xref>). Similar results were found in BALB/c mice using 4T1 breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>). These data suggest that RSV infection inhibits metastatic lung colonization but that, once established, tumor cells can grow unimpeded.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The presence of metastatic cells in the lung does not influence the overall response to RSV infection</title><p id="P10">Using FVB/N mice, we also assessed if the presence of lung metastases influences the course of RSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>). FVB/N mice developed severe disease during RSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>), with increased weight loss compared to that which we have previously reported in C57BL/6J mice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Interestingly, administration of MMTV-PyMT cells a day after infection did not alter subsequent weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) or viral load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The total number of cells, mostly CD45<sup>+</sup>, recovered from the lungs and the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was quantified at different times post infection (p.i.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-F</xref>). RSV infection led to increased abundance of cells that could be recovered from the lungs and BAL at days 4 and 8 p.i., respectively. Interestingly, increased number of cells were detected at 18h and 3 days post cell administration (d2 and d4 p.i.) in all mice bearing MMTV-PyMT cells irrespective of RSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To further characterize the immune response induced by RSV in the presence of tumor cells, alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes, NK cells and T cells were quantified at different time points by flow cytometry (gating strategy <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>) in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G-H</xref>) and in the BAL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4A</xref>). RSV infection in FVB/N mice did not alter the number of alveolar macrophages (AMs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4A</xref>). However, the infection resulted in recruitment of neutrophils, with higher numbers of these cells detected 18h post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>)). Similarly, inflammatory monocytes (gated as Ly6G<sup>-</sup> SiglecF<sup>-</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD64<sup>+</sup> cells or Ly6G<sup>-</sup> SiglecF<sup>-</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>+</sup> cells) were detected as early as 18h p.i., with higher numbers in the PyMT-bearing mice at day 2 post-RSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). We also detected an increase in the abundance of NK cells, peaking at 4 days p.i., with higher numbers in the RSV-infected mice that also received PyMT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>). A transient increase in T cells was observed in the lungs of PyMT-bearing mice at day 2 and 4 p.i. but only at day 4 p.i. in RSV-infected animals that did not receive tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We next studied the expression of immune mediators triggered by RSV infection in the presence of tumor cells. In infected groups, similar levels of IL-6 and IFN-α were detected in the BAL fluid by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>) and in lung tissue by analysis of gene transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4B</xref>). Furthermore, levels of mRNA encoding <italic>Ifnb</italic> or <italic>Ifnl</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2J</xref>) and <italic>ll1b, Ccl2</italic> or <italic>Cxcl1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 4B</xref>) in lung tissue were similar across all the RSV-infected groups irrespective of tumor cell injection. We also studied the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), including <italic>Pkr, Viperin, Cxcl10, Mx1</italic> and <italic>Oas1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 4C</xref>). The same ISG expression profile was induced after RSV infection regardless of the presence of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4B-C</xref>). These data suggest that the overall innate immune response against RSV infection is largely unaffected by the presence of tumor cells in the lungs, with only a transient increase of inflammatory monocytes, NK cells and T cells in mice in which infection proceeds concomitantly with the presence of tumor cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Neutrophils, monocytes or NK cells are not essential to impair tumor cell metastases during RSV infection</title><p id="P13">Type I IFNs are induced by alveolar macrophages upon detection of RSV(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Interestingly, type I IFNs can induce an anti-tumor response by activating innate immune cells, including neutrophils, monocytes and NK cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). To assess a potential role of neutrophils in the anti-tumoral response we used anti-Ly6G mediated neutrophil depletion during RSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 5A</xref>). Interestingly, no differences in numbers of metastatic foci or tumor size were detected between infected mice with or without neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Neutrophil depletion also had no impact on RSV-induced disease severity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 5B</xref>). We have previously shown that mice lacking TRIF and MyD88 adaptor proteins are unable to recruit neutrophils to the lungs during RSV infection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). MyD88/TRIF deficient mice were infected with RSV and inoculated with tumor cells i.v. a day later (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 5C</xref>). Analysis of tumor burden showed that RSV-infected <italic>Myd88/Trif</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and wildtype mice displayed a similar decrease of metastatic nodules in their lungs after RSV infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 5D</xref>). Together, these data suggest that RSV-induced recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs does not have an essential role in reducing lung metastatic colonization.</p><p id="P14">We next studied the role of monocytes in the reduced metastatic burden after RSV infection. Monocytopenia was achieved using anti-CCR2 treatment(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) from the day of infection until day 5 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 5E</xref>). Disease severity caused by RSV infection was not altered in the absence of monocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 5F</xref>). Notably, lack of monocytes did not impact the number of metastatic foci as this was equally reduced in isotype-matched control vs. anti-CCR2 treated mice after RSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P15">RSV infection also cause an increase in the number of NK cells in the lungs, which is further potentiated by the presence of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>). We therefore depleted NK cells using anti-NK1.1 antibody before and during RSV infection. This did not impact weight loss caused by the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 5G and H</xref>) and, strikingly, did not curtail the inhibitory effect of the infection on metastatic establishment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). However, as expected, NK cell depletion in mock-infected mice led to an increase in lung metastases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). These results indicate that NK cells are not necessary for the reduction in lung metastatic initiation caused by RSV infection. Altogether, our results show that despite the RSV-dependent increase in neutrophils, monocytes and NK cells, each of those immune cells do not explain the virus-induced anti-tumoral response.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The T cell response during RSV infection does not play an essential role in decreasing the metastatic burden</title><p id="P16">We next studied T cell responses at day 8 post RSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). At this timepoint, we noticed clear differences in T cell number between infected and uninfected mice, yet these numbers were unaltered by PyMT inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 6A</xref>). Indeed, both RSV-infected tumor-free and tumor-inoculated groups displayed the same number of total T cells, specifically CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-C</xref>), as well as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the BAL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 6A</xref>). Activation of T cells, as determined by expression of CD69 and PD1, was also similar in all infected mice irrespective of inoculation with tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 6A</xref>). Further, levels of IFN-γ and Granzyme B detected in BAL fluid were similar across infected groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that the T cell response induced by RSV infection is not significantly affected by the presence of MMTV-PyMT cells in the lungs.</p><p id="P17">To formally evaluate the role of T cells on the anti-tumoral effect induced by RSV infection, CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were depleted with antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 6B</xref>). As previously shown(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), depletion of T cells decreases the weight loss seen at day 5-7 p.i. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 6C</xref>), which is due to immunopathology. However, regardless of the presence of T cells, RSV infection still led to a lower number of metastatic nodules compared to uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Thus, T cells are also dispensable for the reduced metastatic burden induced by RSV infection.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Type I interferons recapitulate the anti-tumoral effect observed after RSV infection</title><p id="P18">Type I interferons (IFN) are key anti-viral cytokines released early upon RSV infection and responsible for inhibiting viral replication and orchestrating the innate immune response by signaling through the IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). We first analyzed how IFN-α changes the lung environment within 18h of airway exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 7A</xref>). Administration of IFN-α i.n. to C57BL/6J mice or to FVB/N mice resulted in a transient inflammatory response characterized by activation of resident neutrophils (determined as CD64<sup>+</sup> neutrophils) and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 7B-D</xref>,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>)). Expression of several chemokines such as <italic>Ccl2</italic> and <italic>Cxcl1</italic> and cytokines including <italic>ll1b</italic> and <italic>ll6</italic> and ISGs was also increased at this time point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 7E-F</xref>). Thus, type I IFNs are sufficient to remodel the lung environment 18h after inhalation, the timepoint when tumor cells are injected i.v. in our model. To note, the presence of MMTV-PyMT cells, does not impact the overall lung immune response induced by IFN-α (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To determine if type I IFNs phenocopy the anti-tumoral effect of RSV infection, we administered two doses of recombinant IFN-α (IFN-α) intranasally to C57BL/6J mice, 24 and 18h prior to cancer cells injection and assessed tumor burden 28 days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Remarkably, compared to the control group, IFN-α exposure resulted in reduced number of metastatic nodules in the lung, to a similar extent as RSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Furthermore, UV-inactivated RSV, which does not induce a productive infection and therefore does not induce type I IFNs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), did not offer protection from metastatic burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Thus, early administration of type I IFNs, like RSV infection, has an anti-metastatic effect.</p><p id="P20">To assess if RSV-induced type I IFNs acting on host cells are necessary for metastatic reduction, we also infected mice lacking the type I IFN receptor (<italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Notably, RSV infection in <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice did not decrease numbers of metastatic nodules or size compared to the uninfected group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). To further assess if IFN-α impacts tumor cells directly, <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were treated with IFN-α to create a setting in which only the tumor cells can respond to the cytokine. IFN-α administration to <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice did not change the number of metastatic nodules or size compared to the mock treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that IFN-α induces changes in the lung environment rather than acting directly on the tumor cells to reduce metastatic initiation.</p><p id="P21">To further explore how the lung response to IFN-α influences the interaction with the metastatic cells, we performed scRNAseq analysis on lung cells from mice that had been exposed to PBS or IFN-α 18hrs prior to tumor cell injection. The lungs were collected 24hrs after the tumor cells were injected. In order to capture a good representation of the different cell types of the lung we sorted cancer, epithelial, immune and mesenchymal cells using FACS and analyzed them by single cell RNA analysis at a ratio of 1:3:3:3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). As predicted, GSEA analysis of the cancer cell cluster showed that cancer cells that were present in the IFN-α pre-treated lung showed a reduction in pathways linked to cell cycle and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>).

To test whether this could influence the ability of cancer cells to seed the lung, we followed <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor cell extravasation by injecting luciferase-expressing MMTV-PyMT cells into mice after exposure to RSV or IFN-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Bioluminescence was monitored at different time points after cell injection. Notably, RSV infection, as well as IFN-α administration, resulted in a reduced luciferase signal in the lung as early as 3.5h post injection, indicating a reduced ability of circulating cancer cells to seed the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D-E</xref>). This was confirmed by flow cytometry, using GFP-expressing MMTV-PyMT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 10</xref>). The reduced luciferase signal detected at 2- and 3-days post injection in the control group was very similar in all three experimental groups, suggesting that extravasation of metastatic cells per se is not affected by exposure to RSV or IFN-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>).</p><p id="P23">The Galectin pathway was major type I IFN induced gene driving the main increased pathway across the different lung cell types, and its activating ligand, Galectin 9 (<italic>Lgals9</italic>), was strongly increased also in endothelial cells and pericytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 11</xref>). Interestingly, Galectin 9 was reported to decrease the ability of cancer cells to extravasate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).

This resulted in an overall <italic>ex vivo</italic> reduction in bioluminescence at the day 28 end point, which was confirmed to reflect lower tumor burden by histological quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G-I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Lung epithelial cells from RSV infected or IFN-α exposed mice are less supportive of MMTV-PyMT cell growth</title><p id="P25">Fibroblasts are one of the most dominant tissue cells contributing to the tumor niche, and their early activation is a key factor for metastatic niche initiation of breast cancer cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).

An Alvetex™ scaffolds co-culture system that mimics the 3D tissue environment was used to culture GFP-expressing MMTV-PyMT cells in presence of the isolated fibroblasts or epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). Tumor cell growth was subsequently determined by the intensity of GFP signal at days 2, 5 and 8. Culture of tumor cells with fibroblasts from PBS-exposed mice induced cell proliferation, detectable as early as day 5. This was not altered in the presence of fibroblasts from mice infected with RSV or treated with IFN-α at any time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>). Co-cultures with epithelial cells from mock-treated mice showed significantly enhanced PyMT proliferation at day 8. Interestingly, when epithelial cells were isolated from RSV infected or IFN-α exposed lungs, they failed to support cancer cell proliferation to the levels seen in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E</xref>).

However, the lungs can also be exposed to respiratory viruses, which cause acute inflammation and changes to the environment. The interplay between respiratory viral infections and the initiation and progression of lung metastasis remains unclear. Here, using the MMTV-PyMT experimental metastasis model, we show that early events during RSV infection led to reduced seeding and colonization of breast cancer cells in the lungs.</p><p id="P27">Viral infections induce early secretion of IFNs, especially type I IFNs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). During RSV infection, AMs are the main producers of type I IFNs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). As the type I IFN receptor is expressed on all nucleated cells, type I IFNs can have a global effect in all different lung cell types. Signaling through the type I IFN receptor potentiates type I IFN production through a positive feedback loop and induces expression of ISGs, which can limit viral replication. It also causes activation of neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes, NK cells, dendritic cells and macrophages, increasing the complexity of the lung environment(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). In this study we found that intranasal delivery of IFN-α could mimic the anti-metastatic effect induced by RSV infection in the lung, suggesting that type I IFN receptor signaling during RSV infection creates an unfavorable environment for cell metastases in this model. Interestingly, in several other metastatic tumor models (melanoma; B16, K1735m and DX3, fibrosarcoma; UV2237) it has been reported that prophylactic i.p. administration of human hybrid IFN-α also reduces the number of lung metastases, further supporting a role for type I IFNs in decreasing the seeding and colonization of metastatic cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Furthermore, in hepatocellular carcinoma, subcutaneous treatment with IFN-α was shown to change the lung environment reducing the number of metastatic nodules independent of the primary tumor(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). There is evidence that type I IFNs can signal through the type I IFN receptor expressed on tumor cells to induce senescence or apoptosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). However, as intranasal administration of IFN-α to <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, (where only the MMTV-PyMT cells express the type I IFN receptor) had no impact on metastatic burden, the effect triggered by type I IFNs in our model is not due to a direct effect on tumor cells. Rather, type I IFNs mediate their anti-tumoral effect by changing the lung environment, leading to impaired establishment of metastatic breast cancer cell nodules.</p><p id="P28">We attempted to uncover the anti-tumoral role of the immune cells recruited and activated by RSV infection by depleting different immune cell populations. Interestingly, lack of RSV-induced neutrophil recruitment or depletion of neutrophils, NK cells, monocytes or T cells independently did not revert the phenotype and resulted in reduced numbers of metastatic foci. These depletion experiments demonstrate that none of the discussed immune cells on their own are necessary for mediating the anti-metastatic effect of type I IFNs and/or RSV infection. However, it is possible that due to the complexity of the lung environment during RSV infection, multiple immune cell types work together, or in a redundant manner, to impair metastatic initiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) and by reducing or depleting only one cell type, no overall effect on metastatic burden can be detected.</p><p id="P29">By measuring luciferase-expressing MMTV-PyMT cells <italic>in vivo,</italic> we demonstrated that exposure to RSV or IFN-α impairs tumor cell seeding and early proliferation in the lungs. Infiltrating cancer cells interact with cells in the lung parenchyma, which supports initiation of metastatic growth(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). For example lung epithelial cells play an essential role in supporting tumor cell growth(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) and they are also host cells for RSV replication(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). During respiratory viral infections, communication between lung epithelial cells, stromal cells and immune cells is critical for an effective viral clearance without excessive inflammation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). We show that RSV- or IFN-α-primed lung epithelial cells are less supportive of MMTV-PyMT cell growth. The key changes in epithelial cells induced by how RSV infection or type I IFNs remain to be determined. This could be directly by signaling through the type I IFN receptor in epithelial cells or indirectly via type I IFNs activating other stromal cells, such as fibroblasts(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), which then act on epithelial cells. Nevertheless, altogether, our data demonstrates that impaired metastatic cell homing, survival and/or early proliferation in the lungs of RSV infected mice is likely mediated by rapid changes to the non-immune compartment induced by type I IFNs.</p><p id="P30">The urgent need to understand the interplay between respiratory viral infection and metastasis to the lungs is becoming increasingly evident after the COVID-19 pandemic. Cohorts of cancer patients exposed to coronavirus infection provide a unique opportunity to follow cancer progression after respiratory viral infections. Notably, it has been proposed that COVID-19 disease can induce cancer reawakening and metastatic relapse(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). These human studies provide important insights and support our findings that respiratory viral infections can alter metastatic tumor progression. However, it is important to consider how different stages of cancer progression can dynamically alter the lung environment, perhaps leading to respiratory virus infections having differential effects that depend on the time point of infection relative to the stage of cancer. This is a key consideration when interpreting the data presented in our study, given that the MMTV-PyMT model lacks the generation of a pre-metastatic niche in the lungs by a primary tumor. However, this model has strengths in allowing us to directly investigate the temporal aspects of how respiratory viral infections impact on metastatic initiation, something that cannot be easily done in spontaneous metastasis models. Our findings may help identify targets that can be used to render the lungs less receptive to metastatic cells. Future studies will be necessary to assess how our findings can be translated into patients in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Mice</title><p id="P31">For <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments performed at Imperial College London C57BL/6J, FVB/N and BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River. <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (on a C57BL/6 background) and <italic>Myd88Trif</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (obtained from S.

Sequencing read configuration: 28-10-10-90).</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Bioinformatic Analysis</title><p id="P52">Raw reads were initially processed by the Cell Ranger v.2.1.1 pipeline, which deconvolved reads to their cell of origin using the UMI tags, aligned these to the mm10 transcriptome using STAR (v.2.5.1b) and reported cell-specific gene expression count estimates. All subsequent analyses were performed in R v.4.3.3 using the cellrangerRkit packages. Genes were ‘expressed’ if the estimated (log<sub>10</sub>) count was at least 0.1. Primary filtering was then performed by removing from consideration: genes expressed in fewer than 3 cells; cells expressing fewer than 200 genes; cells for which the total yield (that is, sum of expression across all genes) was more than two standard deviations from the mean across all cells in that sample; and cells for which mitochondrial genes made up greater than 4% of all expressed genes. Seurat V5(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>) was used to perform UMAP and for nearest-neighbour analysis on the integrated datasets (rPCA). Clusters identified using resolution of 0.5 were either assigned manually using specific cell type expression or for immune cells by cross-referencing to the ImmGen dataset(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). fGsea package was used for identification of cancer cell pathway changes using gene expression changes from FindMarkers and cross-referencing to Reactome pathways(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). CellChat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>) was used to identify receptor-ligand interaction changes between the two conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P53">Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (GraphPad software) version 9.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance</title></caption><p>Women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer have a low survival rate. The lungs are a common metastatic site and are constantly exposed to viral pathogens, such as coronavirus, RSV and influenza virus. Thus, breast cancer and respiratory virus infection are likely to co-occur, but their interplay remains unclear. We show that type I interferons (IFNs), induced upon viral infection impair metastatic cancer cell seeding of mouse lungs. This is potentially via an effect of IFNs on lung epithelial cells, which become less supportive of early tumor cell proliferation. These findings indicate that viral infections and type I IFNs can alter the lung environment and impair implantation of metastatic cells, which could be explored to improve future cancer treatments.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>RSV infection impairs the development of metastases in the lungs.</title><p>(A) Experimental setup.
