We identified a homozygous human <italic>WNT11</italic> variant in an infant with <italic>Situs inversus totalis</italic>, complex heart defects and renal hypodysplasia, and we used <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos to functionally characterize this variant. <italic>WNT11<sup>c.814delG</sup></italic> encodes a loss-of-function protein with reduced stability that lost signaling activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. This is remarkable, because the variant encodes a truncated ligand with nearly identical length and predicted structure to dominant-negative Wnts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alteration of the truncated C-terminal end can restore stability and dominant-negative signaling activity. Our study also suggests similar functions for WNT11 in human development as described in model organisms. Therefore, biallelic WNT11 dysfunction should be considered as novel genetic cause in syndromal human phenotypes presenting with congenital heart defects and renal hypoplasia, with or without laterality defects. The work presented here enhances our understanding of human development and structure-function relationships in Wnt ligands.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Xenopus</kwd><kwd>left-right axis development</kwd><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>renal hypodysplasia</kwd><kwd>congenital heart defects</kwd><kwd>situs inversus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Bilaterians have an overall bilateral symmetric body plan, but several internal organs display asymmetries along the left-right body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fliegauf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Namigai et al., 2014</xref>).

The LRO is a monociliated epithelium and its transient appearance, structure and function are remarkably conserved across most vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Blum et al., 2009b</xref>).

All of these are heterozygous and the majority represent private alleles, all with a very low allele frequency (&lt; 0.0001 minor allele frequency), suggesting that WNT11 has non- redundant functions and that biallelic loss-of-function variants will result in a human phenotype. In the affected individual, no additional putative disease-causing variants or CNVs were detected.

Thus, these results revealed striking functional differences in Wnt11-type ligands that differed only in few amino acids at their truncated C-termini.</p><p id="P21">To confirm that <italic>WNT11<sup>Δ814-1062</sup></italic> encodes a dominant-negatively acting Wnt ligand, we next injected <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos from a Wnt/β-catenin signaling reporter line (pbin7LEF::dGFP; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Haas et al., 2019</xref>)) unilaterally targeting the right neural plate and analyzed Wnt-driven GFP expression at st. 20 by epifluorescent microscopy. Additionally, we used overexpression of <italic>Xenopus wnt3a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kiecker and Niehrs, 2001</xref>) as positive control to stimulate reporter activity.

These data suggested that removal or replacement of frameshift amino acids from WNT11<sup>c.814delG</sup> generated dominant-negative acting WNT11 ligands.</p><p id="P22">The observed functional differences in C-terminally truncated WNT11 ligands could be due to changed molecular signaling properties of the ligands (e.g. loss of dimerization ability) or could lead to altered expression levels, e.g. by triggering protein degradation (e.g. due to protein misfolding). To investigate which scenario applied to WNT11<sup>c.814delG</sup>, we overexpressed WNT11, WNT11<sup>c.814delG</sup>, WNT11<sup>Δ814-1062</sup> or WNT11<sup>Δ850-1062</sup> and assessed protein levels as well as dimerization using sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting. To ensure specific reactivity of the anti-WNT11 antibody to the overexpressed human WNT11 constructs, we included uninjected as well as <italic>wnt11b</italic> injected controls in these assays. Uninjected and <italic>wnt11b</italic> injected samples showed only minor reactivity to the anti-WNT11 antibody, while a clear band around the expected 40 kDa was detected in WNT11-injected samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2C</xref>). In contrast to WNT11, WNT11<sup>c.814delG</sup> and WNT11<sup>Δ850-1062</sup> showed reduced abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2C</xref>), linking their reduced functional potencies to reduced protein concentrations. The modified ligand WNT11<sup>Δ814-1062</sup>, which also showed strong dominant-active activity, was in turn detected at the expected size (around 30 kDa) and at levels similar to the wt WNT11 ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2C</xref>). Comparison of Western results between reducing (standard) vs. non-reducing (allowing to detect Wnt ligand-dimers; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cha et al., 2009</xref>)) sample preparation conditions further indicated that all detectable ligands, including WNT11 and WNT11<sup>Δ814-1062</sup>, were able to form ligand dimers <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2D</xref>), a prerequisite for signaling activity.</p><p id="P23">Thus, we conclude from these results that changes in the last 12 amino acids in WNT11<sup>c.814delG</sup> render the ligand instable, leading to reduced protein levels and loss of normal or dominant-negative signaling activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">Our functional studies to characterize the novel human <italic>WNT11<sup>c.814delG</sup></italic> variant revealed that it encodes a loss-of-function allele: Overexpression of <italic>WNT11<sup>c.814delG</sup></italic> did not affect morphogenesis, left-right axis patterning and canonical Wnt signaling activity in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos. This was surprising, because the variant encodes a ligand with nearly identical length and predicted structure to the <italic>Xenopus</italic> dominant-negative Wnt11b construct (283 vs. 282 amino acids respectively) as well as to a dominant-negative acting Wnt11b ligand resulting from mis-splicing with 296 amino acid length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dichmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Tada and Smith, 2000</xref>). This lack of activity is not caused by functional differences of Wnt11 homologs across species, because overexpression of full-length WNT11 yielded similar results to <italic>Xenopus</italic> Wnt11b. Instead, our results suggest that the functional differences are due to changes of the composition of the last 12 frameshift amino acids. Removal of the 12 frameshift amino acids (<italic>WNT11<sup>Δ814-1062</sup></italic>) restored dominant-negative activity. Moreover, replacing these 12 amino acids with the wt sequence (<italic>WNT11<sup>Δ850-1062</sup></italic>) resulted in a ligand with weaker, yet clear dominant-negative activity. Our results further indicate that the lack of signaling activity by the WNT11<sup>c</sup>.8<sup>14delG</sup> variant is due to reduced protein levels, while C-terminally truncated ligands can generally still dimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cha et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Interestingly, removal of 12 amino acids from <italic>Xenopus</italic> dnWnt11b (<italic>Wnt11b<sup>Δ811-1059</sup></italic>) also resulted in a weaker dominant-negative activity of the ligand, and it was described that dominant-negative activity of Wnt ligands depends on their length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hoppler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">MacDonald et al., 2014</xref>). The first dominant-negative Wnts were constructed by C-terminally truncating the ligand behind a particular conserved cysteine (C13). In search of a dominant-negative Wnt8, the authors noted that a 30 amino acids shorter ligand than dnWnt8, which lacked the conserved cysteine, had only weak dominant-negative activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hoppler et al., 1996</xref>). Subsequently, dnWnt11b was designed with the premature stop positioned directly after the conserved cysteine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Tada and Smith, 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, our results reveal that dominant-negative behavior of Wnts cannot be dependent on a specific length or the presence of the cysteine residue, as WNT11<sup>Δ814-1062</sup> and Wnt11b<sup>Δ811-1059</sup> do not contain it. Instead, we propose that a combination of ligand length and amino acid composition is required for protein stability and dominant-negative activity, perhaps by allowing certain posttranslational modifications, including glycosylation and acylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Willert and Nusse, 2012</xref>), which are indispensable for Wnt structure and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Komekado et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kurayoshi et al., 2007</xref>). Amino acid changes might increase susceptibility for recognition by protein control mechanisms, such as unfolded protein response or destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Teng et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA seems rather unlikely, because we overexpressed synthetic mRNAs at high levels and the stop codon in <italic>WNT11<sup>c.814delG</sup></italic> is positioned 120 bases upstream of the last exon-exon-junction, a region which is typically insensitive to nonsense-mediated decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nagy and Maquat, 1998</xref>).</p><p id="P26">In line with our experimental results, the affected individual is homozygous for <italic>WNT11<sup>c.814delG</sup></italic>, while both heterozygous parents were healthy individuals (except for SIT in the mother), arguing against a dominant-negative function of WNT11<sup>c.814delG</sup> in humans.
