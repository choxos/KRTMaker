Nearly 5,000 independent experiments across multiple <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays produced motifs for just over half of the putative TFs analyzed (177, or 53%), of which most are unique to a single TF. The data highlight the extensive contribution of transposable elements to TF evolution, both in <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>, and identify tens of thousands of conserved, base-level binding sites in the human genome. The use of multiple assays provides an unprecedented opportunity to benchmark and analyze TF sequence specificity, function, and evolution, as further explored in accompanying manuscripts. 1,421 human TFs are now associated with a DNA binding motif. Extrapolation from the Codebook benchmarking, however, suggests that many of the currently known binding motifs for well-studied TFs may inaccurately describe the TF’s true sequence preferences.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Transcription factor</kwd><kwd>TF</kwd><kwd>ChIP-seq</kwd><kwd>HT-SELEX</kwd><kwd>GHT-SELEX</kwd><kwd>SELEX</kwd><kwd>SMiLE-seq</kwd><kwd>Motif</kwd><kwd>DNA-binding specificity</kwd><kwd>PWM</kwd><kwd>PBM</kwd><kwd>Codebook</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction and motivations</title><p id="P3">The human genome encodes &gt;1,600 putative transcription factors (TFs), defined as proteins that bind specific DNA sequence motifs and regulate gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. These DNA binding motifs are most commonly modelled as a Position Weight Matrix (PWM) that describes the relative preference of the TF for each nucleotide base pair in the binding site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, and can be visualized as a sequence logo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Several hundred putative human TFs still lack DNA binding motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, and even for well-characterized TFs, it remains controversial whether the reported motif model is accurate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and to what degree the TF’s sequence specificity contributes to binding site selection in living cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. These uncertainties are due in part to the fact that different methods for measuring TF binding, and for deriving PWMs from these data, can have different inherent limitations and biases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Such shortcomings represent fundamental hurdles for the analysis of gene regulation, as well as a myriad of related tasks in genome analysis, including the interpretation of conserved genomic elements and sequence variants, or genetic engineering such as synthetic enhancer design.</p><p id="P4">To address these issues, we analyzed a large majority of the as-yet uncharacterized human TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, as well as several dozen previously studied control TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, using a panel of assays that provide different perspectives on DNA sequence specificity. This unprecedented effort generated what we believe is the largest uniform data structure of its kind. We refer to this international collaborative project as the “Codebook/GRECO-BIT Collaboration”: the reagent set and laboratory experiments were initiated as the “Codebook Project”, alluding to the fact that TFs decode individual “words” in the genome, and the existing <underline>G</underline>ene <underline>RE</underline>gulation <underline>CO</underline>nsortium <underline>B</underline>enchmarking <underline>I</underline>ni<underline>T</underline>iative, GRECO-BIT, was then engaged for much of the data analysis and benchmarking.</p><p id="P5">In this paper, we present an overview of the data collection and its analysis, the resulting data, several major outcomes and findings of the Codebook study, and examples of prevalent phenomena and applications. We also introduce web resources that can be used to access the primary and processed data, including the PWMs. Accompanying manuscripts provide greater depth regarding biological findings, new assays, and intriguing TF families, as well as methods for identifying binding patterns (i.e. PWM derivation) and PWM benchmarking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><sec id="S2"><title>Codebook reagents, assays, and data structure</title><p id="P6"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> provides a schematic of the Codebook project. We chose 332 putative TFs (i.e., “Codebook TFs”) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>) for study by starting with a previously described list of 427 hand-curated “likely” human TFs that lacked known motifs or any large-scale DNA binding data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. We removed 95 C2H2 zinc finger (C2H2-zf) proteins for which we were already aware of unpublished data (mainly from our prior collaboration with ENCODE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>). As of June 2024, most of these putative TFs still lack motifs, outside of the Codebook study: of the 332, only 107 have PWMs on Factorbook<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and/or HOCOMOCO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Many of these motifs appear to be simple repeats, or common cofactor motifs (such as CTCF, REST, and CRE sites) (examples in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S1</xref>), but among the 107, 59 have at least one PWM that appears plausible for representing specificity of the TF (see below).</p><p id="P7">Among the 332 Codebook TFs, 180 contain C2H2-zf domains, while another 103 contain another type of well-known DNA-binding domain (DBD). Forty-nine did not have an established DBD at the outset of the study; these were mainly identified as sequence-specific in studies of individual proteins or regulatory sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. We simultaneously analyzed 61 control TFs, encompassing 29 well-characterized TFs representing diverse human DBD classes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and an additional 32 C2H2-zf proteins for which published ChIP-seq data were available and had led to a binding motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. For these controls, we incorporated the published SMiLE-seq and ChIP-seq data, rather than repeating the experiments.</p><p id="P8">To study the 332 Codebook proteins, we manually designed 716 protein-coding inserts, corresponding to full-length coding regions of the dominant isoform, and one or more DBDs (or subsets of C2H2-zf domain arrays), if there was a known DBD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>). We employed up to three different expression vectors for each insert, as required for the different assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, resulting in a total of 1352 new distinct constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S4</xref>). One of the assays, GHT-SELEX (Genomic high-throughput SELEX), is a new variant of HT-SELEX which is performed with fragmented genomic DNA. As described in the accompanying manuscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, GHT-SELEX yields peaks, analogous and often in agreement with ChIP-seq. GHT-SELEX thus provides a new perspective that bridges <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA binding. HT-SELEX and GHT-SELEX were performed with multiple protein sources (mammalian cell extracts, and two different systems for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription/translation) whereas SMiLE-seq and PBMs were performed with only one protein source. Multiple replicates were performed in many cases, for all assays.</p><p id="P9">The full Codebook data structure is composed of a total of 4,873 technically successful experiments (i.e. they produced data that could be analyzed by at least some subsequent processes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S5</xref>), The Codebook data structure, experimental information, and PWMs (see below) are accessible at multiple sources (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S28">Data Availability</xref>). Each experiment corresponds to one of the Codebook constructs (or one of the control constructs), analyzed using one of the assays, with one of the protein sources. Not every protein or every insert was analyzed in every assay, by design. For example, the ChIP-seq data only utilize full-length proteins, while Protein Binding Microarray data include only DBD constructs. Long human C2H2-zf domain arrays typically fail in PBMs, and such experiments were omitted. We note that, in general, experiments that are technically successful may not yield motifs that are specific to the TF assessed and supported by other data types (see below). For example, ChIP-seq can detect both indirect and non-sequence-specific DNA binding, as we explored separately<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. We also emphasize that the <italic>in vitro</italic> assays described here were conducted with unmethylated DNA. We explored the sensitivity of a subset (79) of the Codebook TFs to DNA methylation in an accompanying study, however, which introduces the methylation-sensitive SMiLE-seq variant (meSMS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. DNA binding interactions of 17 of the 79 were impacted by methylation, encompassing inhibition (10) and increased binding or alternative binding sites (7); these data were not incorporated in the analyses described herein.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Motifs are obtained from most C2H2-zf proteins, and half of those containing other DBD classes, but only a few proteins with previously unknown DNA binding domains</title><p id="P10">We next derived and examined motifs as PWMs for all the experiments in a semi-automated expert curation format, to identify “approved” experiments (i.e. experiments that contained clear enrichment of credible binding motifs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>)). This effort is described in detail in a separate manuscript that describes motif benchmarking, data sets, and success measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and also introduces a web resource that makes all of the motifs available for browsing and download. Briefly, our primary approach was to ask whether similar motifs were obtained for the same protein from different assays and whether the PWMs scored highly by a panel of criteria, including predictive capacity in other data types (depicted schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>bottom left</italic>), adapting a previously described motif benchmarking framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. To increase our ability to derive motifs that would score highly across data sets, we employed ten motif discovery tools, ranging from the widely used MEME suite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> to approaches based on machine learning or biophysical modeling, such as ExplaiNN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and ProBound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, thus producing hundreds of motifs per TF. In total, 177 Codebook TFs were associated with “approved” datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>bottom right</italic>), and a total of 1,072 experiments associated with these 177 TFs were approved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S5</xref>). 59/61 controls were also approved, suggesting a low per-TF false-negative rate.</p><p id="P11">The 177 Codebook TFs for which there are approved experiments are dominated by the C2H2-zf domain class, for which 67% (121/180) had approved experiments. These proteins typically contain an array of C2H2-zf domains that bind DNA in tandem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Some C2H2-zf domains can bind RNA, protein, or other ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The Codebook outcome indicates that most C2H2-zf proteins are indeed DNA-binding, although it does not rule out their other activities. Experiments for roughly half (50/103, or 49%) of Codebook TFs in other established DBD classes were also successful. Lack of approved experiments for a putative TF could represent false negatives, which could arise from lack of an obligate binding partner, a requirement for epigenetically modified DNA, lack of requisite post-translational modification in our experiments, or limitations of the methods. Alternatively, they could represent true negatives which are not unexpected; some <italic>bona fide</italic> DBD classes are known to have subtypes that lack sequence specificity (e.g. HMG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>). Among the Codebook proteins lacking a well-established DBD, only 6/49 (12%) yielded approved experiments (and thus motifs) (discussed in more detail below), suggesting that many of them may indeed lack sequence specificity.</p><p id="P12">We emphasize that our approval process was intentionally conservative, and many experiments were not approved despite being informative in some way (e.g. ChIP-seq yielding reproducible peaks, but no motif, which could indicate indirect association through other TFs or chromatin binding; these are explored in an accompanying manuscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>). We also note that our success criteria assume that the sequence preferences of TFs can be represented by PWMs. It is conceivable that uncharacterized TFs could instead recognize interspersed sequence patterns or other features of the DNA sequence that are not readily captured by PWM models or short k-mers.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Diversity and complexity among Codebook TF motifs</title><p id="P13">To gain an overview of the Codebook TF motifs, and to generate a representative PWM set, we next used expert curation to select a single PWM that is (i) high-performing among all “approved” experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>), (ii) representative of other high-performing PWMs for the same TF, (iii) consistent with expectation for the class of TF (e.g. the C2H2-zf “recognition code”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>), and (iv) high information content (IC) (i.e. with a “tall” sequence logo), provided it does not compromise PWM performance. The PWM selected in this process is typically not the highest scoring by criterion (i) alone, as our extensive process typically generated dozens of high-performing PWMs from which to choose, for approved experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S6</xref> shows sequence logos for these curated PWMs and their properties; the PWM IDs are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>, and all PWMs can be downloaded (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S28">Data Availability</xref>). Notably, no data type or motif derivation method stood out as highly preferred by the curators, who were blinded to the source (i.e. data type and derivation method for the PWMs).</p><p id="P14"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows an overview of similarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> among the curated PWMs. Small clusters along the diagonal mostly correspond to the handful of paralogs analyzed (e.g. TIGD4 and 5, SP140 and SP140L, DACH1 and 2, CAMTA1 and 2, and ZXDA, B, and C). In the middle of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> is a set of eight TFs that mainly bind CG dinucleotides, leading to similarity in DNA-binding, and in the lower right is a group of five AT-hook proteins that have similar preferences to A/T containing sequences. Most of the Codebook TF PWMs are unlike each other, however, and display a low similarity to any other known PWM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This result is partly explained by the large number of C2H2-zf proteins, which are known to differ in their DNA-contacting “specificity residues”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Regardless, a large majority of the Codebook TF motifs are apparently new, and all previous analyses in human regulatory genomics would have been unaware of the ~150 visibly distinct, curated motifs described here.</p><p id="P15">For dozens of TFs, the curated PWM had a degenerate appearance, i.e. there are few or no positions at which a specific base is absolutely required. Indeed, for fifty-two of them, no individual base at any position achieved a bit score of ≥1.4 in the curated PWM (equivalent to roughly &gt;10% of aligned binding sites having a variant base at that position) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S2A</xref>). Systematically increasing the information content (IC) (i.e., “unflattening” the sequence logo, and increasing the specificity) of the low-IC curated PWMs almost universally reduced performance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S2B,C</xref>), indicating that the degeneracy is required for accuracy. We also found that, overall, IC is not predictive of motif performance in the benchmarking effort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. It is counterintuitive that degeneracy (i.e. lower inherent specificity) would lead to better predictive capacity, but we note that similar findings by others support the validity of the result<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">We propose several explanations for this observation. First, lower IC tends to make affinity distributions across all possible k-mers less digital (i.e. it removes all-or-nothing dependence on specific base positions), which could facilitate the gradual evolution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences. Second, homomeric binding (possibly via “avidity”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>), which a body of evidence suggests is a widespread mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, should reduce reliance on optimal specificity to a single binding site, and strong binding sites may evolve more readily if weak binding sites tend to occur more frequently (and are selected). Third, motif degeneracy may be a consequence of forcing a single PWM to represent the specificity of TFs that, in reality, recognize multiple related motifs. For example, the dependency of binding energy on both enthalpy and entropy can lead to two distinct sequence optima<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>; in another example, different spacings of bZIP half-sites cannot be represented by a single PWM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Consistent with this last possibility, the accompanying manuscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> finds that combining multiple PWMs (by Random Forests) typically produces models that are more accurate across platforms, relative to any single PWM.</p><p id="P17">The C2H2-zf proteins present a special case in which a single TF might be anticipated to require multiple PWMs, because long C2H2-zf domain arrays could utilize different segments of the array to bind to either overlapping or distinct sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Until now, however, examples were sparse and anecdotal. In an accompanying manuscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, we present evidence that C2H2-zf proteins often bind multiple sequence motifs that correspond to different subsets of the extended motif predicted by the recognition code (i.e. protein-sequence-based computational prediction of C2H2-zf-domain specificities), consistent with varying usage of the C2H2-zf domains at different genomic binding sites being commonplace.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Underappreciated DNA-binding domains</title><p id="P18">The six Codebook proteins that were lacking canonical DBDs, yet yielded “approved” experiments and thus motifs (CGGBP1, NACC2, TCF20, PURB, DACH1, and DACH2), appear to represent cases of DBDs that were poorly described at the outset of the study. We and others have recently described CGGBP1 as the founding member of an extensive family of eukaryotic TFs derived from the DBDs of transposons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. NACC2 contains a BEN domain, which over the last decade has been clearly established as a sequence-specific DBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. TCF20 contains a potential AT-hook<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> (below the conventional Pfam scoring threshold), and yielded an AT-hook-like motif. PURB is composed largely of three copies of the PUR (Purine-rich-element binding) domain; it yielded a motif on four different PBM assays (resembling ACCnAC/GTnGGT), which is unlike its previously established binding site (CTTCCCTGGAAG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. The sequence specificity of this protein thus remains enigmatic.</p><p id="P19">DACH1 and DACH2 are paralogs that yielded very similar motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). They contain a SKI/SNO/DAC domain, shared with their <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart Dachshund, from which their name is derived. A Forkhead-like motif (different from the one we obtained) was previously described for DACH1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, but to our knowledge, no other homolog has been reported as being sequence-specific. The SKI/SNO/DAC domain includes a helix-turn-helix (HTH), a feature found in many DBDs. Alphafold3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> predicts that the HTH inserts into the major groove precisely at the PWM-predicted binding site within an extended DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interpro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> lists over 7,000 proteins containing SKI/SNO/DAC domains, entirely in metazoans, with specific expansions in several fish lineages, particularly barbels and salmonids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). SKI/SNO/DAC therefore may represent an expansive class of poorly-characterized DBDs.</p><p id="P20">In addition to these six examples, the sequence specificity of SLC2A4RG and ZNF395 – both C2H2-zf proteins – appears to reside in their C-clamp. The domain is also present in TCF7L and LEF proteins, where it is known to bind DNA alongside their HMG domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Alphafold3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> predicts that the single C2H2-zf domains in SLC2A4RG and ZNF395 are not the main determinants of DNA-binding (although they may contact the major groove), but instead that a region corresponding to the C-clamp model on the SMART database of protein domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> binds the major groove precisely at the PWM-predicted binding site within an extended DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). There is one additional human TF matching the C-clamp model, ZNF704, with a published PWM that is virtually identical to that of SLC2A4RG and ZNF395 (CCGGCCGG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Like the SKI/SNO/DAC domain, the C-clamp is found broadly across animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, and may therefore also represent a large class of unexplored DBDs.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Widespread contribution of transposons to the human TF repertoire</title><p id="P21">Sixteen of the Codebook TFs (and two controls) that yielded approved experiments possess a DBD that has been co-opted from a DNA transposon: CGGBP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, five proteins containing BED-zf domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, six with the related CENBP or Brinker domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, two with transposon-derived Myb/SANT domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, one with a MADF domain, and FLYWCH1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. The PWMs obtained for CENPB/Brinker TFs are often long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). A striking example is JRK, a TF that is derived from an ancient domesticated Tigger element DBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, and is found broadly in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. All DNA transposons, including Tigger, have been extinct in the human lineage for over 40 million years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Remarkably, genomic binding of JRK is enriched for binding to a subset of Tigger elements, and the consensus sequence for these same elements has a PWM-predicted binding site for JRK in the terminal repeats of these elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), consistent with its presumed ancestral role in transposition. We speculate that JRK may represent a case of co-option in which the same DNA transposon simultaneously introduced both a multitude of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, and the TF that binds them.</p><p id="P22">The Codebook data also underscore that many TFs bind preferentially and intrinsically to specific repeat classes. These interactions are explored in greater detail in the accompanying manuscripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Binding to endogenous retroelements is known to be a common property of the KRAB-domain-containing C2H2-zf (KZNF) subfamily <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, but until now it has not been clear that the recruitment is defined almost entirely by the sequence specificity of the KZNFs alone. The combination of assays run here, particularly GHT-SELEX, extends earlier observations by pinpointing the exact binding sites, and demonstrating that these proteins typically have high specificity for these elements, because they bind preferentially to precisely the same elements <italic>in vitro</italic>. Binding preferentially to retroelements is not limited to KZNFs, but includes other C2H2-zf proteins and other classes of TFs. For example, binding sites for TIGD3, a transposon-derived TF which is closely related to JRK, are enriched for binding to L1s, SINEs, and DNA transposons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Codebook PWMs predict TF binding in independent data and across cell types</title><p id="P23">The Codebook project was conducted over a period of nearly six years, and during this time, several large-scale studies aimed at systematic ChIP-seq analysis of human TFs (e.g. ENCODE) were published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>.

We grouped both types of ChIP-seq data in our study and compared them to the external data. We first asked whether Codebook peak sets overlapped with these external peak sets for the same TF. Among the major ENCODE cell lines, the highest overlap values (Jaccard index) were found with experiments utilizing the same cell type (HEK293 cells) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S3A,B</xref>). Slightly lower Jaccard values were obtained for experiments performed in HepG2 and other cell types, which would be expected given the altered chromatin profiles in different cell types, but over one-third were still clearly nonrandom (Jaccard &gt; 0.1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S3C</xref>). Overlap scores with published K562 data, which dominate the external ChIP data due to a single large ChIP-exo study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, were much lower, overall (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S3D</xref>).

These results, summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S4</xref> and in greater detail in an accompanying manuscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, provide strong support for the functional importance of Codebook TF binding sites in the genome.</p><p id="P27">Many of the CTOP sites were either overlapping or adjacent to CTOP sites for the same or other TFs. We grouped them into 50,375 clusters, based on proximity (allowing a maximum of 100 bases, to capture binding to different segments of what may be the same regulatory element). Codebook TFs with the largest number of CTOP sites were typically associated with CpG islands, which represented 37.5% of all the clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The majority of protein-coding promoter CpG islands (58.7%, 7,892/13,427) contained CTOP sites, with an average of 4.3 CTOP sites per CpG island. Moreover, 59/101 (58%) of all Codebook TFs had at least one CTOP site within a CpG island. An example CTOP that overlaps a CpG island is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>.</p><p id="P28">The extent of specific, conserved, and intrinsic occupancy of CpG islands by many TFs of diverse classes is, to our knowledge, unexpected. The abundance of CG dinucleotides in CpG islands has been attributed primarily to their lack of methylation in the germline, rather than primary sequence constraint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. There is one class of TFs (the CXXC proteins) that is known to specifically recognize unmethylated CG dinucleotides and to modulate chromatin at promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, and we do observe this property for the CXXC proteins KDM2A, CXXC4, FBXL19, and TET3. Intriguingly, however, many of the Codebook TFs with CTOP sites in CpG islands recognize elaborate C/G rich motifs, rather than CG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P29">CTOP clusters were also found in non-CpG island protein-coding promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) (855/6,606 such promoters, defined as -1000 to +500 relative to TSS). These clusters are not dominated by any specific TFs, although some TFs are more prevalent than others (e.g. CTOPs for the controls ELF3 and CTCF, and Codebook TF ZBTB41, are each found in ~10% of all non-CpG promoters) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref> shows an example of one such non-CpG promoter cluster, occurring early in the first intron of the TSPAN31 gene, which exhibits apparent conserved spacing and orientation of multiple Codebook TF binding sites. In contrast, CTOP clusters outside of promoters and CpG islands often contain just one or two CTOP sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). One example is a very strongly conserved intergenic ZNF689 binding site found in an L1ME1 transposon; this site is just over 100 bp from a predicted enhancer containing a CTCF binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p id="P30">A total of 42,200 distinct CTOP clusters (out of 50,375) overlapped catalogued conserved elements (UCSC PhastCons track), thus indicating a likely biochemical function for these elements. For the remaining 8,175, detection of functional elements from base-level scores is now augmented by the TF binding information. Relatively few CTOP clusters overlapped with known enhancers, however: only 4,768 are found in the extensive GeneHancer annotation set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>, and 2,819 overlap with HEK293 enhancers ( defined by ChromHMM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>). This low overlap could be attributed to the relatively rapid evolution of enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, or to lack of complete knowledge of enhancer identities. We also note that, even for well-studied TFs, most TOP sites were classified by our methods as not conserved, and that roughly half of the Codebook TFs had few or no conserved TOP sites (particularly the aforementioned retroelement-binding KZNFs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S4</xref>). Lack of conservation does not demonstrate that a sequence is not a functional binding site, however, as turnover in functional genomic binding sites of TFs is common<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. This result is nonetheless consistent with the notion that many TF binding sites are coincidental, redundant, or serve(d) a purpose other than host genome regulation. In the accompanying manuscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, we explore potential functions for proteins that frequently bind non-conserved sites in genomic “dark matter”.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Relationships between Codebook TFs, SNVs and chromatin</title><p id="P31">Because the CTOP sites are evolutionarily constrained, we reasoned that they might also be less frequently associated with human sequence variation, and indeed, 92.6% of CTOPs lack SNPs and other common short variants, while only 82.1% of unconserved TOPs are variant-free. Both are depleted of common SNPs, however, when examined separately (Fisher’s exact test p ~ 2.4x10<sup>-307</sup> and odds ratio = 0.657, p ~ 0 and ratio = 0.872, respectively). The CTOP SNPs also have a lower impact on PWM scores: on average, the relative PWM score for SNP-containing CTOP sequences declines by 0.027, while PWM scores for unconserved TOPs decline by 0.057 (median declines of 0.011 and 0.0285, respectively). CTOPs are furthermore depleted of common short indels (Fisher’s exact test, p ~ 1x10<sup>-150</sup>, ratio = 0.77), while unconserved TOPs (which often overlap with simple repeats) are enriched (p &lt; 1x10<sup>-150</sup>, ratio = 3.318), relative to genomic background. The depletion of common SNPs is consistent with ongoing purifying selection of CTOPs within recent human populations, and the association of SNPs with specific TFs should provide a ready means for directed study of the functionality of the encompassed SNPs.</p><p id="P32">We reasoned that the GHT-SELEX and ChIP-seq experiments would also allow direct assessment of allele-specific binding (ASB) of TFs, by quantifying allelic imbalance of read counts at SNVs. We note that the data were not initially intended for this purpose, and caveats included relatively low read counts, linked SNVs, and the fact that HEK293 has an abnormal karyotype and was derived from a single individual. Nonetheless, there was sufficient coverage in the sequencing data to make 925,003 variant calls overlapping with dbSNP common SNPs (889,820 variant calls from 362 ChIP-seq experiments and 35,183 from 374 GHT-SELEX multi-cycle experiments), at 122,364 unique genomic locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Table S9</xref>). 10,009 of these genomic locations were associated with 12,056 ASBs of 160 Codebook TFs and 46 positive controls in ChIP-seq (10,571 ASBs) or GHT-SELEX (1,485 ASBs) samples, i.e. there was a significant imbalance in the sequencing reads for the two alleles overlapping the respective SNPs. Among these ASBs, 3,569 also overlapped a PWM hit for the TF, and for 2,367 of them, the read count imbalance was concordant with the change in PWM scores, i.e. the allele with the higher read count also has a higher PWM score (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S5A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Table S9</xref>). (ASBs that do not overlap a PWM hit may be linked to a “causative” SNV, which may act indirectly). ASBs for control TFs were strongly enriched with previously-known ASBs of those TFs (ADASTRA database, odds ratio of 5.7, p &lt; 10<sup>-15</sup>, Fisher’s exact test)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>, and nearly three-quarters of ASBs coincided with eQTLs (GTEx database, odds ratio of 1.2, p &lt; 10<sup>-15</sup>, Fisher’s exact test)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S5C</xref>), supporting the reliability of the detected ASBs as well as the validity of detected PWM hits.</p><p id="P33">Compared to whole-length peaks, TOP regions had an increased density of variant calls (~258 sufficiently covered variants per Mb in TOPs, versus 52 per Mb for peaks), and a larger fraction of ASB calls in SNVs (30%, compared to 9% for full peaks), presumably due to detection bias from higher ChIP-Seq or GHT-SELEX coverage at the TOPs. Nonetheless, variants in TOPs had a significantly higher predicted effect on protein binding (i.e. PWM score change) for both controls and Codebook TFs (p &lt; 2.22x10<sup>-5</sup> and p &lt; 2.98x10<sup>-12</sup>, Mann-Whitney U test), relative to full peaks or non-ASB SNPs overlapping PWM hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, the ASBs in TOPs are more likely to induce an effect than those elsewhere within peaks, presumably because they represent direct TF binding.</p><p id="P34">Among the mechanisms connecting TF binding to biological function are TF-mediated chromatin state changes. Hence, in heterozygotes, variant-dependent TF binding may co-occur with allele-specific chromatin accessibility variants (ASVs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), which are SNVs with imbalanced read counts in ATAC-seq and/or DNase-seq experiments. To ask whether the Codebook TFs may be involved in control of ASVs, we utilized the UDACHA database, which contains ASVs from 577 ATAC-seq and 321 DNase-seq datasets from individual cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Table S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S5D</xref>). Using a multi-tiered procedure (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>), we identified cases in which (1) ASVs in a specific cell type overlap significantly with PWM hits for a TF in the Codebook motif collection, (2) the change in the PWM score is concordant with the read imbalance in the ASVs, (i.e. stronger predicted binding is associated with more accessible chromatin), and (3) the concordance is significant across cell types detected in step (1). This procedure identified 53 TFs whose PWM hits were found often at, and concordant with, ASVs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S5E</xref>). Twenty of these TFs were positive controls including well-known pioneers or activators (such as SOX2, GABPA, or JUN/FOS-family TFs), while 33 were previously unexplored Codebook TFs, including ZNF70, GRHL3, MYPOP, SP140(L), and DMTF1. An example ASV for ZNF70, in a region upstream of the PTMS gene that is annotated with multiple ENCODE enhancer elements is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>.</p><p id="P35">For 34 of these 53 TFs, there was at least one ASV-overlapping TOP site (the non-TOP sites may represent sites that are not bound in HEK293). To assess whether ASVs in PWM hits have a greater effect at TOP sites than in other regions, we first removed cases in which the TF does not appear to impact chromatin directly, by grouping the TFs into ASV-concordant (i.e. having overall concordance between ASVs and PWM hits in ChIP-seq or GHT-SELEX peaks; 18 TFs), and others (16 TFs). We separated the ASV-concordant group into Codebook and control TFs. For each of the groups, we then calculated the concordant-to-discordant ratio for loci that corresponded to PWM hits that are non-ASV for that TF, ASV, ASV in TF’s peaks, and ASV in TOPs, and observed an overall monotonic increase in concordance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, the highest-confidence Codebook TF binding sites for these TFs are those most likely to impact the chromatin state. Moreover, the fraction of ASVs within PWM hits also increased monotonously as the ASV confidence increased, and the ASVs preferably occur at binding site positions that are most important for the PWM score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S5F</xref>), further supporting relevance of the TF sequence preferences.</p><p id="P36">Overall, the Codebook motifs provide a valuable resource for SNV interpretation, including identification of mechanisms that underpin variation in chromatin and transcription.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Lessons from Codebook: prospects for a complete human TF motif collection</title><p id="P37">Codebook yielded several clear outcomes, and guidance for future efforts. The high success rate is particularly striking. We obtained motifs for 177 previously uncharacterized human TFs, a number larger than the entire TF repertoire for many eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>. The selected PWMs for most of these TFs are unique, and unlike any previous TF motif. Most are from C2H2-zf proteins, and most C2H2-zf proteins analyzed were successful. Thus, a majority of putative and uncharacterized human TFs are <italic>bona fide</italic> TFs, and not annotation errors. We envision that the data produced will be broadly and immediately useful for a variety of applications. Motifs (especially as PWMs) are a standard component of the computational genomics toolkit, due to their utility in a range of tasks ranging from identification of key regulatory factors to building and interpreting models of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. For example, differential binding of TFs to noncoding SNVs (Single Nucleotide Variants) is thought to be a major mechanism by which these variants contribute to phenotypic differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>, and the Codebook data therefore provide vital new information for the analysis of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation.</p><p id="P38">A key technical demonstration of the Codebook project is that the simultaneous application of multiple experimental strategies and multiple motif-derivation and motif-scoring strategies was highly beneficial. No single experiment type or data analysis approach dominated all others, or was universally successful, although specific assays were more or less advantageous for different classes of proteins (as evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). For example, PBMs were uniquely successful with AT-hook proteins, while ChIP-seq and SELEX variants were most successful for C2H2-zf proteins. We caution that there are confounding variables limiting what conclusions can be drawn regarding the strengths and weaknesses of experimental platforms. The protein production and purification method can differentially impact success of specific DBD classes, even when the same assay is used, and the different assays we employed were tied to different affinity tags and expression systems. Data pre-processing (i.e. read filtering and background estimation) is an additional variable that we did not systematically explore, but is known to impact all of the assays used here.</p><p id="P39">As noted above, a subset of the Codebook TFs, as well as other poorly characterized TFs, have been analyzed by others since our study began. To evaluate the current scope of known human TF specificities, we surveyed JASPAR, HOCOMOCO, and Factorbook for PWMs for putative TFs that were not included in this study or not found among 177 Codebook successes. These databases reported PWMs for 107 proteins, 63 of which we had tested, and 44 were among the 95 putative TFs not included in our experiments. We manually curated these external PWMs, using procedures similar to those we applied to our own data, to assess whether they are likely to represent the <italic>bona fide</italic> specificity of the TF analyzed. Many of them were comprised of simple repeats (which are common artifacts in virtually all assays) or appeared to correspond to indirect binding and/or recruitment by other TFs in ChIP-seq (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table S8</xref> for annotations and classification, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Figure S1</xref> for examples of nonspecific, concordant, and likely correct PWMs in the external datasets).</p><p id="P40">Based on this curation, 33 additional human TFs (i.e. beyond the 177 described here) have at least one plausible motif available in datasets that have been performed since our 2018 TF census<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, leading to a total of 1,421 human TFs now with characterized sequence specificities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">Table S10</xref>). Altogether, only 175 proteins with conventional DBDs now lack known sequence specificity. Not all proteins with such domains are necessarily TFs; for example, one systematic trend we observed is that almost all 36 proteins we tested with only a single C2H2-zf domain failed in every assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). At the same time, however, new DBD classes continue to appear, such as the aforementioned BEN, CGGBP, Dachshund, and C-clamp. Some TFs may bind only to methylated DNA, and ongoing advances in the prediction of protein and protein-DNA structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> have the potential to identify additional candidates for sequence-specific DNA binding.

We then divided this date into four categories corresponding to cell type: HEK293/HEK293T, HepG2, K562, and other cells. Then, for each combination of TF and cell type category, we selected a single peak set. We preferentially selected the peak sets from GTRD, because it contains systematically derived peak sets; we also note that GTRD contains the majority of ENCODE consortium experiments, together with many non-ENCODE experiments. When multiple experiments were available for a TF in a cell type category, we selected the experiment with higher counts. If multiple computational methods had been used to derive peak sets for the selected experiment, we chose the peak set using a preferential order MACS, GEM, SISSRS, PICS and PEAKZILLA.

We scanned Codebook and external peak sets (and corresponding negative sets) with the expert curated Codebook motifs as PWMs using AffiMX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, and calculated AUROC values. Additionally, for the 19 Codebook TFs with a successful Codebook ChIP-seq experiment, a Codebook PWM, an external ChIP-seq experiment, and an external PWM, we compared the performance of PWMs across the different peak sets as follows. We first selected a single external PWM for each of the 19 TFs by scanning each PWM for a given TF on each external peak set for the same TF and identifying the PWM that produced the highest AUROC.
