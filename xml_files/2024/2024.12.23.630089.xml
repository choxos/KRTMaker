An increased understanding of predatory protein function can be achieved by analyzing their relative abundance at key stages of predation.

Periplasmic predatory bacterium <italic>Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</italic> is regarded as a ‘living antibiotic’ due to its low immunogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and capability to kill many MDR Gram-negative pathogens, including many on the WHO priority pathogens list<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, irrespective of their antibiotic resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Further advantages of <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> include the ability to reduce biofilms of MDR Gram-negative pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, as well as Gram-positive <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. When encountering the latter, it is known to secrete a multitude of proteases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3"><italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> is a model organism for periplasmic predation, is genetically-tractable and found in many different environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. This predator invades through the outer leaflet of the prey and establishes itself in its periplasm, feeding on it as a nutrient source, before dividing and lysing the prey cell remnants to escape and search for new prey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Understanding this fascinating predatory life cycle is important for a potential future medical application of <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic>, next to learning about this predator-prey interaction. Approximately one-third of the genes in the <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> HD100 genome encode proteins whose function are unknown and lack recognizable homology to proteins from other (non-predatory) bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. As an organism with one of the highest densities of hydrolytic enzymes in the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, a predatory proteome would be ideal to discover novel, unique or modified enzymatic functions and serve as a potential source of new antimicrobial drugs.</p><p id="P4">Bacterial-damaging predatory enzymes are needed when crossing the outer membrane and cell wall of the bacterial prey, which first occurs upon invasion of the prey and again at the end when the predator exits from the prey cell remnants. Many aspects of how the predator escapes and lyses the remaining prey structures are still unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The genome of <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> encodes ∼10% hydrolytic enzymes, including 150 predicted protease genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, of which a subset could aid the predator to escape the depleted prey. For example, the hydrolytic capability of host-independent <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> HIB strain to clear <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm involves various proteases and peptidases (e.g. Bd2269, Bd2321 and Bd2692) present in its supernatant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Subsequently, direct application of purified proteases Bd2269 and Bd2692 to a <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm effectively reduced it, likely affecting the biofilm’s complex network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. While these represent some examples of known hydrolytic and bacterial-damaging functions, the vast majority of proteins with hydrolytic or unknown function in <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> remain uncharacterized. To facilitate this, additional information on protein abundance at the different phases of the predatory life cycle may be helpful.</p><p id="P5">Holistic, high-throughput genomic and transcriptomic studies on <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> facilitated research on mechanisms of predator-prey interactions. For example, early transcriptomics studies revealed a “predatosome” of genes involved in invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, aiding research on the initial phase of prey entry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. mRNA levels have served as a proxy for protein levels, although the correlation between mRNA and protein abundance has generally not been shown to be very strong, e.g. due to additional transcriptional and translational regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Since proteins carry out cellular functions, using proteomics to directly measure protein expression can provide a more accurate view of the cellular processes.</p><p id="P6">To date, studies using proteomic approaches in <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> have been performed using a label-free shotgun approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. An early study by Dori-Bachash and colleagues identified differentially expressed proteins from AP and growth phases in <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> HI-6, a host-independent strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. More recently, Tyson et al. identified that deletion of Bd0875, a predatory MIDAS-family adhesin protein, leads to ∼10% of rounded, but uninvaded prey cells. These were separated at the end of the predatory life cycle and analyzed, revealing a list of secreted proteins into the prey that was deemed sufficient for prey killing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Generally, in label-free data-dependent shotgun proteomics the quantification is based on MS1 measurements, where the intensity of peptide precursor ions is assumed to correlate with protein abundance in the sample. However, relying solely on unique peptides as markers for protein abundance may not necessarily capture differences between samples. Additionally, challenges inherent to label-free proteomics like retention time variability and missing values may contribute to inaccurate identification or quantification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based isobaric labelling enables precise peptide quantification by measuring the reporter ion intensity of the TMT label of a given peptide. By labelling each sample with different TMT labels and processing them together, a direct ratio can be derived between the different samples based on their distinct reporter ions, allowing precise quantitative comparisons. The ability to multiplex samples and use offline prefractionation further increases the sensitivity and accuracy of proteomics analysis in contrast to shotgun proteomics. Therefore, TMT-based quantitative proteomics is ideal to study the predatory life cycle of <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> and provides a precise snapshot of the protein levels.</p><p id="P8">In this study, we generated a highly resolved quantitative proteome of predatory proteins identified throughout the predatory life cycle using TMT labelling. This dataset comprises 61% of <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> proteins at high confidence that are present over the entire predatory life cycle on <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K-12 MG1655. We provide the protein abundances throughout the predatory life cycle and log<sub>2</sub> of the fold changes [log<sub>2</sub>(FC)] of each protein compared to the free-swimming attack phase (AP) to inform hypothesis generation on predatory proteins of unknown function. Further, we identified nine distinct protein clusters, exhibiting similar expression patterns. Also, we show that one of the most highly abundant proteases in the exit phase, Bd2269, is involved in escape from the depleted prey cell and caused <italic>E. coli</italic> internal cell damage upon heterologous expression. Overall, this highly resolved quantitative predatory proteome will be a useful resource to investigate this bacterial predatory-prey interaction, while we show that it helps to identify cell-damaging predatory enzymes potentially useful to combat MDR pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Quantitative predator proteome analysis of 2195 proteins over the whole predatory life cycle</title><p id="P9">To support hypothesis generation of predator enzymes of unknown function and gain a holistic overview on the cell biology of periplasmic predator <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic>, we generated a quantitative proteome over the whole predatory life cycle. Samples collected at various time points of the predatory life cycle, ranging from 15 minutes to 7 hours after mixing predator with the model organism <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 as prey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, T15’ - T7h), were processed. Using TMT isobaric labelling we generated a high-quality predator proteome covering all phases of the periplasmic predatory life cycle from five biological and independent repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). After normalization of protein abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), 2195 predator proteins were quantified throughout the full predatory life cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). This corresponds to approximately two-thirds of all <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> HD100 predicted proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. To assess the quality of the quantitative dataset, various analyses were conducted.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>High data quality reflecting cyclic nature of predatory life cycle confirmed by principal component analysis</title><p id="P10">Principal component analysis (PCA) of the quantitative predatory proteome effectively clusters samples from each timepoint of the predatory life cycle, mirroring the different phases without batch effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, 1b</xref>). The circular pattern of the samples in the PCA, arranged in temporal order, reflects the cyclic nature of the life cycle. The 7-hour samples gravitate back to the AP starting condition, indicating that the protein abundance levels of new predator progeny are again similar to the initial AP. A hierarchically clustered heatmap effectively groups the phases of the predatory life cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Samples of the attack and invasion phase, growth (T2h), division and early exit (T3h &amp; T4h), as well as late exit and reversion to AP following exiting (T5h, T6h, T7h) are grouped similarly, further validating the quality of the data. Both the PCA and hierarchically clustered heatmap confirm the high reproducibility and quality of the normalized data across the different predatory life cycle phases. The resulting quantitative data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) serves as a valuable resource to track predatory protein abundance over the whole predatory life cycle for hypothesis generation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Identification of nine distinct clusters of predatory proteins with similar expression trends throughout the predatory life cycle</title><p id="P11">To facilitate hypothesis generation for the function of unknown predatory proteins, proteins with similar expression patterns were clustered. Protein abundances were normalized to ‘AP+Ec’ so all proteins start at a value of 0. The hierarchically clustered heatmap shows protein expression changes over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Based on hierarchical clustering, the data was initially divided into 18 clusters. Due to similar expression patterns of some clusters, these 18 clusters were manually grouped into nine distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). These nine clusters reflect specific expression patterns distinct for different phases of the life cycle.</p><p id="P12">A functional cluster of orthologous genes analysis of these protein clusters revealed that up to half of the proteins in some clusters have unknown functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In clusters A and B, where protein abundance increases during prey cell entry and bdelloplast establishment, the highest functional category, aside from unknown, is cell wall/membrane and envelope biogenesis. This likely reflects the predatory proteins involved in manipulating and remodeling of the prey cell upon entry, many of which have been described in connection with prey peptidoglycan manipulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. In cluster D, peaking at 3h with slow drop towards the end of the periplasmic predation cycle, are mainly the categories of transport and metabolism of inorganic ions, carbohydrate, and coenzymes, as well as replication, recombination and repair, consistent with periplasmic feeding and growth during this phase. In clusters E and G which peak at 4 h, a major functional category is cell cycle control, cell division and chromosome partitioning, expected with progeny cell division at that phase. Finally, clusters G and I, increasing from 3 h onward, show a large proportion of cell motility proteins, indicating flagellar synthesis for predator progeny cells. Additionally, cluster I also shows increased signal transduction, indicating an increased need for stimulus integration in new predatory cells. Although analyzing protein expression trends provide insights into proteins that may have similar functions or interactions, performing pairwise comparison between two different phases of the predatory life cycle by differential expression enables a detailed view of most extremely regulated proteins aiding in functional assignments.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Pairwise comparisons of each predatory life cycle phase with initial attack phase</title><p id="P13">To enable a detailed overview of protein expression at a specific timepoint during the predatory life cycle, pairwise comparisons were performed at each timepoint to the ‘AP+Ec’ condition at the beginning of the experiment.

Different proteins described in literature are highlighted and their abundance discussed in the following paragraphs.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Protein changes in free-swimming predator</title><p id="P14"><italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> in its free-swimming AP requires a flagellum. We detect an increase in protein abundance of flagellar proteins from T4h to T7h in cluster I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), namely flagellar basal-body proteins FlgB and FlgF (Bd3407, Bd0530), and flagellin homologs FliC (Bd0604, Bd0606). As expected during this time, new flagella are formed in the predator progeny cells. Additionally, a probable chemoreceptor glutamine deaminase CheD (Bd2829) is found in this cluster, indicative of an increased need for chemotaxis in AP (Cluster I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Comparing AP cells at T6h and T7h to the older 24-hr lysate AP cells may reveal what adaptations new progeny cells undergo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Table 3</xref>). In these newly formed progeny cells (T6h and T7h), enzymes involved in reducing oxidative stress − such as glutathione peroxidase (Bd0326), superoxide dismutase (Bd1401), and glutaredoxin (Bd2887) − are upregulated by more than 2-fold (vs. ‘AP+Ec’). The three most upregulated proteins of AP at T7h (vs ‘AP+Ec’) are three proteins of unknown function (Bd1524, Bd2244, Bd3489). Furthermore, Bd0119 (Flp1), a pilin known to be genetically expressed in AP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, is upregulated ∼2.7-fold in the progeny AP cells at T6h and T7h (vs. ‘AP+Ec’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). This pilin abundance increased markedly from T4h to T5h, likely representing the start of pilin assembly in progeny AP cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, there is a second ‘peak’ in Bd0119 pilin abundance at T15’ during attachment, potentially enabling the predator to make contact to the prey cell via the pilins.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Proteins involved in prey attachment, entry and periplasmic niche establishment</title><p id="P15">Upon attachment to the prey (T15’), the two most strikingly upregulated proteins compared to AP have unknown functions (7.3-fold for Bd0434, 6.2-fold for Bd3155), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). While Bd0434 encodes a secreted α-helix of unknown function, Bd3155 is a predicted C-type lysozyme inhibitor (UniProt prediction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>). However, protein docking analysis between this lysozyme inhibitor and predator lysozyme Bd1411 revealed no evidence of coevolution/co-folding between these two proteins. Further, Bd0434 and Bd3155 remain amongst the most upregulated proteins during the whole entry phase into the prey (T30’-T1h). During prey entry (T30’), flagellins Bd0604 and Bd0606 are downregulated more than 2-fold (vs. ‘AP+Ec’) consistent with the observed flagellar retraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> and its likely degradation. Additionally, we found four proteins which are substantially downregulated during the phases of periplasmic predation: two uncharacterized proteins (Bd1815, Bd2577), regulatory protein (Bd3071), as well as an amidophosphoribosyltransferase (Bd3009) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Later, during the invasion to early bdelloplast phases (T30’-T1h), many prey cell wall modifying enzymes are upregulated (over 2-fold).

As most predator cells would have entered the prey periplasm at these timepoints, we speculate that this gliding cluster is used to move inside of the bdelloplast to establish itself within its new niche. Overall, our quantitative proteomics dataset is in good agreement with previously published findings of prey invasion, while allowing for additional insights.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Upregulated predator proteins during growth within prey periplasm and division into progeny cells</title><p id="P18">The two most upregulated proteins during the growth phase at T2h (vs. ‘AP+Ec’) are uncharacterized proteins Bd0278 and Bd2997. Interestingly, operon Bd0276-Bd0284 has been previously implicated in fatty acid synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, which aligns with the metabolic context of the growth phase. In addition, several other proteins are highly upregulated (&gt; 4-fold), including Bd0039 (DNA inversion stimulation factor), Bd0223 (granula-associated regulation protein), Bd0512 (RecA), Bd1582 (single stranded DNA-binding protein), Bd0035 (trypsin-like serine protease), Bd3905 (chromosome partitioning protein, ParB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>) and Bd0575 (putative imelysin). Most of these proteins are growth related and involved in crucial processes like DNA replication and division.

Supporting this hypothesis is a secreted nuclease Bd3507 (FC = 5.35, 5.17 at T3h, T4h respectively) which is upregulated during the late bdelloplast phase, which could degrade prey DNA to release nucleotides for uptake and integration into the predator DNA.</p><p id="P19">A pair of ribonucleoside reductase proteins (Bd1983, Bd1984) were found to be highly upregulated from T2h to T3h (FC from 2.03 to 5.54; 1.87 to 5.32 respectively).

Examining the dataset for potential prey cell-damaging enzymes revealed two serine proteases Bd2269 and Bd2692 among the most upregulated proteins at the exit phase.

Our proteome results differ from the growth phase-specific transcriptome of Karunker and colleagues during this phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. They identified eight genes to represent exclusive growth phase expression (30 min, 1 h or 3 h), whereas our dataset shows only GroES1 (Bd0097, at T2-4h) and RecA (Bd0512, at T3-4h) with a FC &gt;2. While semi-quantitative RT-PCRs indicated transcript presence at growth but not AP, our protein data do not support this observation. Looking at the biological context of the mRNA growth-upregulated genes, most serve a housekeeping role (ATP synthesis, ribosomal proteins, electron transport chain). This is likely due to the different lifetimes of protein and RNA in the cells. Differences between the mRNA and protein levels could be explained by post-transcriptional control including small RNAs and RNA-binding proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> or post-translational control like protein stability. The latter may allow a low abundant protein to function effectively for an extended period, even though mRNA levels may have begun to drop after translation.

Previously, it was reported that many proteolytic enzymes were secreted by HI strain <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> HIB as well as AP <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> HD100 when cultured in rich medium, including the three proteases Bd2269, Bd2321 and Bd2692<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that in the presence of extracellular nutrients, proteases are secreted to release amino acids for the predator’s uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the application of the HI supernatant or purified proteases Bd2269 and Bd2692 to <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. biofilms resulted in effective dispersal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, Bd2269 and Bd2692 have been predicted to be highly expressed based on codon usage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, further correlating with the protein abundance found in this study. In our study, we test the activity of proteases Bd2269, Bd2321 and Bd2692 in the context of prey cells. We show that the absence of Bd2269 results in delayed exit of prey progeny from the depleted bdelloplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The expression of Bd2269, Bd2321 and Bd2692 heterologously in <italic>E. coli</italic> resulted in a major reduction of <italic>E. coli</italic> cell viability by Bd2269 and to a lesser extent with Bd2692 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b, 4c</xref>). We hypothesize that during the prey exit phase, Bd2269 first degrades proteins into smaller peptides, enabling Bd2692 to break these down further for effective bdelloplast lysis. This is supported by a preference of Bd2692 to target a broad range of smaller peptides and denatured proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Our dataset further supports this as Bd2269 is most expressed at T3h, dropping slightly at T4h whereas both Bd2692 and Bd2321 are most highly expressed after Bd2269, at T4h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

Within the spectrum selector node, the Sequest HT search parameters were as follows: Fixed modifications: carbamidomethyl, TMTpro on peptide N-terminus; Variable modifications: Oxidation; N-terminal variable modifications: Acetyl, Met-loss, Met-loss+Acetyl; Enzyme: Trypsin; Max. missed cleavages: 2; Peptide charge: 2+ and 3+; Precursor mass tolerance: ±10 ppm; Fragment mass tolerance: ±0.03 Da. FDR was set to 0.01 for peptide and protein identification. Following the Sequest HT search, Percolator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup> was used for peptide-spectrum match validation and FDR calculations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. The resulting raw abundances from the protein level data were imported into R for further analysis (Source file: Quantexp_all_mod.csv). Identified proteins were filtered for high confidence and proteins with missing values in any one of the five biological replicates were removed. The raw protein abundances of <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> AP and <italic>E. coli</italic> samples were pooled in silico to compare with the later timepoints where the prey and predator are mixed. The normalizations were done following the protocol of Wilmarth in three steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. First, a “sample loading” (SL) normalization was performed, which uses a scaling factor of the mean of the signal of all TMT channels divided by the total signal in each individual TMT channel. This SL scaling factor is then multiplied by the raw abundances for each protein in each channel. Second, the sample-loading adjusted abundances were normalized by internal reference scaling (IRS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. This was calculated by taking the geometric mean of each protein abundance from the golden standards, dividing this geometric mean by each individual protein abundance and finally multiplying this result by the sample loading normalization factor. Third, a “trimmed mean of M-values” (TMM) normalization was applied to the IRS normalized data. Following IRS+TMM normalization, the proteins were separated by their respective species and analyzed independently with the prolfqua R-package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>, which included differential expression, linear modelling and group average estimation (imputation). The protein abundances were filtered for &gt;1 and an additional robust scaling was applied to the data before log<sub>2</sub> transformation. For each timepoint, the normalized abundances from the five TMT experiments (representing five different biological repeats) were averaged, representing the final data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Comparisons between the AP condition and all other phases of the predatory life cycle were made by calculating the log<sub>2</sub> fold change (FC) for each protein. For differential expression, a linear model was performed where the normalized protein abundance was modeled as a function of the timepoint (Condition) and biological repeats (TMTexp). Two group comparisons against the AP condition was performed using a moderated t-test with pooled variance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. Imputation of missing values was performed based on group differences of normalized protein abundances. The resulting log<sub>2</sub>(FC) data is in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>. ‘eggNOG’ annotations were achieved using eggnog-mapper v2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>.

The data was transformed by dividing each condition by the ‘AP+Ec’ value and performing a log<sub>2</sub> transformation such that the ‘AP+Ec’ value is 0. Using this method, the changes from the starting condition can be visualized and clustered based on their pattern throughout the predatory life cycle. Euclidean distance calculations were used for the clustering and significance thresholds for proteins were filtered for p-value &lt; 0.001 and q-value &lt; 0.01. A total of 18 clusters were made and those with very similar cluster profiles were manually combined into a total of ten distinct clusters, nine with changing expression patterns (cluster A-I in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) and one cluster without notable change containing 839 proteins.

The concentrated <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> and S17-1 pMAL-p2_mCherry prey were incubated at 29°C, 200 rpm shaking for 10 min to allow for adaptation to new media. At experiment start, 50 μl of predator and prey were mixed and incubated for 2 h 35 min at 29°C, 200 rpm. Synchronicity of infection was monitored 30 min after mixing with bright-field light microscopy, checking that at least 90% of the prey cells were rounded based on infection. 2 h 35 min after mixing of predator and prey, 10 μl of the lysate was transferred onto a 1% agarose in Ca/HEPES buffer pad in a μ-petri dish (35 mm, high glass bottom dish, IBIDI, Vitaris AG, Cat. No. 81218-200) for time-lapse microscopy using the Nikon Eclipse Ti2-E widefield system with a 100x objective (CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda 100x Oil, N.A. 1.45, W.D. 0.13 mm, Ph3). The Orca Fusion CoaXpress sCMOS camera and NIS-Elements AR 5.42.01 software (Nikon) were used for image acquisition, taking pictures every 2.5 min for 8 h at 29°C of nine different fields of view. Phase contrast images were taken with a 300 ms exposure time and light intensity of 40, while mCherry images were taken with an excitation length of 550 nm (LED at 11% intensity) and a 90 ms exposure time. The motorized encoded xy-stage and motorized z-drive, Nikon Perfect Focus System 4 and Okolab Cage incubation box (set to 29°C and 90% humidity), were used to assure stable incubation conditions and focused imaging during the length of the experiment. Two independent biological replicates each with 30 events were evaluated per strain (total of 60). Exit times were defined by visual inspection from the estimated first frame of visible division of elongated predatory filament into separate progeny cells, to the first frame of visible progeny exit out of the bdelloplast by at least half a progeny cell length. Initial selection of suitable bdelloplasts was supported by NIS-Elements AR software version 6.02.03 (Nikon) and a General Analysis 3 workflow. This workflow segments and numbers potentially suitable bdelloplasts for manual analysis based on fluorescence level, size, circularity and a suitable exit time within the range of the 8 h imaging.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Arabinose induced β-galactosidase assay</title><p id="P43">To construct the strains for the arabinose induced β-galactosidase assay, the <italic>bd2269</italic> and <italic>bd2692</italic> pBAD18-plasmids were constructed by addition of EcoRI and SalI restriction sites.
