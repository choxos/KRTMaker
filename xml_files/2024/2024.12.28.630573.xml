Immunotherapies including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell approaches are under investigation, but high levels of disease heterogeneity remain a major hurdle to achieving durable responses. Targeting of multiple surface antigens may ensure complete immunological coverage of leukemic blast populations, but such antigens are often also present on healthy haematopoietic populations. To address likely aplasia, strategies can be designed to bridge CAR T cell therapies to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), as demonstrated in recent anti-CD7 CAR T cell studies. Here we report that monotherapy using base edited (BE) ‘universal’ donor CAR T cells against CD33, CLL-1, or CD7 delivered inhibition of AML in immunodeficient mice when antigen expression was homogenous, but combined use of BE-CAR33 and BE-CARCLL-1 T cells was required to address heterogenous CLL-1<sup>-/+</sup>CD33<sup>-/+</sup> disease. We also demonstrate that removal of shared CD7 antigens enabled compatibility of BE-CAR33 with BE-CAR7 T cells, including in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of AML. Therapeutic strategies envisage ‘pick and mix’ applications of base edited universal CAR T cells in combinations determined by patient-specific antigen profiles. Such approaches also offer the possibility of deep, cell-based, de-bulking and preparative conditioning ahead of allo-SCT followed by donor-derived reconstitution.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is often an aggressive, life-threatening disease with limited curative treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Newly diagnosed patients typically receive multiple rounds of chemotherapy and those with “high-risk” disease or elevated minimal residual disease (MRD) may undergo allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) with the aim of harnessing graft-versus-leukaemia (GvL) effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Approaches using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are also under investigation, but their development and application is more challenging than for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL), especially in the context of disease heterogeneity and reduced immune cell fitness. Targetable antigens include CD33, CLL-1, CD123, CD7, CD38 and FLT-3, but expression of these on healthy tissues as well as disease populations suggests immunotherapy has to be time-limited to allow for eventual autologous recovery or donor derived reconstitution following haematopoietic SCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. As an alternative to autologous CAR T cells, effectors can be generated from donors through an “off-the-shelf” approach, and use without HLA matching may be feasible following appropriate genome editing steps. We previously reported the use of cytidine base editing to develop ‘universal’ donor CAR T cells (BE-CAR7) against CD7, a molecule expressed on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) and present on a large proportion of healthy lymphocytes. Multiplexed knockouts prevented expression of αβ T cell receptor (TCRαβ) to avoid graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), disrupted <italic>CD7</italic> to evade self-targeting through the anti-CD7 CAR, and removed <italic>CD52</italic> to confer resistance to the lymphodepleting antibody Alemtuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Similar anti-CD7 CAR T cell products are being investigated for their ability to mediate lymphodepletion and myeloablation ahead of allogeneic (allo-) SCT, and have been utilised to treat AML exhibiting CD7 antigen expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. However, the majority of AML blasts have heterogenous antigen expression, necessitating the targeting of multiple antigens simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Combinational approaches against B-cell malignancies have investigated various strategies ranging from the expression of different CARs via the transduction of T cells using multiple vectors, as well as bi-cistronic constructs or tandem configurations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Our ‘off-the-shelf’ approach envisages the co-infusion of cells from pre-generated CAR T-cell banks with different target specificities. We therefore manufactured universal BE-CAR formulations against CD33 (siglec-3) or C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL-1/CLEC12A), both of which are commonly over-expressed in childhood and adult AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Multiplexed base-editing of <italic>TRBC, CD7</italic> and <italic>CD52</italic> generated universal BE-CAR33 and BE-CARCLL-1 CAR T cells compatible with our existing BE-CAR7 products. Each BE-CAR product was investigated alone, or in combination, against heterogenous cell lines and primary AML, as a cell-based universal CAR T cell immunotherapy approach against AML.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell lines and primary cells</title><p id="P3">HEK293Ts, Kasumi-3, HL-60, U-937 and Molm-14 cell lines were obtained from ATCC and cultured according to the supplier’s instructions.

We investigated use of BE-CAR33 alongside BE-CARCLL-1 T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> against xenografted human CD33<sup>+/-</sup> CLL-1<sup>+/-</sup> AML. Mice were engrafted with equal numbers of HL-60 variants, edited using CRISPR/Cas9 to express either CD33 (CD33<sup>+</sup>CLL-1<sup>-</sup>) or CLL-1 (CLL-1<sup>+</sup>CD33<sup>-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 3A, B</xref>).

Mice sacrificed on day 25 due to disease progression had high levels of bone marrow disease detectable through flow cytometry.

In contrast, an average radiance value of 1.2×10<sup>7</sup> p/s/cm<sup>2</sup>/r was set as a threshold for tumour progression in mice treated with combined BE-CAR T cells, and 4 out of 5 reached this by day 39. Potent disease clearance was observed in the bone marrow of mice treated with combined BE-CAR T cells when compared with BE-CAR33 (p&lt;0.01) or BE-CARCLL-1 (p&lt;0.01) monotherapy groups. Importantly, very few residual HL-60 cells displaying loss of both CAR target antigens were detected in the bone marrows of mice from all combined BE-CAR T-cell groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). These findings together demonstrate combined anti-leukaemia effects of BE-CARCLL-1 and BE-CAR33 T cells can inhibit heterogenous AML more effectively than monotherapy strategies.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>BE-CAR33 activity in a PDX model of AML following co-infusion with BE-CAR7</title><p id="P25">A combinatorial strategy was tested <italic>in vivo</italic> to examine the feasibility of using BE-CAR33 T cells in the presence of BE-CAR7 T cells, noting that the latter is already being applied in human studies against T-ALL, and can offer lymphodepleting effects as well as direct anti-leukaemia activity against CD7<sup>+</sup> AML. For these experiments, BE-CAR33 T cells were base edited to remove CD7 to prevent targeting by BE-CAR7 T cells and both populations were also edited to remove <italic>CD52</italic> in case of co-infusion in the presence of alemtuzumab. We utilised a PDX murine model where CD33<sup>high</sup> CD7<sup>low</sup> primary AML cells were engrafted into Eight-twelve week-old NSG mice following sub-lethal (2.5Gy) irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Peripheral blood sampling confirmed AML engraftment three weeks later and effectors were injected in the following groups: CAR19 control T cells alone (n=9) or in combination with either BE-CAR33 (n=10) or BE-CAR7 (n=10), and BE-CAR33 in combination with BE-CAR7 T cells (n=10). Serial peripheral bleeds were then performed on day 14, 28 and 42 post-effector infusion to track disease progression. By day 14, groups that had received BE-CAR33 T cells exhibited delayed disease progression compared to mice that received BE-CAR7 and/or control CAR19 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Importantly, BE-CAR33 effectors continued to exert their anti-leukaemia effects in the presence of BE-CAR7 in the co-infusion group, confirming successful evasion of fratricidal effects through removal of CD7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4C, D</xref>). Treatment with BE-CAR33 cells significantly prolonged survival of PDX mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), and bone marrow analysis confirmed clearance of the majority of CD33<sup>+</sup> disease two weeks post co-infusion with BE-CAR33 and BE-CAR7 T cells.

CAR T cells offer a promising alternative but targeting of a single antigen may not be as effective as with B- or T-cell malignancies due to high levels of inter- and intra-patient phenotypic heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. A lack of leukaemia-specific antigens also remains problematic, and target antigen expression inevitably overlaps with healthy haematopoietic or other tissues; for example, autologous and allogeneic CAR T cell therapies targeting the interleukin-3 receptor (CD123) have been investigated in clinical trials, but with notable toxicities and variation across age groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Other antigens of interest may also be present on precursors or mature granulocytes, macrophages and T cells, and myeloablative and lymphodepleting CAR T cell effects can create protracted risks of cytopenia and opportunistic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. In addition, disease heterogenicity suggests that CAR T-cell therapies against multiple leukaemia antigens may be needed to ensure complete coverage of disease profiles of both childhood and adult AML. CAR T cells used in combination may address heterogenicity and mediate disease clearance ahead of donor-derived stem cell rescue.</p><p id="P27">CD33 is broadly expressed on AML blasts and leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) and has been targeted using the drug conjugated humanised anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody (mAb) Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. A number of alternative anti-CD33 antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), radiolabelled antibodies, bi-specific antibodies and CAR T cells carrying GO-derived binders have also been investigated clinically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Qin et al. encountered toxicities in their murine studies and instead proposed a Lintuzumab-derived CAR T product with a CD28-CD3ζ signalling domain, and results from a corresponding clinical study in children and young adults suggested manageable toxicities with complete responses and myeloid aplasia reported in 2 out of 6 patients at higher doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Our GO-derived BE-CAR includes 41BB-CD3ζ signalling domains and successfully inhibited AML in humanised mice without obvious toxicity, including when used in combination with other BE-CAR products. Taking into account extensive pre-existing clinical safety data from anti-CD33 antibody studies, BE-CAR33 has been adopted for early phase clinical investigation in an allogeneic off-the-shelf approach in children (NCT05942599). Clinical experience with similar autologous anti-CD33 CAR T cell products have noted difficulties with apheresis harvests in heavily pre-treated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].

Recently, Applebaum et al. reported variant CD33 binders with rapamycin-regulated dimerization for controlled expression, and clinical endpoints were consistent with T-cell expansion alongside signs of anti-leukaemia activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>].</p><p id="P28">CLL-1 is a type II transmembrane C-type lectin-like receptor that is often aberrantly expressed on AML blasts, as well as on LSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>].

Separately, six out of nine adults were reported to be in ongoing complete remission three months following treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Our BE-CARCLL-1 product was designed using the anti-CLL-1 mAb clone M26 following promising reports from both studies. A separate CD28-CD3ζ CAR designed with the same anti-CLL-1 mAb clone is also under clinical investigation (NCT04219163) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Targeting of CLL-1 alongside CD33 has also been investigated, including via a self-cleaving P2A peptide sequence allowing for a 1:1 expression of both CAR constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Six of nine patients were reported as MRD negative following CAR T-cell treatment and allo-SCT.</p><p id="P29">We also investigated the use of anti-CD7 CAR T cells as part of a combinatorial approach.

We previously reported the generation of fratricide- and lymphodepletion-resistant universal BE-CAR7 T cells, developed originally to treat CD7<sup>+</sup> T-cell malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Multiple studies, including one at our centre, have reported profound lymphodepletion and bone marrow aplasia post CAR T-cell infusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. There are also reports of successful haploidentical-SCT without the need for additional myeloablative pre-conditioning post anti-CD7 CAR therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].

Delivery of additional uncoupled sgRNAs at the time of electroporation along with BE mRNA rendered the cells resistant to pre-conditioning serotherapy with anti-CD52 antibodies such as alemtuzumab and removed shared T-cell antigen CD7. Each BE-CAR product was able to clear respective antigen-expressing AML targets with high efficiency alongside concordant elevation of Th1 cytokines <italic>in vitro</italic>, with anti-leukaemia potency also corroborated <italic>in vivo</italic> against human xenograft murine models of AML. Previous combined target antigen targeting of Molm-13, HL-60 and KG1a AML cell lines noted improved survival following combined dosing with anti-CD33 and anti-CLL-1 CAR T cells compared to monotherapy options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Targeted removal of CD33 and CLL-1 form HL-60 cells provided a heterogenous model to assess specific BE-CAR products <italic>in vivo</italic>. Monotherapy treatment groups cleared target positive disease but succumbed to antigen negative disease, whilst combined infusions of BE-CAR33 and BE-CARCLL-1 cells were able to control disease progression. Furthermore, in a primary AML model, CD33<sup>high</sup>CD7<sup>low</sup> disease was controlled with longer overall survival in groups receiving BE-CAR33. These effectors persisted and remained operational in the presence of BE-CAR7 given the removal of CD7 from both products. Whilst our model could not assess BE-CAR7 effects against AML directly, the preservation of BE-CAR33 effects was important to establish following co-infusion of the two products. We envisage adoption of “universal” BE-CAR33, BE-CARCLL-1 and BE-CAR7 products for AML eradiation or control ahead of transplant. Deep preparative conditioning ahead of programmed transplant and donor-derived immunological reconstitution may offer valuable routes to treatment for heterogenous hard-to-treat disease.</p><p id="P31">Genome editing has unlocked opportunities for engineering of CAR T cells, and may be further exploited for modification of shared antigens on healthy HSCs to support persistence during anti-leukaemia therapy. CRISPR-mediated removal of CD33 on healthy HSCs is being investigated in combination with GO antibody therapy (NCT04849910), whilst base editing for disruption of FLT-3 and CD45 epitopes has been modelled to allow evasion of CAR-T effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. However, in heavily treated AML patients, modification of autologous HSC may be challenging in subjects who may harbour underlying cancer predispositions, or who have been heavily pre-treated. In the first instance, allogeneic universal donor BE-CAR T cells, alone or in combination, offer innovative routes to disease clearance and remission if planned carefully ahead of allo-SCT and donor derived reconstitution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="EMS202424-supplement-Supplementary_Data.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d83aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by the Wellcome Trust (215619/Z/19/Z), Medical Research Council (MR/X004619/1) and MRC DPFS (MR/V03961X/1), National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) and Great Ormond Street Biomedical Research Centre (RP-2014-05-007), BRC (IS-BRC-1215-20012) and The Child Health Research CIO PhD Studentship 2020/2021 (182120).
