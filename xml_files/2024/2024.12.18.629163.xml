proteins that compromise cellular health. Central to this defense is the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where UBR4 acts as essential E4 ubiquitin ligase, amplifying degradation marks on defective proteins. Our cryo-EM analysis of UBR4 in complex with its cofactors KCMF1 and CALM1 reveals a massive 1.3 MDa ring structure, featuring a central substrate-binding arena and flexibly attached catalytic units. Structural data illustrate how UBR4 binds substrate and extends K48-specific ubiquitin chains. Importantly, efficient substrate targeting depends on both pre-ubiquitination and specific N-degrons, with KCMF1 acting as key substrate filter. Furthermore, we show that the architecture of the E4 megacomplex is conserved across eukaryotes but with species specific adaptations, allowing UBR4 to perform its precisely tuned quality-control function in diverse cellular environments.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Protein function depends on proper folding, complex assembly, and precise localization within the cell. When any of these processes fail, misfolded proteins can build up, forming harmful aggregates that compromise cell health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). To safeguard against such proteotoxic damage, all cells employ sophisticated protein quality control (PQC) mechanisms, with the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) acting as a key clean-up pathway that tags defective proteins with ubiquitin molecules for rapid destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Specificity of ubiquitination is determined by E3 ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The best characterized E3 ligases recognize distinct sequence or structural motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), allowing the tightly controlled removal of specific target proteins, as required, for example, for cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). In contrast, E3 ligases involved in PQC must be able to target diverse proteins that are present in a non-native state, but otherwise do not share specific molecular features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Accurate function of PQC ligases is ensured by intricate binding mechanisms involving various receptor sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) and by adaptor proteins that specifically recognize defective substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), thus preventing the mislabeling of functional proteins. An additional security measure is provided by UPS enzymes that directly modify the degradation signal. While deubiquitinases remove ubiquitin tags and stabilize specific targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), certain E3 ligases enhance degradation by amplifying the ubiquitination signal. The latter class of enzymes, known as E4 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), not only extend poly-ubiquitin chains but also generate branched chains, which are particularly strong proteasomal degradation signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Given their critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, it is not surprising that ubiquitin ligases have been linked to diverse diseases including neurodegeneration, myopathies and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Aneuploidy, for example, disrupts subunit stoichiometry, generates orphan proteins, and imposes proteotoxic stress, highlighting the importance of PQC ligases as potential therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Among the &gt;600 ubiquitin ligases in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), UBR4 plays a particularly important PQC role, being an essential and conserved E3/E4 ligase found across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). UBR4 is critical for maintaining proteostasis in long-lived cells with high metabolic demands, such as neurons and muscle cells, where proteotoxic stress is particularly harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Recent evidence has shown that UBR4 recognizes multiple substrate features, including mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS) of mislocalized mitochondrial precursors, orphan proteins resulting from unassembled complexes, and aggregation-prone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Additionally, UBR4 plays a key role in autophagic processes, bridging proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways to ensure efficient clearance of aberrant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). The diverse functions of UBR4 underscores its role as a central hub in the PQC network, capable of integrating multiple stress response pathways and teaming up with various ubiquitin ligases. At the same time, UBR4 activity seems to rely on two specific cofactors: the calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CALM1) and KCMF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Although KCMF1 has been reported to function as an E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), its precise role within the UBR4 complex remains unclear, particularly as it is absent in many organisms. To elucidate how these proteins interact to assemble an efficient yet tightly regulated E4 ligase, we reconstituted the UBR4/KCMF1/CALM1 complex and examined its structure and function. Our findings reveal that UBR4 acts as a K48-linkage-specific E4 ligase, employing KCMF1 not as a partner ubiquitin ligase but as a tightly bound adaptor protein, targeting pre- ubiquitinated with a specific N-degron or MTS. The 1.3 MDa hexameric complex adopts a ring-like architecture, comprising a central substrate-binding arena that is read out by a flexibly attached catalytic unit. We further demonstrate that the overall structure and mechanism of UBR4 complexes are conserved across eukaryotes, highlighting its role as a central PQC factor.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Structure of the human UBR4 complex reveals a ring-shaped ubiquitination arena</title><p id="P6">To investigate how UBR4 and its KCMF1 and CALM1 cofactors target proteins for degradation, we reconstituted the human E4 complex with recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells. We either purified the three proteins separately before mixing them together or co-expressed them to purify the ternary complex via a tag on UBR4. When we assessed the composition of the E4 complex by mass photometry, we observed that the co-expressed complex contained UBR4, KCMF1, and CALM1, and had a molecular weight consistent with a dimer of heterotrimers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). In contrast, UBR4 isolated separately was monomeric and did not associate with KCMF1 and calmodulin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Moreover, monomeric UBR4 showed a tendency to aggregate and become degraded, while the co-expressed complex was stable.</p><p id="P7">We next determined the structure of the human UBR4 complex (HsUBR42/KCMF12/CALM12) using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Through focused classification and refinement, we obtained density maps encompassing all folded sections of each component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2, Fig. S3</xref>), except the flexible C-terminal domain containing the hemi-RING E3 module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Overall, two UBR4 molecules assemble a through two distant dimerization interfaces, resulting in the formation of a large molecular ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). One dimer interface is formed by the N-terminal domain, involving extensive contacts between adjacent Armadillo repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The second interface, which is much larger, is formed by Armadillo repeats in the C-terminal portion and laterally aligned helices sealing this contact. This interface is further appended by the partner proteins CALM1 and KCMF1, as previously predicted for the trimeric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). The C-terminal helix of KCMF1 acts as a pin, inserting into a hole in the helical scaffold of UBR4. Here, it forms one helix of the Armadillo repeat and is covered by a small lid insertion within the region that also mediates CALM1 binding. The intricate KCMF1-UBR4 binding mode explains why UBR4 is unstable when it is not co-expressed with its cofactor: both the Armadillo repeat and this lid structure would be unlikely to fold properly without KCMF1. To confirm the importance of this interaction, we co-expressed UBR4 with a KCMF1 variant where hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal helix were mutated (L318A/F319A/V320S). The resultant UBR4 protein was monomeric and unstable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>), as predicted by the cryo-EM model.</p><p id="P8">CALM1 often mediates calcium regulation of target proteins and is bound in our structure in a manner typical of other calmodulin-interacting proteins with a long hydrophobic helix docking into the cleft between the two lobes of CALM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). The C-lobe of CALM1 adopts a calcium-bound conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>), suggesting that calmodulin binding to UBR4 may depend on the availability of calcium and, accordingly, we observed a significant CALM1-free UBR4 population in our cryo-EM dataset despite CALM1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E, Fig. S2</xref>). Addition of the calcium-chelator EGTA did not affect the CALM1 occupancy in the structure, suggesting that once CALM1 is bound it remains stable rather than acting as a reversible regulator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Whereas the structural motifs forming the rigid scaffold of the E4 ring were well defined by EM density, the functional domains lining the inner cavity or extending into the periphery exhibited high flexibility, as reflected by poorer local resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E, Fig. S2</xref>). The most prominent intrusion into the E4 ring is formed by a beta-propeller (BP) and an attached multidomain structure comprising the UBR box and beta-sandwich 1 (BS1) domains of UBR4 together with the N-terminal zinc binding domains of KCMF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). A second appendix protrudes from the C-terminal dimerization region, where a zinc finger domain positions another beta-sandwich domain (BS2) with two associated zinc fingers near the central cavity. Finally, an extension projects outwards from the UBR4 ring, and is formed by the C-terminal Armadillo repeats. This structure houses a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and a flexibly attached hemi-RING module, which was unresolved in the EM map.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Ubiquitin K48 chain extension within the UBR4 ring</title><p id="P10">To investigate how the distinct functional motifs of the 1.3 MDa UBR4 complex contribute to ubiquitination activity, we developed an E4 assay monitoring the conjugation of the two ubiquitin variants Ub* and Ub-K0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Ub* (ubiquitin-ΔGG) lacks the C-terminal residues required for ubiquitin transfer, while Ub-K0 has all lysine residues mutated to arginine. This setup enabled us to follow the rate of a single ubiquitination event where Ub-K0 is transferred onto Ub*, and then no further reaction can occur. As anticipated, a Ub-K0-Ub* band was observed only in the presence of both ubiquitin variants and UBR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), offering a clear and specific readout of E4 activity, ideal for mutational analyses and systematic substrate screens.</p><p id="P11">We previously observed that UBR4 only ubiquitinates orphan proteins which have already been ubiquitinated by other E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). This E4 activity was dependent on the UBL domain which was predicted by AlphaFold3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) to bind ubiquitin and position lysine K48 towards the E2~Ub conjugate bound to the hemi-RING, thereby promoting formation of K48-linked chains on pre-ubiquitinated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). To further human UBR4 complex with its cognate E2, UBE2A, and performed cryo-EM analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4, Table S1</xref>). We now observed additional density for UBE2A bound to the end of the helical UBR4 scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). As predicted by AlphaFold3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), the E2 is bound in a backside configuration, stabilized by a specific beta-hairpin structure within an extended helix of the C-terminal protrusion. This interaction features an extensive hydrophobic interface that spans two sides of UBE2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), while leaving the canonical E3/E4 binding site accessible for interaction with the hemi-RING domain of UBR4. The stable interface precisely positions the E2 at the narrow constriction site of the substrate arena, bringing it into close proximity with the UBL domain.</p><p id="P12">With regards to the catalytic module, we did not observe the hemi-RING domain in our cryoEM map due to the inherent flexibility of the C-terminal extension. We thus modelled the ubiquitin transfer state by aligning the UBE2A-UBR4(hemi-RING) crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) onto the UBE2A in our cryo-EM model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), along with the AlphaFold3 prediction of the UBL-Ub interaction. In this structure guided model, UBE2A and the UBL domain were well positioned to orient the acceptor ubiquitin towards the hemi-RING, with the K48 residue protruding towards the E2~Ub thioester to enable ubiquitin chain extension. A triple mutation in the ubiquitin receptor site of the UBL domain (UBL-3A) or deletion of the hemi-RING domain (ΔRING) abrogated ubiquitin conjugation, confirming the central role of the UBL domain in the E4 mechanism of UBR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). For native substrates, the ubiquitin captured by the UBL domain would be linked via its C-terminus to a lysine residue on the target protein. Notably, the ubiquitin C-terminus points into the central UBR4 cavity, suggesting the presence of potential substrate recognition sites within this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Previous studies suggested that KCMF1 functions as an E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), and thus could potentially initiate substrate ubiquitination. However, these earlier results may reflect an indirect effect, as our findings indicate that the C-terminus of KCMF1 is essential for stabilizing UBR4. A closer analysis of KCMF1 revealed that it does not contain any known E3 domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>). The N-terminal zinc binding domain (1-80) has similar topology to a RING domain but is a ZZ domain with high sequence similarity to these domains in p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), ZZZ3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) and p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) which recognize specific N- terminal residues but have no E3 activity. The other zinc binding domain (80-160) is a Di19-Zn-binding (DZB) domain which has distinct topology to a RING domain. The only reported function of a DZB domain is binding mono-ADP-ribosylated histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Consistent with these observations, when we tested the ubiquitination activity of isolated KCMF1 with a panel of human E2 enzymes, no activity was detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that the human UBR4 complex operates as a bona fide E4 ligase, ready to collaborate with partner E3 ligases in the PQC network.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Selection of Ub-marked proteins to be degraded</title><p id="P14">UBR4, with a mobile E4 module on top of a substrate binding arena, mirrors the architecture of giant ubiquitin ligases like BIRC6, HUWE1 and UBR5, all of which use an array of receptor domains to target diverse substrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). To test whether UBR4 may also target distinct substrate classes, we first performed a co-IP/MS experiment in human cells to categorize potential target proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Consistent with earlier studies, we detected many mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). These have been reported to be recognized via their mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and accordingly, we detected several unprocessed MTS peptides in our co-IP/MS data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6B</xref>). The MTS-bearing proteins could be direct substrates of UBR4 as previously suggested or, in accordance with our E4 model, are only recognized because they have been pre-ubiquitinated by other E3 ligases. To distinguish between these two models, we performed a co-IP/MS experiment with a lysate that was treated with USP21, a non-specific deubiquitinase (DUB), to remove all ubiquitination marks. Comparison of the DUB-treated to the untreated sample revealed a striking depletion of mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). These data suggest UBR4 acts as an E4 ligase for mislocalized pre- ubiquitinated mitochondrial proteins similarly to its role in targeting pre-ubiquitinated orphaned proteins for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Despite the requirement for pre-ubiquitination for recognition, the enrichment of mitochondrial precursors among all ubiquitinated proteins suggests that UBR4 is able to recognize specific protein motifs. To test for a respective substrate filter, we adapted our single ubiquitination E4 assay by fusing candidate sequences, via a flexible linker, to the Ub* N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). We then compared activity against our control (linker-Ub*) and model (MTS-linker-Ub*) substrates, using targeting sequences from two co-IP/MS hits, ACOT9 (MTS1) and TIMM50 (MTS2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). We observed stronger ubiquitination of the MTS fused substrates compared to linker-Ub* alone, reflecting the inherent specificity of UBR4 for mitochondrial precursors. To test whether we were measuring UBL-mediated E4 rather than direct E3 ligase activity, we used the UBL-3A complex variant which disrupts the ubiquitin interaction site, thus abolishing chain extension without compromising hemi-RING E3 activity. Importantly, this mutation fully abolished ubiquitination of our MTS1-Ub* and MTS2-Ub* model substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Moreover, introducing a K48R mutation into one of the MTS-Ub* model substrates, which should also prevent K48 chain formation, impaired product formation as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that the human UBR4 complex is a substrate-specific E4 ligase.</p><p id="P16">When investigating how substrates are recognized, we noted that our cryo-EM reconstruction contained extra low-resolution density in the central cavity of the UBR4 ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). As the flexible C-terminal extension is too distant to account for this density, we considered a copurified protein, such as a substrate, that was captured in the inner cavity, providing direct insight into the mechanism of substrate recognition. To look for the captured target, we re-analyzed MS data of the purified complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Among common protein contaminants, we observed a significant enrichment of single stranded DNA binding protein (SSBP1), a mitochondrial protein previously reported to bind to UBR4/KCMF1 in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). While the low resolution did not allow fitting of a molecular model into the density in the inner cavity, we observed a clear connection of this density to the ZZ-DZB domains of KCMF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), consistent with previous observations that this domain is involved in binding mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). To test whether the ZZ-DZB is the recognition site for MTS sequences, we reconstituted the UBR4<sub>2</sub>/KCMFI(Δ2-138)<sub>2</sub>/CALMI<sub>2</sub> complex lacking the putative receptor site and tested the E4 activity against our MTS model substrates. For the mutated complex, ubiquitination of the MTS1-Ub* substrate was now indistinguishable from the linker-Ub* control, suggesting that substrate specificity has been lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Surprisingly, the activity of ΔZZ-DZB complex was stronger than the WT complex towards both the MTS1-Ub* and Ub* substrates. This result suggests that the ZZ-DZB is not only a substrate receptor but also functions as a selectivity filter, restricting access to the site within the central cavity where substrates are subjected to E4 activity.</p><p id="P17">KCMF1 has been previously reported to recognize type I Arg N-degrons via its ZZ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Consistently, AlphaFold3 predicts a complex between the KCMF1 ZZ-domain and an <sup>N</sup>R- peptide motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Notably, our model substrate MTS1-Ub* has an N-degron- like <sup>N</sup>RR- sequence, but the equally well targeted MTS2-Ub* does not, bearing an N- terminal <sup>N</sup>AA- sequence. To explore potential N-degrons, we started with our control construct (<sup>N</sup>TA-linker-Ub*) and generated an <sup>N</sup>RT- degron sequence (<sup>N</sup>RTA-linker-Ub*) as well as the <sup>N</sup>RE- degron (<sup>N</sup>RETA-linker-Ub*) previously shown to bind the ZZ domain of p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). The <sup>N</sup>RT-Ub* construct was ubiquitinated as strongly as the MTS2-Ub* construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>), showing that the UBR4 complex specifically recognizes type I N-degrons. In contrast, the <sup>N</sup>RE degron was targeted worse than the control sequence. The preference for the <sup>N</sup>RT degron was dependent on the ZZ-DZB domain of KCMF1 suggesting that recognition of N-degrons is mechanistically similar to that of MTS sequences. Both the <sup>N</sup>RT degron and the MTS sequences are characterized by their basicity and so it is possible that the UBR4 complex disfavors binding of negative charges, as present in the <sup>N</sup>RE sequence. Of note, UBR4 was initially identified as an N-degron ubiquitin ligase due to its UBR domain, a motif associated with recognizing N-degrons. Yet, our data indicate that the UBR domain is not essential for recognition of substrates tested in this study, as its deletion did not impair the ubiquitination of MTS-Ub* or <sup>N</sup>R-Ub* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). These findings emphasize the role of the ZZ-DZB as substrate receptor within the UBR4 complex.</p><p id="P18">Furthermore, our results help clarify why earlier studies suggested KCMF1 might function as an E3 ligase together with UBR4, as mutations in the ZZ-DZB domain disrupt substrate recognition. To clearly rule out an E3 function for KCMF1 within the UBR4 complex, we analyzed ubiquitination in the presence and absence of a UBE2D family E2, the reported partner of KCMF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), using wild-type ubiquitin capable of chain formation and the MTS1-Ub* substrate. UBE2D2, when tested without UBE2A, was unable to support any E3 activity on this substrate. Furthermore, its addition did not alter the activity catalyzed by UBE2A or its dependence on the K48 residue of the Ub* substrate moiety, despite there being an exposed lysine within the MTS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C</xref>).</p><p id="P19">In conclusion, we show that the ZZ-DZB is not an E3 module but a specialized substrate receptor within the UBR4 complex. The low specificity of this domain fits well with the general PQC role of UBR4, targeting a broad range of MTS and N-degron sequences.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Evolutionary conservation of the UBR4 ubiquitination arena</title><p id="P20">UBR4 has been shown to play essential roles in various eukaryotes, including <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>), and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Notably, UBR4 from nematodes and plants has not been associated with KCMF1, a protein that is absent outside of metazoans and considerably larger in nematodes. This raises the question of whether the structurally and functionally characterized human UBR4 complex reflects the universal mechanisms underlying the role of UBR4 in eukaryotic protein quality control.</p><p id="P21">To address this question, we first focused on <italic>C. elegans</italic> UBR4, which has been linked to orphan protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>) and for which we could identify a potential KCMF1 orthologue, ZK652.6. We co-expressed CeUBR4, CeKCMF1, and CeCALM, purified the resulting complex, and compared it to CeUBR4 alone. Like the human proteins, CeUBR4 was monomeric when expressed alone, while the co-expressed complex exhibited a molecular weight of 1.1 MDa consistent with a dimer of trimers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A</xref>). However, MS analysis revealed that CeCALM was not retained in the purified complex. Activity assays demonstrated that the CeUBR4 complex (UBR42/KCMF12) exhibited strong selectivity for MTS-Ub* substrates over Ub* alone but showed reduced activity on the <sup>N</sup>RT-Ub* degron substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Overall, these findings indicate functional conservation between human and <italic>C. elegans</italic> UBR4, while also highlighting species specific adaptations in substrate selectivity and complex composition.</p><p id="P22">To explore the underlying structural differences, we determined the cryo-EM structure of the CeUBR4 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1, Fig. S8, Fig. S9</xref>). While the dimeric complex retains the ring-shaped organization of the human counterpart, it exhibits significant structural adaptations. Notably, CALM is absent and replaced by insertions in CeKCMF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). The conserved C-terminal helical pin of KCMF1 interacts with UBR4, but this interaction is further stabilized by a mixed beta-sheet that connects KCMF1 with both UBR4 protomers, effectively gluing the dimer together. Additionally, two helices from KCMF1 extend from the mixed beta-sheet to engage the same interface on UBR4 that CALM1 interacts with in the human structure. The necessity of occupying this interface in the absence of CALM1 highlights its critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of the E4 complex. Supporting a structural rather than regulatory function, deletion of the CALM1-interacting helix in HsUBR4 had no effect on its E4 activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref>). Beyond this interface, an extended C-terminal peptide of KCMF1 wraps tightly around the back of the UBR4 dimer, aligning the UBR4 protomers from the opposite side. The modified CeUBR4/CeKCMF1 interface alters the overall conformation of the UBR4 ring, a distortion further reinforced by a distinct dimerization interface at the opposite end, involving unique N-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Notably, the relative positions and structures of key functional units—including the UBL, BP, and BS2 domains, the UBR- BS1-ZZ-RING composite structure, and the flexible C-terminal extension housing the E4 active site remain consistent with the human UBR4 complex, emphasizing the evolutionary conservation of its core architecture.</p><p id="P23">While the CeUBR4 complex retains E4 activity on mitochondrial precursors, its architecture shows pronounced differences to its human counterpart. This divergence prompted us to investigate the ancestral design of the UBR4 core further. We turned to <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> UBR4 (also known as BIG), which diverged from metazoan UBR4 early in eukaryotic evolution. Unlike metazoan UBR4, plants lack a KCMF1 orthologue, raising questions about how UBR4 architecture and activity are maintained. We expressed and purified AtUBR4 from insect cells and observed that the protein was homodimeric (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7C</xref>) and possessed detectable but weak substrate- and K48-specific E4 ligase activity, despite the lack of the KCMF1 co-factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Furthermore, in negative stain analysis, we saw a ring structure with similar dimensions to the human UBR4 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). We performed MS analysis to identify co-purified components of the insect cell UBR4 complex and found strong enrichment of calmodulin but no detectable KCMF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). Consistently, the CALM1-interacting helix of HsUBR4 is well conserved in AtUBR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). Considering the apparent structural and functional similarity between plant and human UBR4, we hypothesized that a so-far undiscovered KCMF1 orthologue should stabilize AtUBR4. We identified a candidate protein, drought-induced protein 19 (DI19), which shows strong homology to HsKCMF1 in the C-terminal pin region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>), has related biological functions to AtUBR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>) and was one of the top hits along with AtUBR4 in a proximity labelling experiment using an N-degron as bait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Using AlphaFold3, we were able to predict the AtUBR4<sub>2</sub>/DIW<sub>2</sub>/CALM<sub>2</sub> complex with high confidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>), confirming the identity of the plant KCMF1. Thus, the structural core of the UBR4 complex has been maintained throughout eukaryotic evolution.</p><p id="P24">We next examined species-specific adaptations of functional domains in the E4 complex. Notably, DI19 lacks an N-terminal ZZ domain, yet we co-purified the same substrate, SSBP1, as with the human complex and observed MTS-specific activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A,C</xref>). These data can be explained by the presence of an internal ZZ domain in AtUBR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), which shares high sequence similarity with the HsKCMF1 ZZ domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Thus, while conserving the substrate targeting and ubiquitin conjugation mechanism, UBR4 complexes have reshuffled domains to generate distinct genetic contexts, facilitating the adoption of specialized PQC functions. Plants, for example, encode multiple homologues of the DI19 cofactor that respond to diverse stresses and localize to different cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the UBR4 complex appears to exhibit unique substrate selectivity, with mitochondrial medium-chain acyl- CoA dehydrogenase (ACADM) showing stronger enrichment compared to SSBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>), pointing to a distinct substrate filter. In line with this finding, we observed well-defined extra density in the central arena of CeUBR4, closely resembling the elongated shape of an orphaned subunit from the tetrameric ACADM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>). According to these cryo-EM data, bound ACADM not only contacts the ZZ domain but also two long helices in the N-terminal region. These two helices, which are unique to CeUBR4, protrude from the rigid E4 core into the central cavity, exposing a series of hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7D</xref>) that may help to recognize and bind the hydrophobic surface characteristic of orphaned subunits.</p><p id="P25">In conclusion, these findings reveal that despite evolutionary divergence, the E4 arena of UBR4 is remarkably well conserved across eukaryotes in its core architecture. However, evolutionary processes have reshuffled domains and interacting partners within the scaffold, producing holo E4 systems that are functionally similar but fine-tuned in their substrate profile and regulation for diverse PQC challenges in different organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">PQC enzymes target aberrant proteins for degradation based on broadly defined properties that are associated with protein dysfunction rather than on specific structural or sequence motifs. These properties often correlate with diverse phenotypes such as mislocalization, partial misfolding, orphan subunit status, or incomplete post- translational processing. Our structural, biochemical, and evolutionary analyses of UBR4 provide mechanistic insights into how such selection is achieved.</p><p id="P27">We demonstrate that the assembly of UBR4 with KCMF1 and CALM1 into an intricate 1.3 MDa E4 complex introduces important regulatory measures, ensuring tight control of degradation labelling beyond simple K48-ubiquitin chain extension. The giant structure of the E4 complex is composed of a rigid, ring-like core with flexibly attached functional domains. Substrates are sequestered within the central cavity, where they can interact with various receptor domains. The mobile E4 module protrudes to the narrow end of this arena, while the UBL domain is located between receptor domains and catalytic site, aligning ubiquitin moieties of captured substrates for chain extension. The bound cofactor KCMF1 has functional as well as structural roles in this assembly. Its C-terminal region stabilizes the core of the E4 complex, whereas the N-terminal ZZ-DZB motif protrudes into the center of the ring, acting as a substrate receptor. Moreover, the inherent mobility of the ZZ-DZB, located in the ubiquitin transfer region near the UBL domain, enables it to function as molecular bouncer, hindering ubiquitin chain extension of proteins that do not meet the specificity criteria. Accordingly, the ZZ-RING domain functions as a selectivity filter within the UBR4 system, identifying PQC substrates while preventing the erroneous marking of functional proteins for degradation.</p><p id="P28">UBR4 selects substrates based on their orphan protein character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), the presence of an unprocessed MTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), or a specific N-degron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). The weak sequence specificity of these selection criteria also explains the large number of reported UBR4 substrates. Efficient binding should depend on multivalent interactions, requiring multiple weak signals to be recognized. Additional contributions to substrate recognition likely come from peripheral domains like the BP, UBR and BS2, which also line the inner cavity. Moreover, for CeUBR4, we observed that two elongated helices in the N-terminus protrude into the ring and appear to bind the substrate, presumably recognizing the exposed hydrophobic surface present on an orphaned protein. Finally, the ring structure itself should enforce selectivity by restricting access to proteins below a certain size, favoring the binding of small orphaned proteins over multi-protein complexes. The functional importance of the ring architecture is emphasized by its conserved shape and dimension in CeUBR4, despite pronounced differences in its helical scaffold and dimerization interfaces. Moreover, structurally disruptive UBR4 patient mutations are spread throughout the ring scaffold suggesting the maintenance of this architecture is crucial for its PQC function (<bold>Fig. S10</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>).</p><p id="P29">E4 ligases such as UBR4 play a dual role in amplifying ubiquitination signals and refining specificity in protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Rather than relying solely on the priming E3 ligase for substrate selection, our findings emphasize the equally crucial role of E4 ligases in enhancing specificity. While both chain-initiating E3 ligases and chain-extending E4 ligases individually may exhibit weak substrate specificity, their sequential action yields an effective and specific proofreading mechanism to target aberrant proteins. Moreover, defective proteins are more efficiently targeted by E3/E4 ligase pairs the longer the substrates persist in a dysfunctional state. For example, mitochondrial precursor proteins imported efficiently into mitochondria escape recognition, but under stress conditions, stalled import traps them in the cytoplasm, where their chances of sequential recognition and degradation grow significantly. This temporal regulation should ensure the selective removal of truly defective proteins. Sequential ligase action also facilitates the formation of specialized PQC pathways towards distinct substrate types. For example, UBR4/KCMF1 operates alongside other general PQC enzymes, such as HUWE1, BIRC6, UBR5, HERC1 and HERC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>), each targeting distinct but overlapping sets of substrates. This combinatorial setting allows for fine-tuned regulation of PQC pathways in specific cell types and physiological conditions. Through its intricate structure, selective substrate targeting, and synergy with other PQC ligases, UBR4 is thus able to adopt a crucial role in cellular homeostasis, enabling the precise and efficient elimination of defective proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Cloning and expression</title><p id="P30">UBR4, KCMF1 and CALM genes from <italic>H. sapiens, C. elegans</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> were codon- optimized for insect cell expression and, where required, synthesized in fragments flanked with BsaI sites.

From these starting models we used rounds of modelling in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>) and real space refinement in Phenix Real Space Refine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>) to obtain models which fit well to the density while having reasonable geometry statistics.

AtUBR4 was diluted to 0.05 mg/mL in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, spotted on the grids, incubated for one minute, blotted, washed with 4 μL 2% uranyl acetate, blotted again, and incubated for one minute with 4 μL 2% uranyl acetate before final blotting. Data were cp;;ected on a 200 kV FEI Tecnai G2 20 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 50,000x magnification with a 2.21 Å pixel size using SerialEM. Particle picking was performed using CrYOLO and then particles coordinates were imported into CryoSPARC v4 for extraction with a 2x binned 256 pixel box size and then rounds of 2D classification.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Ubiquitination assays</title><p id="P42">All ubiquitination assays were performed in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Reactions contained 100 or 200 nM UBR4 monomer as indicated, 250 nM UBA1,500 nM UBE2A, 5 μM substrate-Ub* and either 5 μM Ub-K0 or 10 uM wild-type ubiquitin spiked with 1 μM Ub-DyLight488. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 mM ATP and proceeded for 15, 30 or 60 minutes as indicated.</p><p id="P43">Reactions were quenched with SDS gel loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE using 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gradient gels (Invitrogen) in MES running buffer. If required, gels were first imaged for DyLight488 fluorescence using a ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad) before Coomassie staining. All experiments were replicated entirely at least twice.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Mass photometry</title><p id="P44">Experiments were performed using a OneMP mass photometer (Refeyn Ltd.) controlled by the AcquireMP application. A one-minute acquisition time in the medium field of view was used. To obtain average species masses, particle event histograms were automatically Gaussian fitted with the DiscoverMP software. Samples were first prepared in a 200 nM stock solution in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP and prior to measurement were diluted 10x in PBS.

UBR4 KO was confirmed by Western blot. Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS before lysis by sonication. In addition to PBS the lysis buffer contained proteasome inhibitor (100 μM MG-132) 1 mM PMSF, benzonase and 0.1% NP40. After clarification by centrifugation the total protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay. All lysates were normalized to 1 mg/ml total protein. For lysates which were not treated with deubiquitinase, the deubiquitinase inhibitor PR619 was added at 100 μM. Experiments were performed in triplicate. For deubiquitinase treatment 250 nM USP21 was used and deubiquitination confirmed by Western blot. MagStrep Strep-Tactin beads (IBA) were pre-bound to either UBR4 or GFP by incubation at 4°C for one hour followed by washing with PBS. 7 μL of bead slurry was added to 550 μL of treated RKO lysate and incubated overnight at 4°C. Beads were washed twice with 500 μL PBS before resupension in 100 μL PBS for mass spectrometry analysis.</p><p id="P46">Samples were treated with trypsin in ammonium bicarbonate before extraction with 5% formic acid.

Peptides were loaded onto a trap column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PepMap C18, 5 mm × 300 μm ID, 5 μm particles, 100 Å pore size) at a flow rate of 25 μL min<sup>-1</sup> using 0.1% TFA as mobile phase. The trap column was switched in line with the analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PepMap C18, 500 mm × 75 μm ID, 2 μm, 100 Å) after 10 minutes and peptides were then eluted using a binary one hour gradient, starting from 98% A (water/formic acid, 99.9/0.1, v/v) and 2% B (water/acetonitrile/formic acid, 19.92/80/0.08, v/v/v), increasing to 35% B over 60 minutes and then to 95% B over 5 minutes with a flow rate of 230 nl min<sup>-1</sup>.</p><p id="P48">The Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode, performing a full scan (m/z range 350-1200, resolution 60,000, normalized AGC target 100%) at 3 different compensation voltages (CV -45, -60, -75), followed each by MS/MS scans of the most abundant ions for a cycle time of 1 second per CV. MS/MS spectra were acquired using HCD collision energy of 30, isolation width of 1.2 m/z, orbitrap resolution of 30,000, normalized AGC target 200%, minimum intensity of 50,000 and maximum injection time of 100 ms. Precursor ions selected for fragmentation (include charge state 2-6) were excluded for 20 s. The monoisotopic precursor selection (MIPS) filter and exclude isotopes feature were enabled.</p><p id="P49">For peptide identification, the RAW-files were first loaded into Proteome Discoverer (version 2.5.0.400, Thermo Scientific). MS/MS spectra were then searched using MSAmanda v2.0.0.19924 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>). The fragment and peptide mass tolerance were set to ±10 ppm and the maximum number of missed cleavages was set to 2, using tryptic enzymatic specificity without proline restriction. Peptide and protein identification was initially performed by searching the RAW-files against the Uniprot-database using the taxonomy Trichoplusia ni (2021-03; 21,163 sequences; 13,598,141 residues) and Homo sapiens (2023-03; 20,516; 11,401,144 residues) supplemented with common contaminants and the sequences of UBR4, KCMF1 and CALM1 using Beta-methylthiolation on cysteine as a fixed modification. The result was filtered to 1 % FDR on protein level using the Percolator algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>) integrated in Proteome Discoverer. Following this, a second round of searching was done on the sub-databases of these proteins looking for protein modifications and again filtered. Peptides were subjected to label-free quantification using IMP-apQuant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). Proteins were filtered to be identified by a minimum of 2 PSMs in at least 1 sample. Identified proteins were pre-filtered to contain at least 3 quantified peptide groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures and Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS202258-supplement-Supplementary_Figures_and_Tables.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d110aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p><italic>We</italic> would like to thank the EM facility of the Vienna BioCenter Core Facilities (VBCF), particularly H.
