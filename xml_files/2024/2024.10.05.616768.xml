Here we investigated how simulated shading affects priming responses in the context of volatile-mediated plant-plant interactions. Receiver maize plants were exposed to either constitutive volatile organic compounds (cVOCs) or HIPVs from emitter maize plants, while we manipulated R:FR light conditions of receivers or emitters. Priming responses in the receivers were then assessed by measuring real-time volatile emissions following simulated herbivory. We show that low R:FR light enhances HIPVs emissions in plants previously exposed to HIPVs from neighbours independently of the light conditions of emitters. We also demonstrate that both cVOCs and HIPVs emitted by maize grown under low R:FR amplify HIPVs emissions in their neighbours. This amplified response could not be explained by FR-mediated changes in the release of green leaf volatiles or terpenoids by emitters, thus suggesting the involvement of other VOCs. We conclude that volatile-mediated plant-plant interactions can be expected to become more intense in denser canopies due to light-mediated amplification of volatile emission and responsiveness.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Far-red light</kwd><kwd>herbivores</kwd><kwd>maize</kwd><kwd>plant defenses</kwd><kwd>priming</kwd><kwd>volatiles</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Plants can sense the presence of neighbors through light, chemical, and mechanical cues (Huber et al., 2020; Ninkovic et al., 2021; Pantazopoulou et al., 2023). This ability to detect nearby plants helps them to assess their competitive environment, including the availability of light and soil nutrients, as well as the health and potential threats posed by pests and pathogens. By integrating these signals, plants can strategically allocate their resources towards growth or defense, thus enhancing their chances of survival.</p><p id="P5">Neighbor detection through light cues occurs via the photoreceptor-mediated perception of light spectral changes in the canopy. Blue (λ =400-500 nm) and red (R) (λ = 600-700 nm) light wavelengths are preferentially absorbed by photosynthetic pigments of plant leaves while far red (FR) light is mainly reflected or transmitted. In dense canopies, this results in a reduction in R:FR ratios, a light cue that can promote upward bending of the leaves (hyponasty) and stem elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Pierik and Ballaré 2021</xref>). These photomorphogenic changes help the plant to reach more illuminated areas in the canopy and outcompete their neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Pierik and Ballaré 2021</xref>) In addition, FR photons can support growth by promoting photosynthesis in dicotyledonous and C3 and C4 monocotyledonous species, including maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>), when added to a background of white light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Zhen and Bugbee 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Escobar-Bravo et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huber et al. 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Beyond light, plants also perceive their environment through volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Escobar-Bravo, Lin &amp; Waterman, 2023</xref>). These compounds include volatile hormones (e.g., ethylene, methyl salicylate, and methyl jasmonate), terpenoids, benzenoids (e.g., indole), phenylpropanoids, and fatty acid-derived molecules such as green leaf volatiles (GLVs). Plant VOCs can be constitutively emitted and modulated by the plant interactions with the environment. Changes in their emission therefore reflect the plant status and the abiotic and/or biotic stresses it encounters. Upon herbivory, for instance, plants can emit herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that repel the attacker, attract natural predators of the herbivore, and/or alter the defense status in non-attacked neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Turlings and Erb 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hu et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Some HIPVs, such as the green leaf volatiles (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, or (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, can directly induce the emission of volatiles in intact plants and prime their volatile emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Farag and Pare 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Engelberth et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hu et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Escobar-Bravo et al. 2024</xref>). Similarly, other HIPVs like indole, the monoterpene β-ocimene, and the homoterpene (<italic>E</italic>)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) can induce or prime plant defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Erb et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jing et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Onosato et al. 2022</xref>). Defense priming can confer ecological benefits to plants, as the exposure to the priming stimulus prepares them to display a faster, stronger, and more lasting defense response when the actual herbivore or pathogen attack takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Conrath et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Martinez-Medina et al. 2016</xref>). The mechanisms of volatile-mediated defense priming downstream of volatile perception have been amply characterized. Once HIPVs get into plant tissues, they induce the expression of biotic and abiotic stress- responsive genes in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent manner, including the activation of the jasmonic acid (JA) defense signaling pathway that controls the emission of HIPVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Zebelo et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Christensen et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Engelberth et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hu et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ye et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jing et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aratani et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aguirre et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Wang et al. 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P8">How VOC-mediated transfer of information between plants occurs in dense canopies is not well known. The FR-enriched light environment within vegetation canopies might play a crucial role in these interactions by altering (1) the emitter’s volatile emissions, (2) the ability of the receiver to perceive and respond to the volatile cue/s, or (3) both. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kegge et al. (2015)</xref> showed that barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>) emits different volatiles under low R:FR ratios, influencing the carbon allocation in neighboring plants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Aguirre et al. (2023)</xref> reported that maize exposure to (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenyl acetate in the dark does not prime plant defenses, suggesting that light-mediated induction of stomatal opening is required for signal integration of (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenyl acetate in receiver plants. More recently, we have demonstrated that low R:FR light conditions can change the perception of HIPVs in maize plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Escobar-Bravo et al. 2024</xref>). Our study showed that FR-light enrichment prompts intact maize plants to emit more volatiles when exposed to HIPVs from <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic>- infested neighbors or to <italic>Z</italic>-3-hexenyl acetate alone. We also showed that low R:FR-treated plants pre-exposed to <italic>Z</italic>-3-hexenyl acetate displayed stronger HIPVs emissions after simulated herbivory and, therefore, a stronger priming response. Yet, whether low R:FR-induced priming response also occur in plants exposed the whole bouquet of HIPVs from herbivore-infested neighbors was not determined. Furthermore, whether FR light enrichment can alter volatile-mediated interactions between maize plants by inducing changes in the VOCs emissions of emitter plants is unknown.</p><p id="P9">Here, we have investigated whether low R:FR affects HIPVs-induced priming responses in maize by altering (1) the volatile perception of the receivers, and/or (2) the volatile emissions of the emitters. For this, we first exposed plants to low R:FR ratios as a light cue for vegetation shade or high R:FR ratios as control light conditions, and we determined volatile emissions in simulated herbivory-induced plants that were previously exposed to constitutive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or HIPVs emissions from intact or <italic>S. littoralis</italic>-infested plants, respectively. Next, we conducted a multifactorial experiment where we tested whether HIPVs emitted by intact or simulated herbivory-induced maize plants growing under low or high R:FR conditions trigger different defense priming responses in the receivers, and whether these differences could be explained by changes in the GLVs emissions of the emitters.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Plants</title><p id="P10">Experiments were conducted with the maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) inbred line B73.

Here we show that maize plants exposed to low R:FR also display a stronger priming response upon pre-exposure to the HIPVs emitted by herbivore-infested plants. We hypothesize that this response might be partially explained by FR-mediated positive effects on stomata opening and photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Zhen and Bugbee 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Escobar-Bravo et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huber et al. 2024</xref>).

In other words, FR-treated plants might take up more volatiles than high R:FR-treated plants, resulting in a stronger priming stimulus. Alternatively, FR positive effects on photosynthesis and stomatal opening might have increased the availability of precursors for volatile biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Arimura et al. 2008</xref>) and/or the release rate of these volatiles. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms involved in FR-mediated modulation of plant perception and responses to HIPVs.</p><p id="P30">Next, we showed that maize plants emit more HIPVs after pre-exposure to constitutive or herbivory-induced volatiles from low R:FR-treated plants. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that a higher emission of volatiles by low R:FR-treated plants might trigger a stronger priming response in the receiver. For instance, exposure to increasing concentrations of GLVs has been shown to parallel increases in plasma membrane potential depolarization and cytosolic calcium concentrations in plant leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Zebelo et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aratani et al. 2023</xref>). These cellular responses are associated with the activation of JA defense-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aratani et al. 2023</xref>) and might be part of the priming stimulus in the receiver plant. Our analysis of GLV emissions in intact plants and plants subjected to simulated herbivory showed slightly higher levels of hexenal in low R:FR-treated plants compared to the high R:FR treatment, but no differences in hexenyl acetate and hexenol emissions. Thus, it is unlikely that these differences are responsible for the increase in HIPVs observed in receiver plants.</p><p id="P31">Additionally, our previous study revealed that an enriched FR light environment enhances the emission of monoterpenes and the homoterpene DMMT in herbivory-induced B73 maize plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Escobar-Bravo et al. 2024</xref>). Yet, in the same experiments, we did not observe significant differences in constitutive volatile emissions in unwounded FR-treated plants compared to high R:FR light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Escobar-Bravo et al. 2024</xref>). As both unwounded and herbivory-induced low R:FR treated plants enhanced the volatile emissions in receiver plants, they might emit a common volatile signal that was not detected in our PTR-TOF-MS system. This would be the case of volatile compounds that cannot be ionized by the primary ion (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) used in our system. A candidate signal could be the volatile hormone ethylene. Ethylene emission is induced by low R:FR light conditions in several plant species, including <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>, playing an important role in the development of shade avoidance traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Pierik et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kegge et al. 2013</xref>). Furthermore, ethylene exposure has been shown to increase the emission of HIPVs in maize plants when these were challenged with simulated herbivory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Schmelz et al. 2003</xref>) or (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-HOL exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Ruther and Kleier 2005</xref>). Further analyses determining ethylene emissions in low R:FR-treated maize plants together with the artificial manipulation ethylene signaling could shed light on the role of this volatile hormone in the stronger volatile-mediated priming response under enriched FR light conditions.</p><p id="P32">In summary, our findings suggest an enhanced transmission of volatile signals within maize canopies via FR-mediated effects on the emitter’s volatile emissions and the perception of these volatiles by the receiver. Additional experiments are needed to determine (1) whether this translates into a larger spatial distribution of warning volatile signals in maize fields, (2) if this information transfer is species-specific, and (3) what are the benefits and tradeoffs of such a phenomenon. Under field conditions, for instance, the propagation of volatile signals involving several plants located at different distances from the emitter might be affected by the diffusion properties and breakdown of volatile compounds after release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Niinemets et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Schuman 2023</xref>), as well as by their absorption and reabsorption by the plant/s closer to the volatile source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Himanen et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Sugimoto et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">2023</xref>). In addition, maize plants might be exposed to other plant-competition cues such as limited water and nutrient resources, and root-derived exudates from neighboring plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Pierik et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Wang et al. 2021</xref>) that might affect volatile emissions and perception. For instance, drought can modulate herbivory-induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Catola et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lin et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Vázquez-González et al. 2022</xref>) and constitutive volatile emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Jin et al. 2021</xref>), the latter affecting the drought tolerance in neighboring plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Jin et al. 2021</xref>). Finally, we hypothesize that an enhanced transmission of volatile priming signals in maize fields might increase HIPVs emission at the plant community level which can boost the attraction of the natural enemies of herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aartsma et al. 2017</xref>). This might be especially relevant in dense monocultures, where the limited air movement within a dense canopy can reduce the dispersion of plant volatile compounds, potentially leading to volatile entrapment. Thus, our study not only provides a better understanding of the environmental modulation of the transmission of volatile priming signals in an agronomic relevant species, but also sets the basis to further determine their ecological functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS199283-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d53aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work of BCJS was supported by the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action Individual Fellowship (European Union Horizon 2020, Grant Nr. 794947).
