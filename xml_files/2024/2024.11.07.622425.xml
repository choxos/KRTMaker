Therefore, we used the novel genetically-encoded histamine sensor, HisLightG, combined with fiber photometry to measure histamine release in two hypothalamic regions critical for the food-suppressive effects of histamine, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), and the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Male mice were tested under different conditions to assess whether hunger, time of day, or the caloric content of the solution they were given affected histamine fluctuations. We found that histamine levels changed rapidly in response to eating. These histamine fluctuations were influenced by experimental conditions, with slightly smaller responses when the test solution was sucralose (both regions) or during the light cycle (PVH only). Notable regional differences were identified, such that in the PVH histamine rebounded to baseline levels, whereas in the VMH histamine remained lower than baseline for at least 10 seconds after licking ceased. In a separate cohort of male and female mice, enhancing histamine tone via administration of a histamine precursor (L-histidine) reduced the number of licks across multiple sucrose concentrations. Together, these findings indicate that histaminergic activity is modulated rapidly during ingestive episodes, and that understanding these release patterns will give insight into histamine’s role in appetite suppression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The mechanisms that govern meal termination and reductions in food intake are complex and intertwined. The neurotransmitter and neuromodulator histamine plays an important role in ingestive behavior and many well-known satiety signals, including leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Morimoto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Toftegaard et al., 2003</xref>), amylin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Lutz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Mollet et al., 2003</xref>), cholecystokinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Attoub et al., 2001</xref>), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Gotoh et al., 2005</xref>), require histamine in order to exert their effects on eating behavior. Histamine may be responding directly to some of these signals – for example, amylin fibers and histaminergic neurons are found in close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">D’Este et al., 2001</xref>) – but there is likely also indirect input, such as through the melanocortin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Michael et al., 2020</xref>) or noradrenaline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Kurose &amp; Terashima, 1999</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Histamine is involved in many physiological processes besides eating, and can either stimulate or suppress food intake depending on the precise location and receptor subtype activated. The bulk of previous research measuring histamine levels in the brain used microdialysis, a technique which is limited by a relatively large sampling area (e.g., “anterior hypothalamus”) as well as low temporal resolution (e.g. 20-30 min between samples). Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry has also been used to measure histamine with high temporal resolution <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Berger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Samaranayake et al., 2015</xref>). However, properties of the molecule and its release patterns make these studies difficult to perform and have limited utility for studying spontaneous histamine release during naturally occurring behaviors (i.e., outside of stimulation of histamine containing fibers). Recent advances in genetically-encoded fluorescent neurotransmitter sensors have allowed <italic>in vivo</italic> neurotransmitter release to be combined with fiber photometry yielding measurements with high chemical, temporal and spatial precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Patriarchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Simpson et al., 2024</xref>). So far, a histamine sensor, GRAB-HA, has been used in two other studies showing fluctuations during sleep-wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Dong et al., 2023</xref>) and after an aversive stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Lin et al., 2023</xref>). To our knowledge, however, no one has previously recorded histamine fluctuations using fiber photometry during eating behavior. Moreover, unlike the other studies cited, we use the novel histamine sensor HisLightG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Kagiampaki et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Central histamine-producing neurons are located in the tuberomammillary nucleus in the posterior hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Panula et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Watanabe et al., 1984</xref>), and project widely throughout the brain, including many hypothalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Lin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Panula et al., 1989</xref>). Histamine acts on several receptor subtypes, although it is the H1 receptor (H1R) that mediates suppressive effects of histamine on food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Fukagawa et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Kurose &amp; Terashima, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Lecklin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Masaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Morimoto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Ookuma et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Sakata et al., 1988</xref>). H1Rs are expressed in many parts of the brain, with a high density found in both the ventromedial hypothalamus (VHM) and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Futagawa et al., 2024</xref>). Infusions of H1R antagonists, or drugs to inhibit local histamine production, into specific hypothalamic nuclei have indicated that these two regions – the VMH and the PVH – are the critical sites of action for histamine to attenuate eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Ookuma et al., 1989</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Sakata et al., 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">1991</xref>).</p><p id="P5">We wanted to examine the patterns of histamine release in the PVH and the VMH during eating bouts in mice, using fiber photometry and the new histamine sensor, HisLightG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Kagiampaki et al., 2023</xref>). Histamine levels in the hypothalamus are sensitive to time of day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Doi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Mochizuki et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Sakata et al., 1988</xref>). We therefore recorded histamine fluctuations during both the dark and light phase. Additionally, histamine levels may or may not be influenced by hunger status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Itoh et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Sakata et al., 1994</xref>). Consequently, we measured histamine in both <italic>ad libitum</italic> and food restricted conditions. Finally, in a separate experiment to determine how histamine levels shape consumption over a range of rewarding solutions, we manipulated histamine levels by providing the precursor, L-histidine, and measured licking for different concentrations of sucrose.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>In vitro experiments</title><sec id="S4"><label>2.1.1</label><title>Cell culture, confocal imaging and quantification</title><p id="P6">HEK293T cells (ATCC #CRL-3216) were cultured in DMEM medium (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher) and 100 μg/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin mix (Thermo Fisher) and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Mice (n = 23) were anesthetized with isoflurane and secured in a stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf, Tujunga, CA, USA). Each mouse was given subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg; Temgesic) and meloxicam (5 mg/kg; Metacam) to provide systemic analgesia, as well as bupivacaine (1 mg/kg; Marcain) as a local anesthetic. A small burr hole was made above the target area (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for coordinates; all coordinates based on a flat skull) and 500 nl (0.6 x 10<sup>9</sup> vg) of AAV-9/2-hSyn1-chI-HisLightG-WPRE-bGHp(A) (#10264; ETH Viral Vector Facility) was infused at a rate of 100 nl / minute using a Nanofil syringe with 33 g blunt needle and UMP3 microsyringe pump (WPI; Sarasota, FL, USA). The needle remained in place for 10 min to allow the virus to diffuse. Next, a fiber optic cannula (1.25 mm ceramic ferrule, 0.4 NA, 400 μm core; RWD) was lowered slowly to just above the virus injection. The fiber optic was secured to the skull with dental cement (Superbond C&amp;B). Each mouse received meloxicam 2 days postoperatively.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><label>2.2.3</label><title>Testing apparatus</title><p id="P9">Testing took place in operant chambers (24 cm x 20 cm; Med Associates, Fairfax, VT). The fan was on continuously during testing. When mice were tested during their dark phase, the house light was off in the testing chambers, and when the mice were tested during their light phase, the house light was on in the operant chambers. Solutions were delivered through blunted 18 g needles attached to 5 ml syringes via flexible tubing. These syringes were mounted on syringe pumps that dispensed the solution when licks were detected via a contact lickometer. These pumps were controlled by MEDPC-V software (Med Associates).</p><p id="P10">While the mice freely explored the operant chambers and licked solutions, histamine activity was recorded via fiber photometry. An RZ10x system and Synapse software (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL, USA) controlled two LED light sources, one blue (465 nm) and one violet (405 nm). The blue light was sinusoidally modulated at 330 Hz and the violet at 210 Hz. A fluorescence minicube (Doric Lenses, Quebec, Canada) combined the blue and violet wavelengths. A 400 μm optical patch cord (Doric Lenses) transmitted the light to the mouse, where the cable and ferrule were attached by a black ceramic sleeve (RWD). This same cable was used to collect light emitted from the brains of the mice. This light was detected by a femtowatt photoreceiver (#2151; Newport, Irvine, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>2.2.4</label><title>Testing procedures</title><p id="P11">Each mouse underwent a series of testing sessions in different blocks, with each block a different condition. The order of the blocks was the same for all mice. Testing began at least 12 days after surgery and after mice had been habituated to having a cable attached to their fiber optic implant. The four blocks were 1) <italic>ad libitum</italic> light, 2) food restricted dark, 3) <italic>ad libitum</italic> dark, and 4) <italic>ad libitum</italic> sucralose. In the <italic>ad libitum</italic> light block (“Light”), mice with <italic>ad libitum</italic> food and water were tested during the light phase. They were placed in operant chambers for three 30-minute sessions on different days, in which 1 kcal / ml “Ensure” (Nestle Resource Complete neutral flavor) was continuously available through a spout. In the food restricted dark block (“Restricted”), mice were tested in the dark while food restricted. Food restriction was achieved by giving 2.5 – 3 g of chow to each mouse each day; this resulted in approximately 5-10 % weight loss. In this phase they were again given “Ensure” during three 30 min sessions. The <italic>ad libitum</italic> dark block (“Dark”) was identical to the Light block except mice were tested during their dark phase and only tested in 2 sessions. Lastly, in the <italic>ad libitum</italic> sucralose block (“Sucralose”) mice were tested without food restriction in the dark, but given 2 mM sucralose in the single 30 min session.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><label>2.2.5</label><title>Histology</title><p id="P12">Only mice with virus and fibers placed correctly were included in the final analysis. To check placements, brains were collected at the end of the experiment. Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized with 0.3 ml of ZRF mix (zolazepam, 3.3 mg/ml; tiletamine, 3.3 mg/ml; xylazine, 0.45 mg/ml; fentanyl, 2.6 ug/ml). The mice were then transcardially perfused with heparinized saline and 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed, postfixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, and placed in 30% sucrose with Proclin. A microtome (Leica, Deer Park, IL; USA) was used to cut brains into 40 μm coronal sections. Every third section was directly mounted onto a Superfrost Plus slide and coverslipped. The native fluorescence of the viral injections was used to determine the location and spread of the injection, and the fiber tract used to assess location of the implant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><label>2.3</label><title>Histamine manipulation experiments</title><sec id="S12"><label>2.3.1</label><title>Animals</title><p id="P13">Adult male and female C57BL/6J mice (n=4 of each sex) were bred and housed in the animal facility at University of Washington.

Next, mice were given free access to sucrose when head-fixed in the multispout apparatus for 10 min on a single day. Mice were then trained on the multispout apparatus with multiple concentrations of sucrose available. The assay consisted of daily sessions with 100 trials with 3 s access to one of five different sucrose concentrations (0% (water), 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%, 20 trials of each).

Post hoc tests were Holm corrected for multiple comparisons. Data from mice in the PVH cohort and the VMH cohort were analyzed separately, except for when they were directly compared and when they were combined. TDT files included timestamps of licks relayed to the TDT system through MED-PC and its lickometer, as well as the photometry streams for HisLightG and the 405 nm isosbestic control.

Lick bouts were defined as a cluster of 3 or more licks with at least 10 seconds separating one bout from another. Repeated measures ANOVA with Condition (Restricted, Light, Dark, and Sucralose) as within-subjects factor were conducted for each of these parameters. We did not expect mice with PVH or VMH placements to differ in behavior. This was confirmed in a preliminary analysis finding no main effect of Region in licks, number of lick bouts, or length of lick bouts. We therefore combined mice from both regions for subsequent analyses.</p><p id="P19">Peri-event traces (hereafter, “snips”) of the photometry trace corresponding to the 5 s before a lick bout, and lasting 10 seconds after licking ended were created for each lick bout for each mouse. Of the total lick bouts, we created snips for those lasting at least 8 seconds (in the Restricted analysis of PVH vs VMH), or 4 seconds (for the analysis between conditions, due to the low number of longer lick bouts in the Sucralose condition). Artifacts were removed by comparing the absolute difference between consecutive time points and if this was greater than a threshold of 12, that lick bout was discarded. To account for different durations of each bout, only the first 6 s and last 2 s of licking were included. Snips were normalized by z-scoring, using the 5 s before licking as baseline; a baseline was calculated for each snip.</p><p id="P20">We used a strategy similar to that described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Jean-Richard-dit-Bressel et al., 2020</xref>) to conduct waveform analyses of histamine fluctuations. First, we created a bootstrapped estimate of the mean using all lick bouts from a given region and condition, sampling 1000 times with replacement. A 95% confidence interval was then constructed around the mean. We set a consecutive threshold of 6 bins (equivalent to 0.6 s), corresponding to the low-pass filter of the photometry signal. As such, if the confidence interval did not include zero for at least 6 consecutive time bins, the period was determined as a true fluctuation in histamine. Similarly, for a comparison between PVH and VMH in the restricted condition, we compared the confidence intervals for the PVH and VMH and when they were not overlapping for at least 6 consecutive time bins, we considered them different from each other.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><label>2.4.3</label><title>Multispout experiments</title><p id="P21">For the multispout experiments, we analyzed the data with a repeated-measures ANOVA with sucrose concentration as within-subjects factor and injection (vehicle or L-histidine) as between-subjects factor.

These lick bouts were used to construct a bootstrapped mean and 95% confidence interval for each region. In the PVH, histamine was reduced below zero 1.5 s after licking started, and remained below zero for 2.8 s after licking stopped. Between 4.4 s and 10 s after licking stopped, histamine in the PVH rebounded to above zero. In the VMH, however, histamine fell below zero 0.2 s after licking started and remained suppressed throughout the lick bout and for at least 10 s after licking ceased. Comparing the confidence intervals for the histamine signal in the PVH and in the VMH revealed a significant difference (i.e., no overlap between the two regions) in the last 2 s of licking and throughout the 10 s of post-licking examined; during this time, histamine was lower in the VMH than in the PVH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P29">In addition to the waveform analysis, we conducted a more traditional area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis with epochs that we designated based on the behavior (i.e., the beginning and end of a lick bout, and the 10 s following a lick bout divided into two equal 5s bins).

Although previous studies have used fiber photometry to measure histamine <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Dong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Lin et al., 2023</xref>), these studies use a different sensor (GRAB-HA). Availability of multiple sensors for a single molecule is useful, as differences between sensor properties (e.g., kinetics) can make a particular sensor more suitable for a given experiment; this has been discussed in detail for dopamine sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Labouesse et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments clearly show that HisLightG responds to histamine. The response to histamine compared to a variety of other neurotransmitters shows a high specificity to histamine. Interestingly, acetylcholine elicited a small response, but this was an order of magnitude smaller than that of histamine, and indeed so small that it is extremely unlikely to cause any detectable signals <italic>in vivo</italic>. In light of this, we have a high degree of confidence that our photometry experiments were reliably measuring histamine release and not acetylcholine.</p><p id="P34">Past studies that have prevented histamine from exerting its normal function in particular brain areas have identified the VMH and PVH as the regions responsible for histamine reducing food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Ookuma et al., 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Sakata et al., 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">1991</xref>). Here, we examined the dynamics of histamine in these areas during eating behavior and found both similarities and differences in the histaminergic responses to consumption. In both regions, in food-restricted mice, histamine decreased as licking commenced. It remained below baseline when licking stopped. In the PVH, however, histamine rebounded to above baseline levels following the end of licking, while in the VMH it remained suppressed. The functional implications of this difference requires further investigation. A previous microdialysis experiment demonstrated a brief rise in medial hypothalamic histamine after food deprived rats were given 15 min to eat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Itoh et al., 1991</xref>). This increase in histamine was present on a timescale of minutes, indicating a modestly prolonged response of histamine to food. We show that histamine is also altered on a timescale of seconds during consumption of nutritive solutions when hungry, with changes closely linked to individual lick bouts. Interestingly, the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Itoh et al (1991)</xref> found an increase in medial hypothalamus histamine after eating, while we found regional differences such that in the PVH histamine increased after an eating bout, but the opposite was true in the VMH.</p><p id="P35">When we examined histamine release in each region during different conditions, we again found some regional differences. In the PVH, histamine was suppressed during the lick bout in all conditions. After the lick bout, histamine rebounded in the Restricted and Dark Conditions. In the Light and Sucralose conditions, there was also a rebound but it was slower to occur. This leaves open the possibility that hunger state and caloric content of the solution influence the rebound of histamine in the PVH. Mice in the Restricted condition were hungry because of the food restriction, and in the Dark condition were presumably hungry simply from it being the time of day they normally eat. In the Light condition, the mice were likely less hungry because during the light phase they are normally sleeping, not eating, and so when these mice licked for Ensure, histamine release was different than when these same mice consumed Ensure in a different hunger state. In the Sucralose condition, the mice were tested in the dark phase and therefore equally hungry as when tested in the Dark phase, but the substance they were given to lick contained no calories. Again, this appears to have influenced histamine release in the PVH. In the VMH, in contrast, histamine remained suppressed from the start of licking until at least 10 s after licking stopped in the Restricted, Dark, and Light conditions. In the Sucralose condition, histamine showed no change from baseline during the first 2 s of licking, but was then suppressed equally as in the other conditions.</p><p id="P36">Caloric content is one possible reason why histamine responses were different in the Sucralose condition compared to the conditions in which mice were drinking Ensure, but it is also plausible that the difference was instead taste-driven. Microdialysis experiments measuring histamine in the anterior hypothalamus found that histamine levels respond to the nature of the ingested substance. Specifically, perfusates from anterior hypothalamus of food deprived rats receiving intraoral infusions of various tastants showed increased histamine after sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid, and quinine, but a decreased histamine response after saccharin or sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Treesukosol et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, when saccharin or sucrose was paired with lithium chloride to produce a conditioned taste aversion, these tastes produced an increase in histamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Treesukosol et al., 2005</xref>). The authors conclude that histamine release may reflect palatability of the ingested substance, with decreases indicative of high palatability. Both of our test solutions – “Ensure” and sucralose – are generally considered palatable, and this is consistent with the reduced histamine seen during licking. Whether this is related to the sustained histamine sumpression in the VMH after licking stops, and why the same solutions caused an increase after licking in the PVH, requires further study.</p><p id="P37">A fall in VMH histamine could reflect the palatability of the solution, but it is also likely that it is related to the role of histamine in suppressing food intake. Higher levels of histamine are associated with decreased food intake, so the reduction in histamine during eating could be promoting continued consumption, both within that lick bout and increasing the likelihood of subsequent lick bouts occurring due to the continued suppression. The fact that histamine in the PVH returns to baseline after a lick bout – rather than remaining suppressed as in the VMH – could mean that these regions have distinct roles in appetite regulation.</p><p id="P38">To demonstrate a role for increased histamine levels in suppressing feeding, we performed a test in a recently developed multispout apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Gordon-Fennell et al., 2023</xref>) in which it was possible to test licking across several different concentrations of sucrose. In this test we found that increasing histamine levels by injecting the histamine precursor, L-histidine, suppressed licking. Thus, this links increased histamine to reduced licking and potentially satiety mechanisms. Future experiments using this method can determine whether antagonizing specific histamine receptors in specific brain regions is able to block this suppressive effect of L-histidine on licking behavior.</p><p id="P39">In summary, here we show that the fluorescent histamine sensor, HisLightG, can be used to detect rapid fluctuations in histamine release associated with eating bouts and that these patterns of release show some regional heterogeneity and sensitivity to the caloric content of the ingested substance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS199966-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S28"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from Tromsø Research Foundation to JEM (19-SG-JMcC), the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement #891959 to TP), Swiss National Science Foundation (grant #310030_196455 and #310030L_212508 to TP) and NIH to GDS (R01DA038168).
