LARP4 was known to bind RACK1, a ribosome-associated protein, although the specific regions involved, and relevance had been undetermined. Here, yeast two-hybrid domain mapping followed by other methods identified positions 615-625 in conserved region-2 (CR2) of LARP4 (and LARP4B) as directly binding RACK1 region 200-317. Consistent with these results, AlphaFold2-multimer predicted high confidence interaction of CR2 with RACK1 propellers 5-6. CR2 mutations strongly decreased LARP4 association with cellular RACK1 and ribosomes by multiple assays, whereas less effect was observed for PABP association, consistent with independent interactions. CR2 mutations decreased LARP4 ability to optimally stabilize a b-globin mRNA reporter containing an AU-rich element (ARE) more significantly than a b-globin and other reporters lacking this element. While polysome profiles indicate the b-glo-ARE mRNA is inefficiently translated, consistent with published data, we show that LARP4 increases its translation whereas the LARP4-CR2 mutant is impaired. Analysis of nanoLuc-ARE mRNA for production of luciferase activity confirmed LARP4 promotes translation efficiency while CR2 mutations are disabling. Thus, LARP4 CR2-mediated interaction with RACK1 can promote translational efficiency of some mRNAs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>polysomes</kwd><kwd>AU-rich element</kwd><kwd>La-related protein 4</kwd><kwd>translation efficiency</kwd><kwd>RACK1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Abbreviations</title><glossary><def-list><def-item><term>Ab</term><def><p id="P5">antibody</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ActD</term><def><p id="P6">actinomycin-D</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>b-glo</term><def><p id="P7">beta-globin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ARE</term><def><p id="P8">AU-rich element</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EV</term><def><p id="P9">empty vector</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GFP</term><def><p id="P10">green fluorescent protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HEK293</term><def><p id="P11">human embryo kidney</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PABP</term><def><p id="P12">poly(A)-binding protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAT</term><def><p id="P13">poly(A) tail</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SM-PATseq</term><def><p id="P14">single molecule PAT sequencing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>t½</term><def><p id="P15">half-life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TE</term><def><p id="P16">translational efficiency</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WT</term><def><p id="P17">wild-type</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P18">Gene expression includes intricate control of mRNA stability and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Deadenylation of mRNA poly(A) tails (PATs) is linked to eukaryotic mRNA decay, occurs cotranslationally, and is modulated by the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1/PABP) and associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). In addition to binding poly(A), PABP functionally interacts with translation initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). mRNA PAT length is coupled over a wide range to translational efficiency (TE) during embryogenesis, dependent on limiting PABP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), while in other cells in which PABP is higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), the range in TE is substantially diminished (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Five families of La-related proteins (LARPs) share a La-motif (LaM) RNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), which in most members is followed by a family-specific RNA recognition motif (RRM) (for exceptions see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).

LARP founding member, the authentic nuclear La protein (LARP3) uses conserved amino acids in its LaM aided by an edge of the RRM to recognize and sequester the U(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>)U-3’OH motifs shared by RNA polymerase III transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), which protects them from 3’-exonuclease activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) (reviewed in 12).</p><p id="P20">The LARP1-PABP complex impedes global mRNA deadenylation by protecting short length PATs from 3’-exonuclease activity of the CCR4-NOT (CNOT) deadenylase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). LARP4 also hinders mRNA deadenylation although at short PATs distinct from LARP1 and at long PATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Results from cells deleted of <italic>LARP4</italic> and expressed at multiple levels revealed that LARP4 (aka LARP4A) slows deadenylation globally, targeting long and short PATs, the latter of which promotes ribosomal protein (rp) mRNA stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). The LARP1 family-specific DM15 domain binds the m<sup>7</sup>G-capC 5’terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs of rp-mRNAs to regulate their translation and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).

The LaM and adjacent PABP-interaction motif, PAM2 of LARP1 confers mRNA PAT protection-stabilization as a small protein fragment lacking DM15, likely reflecting global activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p id="P21">As LARP4-PABP interactions are examined in this study, a brief overview follows. PAM2 is a consensus sequence found in ~20 proteins involved in mRNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) that competitively bind the C-terminal MLLE domain of PABP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). The PAM2w sequences unique to LARP4 and its paralog LARP4B/LARP5, present tryptophan (W) at consensus position-10 replacing phenylalanine in other PAM2s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). The LARP4 PAM2w serves as a sequence-specific determinant of binding to either poly(A) or to MLLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). While less is known about the other PABP-binding motif (PBM) in LARP4 (and 4B), some data suggest it is more critical for PABP interaction and for mRNA PAT protection-stabilization than the PAM2w (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p><p id="P22">The family-specific PAM2 and PBM appeared in vertebrate LARP4B and LARP4/4A lineages along with conserved region-2 (CR2) in their less overall-conserved C-terminal half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). Although LARP4 and LARP4B are distinguished by functional specifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), they share mRNA PAT-protection activity, while La, LARP6 and LARP7 do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Recent data suggest they also share an apparent mRNA subset-specific, translation activity at the mitochondrial outer surface, likely distinct from LARP4 general activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Indeed, LARP4 is recruited with PABP by A-kinase anchoring protein-1 (AKAP1) which direct mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). LARP4B and LARP4A each cofractionate and colocalize with TOM20 at mitochondrial outer surfaces suggesting this is a deep-rooted, shared function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Studies of LARP4 mechanism use model mRNA reporters that contain or lack the TNFa ARE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), a high-affinity binding site for TTP/ZFP36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) which can recruit CNOT deadenylase complexes by two of the several subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Classic stable mRNA reporters which lack an ARE and bear long PATs are substrates of the PAN2-PAN3 deadenylase, which is recruited to PABP by a PAM2 on PAN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In human cells, PAN2-PAN3 gradually shorten long PATs, unlinked to mRNA decay, to &lt;120 nt, at which they become substrates of CNOT activity which is linked to their decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). By recruiting CNOT via an adapter protein, ARE-mRNAs bypass slow deadenylation and succumb to fast decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Intriguingly by contrast, short PAT transcripts such as stable rp-mRNAs appear to sustain efficient translation as CNOT substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) (see 2). Notably, LARP4 activity to slow deadenylation extends to stable transcripts, including rp-mRNAs, manifested with lengthened PATs and increased abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P24">RACK1 is a seven-propeller WD40 repeat protein that stably binds 40S subunits on ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). RACK1 is multifunctional, participates in resolution of stalled, collided ribosomes and the associated stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), and is a hub for the integration of factors that access translating mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Though RACK1 interacts with LARP4 and LARP4B, a binding region had been identified only for the latter, broadly within the &gt;350 residues from the end of RRM1 to the C-terminus, and consistent with this location was shown to be noncompetitive with PABP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Thus, we sought to refine and examine this interaction further.</p><p id="P25">Yeast two hybrid (Y2H) domain mapping, biochemical binding assays, coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP), and cosedimentation identified LARP4 CR2 residues 615-625, including a central highly conserved SYAEVC sequence as a principal binding site for RACK1 region 200-317. Consistent with this, AlphaFold2-Multimer (AFM) predicted high confidence interaction between the LARP4 CR2 and RACK1 propellers 5-6. CR2 mutations disabled direct interaction with RACK1 in binding assays as well as by cosedimentation with ribosomes and polysomes. The CR2 mutations also impaired LARP4 for optimal stabilization of a reporter β-globin-ARE mRNA more significantly than impaired stabilization of β-globin mRNA and other reporters lacking the ARE. Translational deficiency was associated with presence of the ARE in β-globin mRNA, but not β-globin mRNA lacking the ARE, as monitored by polysome sedimentation profiles, was largely reversed by LARP4 while the LARP4-CR2 mutant was impaired. Analysis of nanoluciferase-ARE-mRNA by polysome sedimentation and luciferase activity production confirmed that LARP4 promotes its translation while the CR2 mutant is impaired.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material And Methods</title><sec id="S4"><title>DNA constructs</title><p id="P26">LARP4 mutants (R1), containing five-point mutations R615E, K616E, Y619G, E621R, V622G and LARP4-ΔR1 (deletion of amino acids 612-625) cloned in the HindIII and BamH1 sites of pFLAG-CMV2 were synthesized by Genewiz.

Thus, effects of LARP4-mediated PAT protection could be examined in conditions not confounded by increase in the mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>). The upper graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref> shows nLucP luciferase activity/μg extract versus LARP4-WT protein levels, and the lower graph shows TE, (nLucP luciferase activity/μg extract)/(nLucP-ARE mRNA/μg extract) on the Y-axis versus LARP4-WT levels (X-axis), A &gt;4-fold increase in translation of nLucP-ARE mRNA reflected by luciferase activity accompanied the dose-dependent LARP4-mediated PAT protection while levels of nLucP-ARE mRNA changed relatively much less. For this experiment, the R<sup>2</sup> trend line derived from six data points with R2=0.93 provides evidence that LARP4 promotes TE of nLucP-ARE mRNA as monitored for functional enzyme product, complementing the conventional polysome profile fractionation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>). This effect was independently reproduced using a partial codon-optimized version of LARP4 referred to as LARP4-CS (codon swap) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), which yielded similar results with R<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.96 for TE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig S9</xref>). These data are evidence that LARP4-mediated poly(A)-end protection (preservation of PAT length) can increase mRNA translational efficiency by means other than increasing the mRNA levels per se.</p></sec><sec id="S38"><title>LARP4 activity to promote TE of nLucP-ARE mRNA is impaired by deficiency of RACK1-interaction</title><p id="P84">To eliminate variation that might be associated with cotransfection of the reporters, we created FRT-targeted integrants in Flp-In™ T-Rex™-293 cells. Clones bearing a single copy of one of four reporters, nLuc, nLucP, nLuc-ARE and nLucP-ARE, were grown, induced for transcription, transfected side-by-side according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5F</xref>, and processed for expression of nLuc mRNA, F-LARP4 and luciferase activity. Analysis of the four samples revealed &gt;200-fold difference in basal luciferase levels between the highest and lowest activity reporters, i.e., with and without the PEST sequence, nLuc and nLucP-ARE, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig S9I</xref>). The data are consistent with &gt;4 day half-life for the nLuc enzyme (lacking PEST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>), and suggest &gt;2 weeks to achieve steady state after induction of expression, vs. &lt;2 hrs. for nLucP. Thus, high activities of constructs lacking PEST and the pre-steady state accumulation conditions that diminish reliability of measured effects of LARP4-WT vs. LARP4-R1 suggest we limit analysis to the nLuc-PEST constructs, nLucP and nLucP-ARE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5G-I</xref>). The northern blot lanes of each set compare uninduced and induced cells, and the next three compare EV, expression of L4-WT and L4-R1. Immunoblot levels of FLAG-LARP4 are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5H</xref>. The nLucP-ARE led to significantly lower mRNA levels compared to nLucP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5G</xref>). The difference in luciferase activities in the EV samples, between nLucP and nLucP-ARE reflected the difference in their nLuc mRNA levels, ~3.5-fold, reproducible in the induced samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5I</xref>, lanes 2-3 and 7-8, compared to corresponding lanes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5G</xref>).</p><p id="P85">Nanoluciferase activity levels produced from nLucP-mRNA were higher in L4-WT than in L4-R1 cells and in EV cells by ~15% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5I</xref>), whereas activity levels from nLucP-ARE mRNA were ~200% higher in L4-WT cells than in L4-R1 and EV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5I</xref>). The larger effect of LARP4-WT on ARE-containing vs. ARE-lacking mRNAs is reminiscent of the data for b-glo-ARE. We next focused on nLucP-ARE mRNA as a substrate of L4-WT and L4-R1. The effects on TE and specificity were apparent when luciferase activity was normalized for nLuc mRNA levels as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5J</xref>. LARP4-WT robustly promoted TE of nLucP-ARE mRNA while LARP4-R1 was deficient for this activity on nLucP-ARE mRNA. While LARP4-WT led to increased luciferase activity relative to EV and LARP4-R1 from LucP lacking the ARE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5I</xref>), this reflects stabilization that led to more nLucP mRNA, though to high levels not well coupled to translation efficacy in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5J</xref>). Whereas by contrast, LARP4-WT effects on nLucP-ARE were to increase both stabilization and TE while LARP4-R1 was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5J</xref>) (Discussion).

Prior to sedimentation, the lysates were examined for expression of nLucP-ARE mRNA, FLAG-LARP4, and nanoluciferase activity/μg extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A-C</xref>). After normalization, the data showed higher translation efficiency of nLucP-ARE mRNA in L4-WT than in EV cells, and that the CR2 mutations impaired this activity in L4-R1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D</xref>), reproducing the results for nLucP-ARE in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5G-J</xref>.</p><p id="P87">The lysates were subjected to sucrose gradient sedimentation. Tracings of the profiles upon collection are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6E</xref> columns i-iii. A northern blot from each profile was probed for mRNAs indicated to the left of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs 6F-H</xref> (codon number in parentheses); in addition to the fractions, aliquots of total RNA from the lysate (L) were loaded as markers. In the EV profile (column i), most nLucP-ARE mRNA sedimented similarly to RPS28 whose relatively shorter codon number and ribosome occupancy limits it to fractions 8-9 with substantially less in fraction 10, whereas GAPDH sedimented deeper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6F-H</xref>, column i). By contrast, in lysate from L4-WT cells, the nLucP-ARE mRNA sedimented deeper than in EV cell extract, with a substantial amount in fraction 10, and deeper than the internal control, RPS28 in the same gradient (column ii) (although degradation occurred in fraction 7, this was incomplete and the RNA above background could be quantified, see below). Thus, the effect of LARP4 to promote the apparent TE on nLuc-ARE mRNA here are reminiscent of its effects on b-glo-ARE mRNA, and generally confirm this activity. The L4-R1 profile was deficient in shifting the distribution of nLucP-ARE mRNA relative to LARP4-WT. Most notably, the amount of nLucP-ARE mRNA in lane 10 in LARP4-R1 cells was decreased relative to lane 10 in L4-WT cells compared to the RPS28 pattern. Fraction 10 is especially relevant because in it reproducibly contains RNA from two polysome peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6E</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig S6B</xref>) and therefore represents a larger increase in ribosome density relative to the preceding fractions, than the other fractions. The nLucP-ARE mRNA in each fraction is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6I</xref>.</p><p id="P88"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6J</xref> shows the sums of mRNA counts in fractions 7-13 divided by the sums in fractions 1-6, i.e., polysomes/pre-polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6K</xref> shows this after normalization by RPS28 mRNA. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs 6I-K</xref> indicate a larger amount of the nLucP-ARE mRNA on polysomes in LARP4-WT cells than in LARP4-R1 or in EV cells. While these data do not account for disproportionately large effects on TE of two polysome peaks in fraction 10, they are consistent with and support the more functional output assessment of TE based on luciferase activity measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S40" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P89">A major conclusion from this work is that the short conserved region (CR2) of LARP4 (amino acids 615-625) comprises the principal site that interacts directly with RACK1. Substitution and/or deletion mutations to CR2 and the homologous region of LARP4B markedly impair stable interaction with cellular RACK1. These mutations strongly impair stable association of LARP4 with ribosomes and polysomes relative to intact LARP4. Use of model reporters showed that the mutations decrease LARP4 activity for stabilization of β-glo mRNA containing an ARE to significantly greater extent than stabilization of the stable β-glo mRNA lacking the ARE. Dissociation from polysomes of RACK1 interaction-deficient LARP4-R1 protein was accompanied by its susceptibility to proteolysis in the several sucrose gradient sedimentation experiments performed. That the LARP4-R1 proteolysis could be minimized by use of milder cosedimentation conditions indicated that polysome dissociation occurred independent of proteolysis. The CR2 mutations (R1 and ΔRIR) which caused loss of LARP4-RACK1 interaction by IP assay caused minimal if any loss of LARP4-PABP interaction by IP assay, in agreement with published data on LARP4B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). The data would suggest that RACK1 and PABP can independently modulate LARP4 mRNA-related activity via their separate binding sites on LARP4. A caveat is that the IP assays do not probe functional relationships among these proteins. The LARP4-R1-specific proteolysis during polysome profile analysis confounded our ability to examine of this aspect of function.</p><p id="P90">Another significant conclusion is that LARP4-WT was shown to robustly promote the TE of both β-glo-ARE and nLucP-ARE. Further, the CR2-RACK1 interaction motif of LARP4 was shown to promote TE of these ARE-containing reporter mRNAs. This shouldn’t be surprising as the CR2 motif physically links LARP4 to the ribosome via direct binding. Evidence of this were conventional polysome profiles which display ribosome density, that compared β-glo-ARE and β-glo mRNAs. This was then confirmed using nLucP and nLucP-ARE mRNAs which allow characterization of TE in terms of translation output per unit of mRNA as functional luciferase enzyme activity.</p><p id="P91">LARP4 activity dependence on the CR2 was manifested most robustly for the β-glo-ARE and nLucP-ARE mRNAs relative to their controls lacking the ARE, it was also manifest albeit less so for the more stable controls which lack the ARE. The CR2-dependent LARP4 activity for nLucP-ARE mRNA was examined for TE in the same extracts used for polysome profile analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref>). The polysome profiles revealed that while LARP4-WT promoted high ribosome density on nLucP-ARE mRNA, the LARP4-R1 (CR2) mutant was deficient by comparisons to internally controlled RPS28 mRNA in the same cells on the same profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref>). Yet while polysome profile analysis of nLucP-ARE mRNA confirm the data obtained using β-glo-ARE, and support the TE data based on translation output, luciferase activity/nLucP-ARE mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C-D</xref>), we noted a feature of the nLucP-ARE mRNA profiles that reproducibly and intriguingly differed from the β-glo-ARE profiles, substantial amounts of nLuc-ARE mRNA in fractions 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6E-H and I</xref>). The material in fraction 2 represents soluble mRNP not engaged by 40S components, at levels higher than in any other fraction thereby comprising sizable percentages of the nLucP-mRNA which was not observed for the other mRNAs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6</xref> nor for β-glo-ARE mRNA. Although other potential explanations exist, the possibility that this is related to the PEST sequence is considerable and raises questions for future studies. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig S9G</xref>, we found that the PEST sequence reproducibly conferred significant stabilization to nLuc mRNAs independent of whether or not they contained the ARE. It is thus tempting to suggest that this PEST sequence may account for accumulation of nLucP-ARE mRNA in the fractions 2. If so, some PEST sequences might act as an RNA stabilization element in the non-translating mRNA, and a destabilizing element in its translated product.</p><p id="P92">The mRNA metabolism and translation related work here were done using cotransfection of HEK293 cells that carry endogenous LARP4. Previous studies compared LARP4 knockout (KO) and WT cells for effects on endogenous mRNA stability and transcriptome-wide PAT metabolism, and included HEK293 cells cotranfected with mRNA reporters and plasmids expressing LARP4-WT at various levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Although those studies produced evidence that the LARP4 expression-in HEK293 LARP4-replete cell system would reflect meaningful results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), we created HEK293-derived LARP4-knockout (KO) cells by CRISPR-Cas9 and transfected them with LARP4-WT and LARP4-R1 to examine β-glo-ARE mRNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig S11</xref>). While there is no a priori reason to believe that such cells have not acquired compensatory mechanisms and are better than the replete system, the data obtained nonetheless readily supported the basic results as expected and confirm them. Specifically, LARP4-WT and LARP4-R1 exhibited differential activity for stabilization of β-glo-ARE mRNA vs. the GFP mRNA lacking the ARE, reproducibly, and with statistical significance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig S11</xref>).</p><sec id="S41"><title>Context of the RACK1 interaction region</title><p id="P93">LARP4 and LARP4B exhibit similar overall architectures but with different functionalities in cancer and other processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), verified by direct comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Compared to their N-terminal halves which share multiple distinct motifs, their second halves display no recognizable domains and relatively low sequence identity with each other except at CR1 and CR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). The work here revealed the significance of CR2, and possibly CR1. As suggested by data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>, cell type differences and differences between LARP4 and LARP4B in their interactions with RACK1 may exist, though such possibilities have not been examined.</p><p id="P94">We wondered if the predicted LARP4 binding sites on RACK1 would appear accessible in context of the ribosome. Inspection of cryo-EM structures of human 80S ribosomes (PDB 6Z6M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>)) suggested the predicted CR2 and CR1 interaction sites as accessible, located on the RACK1 side facing outward (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig S10A</xref>, upper and lower). AFM predictions were performed using RACK1, C-terminal region of ribosomal protein uS3 which interacts with blade 4 of RACK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>), sequence containing LARP4 CR1 and CR2, and ribosomal proteins, uS3, S16 and S17, that contact RACK1. The prediction resembled the RACK1-associated proteins as observed in the 80S ribosome with no apparent hindrance imposed by CR2 and CR1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig S10B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S42"><title>Advances in understanding LARP4 involvement in mRNA metabolism</title><p id="P95">The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4I</xref> suggest that the CR2-mediated RACK1-interaction is as protective as the PBM-mediated PABP-interaction in LARP4 stabilizing β-glo-ARE mRNA. The data are consistent with a model in which LARP4 promotes translation by stabilizing the ARE containing mRNA via 3’PAT protection while engaged by polysomes. Pruning was described to model deadenylation dynamics of subsets of long-lived, well-translated mRNAs in the context of their short PATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>); thus, would be CNOT substrates while paradoxically remaining more refractory to decay than expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). For the abundant rp-mRNAs these appear as phased ~30-nt mRNP-PABP-protected peaks in PATseq profiles, while long noncoding PAT-containing RNAs do not exhibit phasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Although rp-mRNAs lack AREs or other elements that promote fast decay by CNOT, how they are maintained in a steady state of stabilization with short PATs is unclear though they may recruit pruning factors and PAT protection factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Pruning proposes that stable mRNAs with short PATs, including closed loop mRNAs, exhibit high TE in a context of limited local PABP concentration and protected from deadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Analysis of mRNA-PATseq-phasing in LARP4 knockout and control cells indicated protection of PABP-containing short-PAT rp-mRNPs from deadenylation and stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). LARP1-PABP protects short-PAT mRNPs from deadenylation, by the CNOT deadenylase globally, with greater effect on the rp-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Thus, LARP1 and LARP4, and perhaps LARP1B and LARP4B would appear to be PAT protection factors for mRNA subsets including in a pruning model, consistent with limited local PABP concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).</p><p id="P96">Yet, the extent to which PAT protection per se contributes to TE is unclear, and recruitment and/or retention of ribosomes or other activities may independently contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). The results here indicate that the CR2 of LARP4 enables contact with RACK1 as an interaction bridge to ribosomes. They suggest that this promotes enhanced translational efficiency of mRNA in such context providing a basis for future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS199842-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d71aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S43"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>MRC and JCC thank Agi Grigoriadis for reagents, access to infrastructure and support.
