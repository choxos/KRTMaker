shared environment, are ubiquitous in nature. Given the complexity of natural systems, indirect ecological effects were thought to be important in driving eco-evolutionary processes across community boundaries. However, we know remarkably little about such effects. Here we show that indirect effects of terrestrial insect (aphids) herbivory on macrophytes (duckweed) drives adaptive evolution of water fleas (<italic>Daphnia</italic>) in large outdoor aquatic mesocosms. Aphid herbivory reduced macrophyte growth and increased the abundance of phytoplankton, which in turn increased the abundance of <italic>Daphnia</italic>. Whole genome pool sequencing and phenotypic assays revealed an impact on the genetic compositions of the <italic>Daphnia</italic> populations and transplant experiments indicated that these evolutionary changes were adaptive. Furthermore, these changes in the aquatic community altered the interactions of the aphids and the macrophytes. These results demonstrate that indirect ecological effects can shape eco-evolutionary interactions between different communities.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Indirect ecological interactions are ubiquitous in natural ecosystems, where organisms live and evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Understanding whether and how indirect interactions shape evolutionary processes is a major challenge because the effects we observe when studying pairwise species interactions often cannot be extrapolated to more complex natural communities. Theoretical models suggest that indirect effects can drive coevolution in mutualistic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) and that cascading trophic interactions can influence species fitness across community boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). However, examples directly demonstrating that indirect interactions can shape evolutionary processes between natural communities are largely lacking. Furthermore, evolution can take place over ecological time scales of very few generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), which can, in turn, affect ecological interactions. Given the complexity of natural ecosystems, it is important to extend our understanding of adaptive processes and eco-evolutionary dynamics across communities.</p><p id="P3">In natural communities, antagonistic interactions, such as plant-herbivore interactions and interspecific competition, are widespread and can have profound effects on the fitness of each species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). In many shallow freshwater ecosystems, such as rivers, ditches, and ponds, macrophytes grow on the water surface and are attacked by both terrestrial and aquatic herbivores. In the water, macrophytes compete with phytoplankton for dissolved nutrients and light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), and phytoplankton is a food resource of zooplankton. In such ecosystems, macrophytes can act as keystone species that mediate indirect interactions between terrestrial and aquatic communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Here, we tested whether changes in the intensity of terrestrial herbivory on macrophytes can drive the evolution of species in an aquatic community via indirect effects, and whether these changes in the aquatic community can feedback on interactions between macrophytes and terrestrial insect herbivores. To this end, we established a replicated semi-natural aquatic community using outdoor experimental ponds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B and 1C</xref>). We grew the macrophyte <italic>Spirodela polyrhiza</italic> (giant duckweed) in the experimental ponds and manipulated the intensity of herbivory by waterlily aphids (<italic>Rhopalosiphum nymphaeae</italic>) on the duckweed. We then measured the ecosystem changes in the aquatic community and assessed the evolutionary responses of <italic>Daphnia magna</italic>, a key consumer of phytoplankton. By performing transplant experiments, we quantified the consequences of biotic and abiotic changes in the aquatic community on the fitness of aphids and duckweed, and assessed the eco-evolutionary dynamics mediated by indirect interactions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Aphid herbivory reduced duckweed growth and altered the aquatic community</title><p id="P4">To assess the effects of aphid herbivory on the aquatic community, we quantified the aphid population size, the duckweed growth, and the plankton communities over two consecutive years in the outdoor experimental ponds (2021 and 2022; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). The aphid and duckweed populations grew exponentially in summer and declined to zero in winter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, 1E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>), when the duckweed formed resting stages (turions) that sank to the bottom of the ponds. We reintroduced aphids into the community in spring of the second year, 2022. In late summer (between calendar weeks 30 and 36), aphid herbivory reduced the duckweed population size by ∼30.7% and 50.1% in 2021 and 2022, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). In the first year, the herbivory-driven reduction of the plant population started shortly before the peak of the aphid population (calendar week 30). The reduced plant growth effect by aphid herbivory was still visible in spring 2022, before we reintroduced aphids into the ponds, suggesting that herbivory has a long-lasting influence on duckweed growth. In addition to reducing the growth rate and population size of the duckweed, aphid herbivory also increased the content of anthocyanins in the duckweed, such as cyanidin-3-O-glycoside and cyanidin-3-O-(6-O-malonyl-beta-glucoside), likely contributing to the color differences of the duckweed visible during late summer, with predominantly greenish leaves in the controls, and reddish leaves in the plants exposed to aphid herbivory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref> small pictures, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Aphid herbivory on duckweed led to a trophic cascade effect in the aquatic community. In 2021, the reduced duckweed growth was shortly later followed by an increase in phytoplankton abundance (quantified using the chlorophyll-a concentration in the water as a proxy) and diversity between calendar weeks 30 and 35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F</xref>). Shortly after that, we observed an increase in the population size of <italic>D. magna</italic>, the main consumer of phytoplankton. The increased abundance of <italic>D. magna</italic> in the herbivory ponds is the likely cause for the subsequent decline of the phytoplankton in this treatment, which remained low until the end of the experiment, while the <italic>Daphnia</italic> populations remained high until the end of the experiment in 2022 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). From week 42 of the first year until the end of the experiment (more than a year), the average <italic>Daphnia</italic> population size in the herbivory treatment was approximately doubled in comparison to the control treatment. In addition to changing in the phytoplankton community, aphid herbivory also altered the abiotic environment, such as increased total phosphorus concentration, total dissolved carbon, water temperature, and pH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S13 and S14</xref>). Together, these results show that aphid herbivory on duckweed altered both the biotic and abiotic environment of the aquatic community, which influenced the population size of <italic>D. magna</italic>.</p><sec id="S4"><title><italic>Aphid herbivory drove rapid adaptive evolution of</italic> D. magna</title><p id="P6">We then investigated whether the observed biotic and abiotic changes in the aquatic environment associated with aphid herbivory also drove the evolution of <italic>D. magna</italic>. To this end, we phenotypically typed genetic markers developed to test for the attachment (adhesion phenotype) of different isolates of the bacterial pathogen <italic>Pasteuria ramosa</italic>, a common and virulent parasite of <italic>Daphnia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). This parasite was not present in our mesocosms, but the phenotypic markers nevertheless can be used to trace changes at polymorphic loci, as they are very fast to type, allowing big samples to be processed. As the attachment phenotype of <italic>P. ramosa</italic> to the cuticle of <italic>D. magna</italic> is genetically determined, changes in the frequencies of attachment phenotypes indicate evolutionary changes in the <italic>D. magna</italic> population. Attachment phenotypes were assessed with the attachment test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) in the laboratory using <italic>D. magna</italic> taken from the initial population and from the evolved pond populations. We found that the attachment level to three of the five tested parasite isolates differed between <italic>D. magna</italic> populations that evolved in control and in herbivory ponds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). <italic>Daphnia magna</italic> populations evolved lower attachment probabilities to isolates P15 and P21 but higher attachment probability to the isolate P20 in the herbivory ponds compared to populations evolved in the control ponds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The effects were consistent in 2021 and 2022. To verify the absence of <italic>P. ramosa</italic> in the communities at the end of the experiment, we searched the pool-seq data collected for each <italic>D. magna</italic> population for DNA traces of <italic>P. ramosa</italic>, and no fragments of the parasite DNA were discovered in any population, suggesting the changes in parasite resistances are likely due to genetic linkage, pleiotropy or a cost of resistance. Genetic linkage, i.e. the genes under selection being physically linked to the attachment genes, is of particular importance here, as <italic>D. magna</italic> reproduces mostly asexually and the attachment genes typed with the attachment test are known to be located in large polymorphic haplotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To investigate whether the evolution of <italic>D. magna</italic> driven by aphid herbivory is reflected on the genomic level, we sequenced the genomes of the evolved <italic>D. magna</italic> populations at three different time points (beginning, middle, and end of the experiment) using a pool-seq approach.</p><p id="P8">To identify genomic signatures of selection in <italic>D. magna</italic> that were imposed by aphid herbivory on the duckweed, we then compared the allele frequencies between the <italic>D. magna</italic> populations evolved in the control and the herbivory ponds. At the genome-wide level, the <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>ST</italic></sub> between control and aphid herbivory populations increased from 0.039 (± 0.022) in 2021 to 0.097 (± 0.06) in 2022 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S15 and S16</xref>), indicating that aphid-herbivore on the duckweed imposes divergent selection continuously driving the differentiation between the <italic>D. magna</italic> populations from control and aphid herbivory ponds. Consistently, using the Cochran□Mantel□Haenszel test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), we found that the proportion of SNPs showing significant allele frequency differences between control and aphid herbivory ponds increased from 8.1 % in 2021 to 28.6 % in 2022 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S17</xref>). To identify the regions that were under divergent selection imposed by aphid herbivory during the two years, we identified loci that showed different allele frequencies between control and aphid herbivory ponds using the beta-binomial mixed-effects model (with year and pond block as random factors). In total, we found that the allele frequencies of 141 SNPs were significantly different (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction) between the two treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Several of these significant SNPs are located at the beginning of chromosome 10, consistent with the selection analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S18</xref>). Among these 141 SNPs, 105 were in the genic region of 57 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Several of the identified significant SNPs are located close to known loci affecting strain-specific parasite attachment and resistances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Several significant SNPs are located within the large (nearly 5 MB) non-recombing haplotype that covers most of the right arm of Chromosome 5 and that determines the attachment of <italic>P. ramosa</italic> P20 strain to <italic>D. magna</italic>. Similarly, several significant SNPs are located on chromosome 7 near the D-locus that determines the attachment ability of <italic>P. ramosa</italic> strain P15 and P21 to <italic>D. magna</italic>. However, none of the significant SNPs were found near the <italic>Pasteuria</italic> resistance complex (PRC) locus on chromosome 4 (previously called ABCFG locus) that affects the attachment of <italic>P. ramosa</italic> strains C1 and C19. Thus, the changes in allele frequency near the parasite-attachment locus are highly consistent with the phenotypic changes observed in the populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We further determined whether the observed evolutionary changes in <italic>D. magna</italic> are adaptive by performing transplant experiments in the second year of the experiment (2022) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S19</xref>). To this end, we collected <italic>D. magna</italic> individuals from each pond and placed them into both control and herbivory ponds, respectively, using PVC columns containing various cut-outs covered by mesh to allow for an exchange of water and phytoplankton (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S19</xref>). We performed the same experiment once in spring (calendar week 23 to 25) and once in summer (calendar week 28 to 30). Both the season and pond community significantly affected the growth rate of <italic>D. magna</italic>. In calendar week 25, when <italic>D. magna</italic> grew rapidly in most of the ponds, the <italic>D. magna</italic> populations originating from aphid herbivory ponds exhibited significantly higher fitness when they were placed inside the aphid herbivory ponds compared to control ponds (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004, <italic>F</italic>-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The <italic>D. magna</italic> evolved in the control ponds had similar fitness in both the herbivore and control ponds (<italic>P</italic> = 0.73, <italic>F</italic>-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). In calendar week 30, <italic>D. magna</italic> population size did reproduce anymore in most of the ponds and thus their growth rates were similar between the treatments. Together, these data suggest that the evolution of <italic>D. magna</italic> populations in the aphid herbivory ponds reflects an adaptive response to this environment.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Changes in the aquatic community altered the aphid-duckweed interaction</title><p id="P11">The changes mediated by aphid herbivory in the aquatic community, in turn, might also alter the interactions between the aphids and the duckweed and thus lead to eco-evolutionary feedback. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the growth rate and aphid resistance of four duckweed genotypes by growing aphids and duckweed inside the evolved aquatic environments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S20</xref>). We performed the experiments twice in 2022, once in late spring (from calendar week 20 to 25) and once in summer (from calendar week 25 to 30). While the four duckweed genotypes had different growth rates (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>F</italic>-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), the changes in the aquatic communities caused by aphid-herbivory increased the duckweed growth rate in the absence of aphids (<italic>P</italic> = 0.036, <italic>F</italic>-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). The magnitude of the community effects was however only 11% of the direct suppression effects from the aphid herbivory on the growth rate (e.g., at calendar week 30). The interaction effect between the duckweed genotype and community was, however, non-significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.24), likely due to the small sample size. It is worth noticing that the genotype (SP102) that we used to establish the initial population appears to show the highest growth rate increase in the aphid-herbivory environment. This indicates that the environmental feedback on the duckweed might be genotype-specific, which in turn might shape the evolutionary processes of the duckweed-aphid interactions. Among the four duckweed genotypes, aphid growth rates differed (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>F</italic>-test), suggesting that host plants varied in their defense or nutritional value. Interestingly, aphids grew faster in the aphid-herbivory ponds than in the control ponds (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003, <italic>F</italic>-test), regardless of the tested plant genotype, suggesting that aphid-herbivory induced community changes had positive feedback effects on aphids.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P12">In natural communities, indirect ecological effects can play an important role in shaping community structure and affecting organisms’ fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Here, by experimentally manipulating herbivory by a terrestrial insect on aquatic plants and measuring evolutionary responses in the planktonic crustacean <italic>D. magna</italic>, we demonstrated that indirect ecological interactions can drive adaptive evolution in a natural multispecies community.</p><p id="P13">The observed evolutionary changes in the large and genetically diverse <italic>D. magna</italic> populations are likely due to a combination of changes in the quality and quantity of their planktonic food, as well as abiotic changes in the environment caused by aphid herbivory on duckweed, such as different light and temperature conditions caused by the difference in the amount of shading by the duckweed. The phytoplankton abundance and diversity reacted strongly to the herbivory treatment in the first year (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), likely due to the increased light and nutrient availability, and higher temperature in aquatic environments. Such changes can affect the growth of <italic>D. magna</italic> in a genotype-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), driving divergent evolution of the <italic>D. magna</italic> populations in the two treatments. In addition to changes in the phytoplankton community, the herbivory treatment also altered the abiotic environment, such as temperature and pH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14</xref>), two factors that are known to affect <italic>D. magna</italic> growth and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Accordingly, transplant experiments suggested that <italic>D. magna</italic> evolved in the aphid herbivory ponds had lower fitness when they were placed in the control ponds. However, <italic>D. magna</italic> that evolved in the control community showed similar fitness in both communities, indicating an asymmetry in the adaptation to the herbivory-induced community changes.</p><p id="P14">Our genomic analysis revealed that the aphid herbivory-imposed selection shaped the genomic changes in the <italic>D. magna</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The genome-wide population differences between <italic>D. magna</italic> populations evolved to become stronger over time between control and herbivory ponds (2.4-fold higher in 2022 than in 2021), indicating the cumulative effect of indirect selection imposed by the treatment. Because the levels of sexual reproduction and recombination in <italic>D. magna</italic> were limited during our experimental phase, we expected that a large proportion of the allele frequency changes in the populations would be affected by clonal selection, during which the entire genome is in genetic linkage. Consistently, the phenotype frequencies of the parasite attachment genes, which we used as convenient genetic markers, diverged among the treatments. The relevant parasite was not present in our mesocosms. All but one of these attachment genes are in large non-recombining regions in the <italic>D. magna</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), suggesting that linked genes may have been affected by selection. These haplotype blocks are known to evolve very fast in <italic>D. magna</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Thus, the change in parasite attachment phenotype frequency might have been a side-effect of selection on nearby genes. This would indicate that if parasites had been present, their interaction with the host would have been impacted by the herbivory treatment as well. Alternatively, selection by the parasite on the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>) might influence the response of <italic>D. magna</italic> to the herbivory treatment, potentially influencing how other components of the system respond. The evolutionary changes observed are consistent among replicates in the two treatments. This and the fact that the <italic>Daphnia</italic> population was at no moment in time smaller than 1,200 individuals, exclude genetic drift as an explanation for the observed changes.</p><p id="P15">In our experiment, we only introduced a single genotype of the aphid and the duckweed. Under natural conditions, populations of the aphids and the duckweed also harbor genetic variation and, therefore, can also evolve in response to changes in the community via direct and indirect interactions. This study, therefore, identifies a plausible path of how species living in terrestrial and aquatic communities can coevolve via eco-evolutionary feedback.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Establishing outdoor experimental ponds</title><p id="P16">In 2021, we established 16 outdoor experimental ponds at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) in Dübendorf, Switzerland, using a similar setup as reported by Narwani et al.

Separation was done in gradient mode with 0.2% formic acid (Fisher Chemical), 0.1% acetonitrile (Fisher Chemical) in water as Solvent A and acetonitrile (Fisher Chemical) as Solvent B, with the column oven set to 20 °C and a flow rate of 1300 µL/min using following solvent settings (Time [min]/B[%]): 0.0/10, 8.0/21, 18.0/49, 18.1/100, 19.0/100, 19.1/10, 24.0/10. Measurement was performed with a PDA detector. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and Cyanidin-3-O-(6-O-malonyl-beta-glucoside) were analyzed at an absorption wavelength of 517 nm and their retention times of 7.055 min and 9.410 min, respectively. Quantification was done based on the comparison with the molar quantity of an external Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside standard curve and after normalization to the fresh weight of extracted plant material.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary information</label><media xlink:href="EMS199062-supplement-Supplementary_information.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d38aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Ramona Petrig, Pascal Bucher, Lale Bähni, the analytical and teaching laboratory (AuA Lab), Morris Galli, Jesper Wallisch, Max Hofland and Raphael Bossart from Eawag, Marlon Haessler and Benjamin Huessy from the University of Basel, as well as Pascal Poweleit and Alexandra Chávez Argandoña from the University of Mainz for experimental assistance at the pond side and the lab.
