The inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity of GBM presents significant obstacles to effective clinical progression of novel treatments by contributing to tumour plasticity and rapid drug resistance that confounds contemporary target directed drug discovery strategies. Phenotypic drug screening is ideally suited to heterogeneous diseases, where targeting specific oncogenic drivers have been broadly ineffective. Our hypothesis is that a modern phenotypic led approach using disease relevant patient derived GBM stem cell systems will be the most productive approach to identifying new therapeutic targets, drug classes and future drug combinations that target the heterogeneity of GBM. In this study we incorporate a panel of patient derived GBM stem cell lines into an automated and unbiased ‘Cell Painting’ assay to quantify multiple GBM stem cell phenotypes. By screening several compound libraries at multiple concentrations across a panel of patient-derived GBM stem cells we provide the first comprehensive survey of distinct pharmacological classes and known druggable targets, including all clinically approved drug classes and oncology drug candidates upon multiple GBM stem cell phenotypes linked to cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Our data set representing, 3866 compounds, 2.2million images and 64000 datapoints is the largest phenotypic screen carried out to date on a panel of patient-derived GBM stem cell models that we are aware off. We seek to identify agents and targets classes which engender potent activity across heterogenous GBM genotypes and phenotypes, in this study we further characterize two validated target classes, histone deacetylase inhibitors and cyclin dependent kinases that exert broad and potent effects on the phenotypic and transcriptomic profiles of GBM stem cells. Here we present all validated hit compounds and their target assignments for the GBM community to explore.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Glioblastoma (GBM), a Grade IV astrocytoma, is a highly complex disease that remains difficult to treat. Mortality rates in the UK have increased over the last 30 years, especially in the over 60 age group, as incidence rates outpace survival improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] . GBM is therefore the most common and aggressive primary malignant tumour of the brain and represents an urgent area of unmet medical need. Since the introduction of post-surgical, concomitant radiotherapy and adjuvant temozolomide in 2005 (the ‘Stupp protocol’), which increased median overall survival by ˜3 months[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], a lack of effective, novel treatments for GBM have been introduced into broad clinical use and 5 year survival rates from time of diagnosis remain at less than 5%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Clinical and scientific research over the last 20 years has revealed a complex landscape of remarkable intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity associated with the highly dynamic nature of GBM molecular biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>{Verhaak, 2010 #312{Brennan, 2013 #313]. The complex biology driving the disease is further exacerbated by the addition of GBM stem cells (GSC), driving self-renewal and resistance mechanisms[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The self-renewing capacity of GSCs is an inherent feature of GBM to which the tumour microenvironment, or the GBM stem cell niche, contributes by supporting adaptive signal rewiring, heterogeneous tumour evolution and therapeutic resistance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Phospho-proteomic studies performed on patient derived GBM model systems demonstrates rapid rewiring of pathway signalling at the post-translational pathway level following effective inhibition of some of the most compelling drug targets such as the mTOR pathway, that is hyperactivated in approximately 90% of GBM[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. GBM plasticity and heterogeneity thus confound modern target-based drug discovery strategies contributing to drug resistance and relapse, hence the targeting of clear oncogenic drivers of GBM, such as EGFR amplification/mutation or RAS, PI3K signalling, has not translated into significant efficacy in GBM clinical management. Emerging single-cell transcriptomic[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], proteomic[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and image-based phenotypic screening[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] technologies combined with improved patient-derived GSC models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] provide new opportunities to understand and overcome disease heterogeneity. New hope for the development of novel therapeutic classes and drug combinations that may overcome some if this heterogeneity and support new personalized treatments strategies for GBM is provided from the recent phase 2 ROAR basket clinical trial study evaluating a combination a the BRAF targeting agent (dabrafenib) and the MEK inhibitor (trametinib) which includes a cohort of 45 high grade glioma (HGG, including GBM) patients with BRAFV600E mutation. The primary endpoint of, investigator-assessed overall response rate was 33% in the HGG cohort. Secondary endpoints of median duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) in the HGG cohort was; 31.2, 5.5 and 17.6 months respectively[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Emerging case reports from both adult and pediatric patients also point to the benefit of treating BRAF mutation-positive glioblastoma and gliomas with the dabrafenib and trametinib combination[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. However, BRAF V600E mutation can be found in approximately only 3% of GBM patients therefore, while such personalized treatments offer hope, the challenge is addressing the majority of patients which do not fall into molecular subtypes defined by a well-established druggable target or pathway or are refractory to such personalized treatments.</p><p id="P3">The drug development of imidazotetrazines, such as temozolomide, extended from chemocentric and phenotypic-led collaborative research exploring the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-cancer properties of small molecules, dacarbazine and mitozolomide (azolastone)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>] emphasizing the value of incorporating complex tumour biology into early stage drug design and selection. Phenotypic drug discovery (PDD), defined as the identification of hit or lead compounds prior to target identification[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], has historically contributed more than target based drug discovery (TDD), in terms of first-in-class drugs approved by the FDA since 1999[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], yet TDD has dominated drug discovery approaches in oncology over the same period of time[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. While TDD and PDD are complimentary drug discovery strategies, PDD can offer some advantages over target based methods, as it allows discovery of potential therapeutics using complex, biological models from heterogeneous, poorly understood disease states[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] and can reveal novel unprecedented therapeutic classes such as the first HDAC inhibitor (vorinostat), molecular glues (lenalidomide), spicing modulators (risdiplam)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] and novel conformation-selective binding modes-of-action for existing targets (NXP900/eCF506)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. This ‘target-agnostic’ approach has been greatly assisted by hardware advances in high content microscopy, the development of advanced image analysis software tools and improved phenotypic profiling techniques, such as Cell Painting and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) methods that help classify cell phenotypes and elucidate drug mechanism-of-action[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Recent advances in multiparametric high-content imaging enables the generation of a phenotypic fingerprint for every chemical (or genetic) perturbation to support the new discipline of ‘phenotypic (or morphometric) profiling’ that quantifies functional similarities and dissimilarities between drug mechanism-of-action (MOA) within intact cell-based assay systems[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. The Cell Painting assay multiplexes six fluorescent dyes, imaged in five spectral channels to reveal eight broadly relevant cellular components or organelles and can be combined with the development of bespoke automated image analysis pipelines to segment individual cells and calculate thousands of morphological feature-based measurements per cell (e.g. various measures of size, shape, texture, intensity and many others) to produce a data-rich profile that is suitable for the detection of subtle cellular phenotypes which can be linked to biological outcomes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. We describe the adaptation and optimization of Cell Painting for profiling compound MOA and target-class across a panel of 6 genetically distinct GSC lines obtained from the Glioma Cellular Genetics Resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/GCGR">https://github.com/GCGR</ext-link>). Using this approach we provide a comprehensive pharmacological audit of how specific target, pharmacological and chemical classes influence patient-derived GBM cellular phenotypes. We present a large-scale application of this technique using chemically diverse libraries containing FDA approved drugs, or Phase I passed clinical candidates and selective chemical probe compounds against known oncology targets. We identify multiple diverse pharmacological and target classes effective across our genetically distinct panel of patient derived GSCs and present all validated screening hits and their target assignments to the GBM research community. These results support our hypothesis that an unbiased phenotypic led approach, using disease relevant patient derived GSC models and exploitation of deep phenotyping and drug mechanism-of-action profiling technologies is a productive approach to identifying new targets, drug classes and future drug combinations that address the heterogeneity of GBM.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Glioblastoma Stem Cell Models</title><p id="P4">Patient derived GSCs were obtained from the Glioma Cellular Genetics Resource, and 6 GSC lines were initially selected to cover common transcriptomic subtypes based on their RNA-Seq subtype classification (classical (CLA), mesenchymal (MES), proneural (PRO)). GSC’s were cultured on laminin-1 coated substrates, under defined media conditions that have previously been demonstrated to maintain their stem cell like properties[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Initial studies demonstrate compatibility with high content imaging (i.e., flat and adherent morphology) and cell number was optimised for 384-well microtiter plate formats to enable high throughput drug screening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A-C</xref>). Given the generally slow growth rates of the GSCs relative to standard cancer cell line cultures, compound exposure over 72 hrs during screening was selected to ensure at least one population doubling in all lines. Short-tandem repeat (STR) profiling was carried out on each GSC line to create reference sequences and all cell lines were expanded and cell stocks banked in liquid nitrogen, to facilitate screening with consistent low passage numbers ensuring minimal biological drift across primary screening and secondary hit validation assays. In order to begin characterising these cell lines, prior to phenotypic screening we examined basal protein expression and post-translational pathway activation status by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) and cytokine array in 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) cell culture conditions. Basal levels of protein and phospho-epitope abundance (in 2D and 3D culture) show functional enrichment of signalling pathways in MAPK, ErbB, VEGF, PI3K-AKT, focal adhesion, EGFR inhibitor resistance and PD-1 checkpoint in cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). The cytokine array profiling further demonstrates enrichment in the secretion of GBM associated chemokine proteins involved in tumour progression, invasion, angiogenesis (IL-6, MMP-7, TIMP1, VEGF), and tumour associated neutrophils (TANs; CCL2, IL-8/CXCL8)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] including factors previously shown to contribute to GSC subtype trans-differentiation (PRO to MES transition)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A-D</xref>). Notably the six GSC lines representing three pairs of the common GBM transcriptomic sub-types (CLA, MES and PRO) selected for our study do not cluster into any specific subgroups based on basal protein expression or pathway activation status. Interestingly, high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-8 (CXCL8, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>C, D) has recently been reported as a druggable target in GBM (<italic>via</italic> humanised anti-IL8 antibody) with an anti-PD-1 combinational blockade[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Overall, this pre-screening profiling indicates our proposed GSC drug screening models are representative of typical GBM signalling networks observed in patient samples, express known druggable pathways while capturing the expected broad heterogeneity of GBM tumours at the molecular, protein and morphological levels in both 2D adherent and 3D cell culture.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>GSC Cell Painting Assay Development</title><p id="P5">Previously, we have successfully adapted the Cell Painting protocol[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] to explore drug MOA across cancer cell line panels from diverse lineages including, breast and oesophageal adenocarcinoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. In the current study, we adapt the protocol to our panel of patient-derived GSCs and incorporate live mitochondrial staining prior to fixation and staining with the remaining Cell Painting reagents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). It is our understanding that this study describes the first application of phenotypic profiling using the Cell Painting assay to a panel of patient-derived GSC models. Images from each cell line were then used to build a customized CellProfiler image analysis pipeline and confirm appropriate image segmentation and performance of high content analysis. Cell Profiler analysis quantified up to 1006 cellular features from each GSC and principal component analysis was carried out on median aggregated well level data using the StratoMineR HCA platform. Nuclei Count features were also extracted to assess reproducibility of cell seeding in 384-well format and calculate the percentage cell surviving fraction following each compound treatment including signal-to-noise assessment between negative (0.1% (v/v) DMSO) and cytotoxic positive control compounds (paclitaxel, staurosporine). These assay validation studies confirm assay reproducibility and signal-to-noise in 384-well plate formats is suitable for high throughput screening based on industry-standard recommendations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 1C &amp; Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Our phenotypic screening campaign performed across the panel of six GSC lines incorporated multiple small molecule compound libraries screened against varied concentrations (ranging from 3-10,000nM) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">methods</xref> for specific concentrations for each library &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).

The C<sup>3</sup>L library was created with a focus on chemical and known oncology target diversity to functionally evaluate known oncology targets across phenotypic screening assays. The majority of these commercially available compounds (across all library sets) have been through phase I clinical trials. It is our view that this approach presents the potential for discovering novel drug repurposing and drug combination opportunities in addition to identifying new therapeutic targets not previously explored in GBM.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>High Content Cell Painting Screen, Analysis &amp; Validation</title><p id="P7">Our optimised GSC high content phenotypic screening and analysis workflow is outlined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) and described in detail in the materials and methods section. Briefly, cell lines were seeded (500-1500 cells per well) onto laminin pre-coated 384-well plates, followed by compound addition at 24hrs using automated liquid handling platforms. DMSO (0.1% (v/v)) was used as a negative (compound vehicle) control (48 wells per plate minimum) with staurosporine (1uM) typically used as an assay landmark control for cell death. After 72 hrs compound exposure, cells were subjected to live cell labelling of mitochondria with MitoTracker, followed by fixation, permeabilization, and additional staining with the remaining Cell Painting dyes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Materials and Methods</xref>). Images for phenotypic analysis were acquired using an ImageXpress Confocal high-content microscope with six fields of view (20× objective) over five channels, collecting 11,520 images per 384 well plate. Each compound library was screened separately across all six GCGR cells lines. In total 3,866 compounds were screened (varied doses), ˜2.2 million images collected (21 Tb) representing a dataset of &gt;62,000 datapoints. Image analysis was carried out <italic>via</italic> a custom Cell Profiler pipeline and secondary multiparametric data analysis was performed using StratoMineR™ (Core Life Analytics) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>] and TIBCO Spotfire<sup>®</sup> software (Revvity) see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">methods</xref>. Principal components (PC) 1 and 2 were plotted for LOPAC, Prestwick and C<sup>3</sup>L libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panels A, C, E) to visualize distribution of active compounds from DMSO controls in phenotypic space. A phenotypic distance metric between each compound and DMSO control was determined using StratoMineR to calculate a normalised Euclidean distance value and then Z score (‘Phenotypic Distance Z Score’) to rank phenotypic activity of each compound. This phenotypic distance value which identifies compounds having both cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic properties (e.g. morphological changes) was plotted against cell survival (Z-score value of % surviving cells based on nuclei count) to visualise compound effects on both cell morphology and survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panels B, D, F). Initial hit compound identification was based on two phenotypic criteria, a cell survival threshold (Nuclei Count Z score &lt;-1.95 ) and phenotypic distance threshold (Z score &gt;1.95) capturing changes in cell number and/or morphology following compound treatment in two or more GSC lines. Hit compounds were triaged by removal of excessive examples of overtly cytotoxic agents (including common anti-cancer agents which have historically been investigated across pan-cancer indications including GBM) such as microtubule disruptors, topoisomerase poisons and proteasome inhibitors and selected hits were taken forward for further investigation.</p><p id="P8">Final quality control checks (compound specific and direct image assessment) were carried out and 211 compounds (8.3% hit rate) with phenotypic activity were repurchased from different suppliers from that of the original screening libraries, for validation by dose response testing.

Targeted agents of interest involve those targeting cell adhesion (FAK, SRC, YES, FYN), transcription and translation (JAK2/STAT3, CDK9, HDAC, BRD), MAPK pathway/crosstalk (MEK1,2, PAK4,6), DNA damage/repair (PARP, TOPO), mitosis (AURK, KSP), metabolism (FASN, NAMPT) and protein folding/homeostasis (HSP90, HSF, VCP). There is clear chemical and target diversity within this validated hit list, beyond the expected highly potent cytotoxins, which provides a preliminary shortlist for rational drug-target selection and future systematic drug combination strategies.

To address this challenge a number of phenotypic screens of drug libraries and drug combinations performed in complex <italic>ex vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> GBM models have recently been reported. However, screens reported to date have been limited in terms of the number of compounds, phenotypic endpoints and the use of use of culture conditions which preserve GBM stem cell characteristics. In this study, our aim was to attempt to address the unmet clinical need in GBM by applying a comprehensive target agnostic, high content phenotypic screen, of thousands of compounds across a well characterized panel of patient-derived GBM stem cell models. The drug libraries were selected to support repurposing of existing oncology drug discovery programs and included Phase I passed or FDA/EMA approved small molecules and drugs with high target selectivity across known oncology targets. We have chosen to not exclusively utilise blood-brain-barrier (BBB)/CNS penetrant drug libraries in order to provide a comprehensive and unbiased evaluation of distinct drug and target classes upon GSC phenotypes. It is our hope that this will be informative towards future medicinal chemistry efforts in generating CNS penetrating small molecules against such targets, or possible incorporation of validated hit compounds into emerging blood-brain-barrier penetrating nanoparticles, designed to effectively deliver drugs and drug combinations administered systemically, directly towards selective tissue and tumour sites including GBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. In total 3,866 compounds were screened over multiple concentrations (3– 3000nM), in order to capture the most potent dose-dependent cellular phenotypes beyond simple viability measurements. Our GBM models comprised six heterogeneous, patient-derived GSC lines, representing three of the major transcriptomic subtypes (CLA, MES, PRO). We applied the multiparametric high content ‘Cell Painting’ assay to screen five drug libraries across the six GSC lines, acquiring over two million images. Image processing and analysis, using software tools such as CellProfiler (cellprofiler.org) and StratoMineR (stratominer.com), identified 211 hit compounds which were re-purchased and validated (66% validation rate). We provide an updated list of 159 biologically active compounds on human GSC survival and morphology (phenotypic activity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">2</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Common cytotoxic agents, such as microtubule targeting agents, topoisomerase poisons, proteasome and HDAC inhibitors, are prevalent in our hit list and many have previously been investigated in GBM (and other cancers). However, many of these agents have a narrow therapeutic window and significant systemic toxicities limiting their effectiveness. Nevertheless, novel drug delivery technology, such as antibody-cytotoxin conjugates, brain-tumour specific nanoparticles and intra-cranial drug delivery implants, could still utilise such potent molecules clinically in the future. Other molecular targeted compounds identified from our screen, include those targeting cellular adhesion, transcription, DNA damage/repair, cell cycle/mitosis, proliferation, metabolism, and protein folding/homeostasis. The screening deck included a recent, custom made chemogenomic annotated library (Comprehensive Anti-Cancer Compound Library, ‘C<sup>3</sup>L’[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]), which was designed to incorporate chemical diversity, potency and selectivity on a broad range of oncology targets and thus complements the other “off-the-shelf” commercially available libraries contributing to a comprehensive, relevant and updated pharmacological response profile of patient derived GSCs that we present in this article.</p><p id="P20">We provide all 159 validated hit compounds demonstrating activity upon GSC survival and morphological endpoints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">2</xref>) for the GBM research community to explore in further detail. In this article we followed up two drug target classes, HDAC and CDK inhibitors which displayed exquisite low nM activity upon inhibiting cell survival across the heterogeneous panel of GSCs. However, further analysis of the morphological hits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 2</xref>) is likely to also identify compounds that impact upon other GSC phenotypes such as cell cycle, senescence, differentiation and invasion etc.</p><p id="P21">To further explore the HDAC inhibitor class we screened a library of 54 HDAC inhibitors. Fimepinostat (CUDC-907) was outstandingly the most potent molecule, with &lt;20nM IC<sub>50</sub> values across the panel. Fimepinostat, a dual PI3K/HDAC inhibitor, is currently undergoing clinical trials for paediatric/young adult brain cancers/solid tumours (NCT03893487), and is a candidate for targeted drug delivery and drug combination strategies. We compared fimepinostat with structurally distinct HDAC inhibitors, romidepsin and panobinostat, by cell cycle and apoptosis assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). While there was a varied response between cell lines (usually more G2/M arrest vs weak G0/G1), there was a common intra-cell line response (and morphology, by live imaging observation) between molecules, suggesting phenotypic activity is most likely mediated through the anti-HDAC activity of fimepinostat rather than its anti-PI3K activity. Indeed, comparison between fimepinostat and potent, selective PI3K inhibitors (all tested at 30nM) demonstrate substantially weaker activity of PI3K inhibition upon GSC proliferation with only the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, gedatolisib, showing any significant effect but still substantially weaker than fimepinostat (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Targeting transcriptional regulation has previously been shown to be effective against cancer stem cells (including brain cancers)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>], hence we also characterised potent CDK9 inhibitors dinaciclib, NVP-2 (both screening hits) and a more recent selective CDK9 inhibitor, AZD4573. CDK9 is an atypical CDK in that it is a key regulator of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcription initiation, elongation, and termination playing a critical role in transcriptional regulation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. Dinaciclib has near equal potency against CDK1/2 (&amp; 5), whereas NVP-2 and AZD4573 are classed as CDK9 selective. AZD4573 has progressed to clinical trials (NCT04630756) and is well tolerated, although CNS penetrance and solid tumour efficacy remains to be determined. Radio-sensitisation of cancer cells with CDK9 inhibitors and drug combinations with DNA damaging agents have previously been reported[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>], including opportunities in GBM[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>].

These results indicate that the CDK inhibitors are reprogramming the GSCs into a more vulnerable state, leading to inhibition of cell survival that may be further exploited by combination therapy. Therefore, these results together with previous publications implicating CDK9 as a therapeutic target in GBM suggest targeting CDK9 is worth further exploration in other GBM models and with other drug combinations.</p><p id="P24">Overall, our preliminary screening results presented here serve as a foundation for a systematic approach to the identification, validation and prioritisation of novel therapeutic strategies in GBM including future drug combinations, that could be used concurrently or following standard treatment protocols for GBM. Importantly, we have used patient-derived GSC models, grown under stem-like conditions on a laminin rich ECM scaffold to prioritize follow up investigations of highly potent small molecule active across a genetically distinct and heterogeneous GSC panel. The objective of our phenotypic screening assay was to identify, drug targets and mechanisms-of-action which target heterogeneous GSC phenotypes and thus complements the existing focus on known oncogenic drivers that represent established drug target classes. We anticipate that this approach will identify new therapeutic targets and drug combination hypothesis that target GSC phenotypes rather than individual pathways and thus may be more resilient across heterogeneous patient populations and adaptive drug resistance mechanisms.</p><p id="P25">In conclusions, our high content screening followed by multi-cell line validation across primary and secondary phenotypic assays provides the largest unbiased survey of small molecule therapeutic classes and oncology targets upon GBM stem cell phenotypes that we are aware of. We provide our full lists of validated hits active upon GBM stem cell morphology and cell survival for the research community to explore further. Future studies include expanded screening across larger libraries of compounds to identify novel chemical starting points and novel targets for new GBM drug discovery programs. In addition, further profiling of phenotypic screening hits across a larger number of GBM stem cells lines and integration of phenotypic with molecular data, in order to identify synthetic lethality relationships and or predictive biomarkers of response, will support additional personalized medicine strategies for new drug target classes of GBM. Importantly this unbiased approach can identify new therapeutic opportunities for the majority of GBM patients which do not fall into well-defined subtypes characterized by well-known druggable driver genes thus expanding the scope and inclusion criteria of personalized medicine strategies in GBM.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P26">Cell lines were obtained from the Glioma Cellular Genetics Resource, Edinburgh and cultured according to optimised conditions for glioma stem cell growth (gcgr.org.uk).

Detection antibody mixtures (1:500 antibody dilutions in 5% bovine serum albumin/phosphate buffered saline tween-20 0.1% (BSA/PBST), 1% SuperG Blocking Buffer) were made in microplates. Microarrays were clamped and 50 μL of each antibody was added to corresponding microarray wells. Microarrays were incubated for 1 hour on a flat surface. Clamps were removed and microarrays were washed three times for 5 minutes in TBS-Tween (0.1% v/v). Microarrays were then blocked for 10min with SuperG Blocking Buffer at room temperature and again washed three times for 5 minutes in PBST. Three millilitres (3 mL) of IRDye 800CW Streptavidin (LI-COR Biosciences) was diluted 1:5000 in PBST supplemented with 5% BSA, 1% SuperG Blocking Buffer. Microarrays were covered and incubated with IRDye on a rocker at room temperature for 45 minutes, then washed for 5 minutes, three times in PBST followed by three 5-minute PBS washes and finally washed with distilled water.

Cells were set up as mono-layer and spheroid cultures in parallel by seeding equivalent cell numbers from a parental flask with cells in log-phase growth. Cultures were grown until the mono-layer cultures were approximately 70% confluent and then both adherent and suspension cultures were harvested for lysis and preparation for RPPA. For Laminin coating plates were incubated with Laminin at 10ug/ml for 1 hour and then washed with PBS prior to addition of cell lines. Culture media did not contain Laminin and the same media was used for adherent and suspension cultures. For Poly-hema coating plastic 2.4g of poly-hema was dissolved in 200ml of 95% Ethanol and heated to dissolve. The solution was centrifuged at 2500RPM to remove undissolved particles. 4ml was added per 10cm plate (ensuring the plate was completely coated). Plates were left open in a TC hood to air-dry and were rinsed x3 with PBS prior to addition of cells.</p><p id="P37">Mono-layer cultures were washed twice with PBS after removal of media and snap frozen on dry-ice and stored at -80°C. Spheroid cultures were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS and then snap frozen and stored until lysis. Cultures were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with PhosStop and Complete Mini inhibitor tablets. Lysates were needle syringed five times to ensure complete lysis of cells. Protein quantification was carried out using Coomassie-plus assay (ThermoFisher #23228) and protein concentration was adjusted by to 1 mg/ml. Samples were prepared for printing by addition of 4x Sample buffer and heat denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes.</p><p id="P38">All samples were diluted to 0.75mg/ml (D1), 0.375mg/ml (D2), 0.1875mg/ml (D3) and 0.09375mg/ml (D4) using PBS containing 10% Glycerol. Array spotting was carried out with the Quanterix 2470 Arrayer platform using 185μM pins. Each sample was spotted at four dilutions (D1-D4) onto single pad ONCYTE® SuperNOVA nitrocellulose slides at a 500μM spot-to-spot distance. 168 signalling pathway markers (and appropriate controls) were profiled in a standard RPPA assay as described briefly below. After spotting, the slides were incubated with antigen retrieval solution (1x Reblot strong) for 10 mins before being placed in a microfluidic structure to individually address the arrays with primary or secondary antibody solutions. Following blocking buffer (Superblock T20) for 10 mins the detection of marker antibodies was performed in a two-step sequential assay (1) incubation of an array with primary analyte-specific antibody in blocking buffer for 60 mins at room temperature and (2) removal of excess antibody by washing arrays with PBS-T, followed by a further incubation with blocking buffer and PBS-T washes, and incubation secondary antibody (Dylight-800-labeled anti-species antibodies diluted 1:2500 in Superblock T20) for 30 mins. After further washing and slide drying, the arrays were imaged in the Innopsys Innoscan 710 scanner. Blank signals were determined by omitting the primary antibody from step 1 and instead incubating the array with Superblock T20 alone, followed by step 2. Sample loading on arrays (for normalisation) was determined by staining one slide with fast green protein dye and scanning at 800nm. Microarray images are analyzed using Mapix software (Innopsys). The feature (spot) diameter of the grid was set to 270μm. The average signal intensity is determined for each individual feature and the median background from the adjacent area is subtracted from each feature signal leading to a net signal per feature. Data analysis is performed in a standard way: Fluorescence intensity for each feature on the array is measured. A test is performed for linear fit through the 4 point dilution series for all samples on all arrays using a flag system where R2 &gt; 0.9 (green flag) is deemed good, &gt;0.8 (amber flag) is deemed acceptable and &lt;0.8 (red flag) is poor and may be excluded from data analysis. The median values from the 4 point dilution series are calculated and used as a measure of fluorescence intensity. Data is quantified as RFI (relative fluorescence intensity) values relating to relative abundance of total and phosphorylated proteins across the sample set.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS201715-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d185aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table1</label><media xlink:href="EMS201715-supplement-Supplementary_Table1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d185aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table2</label><media xlink:href="EMS201715-supplement-Supplementary_Table2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d185aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by a joint Cancer Research UK (C42454/A28596) and The Brain Tumour Charity award (GN-000676) to D.E., N.O.C. and M.C.F.
