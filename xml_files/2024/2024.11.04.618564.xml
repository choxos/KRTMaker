The contribution of genetic variation to this in cancer treatment is under-explored. We have conducted a genome-wide and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-focused analysis of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell TCR repertoire to identify genetic determinants of variable gene (V-gene) and CDR3 K-mer usage from samples taken prior to and after ICB treatment (n=250). We find 11 genome-wide significant <italic>cis</italic> associations and 10 <italic>trans</italic> associations, primarily to the HLA, with V-gene usage meeting permuted P-value thresholds. Notably, TCR clones containing V-genes associated with HLA were less likely to be persistent across treatment. In a single-cell experiment, we find cells with HLA-matched TCR clones have increased tumor reactivity expression profiles and patients with HLA-matched TCR clones have improved overall survival. Our work indicates a complex relationship between genotype and TCR repertoire in the context of treatment with ICB, which has novel implications for understanding determinants of treatment response and patient outcomes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Immune checkpoint proteins, of which the cell-surface receptors programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) are archetypal examples, play key roles in negatively regulating T cell responses, limiting deleterious inflammation and autoimmunity. In the context of cancer, induction and ligation of PD-1 and CTLA-4 are implicated in the development of T-cell exhaustion and suppression of anti-tumor immunity. Correspondingly, treatment with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) leads to re-invigoration of exhausted T cells, increasing their proliferation, cytotoxicity and broadening the TCR repertoire[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Treatment with ICB has improved outcomes across numerous cancers, most notably metastatic melanoma (MM) where treatment with combination ICB to CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) and PD-1 (nivolumab) for MM is associated with extending median survival from months to beyond five years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p><p id="P3">CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are central to T cell mediated anti-tumor responses to both neoantigens and Tumour Associated Antigens (TAA) presented by Class I Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles in complex with <italic>β</italic>-2 microglobulin. Successful recognition of HLA presented antigens utilises TCR incorporating <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> chains encoded on chromosome 14 and 9 respectively. Within the TCR <italic>β</italic> chain the first and second complementarity-determining regions (CDR1, CDR2) primarily interface with HLA <italic>α</italic> helices, whilst interactions with the hypervariable CDR3 region are the critical determinant of peptide recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. As such, in both the <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> chains, the CDR3 loops have the highest sequence diversity and are the principal determinants of receptor specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The CDR1 and 2 loops are determined by the V-gene segment in the TCR whilst CDR3 hypervariability is secondary to V(D)J recombination during early T cell maturation. The process of gene segment recombination to encode a final full length transcript results in a combinatorial possibility of 10<sup>10</sup> possible TCR sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], vital for enabling recognition of a vast array of self or pathogen derived peptides.</p><p id="P4">At the individual level the TCR repertoire is determined by a complex interplay between antigen exposure and HLA determined propensity to present specific peptides. Early thymic selection is crucial in repertoire determination, with deletion from the repertoire of T cell clones expressing TCRs either unresponsive or overtly reactive to self-peptide MHC complexes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. The interaction between germline genetics at the MHC and TCR repertoire thus has significant implications on our understanding of the pathophysiology of directly immune-mediated diseases and those where immunity plays a key role in clinical responses to therapeutics including cancer. However, in the context of ICB therapy, the relationship between germline genetics, including classical HLA alleles, and TCR usage, as well as any association to clinical response to treatment are largely unexplored.</p><p id="P5">Here we have investigated the association between genetic factors and CD8<sup>+</sup> TCR repertoire composition across 250 patients receiving ICB for cancer, integrating germline genotyping and TCR sequencing both prior to and post ICB treatment. We describe a complex relationship between genotype determined Class I HLA allele carriage and the TCR repertoire, specifically identifying a number of HLA-matched TCR chains. By exploring single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from patients receiving ICB we find CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell clones incorporating HLA-matched TCR demonstrate increased expression of tumor reactivity associated genes. Finally, we find that presence of HLA-matched TCR clones is associated with overall survival in patients receiving ICB for MM.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Exploring CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell receptor repertoire</title><p id="P6">We performed RNA sequencing of peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated prior to the first and second cycles of ICB treatment from 250 patients receiving ICB for cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). By correlating <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> chain V-gene usage between patients we identified conserved patterns of V-gene repertoire frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Principal component (PC) analysis of correlations between <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> chain V-genes demonstrated further distinct relationships in chain usage between <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> chains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A,B</xref>). Notably, the first PC of <italic>α</italic> chain V-gene usage was dominated by <italic>TRAV1-2</italic>, which was markedly separate from other chains, and forms the key TCR for MR1 ligated Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. <italic>TRAV12-2</italic> formed one of outlier chains for the second PC, clustering relatively close to <italic>TRAV1-2</italic> - interestingly <italic>TRAV12-2</italic> has been described to be used by atypical MR1 reacting MAIT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Correspondingly, a reciprocal pattern was observed in the first PC of the <italic>β</italic> chain usage which was dominated by <italic>TRBV6-4</italic>, the key partner of <italic>TRAV1-2</italic> in MAIT cells - thus it would appear that whilst there is limited structure within paired CD8<sup>+</sup> TCR chain usage, reactivity to MR1 versus HLA is the leading driver of variation.</p><p id="P7">For 179 patients we had paired pre and post ICB TCR data. In these we identified 504,078 unique <italic>α</italic>-chain clones and 867,283 unique <italic>β</italic>-chain clones. Analysis of chain conservation across ICB treatment demonstrated that only a small number of clones were resampled across both time points, likely reflecting the relatively small proportion of total TCR being sampled as well as ICB induced T cell mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>GWAS of V-gene usage reveals <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-associations</title><p id="P8">We proceeded to explore the relationship between genetics and TCR usage. No difference in overall V-gene usage pre- and post-treatment was observed in PCA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), and henceforth focused our association analysis on pre-treatment samples where our power was greatest to detect effect (n=250). Genome-wide genotyping was performed across samples, resulting in 486,469 SNPs available for post-QC analysis. We defined V-gene usage for <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> chains as normalised count of unique clones per V-gene and modelled this as a quantitative trait. For each V-gene, we performed additive linear regression to identify genetic variants associated with V-gene usage, correcting for the first two genetic PCs, two TCR PCs, age, gender and cancer type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 3,4</xref>). To account for multiple testing and also correlation between V-gene usage, we permuted the phenotype dataset 1,000 times, preserving individual level V-genes but re-ordering the samples, resulting in a permutation P-value threshold of 3.83 x 10<sup>-9</sup> for <italic>β</italic> chain V-gene (TRBV) and 3.46 x 10<sup>-9</sup> for <italic>α</italic> chain V-gene (TRAV, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5A,B</xref>). In total, we performed genome-wide association studies for 47 <italic>β</italic> chains and 42 <italic>α</italic> chains V-genes from pre-ICB treatment samples. After running &gt; 40 million regression models we observed, as per previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], strong <italic>cis</italic> associations to a subset of the <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> chains, corresponding to their respective genomic loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Additionally we noted a strong secondary <italic>trans</italic>-acting signal to both chains corresponding to the MHC region at 6p23.</p><p id="P9">The mechanisms whereby <italic>cis</italic>-acting polymorphisms may influence V-gene usage may be similar to standard expression quantitative loci, with polymorphisms in regulatory regions such as promoters and enhancers regulating expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. However, by providing equal weighting to clones irrespective of numbers of copies detected, our approach gives insights into propensity for clonal formation. Thus <italic>cis</italic> acting variants are more likely to influence propensity to recombination, defined by the local three dimensional structure of the loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. In total we found clones containing nine different TRBV-genes were associated with variants in <italic>cis</italic> at P-values below the permuted significance threshold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The most significant association was for <italic>TRBV28</italic> was with rs4726571, 3.7Kb upstream (<italic>β</italic> = −0.957, <italic>P</italic> = 2.12 × 10<sup>−40</sup>). At the <italic>α</italic> locus only <italic>TRAV26-2</italic> and <italic>TRAV38-1</italic> demonstrated associations with clonal usage after correcting for multiple testing, the most significant being with rs1023437 which is 41Kb downstream from <italic>TRAV26-2</italic> (<italic>β</italic> = −1.035, <italic>P</italic> = 4.88 × 10<sup>−27</sup>). We performed further conditional analysis on all the significant V-genes, controlling for primary <italic>cis</italic> signals. Only one secondary signal was observed to <italic>TRBV4-3</italic>, with the lead SNP being rs361489 (<italic>β</italic> = 0.571, <italic>P</italic> = 9.83 × 10<sup>−12</sup>) and peak secondary signal to rs17249 (<italic>β</italic> = −0.460, <italic>P</italic> = 2.66 × 10<sup>−11</sup>), indicating multiple germline variants determining the usage of this V-gene.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>V-gene usage is associated with classical HLA alleles</title><p id="P10">We observed a <italic>trans</italic> locus associated with both TRAV and TRBV genes that maps to 6p23, which corresponds to the MHC region. To further define the associations here we associated V-gene usage with imputed SNPs in the MHC region as well as classical HLA alleles and coding polymorphisms. In total we tested 16,781 SNPs, 174 classical alleles, and 2,119 amino acids. To control for false positives, we performed a permutation analysis by randomly shuffling the phenotypes and fitting the regression model 1,000 times deriving empirical P-value thresholds of 3.37 x 10<sup>-7</sup> for <italic>β</italic> chain and 3.61 x 10<sup>-7</sup> for <italic>α</italic> chain V-genes respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5C,D</xref>). In total, we observed five <italic>β</italic> chain V-genes and five <italic>α</italic> chain V-genes that had significant associations with variants within the MHC region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6-8</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We found that the most significant association in the <italic>α</italic> chain was HLA-A*02 with <italic>TRAV12-2</italic> (<italic>β</italic>=0.689, P=3.04 x 10<sup>-13</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Interestingly a strong bias towards <italic>TRAV12-2</italic> usage has been described for melanocyte antigen (Melan-A) specific TCR, with predominant interaction between the <italic>TRAV12-2</italic> chain and the HLA-A2/Melan-A peptide located in the CDR1loop (Gln31) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Given Melan-A is one of the most common melanoma associated antigens, these results suggest that germline determined <italic>TRAV12-2</italic> usage may play a role in anti-melanoma immunity. There were no secondary signals in the conditional analysis of any of the TRAV-genes. The strongest association observed to the <italic>β</italic> chain was between <italic>TRBV19</italic> and rs2250287 (<italic>β</italic>=0.760, P=7.93 x 10<sup>-13</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>) with the top classical HLA allele associated with <italic>TRBV19</italic> being HLA-B*44 (<italic>β</italic>=0.734, P=1.83 x 10<sup>-10</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) in linkage disequilibrium with rs2250287 (r<sup>2</sup>=0.882). At four-digit HLA resolution, <italic>TRBV19</italic> was associated with both HLA-B*44:02 (<italic>β</italic>=0.576, P=2.78 x 10<sup>-5</sup>) and HLA-B*44:03 (<italic>β</italic>=0.725, P=1.23 x 10<sup>-4</sup>). Interestingly, HLA-B*44:02 is associated with protection against multiple sclerosis in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], whilst in the context of melanoma carriage of the B*44 supertype has been associated with improved outcomes to ICB treatment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] - although this was not reproduced in a follow-up study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Notably though, as per <italic>TRAV12-2, TRBV19</italic> is enriched for TCR in T cells reactive to Melan-A in patients with metastatic melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. We further performed conditional analysis and observed only one secondary signal among the significantly associated V-genes - <italic>TRBV19</italic> with the top secondary SNP being rs62395263 (<italic>β</italic>=0.705, P=2.96 x 10<sup>-7</sup>).</p><p id="P12">To determine whether specific HLA amino acid positions were associated with V-gene usage, we tested variable amino acid positions by grouping haplotypes carrying a specific residue at each position in an additive model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). We found that the most significant association in <italic>α</italic> chain was between <italic>TRAV12-2</italic> and position 74 (exon2) in HLA-A (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>ommnibus</italic></sub> = 2.93 x 10<sup>-13</sup>), whilst the most significant association in <italic>β</italic> chain was between <italic>TRBV19</italic> and position 45 (exon2) in HLA-B (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>ommnibus</italic></sub>= 5.08 x 10<sup>-11</sup>). These positions had stronger association signals than any single SNP or classical HLA allele, and fall within the peptide-binding groove of the respective HLA protein, indicating that variation in the amino acid content of the peptide-binding groove is the major genetic determinant of V-gene usage, likely reflecting presentation of a common antigen being the key driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>CDR3 amino acid K-mers are associated with HLA alleles</title><p id="P13">In both <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> TCR chains, CDR3 loops - which form the hypervariable peptide contacting region - have the greatest diversity in sequence and are the crucial determinants of antigen binding specificity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. We hypothesised that specific CDR3 sequences would demonstrate reciprocal association with variants in the MHC region. To test this, we employed a K-mer based approach across TCR mapped from the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell bulk sequencing data, using a sliding window of seven amino acids to quantify K-mer motif usage in the CDR3 region (6,654 <italic>β</italic> chain and 2,306 <italic>α</italic> chain K-mers respectively) across individuals. Linear models were subsequently utilised to test the association between CDR3 K-mers and HLA alleles, incorporating the same covariates as prior analyses.</p><p id="P14">Whilst no significant associations were identified for the <italic>α</italic> chain, we identified two significantly associated K-mers in the <italic>β</italic> chain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). The most significant <italic>β</italic> chain CDR3 K-mer association was between TGDSNQP and HLA-B*35:01 (<italic>β</italic>= 1.41, P=1.57 x 10<sup>-13</sup>) whilst the K-mer TSGDYNE was associated with rs3763288 (<italic>β</italic>= 1.12, P=2.66 x 10<sup>-10</sup>), an intronic variant in <italic>MICA</italic>, encoding MICA (Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I-like molecule A), a ligand for the NK and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activating immunoreceptor NKG2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] which triggers a cytotoxic response upon ligation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Cell surface release of MICA in a soluble form (sMICA) has been implicated in cancer cell escape from natural killer cell immune surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] and rs3763288 forms a quantitative trait locus for blood sMICA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. To test whether the observed associations with CDR3 K-mers were influenced by V-gene usage, we performed a correlation analysis between CDR3 K-mers and V-gene usage. Whilst no V-genes were associated with TGDSNQP, indicating that this K-mer association is independent of V-gene pairing, TSGDYNE was associated with <italic>TRBV19</italic> (pearson r=0.276, P=9.61 x 10<sup>-6</sup>). We repeated our analysis of <italic>TSGDYNE</italic> against rs3763288 conditioning on <italic>TRBV19</italic> and the association remained significant (<italic>β</italic>=1.01, P=1.06 x 10<sup>-8</sup>), suggesting that whilst TSGDYNE was frequently observed in CDR3 from <italic>TRBV19</italic> containing TCR, the association between TSGDYNE and rs3763288 is not dependent upon <italic>TRBV19</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Refinement of genetic signal at single-cell resolution</title><p id="P15">To validate our associations we performed scRNA-seq with VDJ mapping on T Cells from 59 individuals with melanoma, 55 of whom were also included in the bulk RNA analysis.

We wanted to explore the effect of ICB treatment on potential HLA-V-gene selection. A key strength of the dataset is that most patients had paired CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell samples before and after their first cycle of ICB treatment, allowing us to explore genotype×V-gene usage post-treatment. Focusing on the 179 individuals for which paired samples were available, we sub-divided clones into three groups: those only observed pre-treatment (<italic>Unstable</italic>), those observed post-treatment only (<italic>Novel</italic>), and those present across both samples (<italic>Persistent</italic>). We selected all V-genes that had a significant association with variants in the MHC region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), and extracted the top classical HLA alleles with that V-gene. We define a clone to be HLA-matched if it had both the presence of the associated HLA allele and V-gene. We subsequently calculated the proportion of HLA-matched clones for each individual within each clone group. For the <italic>β</italic> chain, we found that the proportion of HLA matched clones in each individual in the <italic>unstable</italic> group was significantly higher (median = 0.238) than in the <italic>novel</italic> group (median = 0.132, P=0.000436, Wilcoxon test) and <italic>persistent</italic> groups (median = 0.125, P=0.000107, Wilcoxon test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Although the median proportion of HLA-matched clones was higher in the novel compared to persistent group, this was not statistically significant. Similarly for the <italic>α</italic> chain the proportion of HLA-matched clones was also higher in the unstable group than the persistent group (P=0.00229) although there was no significant difference in proportions between unstable and novel groups or between persistent and novel groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The observation that the median proportions of HLA-matched clones is highest in the <italic>unstable</italic> group suggests that, in the context of ICB therapy which acts on exhausted T cells, clones that grow and shrink with treatment - and potentially responding to antigen presentation - are more likely to be HLA-selected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). This is illustrated in the leading <italic>β</italic> chain association between <italic>TRBV19</italic> with HLA-B*44 which was strongest in the unstable and novel groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Cells with HLA matched V-gene demonstrated increased tumor reactivity expression profiles</title><p id="P19">Given that unstable clones are more likely to carry TCRs that demonstrate HLA selection, we sought to determine whether such HLA-selected clones showed evidence of tumor reactivity.

Using V-genes significantly associated with variants in the MHC region, we extracted the top classical HLA allele associated with each V-gene and dichotomized cells according to whether they carried HLA-matched TCRs or not. For each cell, we calculated its TRS and determined the association between TRS and HLA-matching status using a linear model. We showed that HLA-matched pre-ICB CD8<sup>+</sup> cells displayed a significantly increased TRS (<italic>β</italic>=0.0870, P=5.82x10<sup>-4</sup>), in keeping with cancer-related antigenic pressure in these patients. We subsequently explored whether the increased TRS seen in HLA-matched cells were also seen in pre-defined cell subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

To see if this effect was driven by singlet or expanded clones, we tested this association across both categories, finding that the association between TRS and HLA-matching status was confined to cells from expanded clones (singlets: <italic>β</italic>=0.0415, P=0.256, expanded clones: <italic>β</italic>=0.140, P=6.87 x 10<sup>-5</sup>).

We also separated the cells into whether they were singlets or from expanded clones, observing that post-ICB, both singlets and expanded clones demonstrated increased TRS if HLA-matched (singlets: <italic>β</italic>=0.150, P=3.85 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, expanded: <italic>β</italic>=0.130, P=7.18 × 10<sup>−5</sup>).</p><p id="P21">We noted that the strongest association between tumor reactivity and the HLA associated V-genes was observed in CD8 TEM cells before ICB treament and in CD8 TEMRA cells after treatment.

Survival analysis across all patients receiving ICB for metastatic disease (n=231) for which we had pre-treatment samples demonstrated that patients deomstrating carriage of HLA-matched clones prior to treatment had improved overall survival (OS) (P=0.0399, log-rank test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11A</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Similarly, we examined samples for which we had both pre and post-treatment data, finding that that 130/179 patients had HLA-matched clones on at least one of these two time-points.

Notably, analysis of these patients again showed that carriage of HLA matched clones at any time point was associated with improved OS (P=0.0229,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), with a similar effect observed when analysis was confined to those with metastatic melanoma (P=0.0553, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 11B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">Here we present the first analysis of genetic determinants of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in patients with cancer who are undergoing treatment with ICB. We describe associations both in <italic>cis</italic> to the V-genes of <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> TCR chains and <italic>trans</italic> acting associations that map to the MHC and can reduce to individual Class I HLA alleles. As well as describing the relationship between germline variation and the CD8<sup>+</sup> TCR repertoire in patients with cancer, out findings support an interaction between genetic effects on the repertoire and ICB treatment with evidence that this relationship has prognostic implications.</p><p id="P25">Given our phenotype consists of unique flattened clones per individual, providing equal weighting to clones that exist as singlets and those expanded, polymorphisms associated in <italic>cis</italic> to the <italic>TRAV</italic> and <italic>TRBV</italic> genes likely reflect influences on V(D)J recombination propensity of clone that are selected for in that individual. Conversely, <italic>trans</italic> associations between MHC polymorphisms and HLA alleles with V-gene usage are proposed to reflect indirect pressures upon clonal deletion or maintenance through clonal selection via antigen presentation. In health, the drivers of this selection are both central thymic deletion of autoantigen reacting TCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] and peripheral selection of antigen-reactive TCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. In the context of cancer, where the burden of chronic antigen presentation leads to immune exhaustion, and also during ICB treatment, which releases immune checkpoints and favours autoimmunity causing immune related adverse events, our data suggests the major determinant of selection is successful antigen presentation to specific TCR clones. This is supported by the increased strength of association we observe for <italic>de novo</italic> versus persistent clones post ICB, and also the relative strength of associations in CD8<sup>+</sup> TEMRA cells versus CD8<sup>+</sup> Naive cells. Why non-HLA selected clones are more likely to be persistent across ICB treatment is unclear - one possibility being they’re reactive to chronic viral infection and non-exhausted. This likely speaks as to the complex processes in TCR recognition of antigen, versus the availability of specific antigens.</p><p id="P26">Our dataset is unique in that we have pre-treatment as well as post-treatment samples from the same individuals. As such, we are able to evaluate the effect of ICB on cells expressing V-genes that show association with selection to the HLA type of the individual they come from. The relatively small sample set means that only the most significant HLA:TCR V gene relationships are discernible in these data however. Nonetheless, analysis of scRNA-seq data from the same individuals demonstrates that cells carrying TCRs that show association to the HLA of the individual from which they’re obtained display gene expression profiles indicative of increased tumor reactivity compared to HLA-unmatched cells. Notably, this difference is more significant post-ICB treatment, suggesting ICB enhancement of tumor reactivity in these cells. Finally, we are able to show that patients with HLA-matched clones demonstrate increased overall survival, reflecting a direct HLA:TCR selection impact on cancer survival post-ICB.</p><p id="P27">Whilst the paired collection of samples from patients with cancer pre and post ICB means the dataset provides unique insights into the relationship between genotype, ICB treatment and TCR repertoire, we have only characterised the CD8<sup>+</sup> subset. It is recognised that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells also play a role in the ICB induced anti-cancer response, especially with respect to the development of irAEs. Given the relative enrichment of Class II HLA genes with autoimmune phenotypes, future studies exploring the relationship between TCR repertoire and genotype of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in patients with cancer will be of high importance.</p><p id="P28">In conclusion, this is the first study of the germline genetic association of TCR repertoire within cancer patients, showing significant associations at the MHC region with genes that are cancer relevant.

Further to that, we did this analysis separately in unique cells and cells belonging to clones (cells having the same TRA and TRB CDR3).</p><disp-formula id="FD2"><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mtable columnalign="left"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mn mathvariant="italic">1</mml:mn><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mn mathvariant="italic">0</mml:mn><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:math></disp-formula></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS199970-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d68aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS199970-supplement-Supplementary_Tables.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" id="d68aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are very grateful to all patients who contributed samples and participated in the study.
