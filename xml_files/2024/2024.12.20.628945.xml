However, stable genome editing in plants remains limited by the time- and labor-intensive process of generating transgenic plants, as well as by the efficient isolation of desired heritable edits. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the morphogenic regulator <italic>GRF-GIF</italic> on plant regeneration and genome editing outcomes in tomato. We demonstrate that expressing a tomato <italic>GRF-GIF</italic> chimera reliably accelerates the onset of shoot regeneration from callus tissue culture by approximately one month and nearly doubles the number of recovered transgenic plants. Consequently, the <italic>GRF-GIF</italic> chimera enables the recovery of a broader range of edited haplotypes and simplifies the isolation of mutants harboring heritable edits, but without markedly interfering with plant growth and development. Based on these findings, we outline strategies that employ basic or advanced diagnostic pipelines for efficient isolation of single and higher-order mutants in tomato. Our work represents a technical advantage for tomato transformation and genome editing, with potential applications across other Solanaceae species.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The application of genome editing using site-specific nucleases has become routine in many model plants and crops to study gene function. The most common approach to deliver clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated protein (CRISPR-Cas) reagents to plant cells is the stable integration of a transgene that encodes for the site-specific Cas nuclease enzyme and guide RNAs (gRNAs) through <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">B. Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>). However, the stable transformation of plants still presents a limiting factor for genome editing experiments, especially in species that require tissue culture transformation. Laborious and inefficient transformation protocols are a particular bottleneck for advanced editing applications such as base editing, prime editing, gene targeting, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory editing, multiplex editing, and CRISPR screens, which require not only the generation of large cohorts of independent transgenic events but also an efficient and user-friendly approach to analyze and recover desired editing outcomes.</p><p id="P3">For many species, the rate-limiting step is not the transformation of plant cells <italic>per se</italic> but rather the regeneration of viable first-generation (T0) transgenic plants. Expression of morphogenic regulators has been shown to improve plant regeneration in species and genotypes that are recalcitrant to regeneration in tissue culture. A prominent example is the combined expression of BABYBOOM (BBM) and WUSCHEL (WUS) homologs in maize (<italic>Z. mays</italic>) and other monocots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lowe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). WUS is a homeobox transcription factor and key regulator of meristem identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Zuo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), while BBM is a member of the AP2/ERF transcription factor family that plays a crucial role during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boutilier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Ectopic expression of BBM or WUS leads to the formation of somatic embryos and combined expression stimulates growth of embryogenic callus tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boutilier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lowe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Zuo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). However, ectopic BBM and WUS expression has pleiotropic effects including severe changes in plant morphology and reduced fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lowe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Overcoming these detrimental effects requires excision of <italic>BBM</italic> and <italic>WUS</italic> using the Cre/loxP system after stimulation of embryogenic callus formation or the use of tissue and developmental-stage specific promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lowe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P4">More recently, constitutive expression of a chimeric protein composed of the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 4 (GRF4) and its cofactor GRF-INTERACTING FACTOR 1 (GIF1) has been shown to improve regeneration in wheat, rice, and citrus without detrimental effects on plant growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Debernardi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). GRF4 belongs to a family of transcription factors that are deeply conserved across the plant kingdom and act as positive regulators of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Omidbakhshfard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). GRF transcription factors interact with GIF co-activators that enable the formation of a complex with chromatin remodeling factors to regulate cellular growth and organ development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Debernardi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Nelissen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). It was proposed that synthetic <italic>GRF-GIF</italic> chimeras enhance plant regeneration due to its capacity to drive cell proliferation across multiple organs and its role in regulating the transition of stem cells to transit-amplifying cells, which typically undergo rapid cell division to ensure the availability of sufficient cells before differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Debernardi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Rodriguez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">2015</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Since the first report in wheat and citrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Debernardi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>), <italic>GRF-GIF</italic> chimeras have been applied in diverse species to enhance plant regeneration without any documented pleiotropic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bull <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Feng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">J.

However, whether <italic>GRF-GIF</italic> chimeras enhance regeneration in Solanaceae species including tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) has not been tested before. Tomato is an important fruit vegetable crop and acts as a model system for both fundamental and translational research. Efficient protocols for tomato transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">van Eck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>) and CRISPR-Cas genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Brooks <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) have been reported but regeneration efficiency can vary greatly between protocols and experiments. The intense time and labor investment required for tomato transformation, especially compared with the model species Arabidopsis, therefore remains a barrier for many genetic and mechanistic studies, underlining the need to further improve the efficiency of transformation protocols.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we show that ectopic expression of a <italic>S. lycopersicum GRF-GIF</italic> (<italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic>) chimera enhances regeneration efficiency in tomato tissue culture by nearly two-fold while also reducing the time to obtain transgenic plants by approximately four weeks. Our results demonstrate that simultaneous delivery of the SlGRF-GIF complex together with genome editing reagents yields higher mutant haplotype diversity without markedly interfering with heritability or plant development.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Identification of <italic>GRF4</italic> and <italic>GIF1</italic> homologs in tomato</title><p id="P7">To identify <italic>GRF4</italic> and <italic>GIF1</italic> homologs in tomato, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis with GRF and GIF proteins from Arabidopsis, grapevine (<italic>V. vinifera</italic>), citrus (<italic>C. clementina</italic>), rice (<italic>O. sativa</italic>), maize (<italic>Z. mays</italic>) and tomato. Consistent with previous studies in Arabidopsis, we found that tomato GIF proteins grouped into two subclades based on homology to GIF1 and GIF2/GIF3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kim and Kende, 2004</xref>). The two tomato GIF proteins, which clustered closely to GIF1 from Arabidopsis, grapevine and citrus, were named <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> GIF1a (SlGIFa) and SlGIF1b. Both <italic>SlGIF1a</italic> and <italic>SlGIF1b</italic> transcripts were primarily expressed in meristematic tissue with overall higher expression levels for <italic>SlGIF1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1b</xref>). From the 13 annotated tomato GRF (SlGRF) proteins we identified three with high sequence similarity to the GRF4 orthologs from grapevine and citrus, which we named SlGRF4a-c (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Debernardi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). All three <italic>SlGRF4</italic> homologs were primarily expressed in meristematic tissue with similar expression patterns across different stages of meristem maturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1d</xref>). We constructed a chimeric SlGRF4c-SlGIF1a (SlGRF-GIF) protein with an alanine linker according to Debernardi and colleagues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1e</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Debernardi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>), and combined the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> chimera with a parsley <italic>UBIQUITIN</italic> promoter (pPcUbi) and the <italic>Pisum sativum rbcS-3A</italic> gene terminator (Pea3At) in an expression module for the widely used Golden Gate Modular Cloning (MoClo) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Engler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Werner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> improves regeneration efficiency of tomato</title><p id="P8">To determine whether the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> chimera enhances regeneration of tomato plants from tissue culture, we combined the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> chimera with a kanamycin resistance marker (<italic>NptII</italic>) and the visual <italic>RUBY</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). <italic>RUBY</italic> is a synthetic open reading frame encoding three enzymes (CYP76AD1, DODA, and Glucosyltransferase) that catalyze subsequent steps in the synthesis of the red pigment betalain. We introduced the construct into tomato cotyledon explants using <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation. In parallel, we transformed a construct without the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> expression cassette as a control. To assess regeneration efficiency, we quantified the formation of shoots that developed on explants transformed with either the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> or control constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2a-d</xref>). We observed 1.8-fold more shoots on <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> explants (45 shoots) compared with the control (25 shoots) eight weeks after transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), and consistently more shoots on <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> explants throughout the experiment. A similar increase in shoot regeneration from the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> construct became apparent at the transfer to rooting medium. After ten weeks, we observed 1.8-fold more shoots at this step for the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> construct (31 shoots) compared with the control (17 shoots) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Importantly, the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> construct also yielded more rooted regenerants that acclimated on soil. Within the first twelve weeks (3 months), we obtained 8 and 3 rooted regenerants on soil for the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> and the control construct, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In total, we recovered 26 plants from the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> construct and 14 plants from the control before we stopped the experiment after 18 weeks (4.5 months) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Based on these observations, we estimated regeneration efficiency as the number of regenerated plants per number of inoculated explants and found that regeneration efficiency with the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> construct (13%) was 1.9-fold higher compared with the control (7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e,f</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Surprisingly, only 53.8% of <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> regenerants (14/26) and 42.8 % of control regenerants (6/14) developed the red pigmentation that indicates <italic>RUBY</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e,g-h</xref>). In addition, pigmentation intensity varied considerably between T0 individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2e-f</xref>). We reasoned that regenerants without the red pigmentation may represent failed transformation events that escaped antibiotic selection and, therefore, tested for the genomic integration of the <italic>RUBY</italic> coding sequence by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i-j</xref>). However, only two control (T0-5 and T0-9) and a single <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> transformant (T0-7) tested negative for <italic>RUBY</italic> while all other green plants carried the transgene. We concluded that the high fraction of transgenics without visible <italic>RUBY</italic> activity was likely due to silencing of the <italic>RUBY</italic> transgene. Importantly, overexpression of <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> did not obviously interfere with plant growth and development, and we obtained T1 seeds from nearly all plants except some with strong <italic>RUBY</italic> coloration. This initial experiment suggested that the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> chimera can be used to increase regeneration frequency in tomato, and in turn, the number of confirmed transgenic events.</p><p id="P10">To determine whether the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> chimera reliably enhances regeneration, we evaluated eight independent transformation experiments with and without <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> that we performed over the course of two and a half years. Within the first twelve weeks (3 months) after transformation, we obtained on average 0.25 and 15 regenerants on soil for the control and <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> transformations, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref>). Remarkably, transformations with <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> yielded the first five regenerated plants on average 34 days earlier than the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1l</xref>), and a similar trend was observed for the first 10 and 15 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1m</xref>). We also noted that fewer control transformations produced at least 10 or 15 plants compared with <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> transformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1m</xref>). These results demonstrate that <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> consistently enhances shoot regeneration and shortens the time to obtain regenerated plants on soil by approximately four weeks.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> streamlines the production of CRISPR-Cas mutants</title><p id="P11">Next, we tested whether the combination of the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> chimera and the <italic>RUBY</italic> reporter can simplify the generation of tomato mutants by CRISPR-Cas mutagenesis. We speculated that intensity of <italic>RUBY</italic> coloration could be used as a proxy for the expression of transgenes from the T-DNA, and thus indirectly for Cas9 expression and mutagenic activity. This could allow the selection of red transgenics during early stages of the transformation process to reduce the number of transformants for molecular analyses. We constructed a binary acceptor construct containing <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic>, <italic>RUBY</italic>, the Cas9 nuclease, and an array of three gRNAs to target the florigen-encoding <italic>SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS</italic> (<italic>SFT</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lifschitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3a</xref>). Within 14 weeks (3.5 months), we recovered 13 regenerants on soil, however, four plants (31%) did not develop the red pigmentation although the transgene was confirmed by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,c</xref>). We also PCR-amplified the <italic>SFT</italic> target region for quick and easy detection of Cas9-induced DNA lesions on agarose gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). DNA lesions were clearly visible in most transgenics, but they were not reliably indicated by the red pigmentation from <italic>RUBY</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). In fact, Sanger sequencing of target amplicons revealed mutation rates of at least 75% in each transgenic plant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), and confirmed homozygous edits in two individuals (T0-6 and T0-10) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3b</xref>). We also asked whether <italic>RUBY</italic> activity correlated with phenotypic changes expected from the Cas9-induced mutations and scored plants that developed <italic>sft</italic> mutant inflorescences, which are single-flowered or revert to vegetative growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lifschitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In addition, we scored T0 plants that reverted from determinate to indeterminate shoot growth due reduced <italic>SFT</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Krieger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3c-d</xref>). Supporting the high mutation rates detected by Sanger sequencing, we observed strong <italic>sft</italic> mutant phenotypes in 69-77 % of the T0 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S3c-d</xref>). However, the changes were not obviously associated with <italic>RUBY</italic> coloration. For example, the green <italic>sft<sup>CR</sup></italic>-4 individual developed the characteristic <italic>sft</italic> single-flowered truss while the inflorescences of the red <italic>sft<sup>CR</sup></italic>-5 individual were indistinguishable from the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In conclusion, we could not exploit <italic>RUBY</italic> as a proxy for Cas9 activity or the frequency of Cas9-induced mutations, most likely due to silencing of the <italic>RUBY</italic> transgene. We also observed that strong <italic>RUBY</italic> coloration negatively affected plant growth and fertility, and most plants with strong red pigmentation failed to set seed. Such side effects from betalain overproduction have been reported in tomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>), and it remains to be tested whether weaker or tissue-specific promoters allow to establish <italic>RUBY</italic> as reliable selection marker in tomato. Nevertheless, the SlGRF-GIF fusion protein did not obviously interfere with CRISPR-Cas activity as mutant phenotypes could be observed at high frequency in the first (T0) generation of transgenics.</p><p id="P13">To test whether enhanced plant regeneration from <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> could improve the isolation of higher-order mutants by CRISPR-Cas, we generated constructs with and without <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> to simultaneously target the MADS-box transcription factor genes <italic>JOINTLESS2</italic> (<italic>J2</italic>) and <italic>ENHANCER OF J2</italic> (<italic>EJ2</italic>) with two gRNAs per target gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4a,d</xref>). Individual mutation of <italic>J2</italic> and <italic>EJ2</italic> affect the development of fruit abscission zones and sepals, respectively, while simultaneous mutation of <italic>J2</italic> and <italic>EJ2</italic> causes strong inflorescence branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Soyk et al., 2017</xref>). Eight weeks after transformation, we observed that explants transformed with the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> construct produced 1.9-fold more shoots than the control explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). The <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> construct also extended the duration of shoot regeneration, which resulted in 2.2-fold more shoots (53 versus 24) by the end of the experiment after 15 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>) and translated to shoot regeneration efficiencies of 24% and 8% for the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> and the control experiment, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). The <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> experiment also yielded more shoots for the transfer to rooting medium during weeks 8-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f,g</xref>), which increased the total number of shoots on rooting medium from 19 to 40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>) and enhanced regeneration efficiency at this step from 8% to 16% compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>). However, only 5 and 13 shoots rooted successfully for the control and <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> transformations, respectively, corresponding to a regeneration efficiency of 2.0% and 5.3% at the plant level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3k,l</xref>). We reasoned that this relatively low regeneration rate may be due to the fact that <italic>J2</italic> and <italic>EJ2</italic> are regulators of meristem development. Interestingly, all 13 rooted <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> regenerants developed branched (compound) inflorescences that are characteristic of <italic>j2ej2</italic> double mutants whereas only 40% (2/5) of the control regenerants displayed the double mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3j,k</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To identify T0 individuals that contain loss-of-function haplotypes at high frequency, we genotyped the gRNA target sites in <italic>J2</italic> and <italic>EJ2</italic> using amplicon sequencing and called haplotypes with the SMAP-package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Develtere <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Schaumont <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). As expected for chimeric T0 plants, we detected genotypes that ranged from genetic mosaics to biallelic and homozygous edits for both <italic>J2</italic> and <italic>EJ2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4c,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> experiment yielded a larger number of unique haplotypes for both targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4c,f</xref>). For <italic>J2</italic>, we detected three unique mutant haplotypes in the control and 18 in the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> regenerants. Similarly, for <italic>EJ2</italic>, we identified six unique haplotypes in the control and 20 in the <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> regenerants. However, the most abundant haplotypes for both genes were identical between experiments. For <italic>J2</italic>, this haplotype contained a 95 bp deletion, while the most abundant <italic>EJ2</italic> haplotype was the unmodified wild-type (WT) sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S4c,f</xref>).

The expression of morphogenic regulators during tissue culture has been shown to boost plant regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Debernardi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lowe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Maher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). In this study, we evaluated the emerging morphogenic regulator GRF-GIF complex to enhance regeneration and streamline CRISPR-Cas experiments in tomato, a widely used model system for fundamental and translational research. Expression of a tomato <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> chimera significantly enhanced regeneration of transgenic tomato plants from cotyledon tissue culture. The chimeric protein reliably increased the efficiency of shoot regeneration by nearly two-fold and shortened the time to obtain transgenic plants by approximately four weeks, thereby reducing the time and labor investment for tissue culture.

Still, pleiotropic effects could be minimized by inducible or tissue-specific expression of <italic>SlGRF-GIF</italic> during early stages of plant regeneration.

Second, the production of larger populations of transgenic plants is simplified, which becomes especially important when applying precision editing tools with low efficiency, editing <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions to obtain very specific alleles, employing multiplex editing, or performing CRISPR screening. Third, the production of transgenic plants becomes more robust and reproducible, which enables research teams that are not specialized in plant transformation to reliably produce sufficient numbers of transgenic events in a timely manner.</p><p id="P21">Designing genome editing experiments to generate stable mutant lines requires careful consideration of the number of target genes, the genetic interactions to be explored (such as single or higher-order mutants), and the desired number of independent alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6</xref>). These parameters determine the number of independent transformants to be generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Van Huffel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>), which will inform both the genotyping and gRNA design. In low-throughput experiments, such as producing single loss-of-function mutants, the induction of large lesions allows low-input genotyping by PCR and agarose gels. When multiplex editing or precise small changes are desired, such as base edits or the disruption of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, next-generation sequencing-based genotyping becomes the method of choice. Here, rapid identification of haplotype sequences and frequencies in the T0 generation provides early insights into the overall editing outcome. In addition, it allows the selection of individuals with desired haplotype sequences at high frequency, which can be fixed in the next generation.
