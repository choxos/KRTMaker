MtDNA mutations can cause diseases, yet whether they increase with age in human germline cells—oocytes—remains understudied. Here, using highly accurate duplex sequencing of full-length mtDNA, we detected <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in single oocytes, blood, and saliva in women between 20 and 42 years of age. We found that, with age, mutations increased in blood and saliva but not in oocytes. In oocytes, mutations with high allele frequencies (%1%) were less prevalent in coding than non-coding regions, whereas mutations with low allele frequencies (&lt;1%) were more uniformly distributed along mtDNA, suggesting frequency-dependent purifying selection. In somatic tissues, mutations caused elevated amino acid changes in protein-coding regions, suggesting positive or destructive selection. Thus, mtDNA in human oocytes is protected against accumulation of mutations having functional consequences and with aging. These findings are particularly timely as humans tend to reproduce later in life.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F5" position="anchor"><label>Graphic abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS202029-f005"/></fig></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Mitochondria are organelles that have a multitude of functions central to the eukaryotic cell, including the production of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation, response to intrinsic and extrinsic stress by inducing metabolic signaling, etc. <sup>reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Mitochondrial dysfunction manifests itself in diverse and frequently multi-systemic diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. How mitochondrial diseases originate is of great interest to the biomedical community.</p><p id="P4">Mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent diseases are caused in part by mutations in the mitochondrial genome, i.e., mtDNA reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, a 16.6-kb long circular double-stranded DNA with 37 genes encoding 13 proteins, 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Many other mitochondrial genes are located in the nuclear genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. In contrast to nuclear DNA, with each chromosome usually present in two copies in somatic cells and one copy in germline cells, mtDNA is present in hundreds to thousands of copies in somatic cells (e.g., a median mtDNA copy number of 127 was measured in whole blood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>) and &gt;100,000 copies in mature oocytes <sup>reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Human mtDNA is thought to be inherited exclusively through the maternal lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Examining whether germline mutation frequency increases with age is highly relevant to modern societies in which reproduction later in life has become common. Whereas parental age has been linked to an increase in the frequency of germline mutations <italic>in the nucleus</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, the effect of maternal age on germline mutations <italic>in mtDNA</italic> has been debated. Pedigree studies have suggested an increased mtDNA mutation frequency in children born to older mothers <sup>e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>; however, post-fertilization selection might have affected them. Indeed, without the direct analysis of oocytes, we cannot ascertain whether an increased frequency of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in the offspring is due to enhanced mutagenesis and selection in oocytes in older mothers vs. due to post-fertilization selection in children born to older mothers.</p><p id="P6">Whereas mtDNA mutations have been analyzed in human somatic tissues in detail <sup>e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, the direct examination of mtDNA mutations in human oocytes has been challenging due to methodological limitations. Most previous studies either focused on particular mtDNA sites <sup>e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> or used sequencing methods with high error rates <sup>e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>Using a low-error duplex sequencing approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, we have recently shown that mutations across the whole mtDNA increase with age in <italic>mouse</italic> oocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Using the same approach, we have demonstrated that mtDNA mutations increase in <italic>macaque</italic> oocytes until ~9 years of age and do not increase afterward <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Importantly, we still do not know definitively whether the frequency of <italic>de novo</italic> mtDNA mutations increases with age in <italic>human</italic> oocytes.</p><p id="P7">To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed mtDNA substitution mutations in single oocytes, blood, and saliva from women of different ages. We used the highly accurate duplex sequencing method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, which we had previously modified to generate high-quality mtDNA sequences directly from single oocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We obtained a comprehensive set of mutations to study the impact of age on frequencies of germline and somatic mutations, as well as on their distribution across mtDNA. We identified genetic variant hotspots and analyzed the effect of selection on the mutational landscape. In addition, we separately analyzed inheritable heteroplasmies—variants present in at least one oocyte and all somatic tissues assayed, and therefore likely already segregating in the germline during oogenesis. This allowed us to estimate the size of the effective germline bottleneck occurring in the oocyte lineage prior to fertilization and embryogenesis. Thus, we present a direct analysis of mtDNA variants in the female germ line, unraveling their dynamics depending on age and allele frequency.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Duplex sequencing and mutation detection</title><p id="P8">To study the role of age in germline and somatic mtDNA mutation accumulation in humans, we generated high-quality, full-length mtDNA sequences for 22 women (mainly of European ancestry) ranging in age from 20 to 42 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>).

By barcoding each double-stranded sequencing template prior to DNA amplification during library preparation, duplex sequencing separates true DNA variants from PCR errors arising during library preparation and from sequencing errors. This is achieved by first forming consensus sequences for reads originating from each of the two template strands separately, i.e., <italic>single-strand consensus sequences (SSCSs)</italic>, which still contain some PCR errors and artifacts resulting from DNA lesions, and next by forming a consensus of the two SSCSs, i.e., <italic>duplex consensus sequence (DCS)</italic>, where the errors and artifacts are eliminated. We followed the protocol we previously developed for enriched mtDNA in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Briefly, the samples were enriched for circular mtDNA with the exonuclease V digestion of linear nuclear DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). The remaining DNA was sheared, sequenced with short (250-nt) paired-end reads, and analyzed with the Du Novo software <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> to form DCSs (see <bold>Methods</bold> for details). We achieved a median mtDNA enrichment of 85.4%, 0.7%, and 4.0%, and a median DCS depth of 1,440×, 78×, and 158×, per site per sample for single oocytes, blood, and saliva, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1AB</xref>), with a rather uniform DCS depth across the mtDNA length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). The DCSs were mapped to the human reference genome including nuclear DNA and mtDNA, and only alignments with the best match to the mtDNA were retained (see <bold>Methods</bold> for details). At 219 different mtDNA positions, we identified fixed differences from the reference (supported by all DCSs in all tissues studied for an individual), with 8-40 such sites per individual (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Additionally, we called <italic>variants</italic>—sites with nucleotides different from those present in most DCSs for a sample (see <bold>Methods</bold>).</p><p id="P10">Across all samples studied, we identified 4,643 variants. Among them, we detected and analyzed separately (see below) 148 <italic>inheritable heteroplasmies</italic> (i.e., variants present in all somatic tissues assessed and %1 oocyte of a donor). From the remaining variants, we filtered out (a) 146 variants with ambiguous timing of occurrence during development (i.e., representing potential inheritable heteroplasmies, early somatic mutations, or early germline mutations; see <bold>Methods</bold>); (b) 539 variants present at the beginning or the end of long homopolymer runs (representing potential read mapping errors); (c) 222 linked variants (with &gt;3 variants present in single paired-end reads mostly occurring in multiple unrelated samples, representing potential regions of nuclear DNA that are homologous to mtDNA, or Numts); and (d) 63 low-confidence variants present in oocytes with a mean DCS depth &lt;50× (this way we excluded variants from 2 oocytes, but were still able to retain variants from 1 to 5 oocytes per woman). As a result, we obtained 3,525 high-confidence tissue-specific <italic>de novo mutations</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To study the frequencies and patterns of <italic>de novo</italic> mutations and inheritable heteroplasmies depending on age, we assigned the studied women to three age groups of approximately equal size: (1) young (20-29 years; 8 women; 28 single oocytes), (2) intermediate (30-34 years; 6 women; 25 single oocytes), and (3) old (35-42 years; 8 women; 27 single oocytes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). The distribution of 3,525 <italic>de novo</italic> mutations among the age groups and tissues is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3</xref>. Most <italic>de novo</italic> mutations (3,051) were each measured in a single DCS, and thus had low Minor Allele Frequencies (MAFs). A total of 247 <italic>de novo</italic> mutations (69, 108, and 70 in oocytes, blood, and saliva, respectively) had a MAF %1%, a common cutoff for mtDNA mutation detection in other studies <sup>e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. A total of 184 of them were supported by single DCSs, and for these mutations high MAFs likely resulted from low sample sequencing depth. To alleviate this potential limitation, we also identified <italic>de novo mutations</italic> (and later also inheritable heteroplasmies<italic>) with high-confidence MAFs</italic> as those supported by %3 DCSs (allowing a more reliable MAF estimation). A total of 64 of 247 (59, 3, and 2 in oocytes, blood, and saliva, respectively) <italic>de novo</italic> mutations satisfied this criterion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Because these mutations are tissue-specific, they likely rose to high frequencies due to clonal expansions.

To study the effect of age on mutation frequency, we built a generalized mixed-effects linear model considering each individual and each tissue separately (each oocyte was also considered separately; see <bold>Methods</bold>), following our approach in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The model predicted the probability of having a mutation at a site as a function of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) and included the mutation frequency as a response, the number of sequenced nucleotides per sample (i.e., sequencing depth per site) as weight, and age, tissue, and their interactions as fixed-effect predictors. The donor ID was used as a random effect. The model indicated a significant increase in mutation frequency with age in blood, a marginally significant increase in saliva, and no difference in oocytes (Z-test <italic>p</italic>=2.7×10<sup>-3</sup>, <italic>p</italic>=5.7×10<sup>-2</sup>, and <italic>p</italic>=0.688 for blood, saliva, and oocytes, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref>).

This provided a detailed picture of the mtDNA mutational frequency and landscape in oocytes. Due to methodological limitations, previous studies <sup>e.g. summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> considered only mtDNA variants with frequencies %1% (or even higher). This rather high MAF cutoff is particularly problematic for oocytes. Indeed, due to the very high copy number in human oocytes (~100,000 on average) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, even for a variant observed at a MAF of 1%, ~1,000 mtDNA molecules would be affected in a single cell.</p><p id="P34">Therefore, very low frequency variants can have considerable impact on mitochondrial function and be substantially affected by selection—yet they were excluded from most previous studies.</p><sec id="S15"><title>Age does not increase mtDNA mutations in human oocytes</title><p id="P35">Analyzing women ranging in age from 20 to 42 years, both based on individual age and on age groups, we did not observe an increase in mutation frequency in the oocytes in older women. This differs from what we observed using the same methods (i.e. duplex sequencing) in mouse oocytes, where we found ~2-fold higher mutation frequencies in 10-month-old compared to ~1-month-old mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. However, for rhesus macaques, again using the same methods, we found that mutation frequencies in oocytes increased only until the age of ~9 years and not further <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (as rhesus macaques age approximately three times faster than humans, ~9 years equivalent to ~27 years for humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>). This suggests that oocytes of older macaques maintain the quality of their mtDNA, which might be also true for humans. Since our samples were obtained from women undergoing IVF treatments, the age of donors was limited to 20-42—a subset of the human female reproductive life span (~13 to ~50 years <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, with fertility peaking around age 24 and diminishing after 30 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>). We therefore cannot exclude the possibility of an increase in mtDNA mutations at an earlier age in humans, similar to what we observed in macaques, sampled by us starting from the age of 1 year (equivalent to ~7 years in humans). Further studies including younger women will be required to study such a potential early age effect. Furthermore, increased mtDNA mutations may occur at more advanced age, however, mitochondria with a high number of deleterious mutations might be removed by mitophagy <sup>reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, or oocytes with high mtDNA mutational load might be eliminated by follicular atresia <sup>reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P36">Results from previous studies directly assessing mtDNA mutation increases in human oocytes have been contradictory and might have been affected by PCR and sequencing errors, as no previous studies used highly accurate duplex sequencing.

The strong strand bias we observed for G&gt;A over C&gt;T and for T&gt;C over A&gt;G on the reference L-strand—especially outside of the D-loop—is consistent with a high incidence of C&gt;T and A&gt;G mutations occurring on the H-strand.

This high incidence of mutations on the H-strand might be explained by its single-stranded status during the initial stages of replication (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>), which facilitates DNA damage, potentially accounting for the nucleotide content differences between the H- and L-strands (the H-strand is guanine- and thymine-rich).

As somatic cells from older women have undergone more cycles of replication and hence spent more time in a single-stranded state, our observation of A&gt;G/T&gt;C transitions being the only mutation type with a significant age-associated increase in blood, coupled with increased strand bias in older women, indicates a contribution of replication to their age-associated mutagenesis. Furthermore, our observation of higher rates of C&gt;T/G&gt;A transitions at CpG than non-CpG sites in somatic tissues suggests a role of spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> in mtDNA mutagenesis, despite controversial reports regarding CpG methylation in mtDNA e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>.

In agreement with this, we observed high prevalence of disease-associated mutations, suggesting positive or destructive selection acting on these sites, especially in somatic tissues.</p><p id="P44">Furthermore, high-frequency inheritable heteroplasmies were observed in a higher proportion of women as compared to the proportion of oocytes, which is indicative of positive selection in somatic tissues, and leads to increases in the MAFs of variants. Indeed, 54.5% of women in our study carried an inheritable heteroplasmy measured at a MAF %1% (in blood and/or saliva), which is in agreement with previously reported figures for mothers (47.8%) and offspring (42.5%) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. In contrast, only 35.0% of all oocytes we assessed carried a heteroplasmy above this MAF threshold. This is also in agreement with our observation that, lowering the MAF, one finds higher numbers of inheritable heteroplasmies in oocytes compared to somatic tissues. MAFs measured in somatic tissues might increase with age, leading to more high-frequency variants in older people. In line with this, Liu and colleagues reported higher numbers of high-frequency variants (MAF%1%) in somatic cells of older vs. younger mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>The effective germline bottleneck size depends on mutation frequency</title><p id="P45">By studying inheritable heteroplasmies in oocytes, we were able to estimate the size of the effective germline mtDNA bottleneck directly in human germ cells, resulting in an estimate that is not affected by age-related genetic drift in somatic tissues. Furthermore, the use of highly accurate duplex sequencing allowed us to include in the estimation heteroplasmies with MAFs &lt;1%. Considering all inheritable heteroplasmies, we estimated the effective germline bottleneck size to be ~909 segregating units (CI: 0.47-5,329.73). Considering only heteroplasmic sites for which at least one sample had MAF%1%, we estimated a bottleneck size of ~30 segregating units (CI: 0.02-178.53). This is similar to previous estimates in humans ranging between ~3-32 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> using MAF cutoffs of 1% or higher. In fact the study using the highest MAF cutoff (only including heteroplasmies with MAFs between 10% and 90%) yielded the smallest bottleneck size estimate of around 3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The similarity between our bottleneck size estimates based directly on oocytes and prior estimates based on pedigrees suggests that the calculation is only negligibly affected by genetic drift in somatic tissues. Differences in bottleneck size estimates depending on MAF cutoffs suggest differences in selective pressure acting on variants with different frequencies. Considering the organization of multiple mtDNA copies in individual mitochondria and cells, selection likely has a different impact when a larger proportion of mtDNA molecules are affected, which is the case for variants at higher MAFs. Note that wide, overlapping confidence intervals have to be considered in these comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Germline mtDNA mutation rate estimates</title><p id="P46">To compare germline mutation rate estimates between our study and prior ones, we computed a germline mutation rate of 3.95×10<sup>-4</sup> (95% CI 2.68-5.60×10<sup>-4</sup>) mutations per position per generation for the D-loop, including only <italic>de novo</italic> mutations measured at MAF≥%1. This is about 5× higher than a previous estimate by Wei and colleagues based on a pedigree analysis using a similar MAF cutoff<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.

The enzymatic digestion of linear nuclear DNA, the comparatively long fragments after shearing, and the relatively high read length during sequencing, as well as retaining only reads mapping to mtDNA, all minimize the contribution from Numts to our mutation dataset. Moreover, while we cannot completely exclude their contribution, Numts should affect each woman similarly and not bias our comparison of mutations between the three age groups. Considering the efficient enrichment of mtDNA molecules in oocytes (on average, 86.1% of all DCS reads represented mtDNA sequences), we do not expect Numts to impact any interpretations considerably. Furthermore, when inferring MAFs of inheritable heteroplasmies, their frequencies were often based on small numbers of measured variants at a position in a sample. While due to the low error rate of duplex sequencing we can be confident that the variant is present in a sample, MAFs might be over- or underestimated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S23"><title>Study participant details, samples, and their handling</title><p id="P48">All parts of this study were designed and conducted in compliance with the relevant regulations regarding the use of human study participants, and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

For the vast majority of patients (n=19, 86.4%) this was done using a short antagonist protocol, while three patients were treated with a long agonist regimen. On average, women were stimulated with 1,913 (±777) IU of purified (Menopur, Ferring; Fostimon, IBSA) or recombinant FSH (Puregon, MSD) and stimulation took 11 (± 2) days.

We define variant hotspots as mutations that are shared by multiple donors, but are not expected to be shared by chance (168 mutations were shared in oocytes and 161 mutations were shared in somatic tissues). Blood and saliva were considered together as ‘somatic tissues’ due to similar mutation frequencies and lower numbers of measured mutations, hence increasing our power to detect somatic variant hotspots. For the evaluation of oocyte variant hotspots, we also considered the number of sequenced oocytes per donor (ranging from 1 to 5).</p><p id="P68">In short, we built a probabilistic model that takes into account tissue-specific estimates of the average mutation frequencies inside and outside of the D-loop, as well as the mean DCS depth in each sample. We computed the expected number of mutations present in exactly one woman and shared by several women, separately for oocytes and somatic tissues. As a result, we defined oocyte variant hotspots as sites mutated in oocytes of at least four different women, and somatic hotspots as sites mutated in somatic tissues of at least three different women.</p></sec><sec id="S37"><title>Annotation of disease-associated variants</title><p id="P69">Mutations known to be associated with diseases were annotated based on the 109 disease-associated confirmed substitutions reported by MITOMAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (downloaded on June 18, 2024).

For somatic tissues, in addition to exonuclease V mtDNA enriched sequencing libraries, we included duplex libraries enriched for mtDNA using a targeted capture approach. Though such samples harbor the chance of Numt co-enrichment, the sole assessment of variants previously identified in donors using Exonuclease V mtDNA enrichment diminishes such bias. This increased the average SSCS sequencing depth from 445× and 514× to 3,750× (n=18, SD=824.6) and 5,019× (n=11, SD=1,864.1) per site per sample in blood and saliva, respectively.
