Colonic crypts are surrounded by a network of fibroblasts essential for various functions, including the production and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), supporting the epithelial stem cell niche, and promoting the differentiation of epithelial cells. Recent studies indicate that fibroblasts are not a homogeneous cell population. However, differences in nomenclature and a lack of exact markers hindered their classification and functional understanding. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify six distinct fibroblast subpopulations in mouse colonic mucosa, each with unique molecular signatures and functional specialization. Our analysis reveals that some fibroblasts are primarily involved in ECM production and remodeling, while others exhibit high contractility. Additionally, a subset of fibroblasts produces cytokines that promote epithelial cell differentiation, whereas another group secrete cytokines essential for maintaining the epithelial stem cell niche. We also map the spatial distribution of these fibroblast subpopulations within the colonic mucosa. Differentiation trajectory analysis suggests distinct pathways for fibroblast differentiation, while cell cycle scoring reveals that fibroblasts do not proliferate under homeostatic conditions. Furthermore, we integrated our scRNA-seq data with previously published datasets to identify common fibroblast populations and propose a standardized nomenclature for intestinal fibroblasts. This unified framework aims to improve communication within the research community and enhance understanding of fibroblast roles in gut homeostasis and gastrointestinal diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F6" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><caption><p id="P3">Illustations: Neda Glisovic (@neda.sciart)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201988-f006"/></fig></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The gastrointestinal system consists primarily of the small intestine and colon. Whereas the epithelium aligns villi and crypts in the small intestine, significantly longer crypts in the colon descend into the stroma (<italic>lamina propria</italic>) beneath and reach the first muscle layer (<italic>muscularis mucosae</italic>). At the base of the crypts reside stem cells, perpetually dividing to give rise to transit-amplifying (TA) cells that further differentiate into specialized cell types, including absorptive enterocytes and secretory cells such as goblet, enteroendocrine, and Tuft cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Underlying the epithelial cells’ basal side lies the basement membrane, a thin, dense sheet-like structure composed of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as laminin and collagen IV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The basement membrane facilitates epithelial cell adhesion and separates the epithelium from the stroma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.

The lack of precise localization, consistent roles, and a single marker for cell population identification complicates the study of subepithelial fibroblasts, resulting in varied nomenclature and confusion. Here, we summarize the characteristics of known intestinal fibroblast populations and propose distinct nomenclature to establish consensus within the field.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Distinct subpopulations of fibroblasts in the colonic mucosa</title><p id="P7">To investigate fibroblast populations in the colonic <italic>lamina propria</italic>, we dissected colons from αSMA:CreER<sup>T2</sup>; R26<sup>mT/mG</sup> mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, mechanically discarded the muscle layers, sorted live cells, and performed single-cell RNA sequencing. In this mouse model, all cells have red membranes except for cells where the αSMA promoter is active (thus conventional myofibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>). Their membranes appear green (EGFP+). To broadly target fibroblast populations, we applied bioinformatics gene-expression filters, selecting cells expressing Vimentin, not expressing H2-Ab1 (MHCII<sup>+</sup> immune cells) and Krt8 (thus colonic epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>) and with mitochondrial gene expression ≤20% to exclude potentially damaged cells for more reliable downstream analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This approach allowed us to delineate six distinct subpopulations of fibroblasts, denoted as clusters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, these encompassed three subpopulations of EGFP+ cells, located in clusters 2, 3, and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B, D</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To ascertain unique molecular signatures for each fibroblast subpopulation, we calculated the best markers for each population (logFC=1, genes expressed in at least 75% of cells, with p_val_adj &lt;= 0.05), and visualized their expression by generating a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). This approach allowed us to identify genes prominently expressed in a particular cluster while showing low or negligible expression in others. We delineated distinct molecular signatures for all clusters except cluster 1. In particular, a combination of a few markers was sufficient to distinguish those clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Clusters 0 and 5 were characterized by high expression of <italic>Cd34</italic>, with a notable absence of <italic>Egfp</italic>. They could be further distinguished by the expression of <italic>Pi16</italic> (Cluster 0) or <italic>Clu</italic> (Cluster 5).</p><p id="P9">In contrast, clusters 2, 3, and 4 expressed <italic>Egfp</italic> and lacked <italic>Cd34</italic>. They could be further distinguished by the expression of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> and low expression of <italic>Acta2</italic> (coding for αSMA <italic>-</italic> alpha-smooth muscle actin<italic>)</italic> (Cluster 2), high expression of <italic>Acta2</italic> (Cluster 3) and high expression of <italic>Acta2</italic> in addition to <italic>Des</italic> (desmin, an intermediate filament protein) (Cluster 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Cluster 1 presented a challenge as it lacked specific markers that could distinctly differentiate it from the other clusters. It exhibits varied expression levels of all the genes that characterize other clusters, suggesting its transitional nature. Thus, it was excluded from functional analysis.</p><p id="P10">In the subsequent analysis phase, we used the capabilities of g: Profiler <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, an extensive webserver dedicated to functional enrichment analysis. Specifically, we employed g:GOSt within this platform, which compares a custom list of genes provided by the user against various established functional information sources, including Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Reactome, and WikiPathways (WP) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 1</xref> for the analysis links). g:GOSt identifies statistically significant biological processes, pathways, regulatory motifs, and protein complexes. It encompasses three biological concepts: Biological Process (BP), Molecular Function (MF), and Cellular Component (CC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. For this analysis, we generated gene lists for each cluster, setting the <italic>log.fc</italic> of gene expression to 0.5, and selected only up-regulated genes in each cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Analysis showed that <bold>Cluster 0</bold> (<italic>Egfp</italic><sup>-</sup>, <italic>Cd34</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>Pi16</italic><sup>+</sup>) consists of cells enriched for GO terms such as “Extracellular region” (GO:0005576), “Extracellular matrix structural constituent” (GO:0005201), but also “BMP signaling pathway” (GO:0030509). This cluster had a high level of expression of the main constituents of the basement membrane and ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Moreover, a proportion of cells of this cluster expressed high levels of canonical Wnt molecule, <italic>Wnt2</italic>, as well as <italic>Grem2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). This suggests that Cluster 0 is involved in the secretion and maintenance of the basement membrane and ECM, as well as the regulation of the epithelial stem cell niche. <bold>Cluster 5</bold> (<italic>Egfp, Cd34</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>Clu</italic><sup>+</sup>) consists of cells enriched for GO terms such as “Extracellular region” (GO:0005576), “Developmental process” (GO:0032502), “Cell adhesion” (GO:0007155). This cluster was similar to Cluster 0 and, in addition, was characterized by the production of <italic>Wnt4</italic>. Interestingly, clusters 0 and 5 produce <italic>Bmp1</italic>, which mediates the cleavage of pro-collagens and facilitates the assembly of fibrilar collagens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P12"><bold>Cluster 2</bold> (<italic>Egfp</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>CD34</italic><sup>-</sup>, <italic>Acta2</italic><sup><italic>low</italic></sup>, <italic>Des</italic><sup>-</sup>) consists of cells enriched for GO terms such as “Extracellular region” (GO:0005576), “Anatomical structure morphogenesis” (Go:0009653), “Extracellular matrix structural constituent” (GO:0005201). Compared to Cluster 1, it contained lower levels of ECM and basement membrane protein transcripts. In addtion to <italic>Col4a1, Col4a2, Lama4, Lama2, Lamb1, Lamc1</italic> that were also expressed in Clusters 0 and 5, <italic>Col4a5, Col4a6, Col12a1</italic> were specifically elevated in Cluster 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Cluster 2 also expressed high levels of many BMP transcipts (<italic>Bmp2, Bmp3, Bmp4, Bmp5</italic> and <italic>Bmp7</italic>) as well as non-canonical Wnt, <italic>Wnt5a</italic>. This suggests that Cluster 2 plays a role in epithelial differentiation and ECM production. <bold>Cluster 3</bold> (<italic>Egfp</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>, <italic>CD34</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup>, <italic>Acta2</italic><sup><italic>high</italic></sup>, <italic>Des</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup>) was enriched in the following GO terms: “Actin cytoskeleton” (GO:0015629), “Tissue development: (GO:0009888), and “Contractile fiber” (GO:0043292). It expressed high levels of contractility genes, such as myosins and tropomyosins, indicating that Cluster 3 are highly contractile cells. <bold>Cluster 4</bold> (<italic>Egfp</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>, <italic>CD34</italic><sup><italic>-</italic></sup>, <italic>Acta2</italic><sup><italic>high</italic></sup>, <italic>Des</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup>) consists of cells that are highly enriched for GO terms “Muscle structure development” (GO:0061061). The presence of desmin suggests this cluster is more similar to smooth muscle cells and pericytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Overall, this analysis indicates that, consistent with previous observations, subepithelial fibroblasts express genes involved in ECM remodeling and cytokines that regulate the fate of epithelial cells, including stemness, proliferation, and differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. However, these functions were distributed across different clusters, suggesting a specialization of fibroblasts for specific roles. For instance, Clusters 0 and 5 primarily focused on ECM production, while Clusters 3 and 4 showed high expression of genes related to contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). This specialization is noteworthy because fibroblasts typically perform both functions simultaneously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Additionally, there was a functional division in the production of BMP/Wnt molecules. Cluster 2 mainly contributed to the production of BMPs, indicating a role in epithelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, Clusters 0 and 5 appeared to support the maintenance of the epithelial stem cell niche by producing Wnt molecules and BMP antagonists.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Spatial organization of fibroblast subpopulations in the colon mucosa</title><p id="P14">Despite the wealth of studies on the diversity and heterogeneity of gut fibroblasts, a comprehensive understanding of the spatial distribution and visualization of various fibroblast types remains elusive. Questions about where different populations localize and whether this localization correlates with their functional roles remain to be further investigated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. To address this, we performed multicolor imaging, which enabled us to visualize and spatially map different fibroblast subpopulations identified in our RNA sequencing analysis.</p><p id="P15">The initial step in distinguishing between clusters involved identifying cells as either EGFP<sup>+</sup> or CD34<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). In EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells, we assessed the expression of αSMA protein derived from the <italic>Acta2</italic> gene. Cells exhibiting low αSMA protein levels were categorized into Cluster 2 (EGFP<sup>+</sup>, αSMA<sup>low</sup>). In the mouse line we used, tamoxifen-dependent Cre activity is driven by a 1.1 kb fragment of the mouse <italic>Acta2</italic> promoter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. While this promoter fragment is sufficient for CreER<sup>T2</sup> expression and subsequent excision of a loxP-flanked <italic>Tomato</italic> reporter cassette (rendering the cells EGFP+), the endogenous transcriptional machinery in Cluster 2 cells is not robust enough to fully activate the native <italic>Acta2</italic> gene. Consequently, these cells exhibit low levels of αSMA protein. Desmin expression was then used to further delineate cells with high levels of αSMA protein. Those with low desmin levels were allocated to Cluster 3 (EGFP<sup>+</sup>, αSMA<sup>high</sup>, desmin<sup>low</sup>), while cells with high desmin levels were placed in Cluster 4 (EGFP<sup>+</sup>, αSMA<sup>high</sup>, desmin<sup>high</sup>). Clusters 0 and 5 were characterized by CD34 expression without EGFP. Despite identifying <italic>Pi16</italic> and <italic>Clu</italic> transcripts as specific markers for Clusters 0 and 5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, D</xref>), commercially available antibodies did not yield satisfactory results, preventing a clear distinction between Clusters 0 and 5.</p><p id="P16">Using this mapping strategy, we successfully visualized distinct clusters of subepithelial fibroblasts in the distal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) and proximal sections of the murine colon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 1A-C</xref>). Cluster 2 was characterized by EGFP<sup>+</sup> stellate-shaped (branched) cells, interconnected via long, thin dendritic protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Movies 1-3</xref>) and gap junctions (connexin 43, gene <italic>Gja1</italic>) to form a network encapsulating the crypt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 2E-F</xref>). Their morphology was consistent across various gut segments. Clusters 0 and 5 similarly exhibited a stellate-like morphology but with fewer, thicker protrusions that taper to relatively thin ends, connecting to adjacent cells by connexin 43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 2E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Movie 2-3</xref>). These clusters were found along the entire length of the crypts, often in tightly packed groups, making individual cell identification challenging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Despite CD34 being a marker for endothelial progenitor cells, we distinguished fibroblasts from blood vessels by their unique location, morphology, and the absence of CD31 staining, which is specific to blood vessels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 2A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 1B</xref>). Clusters 3 and 4 were primarily composed of spindle-shaped cells, varying from smaller, square-like cells similar in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Movie 1</xref>) to exceptionally long cells connecting the <italic>muscularis mucosae</italic> at the crypt base to blood vessels at the top (up to 120 μm long, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. figure 3A, B</xref>). These cells, found on top or in between crypts, were either solitary or in small groups of 3-4 cells. Both clusters featured cells with prominent αSMA-rich contractile stress fibers, with cluster 4 also showing an abundance of desmin fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 3A, B</xref>). When found together, EGFP<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts (Clusters 2-4) were positioned directly adjacent to the basement membrane of epithelial cells, labeled with as pan-laminin (LAM1), COL1, COL4, and FN1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 4A-E</xref>). In contrast, Clusters 0 and 5 were situated further from the epithelial cells, residing above the EGFP<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts. However, when alone, cells from clusters 0 and 5 interacted directly with the epithelial basement membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We also examined PDGFRα expression, a frequently cited fibroblast marker. PDGFRα expression was most significant in Cluster 2 (EGFP<sup>+</sup>), followed by Cluster 0 (CD34<sup>+</sup>), and absent in Clusters 3 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Consistent with literature reports, we observed a PDGFRα expression gradient along crypts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> with cells atop the crypts, including pericytes over blood vessels, exhibiting higher PDGFRα levels than those at the bottom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 1C</xref>). Intriguingly, we also identified cells negative for CD34 and EGFP but positive for PDGFRα, suggesting a potential association with Cluster 1 based on their morphology and positioning similar to Cluster 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 1C</xref>). The UMAP plot shows that a small proportion of cells of Cluster 1 express PDGFRα (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Figure 1D</xref>). The expression of intermediate filament vimentin was observed in all fibroblast clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 2C-D</xref>), but it followed the same pattern as PDGFRα, with higher expression at the top of the crypt and lower expression in fibroblasts closer to the crypt bottom (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Altogether, we found that fibroblasts exhibit distinct shapes and localizations in the colonic mucosa. Stellate-shaped fibroblasts were located close to the epithelium, forming a basket around the crypts. These are enriched in ECM genes and produce cytokines necessary for the maintenance of the stem cell niche (Clusters 0 and 5) or cytokines that support the differentiation of epithelial cells (Cluster 2). In contrast, spindle-shaped cells do not express ECM genes, but are highly enriched in genes related to contractility (Cluster 3, Cluster 4). The spindle cells can be attached on one side to blood vessels at the top of the crypts just beneath the epithelium and on the other side to the muscle layer. In addition to expressing contractility genes, some of the spindle cells are enriched in genes typically found in pericytes and smooth muscle cells (Cluster 4).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Different fibroblast subpopulations were at various stages of differentiation</title><p id="P20">To investigate fibroblast differentiation pathways based on gene expression profiles, we employed the Monocle 3 algorithm. Cluster 1 was selected as the root for trajectory analysis due to its expression of genes present in all other clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The obtained pseudotime trajectory was projected onto UMAPs, and cells were colored according to Seurat fibroblast clusters and predicted pseudotime values, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). Each leaf, represented by light gray circles, indicates a unique outcome (cell fate or end state) of the trajectory. Black circles denote main branch nodes, which direct cells toward one of several potential fates. Eight distinct branches were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In Cluster 1, three branches contained cells with low pseudotime values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). Branch 2 terminated at a leaf (gray circle 1) corresponding to Cluster 2. The pseudotime values of cells along Branch 3 increased, suggesting differentiation toward Cluster 2. Branch 3 subsequently divided into Branch 5, which terminated at a leaf (gray circle 2) corresponding to Cluster 3. Cells in Cluster 3 exhibited the highest pseudotime values, indicating their status as the most differentiated and well-defined population.</p><p id="P22">Branch 6 divided at the major branching point 2 (black circle) into two pathways: Branch 7, terminating in Cluster 4, and Branch 8, concluding in Cluster 0. Pseudotime values along these branches increased progressively, reflecting differentiation toward the well-defined clusters 0 and 4. Interestingly, the major branching point 2 was located in Cluster 5, suggesting that cells in Cluster 5 can transition toward Cluster 4 or Cluster 0. Nevertheless, cells in Cluster 5 displayed a gradient of pseudotime values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B</xref>).</p><p id="P23">To complement this, we performed diffusion pseudotime analysis using the R package Slingshot, designating Cluster 1 as the root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-G</xref>). Four distinct differentiation trajectories were identified and projected onto UMAPs, leading from Cluster 1 to Cluster 0 or 3 via Cluster 5, or directly to Clusters 2 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-G</xref>). Cells were colored according to Seurat fibroblast clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) or predicted pseudotime values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-G</xref>). Within Cluster 1, four subpopulations (yellow, red, blue, and green) were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-G</xref>). Cells in the yellow and blue subpopulations originated all trajectories, while red subpopulation cells followed the trajectory leading to Cluster 2 (corresponding to Branch 2 in Monocle 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B</xref>).

Examining the four subpopulations within Cluster 1 (yellow, red, blue, and green) revealed that red subpopulation cells pointed toward Cluster 2, consistent with both trajectory analyses. The velocity vectors of yellow and blue subpopulation cells diverged, indicating differentiation toward distinct end states. Green subpopulation cells’ velocity vectors pointed toward Cluster 3. Additionally, velocity vector lengths varied within Clusters 2 and 5, aligning with their end states and increasing pseudotime values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H, B</xref>).

Additionally, they investigated the impact of PGE2 on intestinal stem cell function. Crypts from the small intestine were cultured in organoid growth media supplemented with PGE2. PGE2 inhibited the formation of budding organoids, resulting in spheroid-like structures lacking crypt-villus architecture, indicative of poor differentiation and increased stemness. These spheroid-like structures harbored a higher proportion of stem cells with complete organoid-forming capacity.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, immunofluorescence labeling, and imaging, we identified distinct fibroblast clusters with unique morphologies, localizations, and functions.</p><p id="P47">Our analysis indicates that consistent with previous observations, subepithelial fibroblasts express genes involved in ECM remodeling and cytokines that regulate the fate of epithelial cells, including stemness, proliferation, and differentiation. Surprisingly, these functions are distributed across different clusters, suggesting a specialization of roles. While trophocytes/ ECM fibroblasts and fibroblasts primarily produce extracellular matrix, myofibroblasts, and smooth muscle/pericyte-like fibroblasts are involved in contraction. This specialization challenges the previous belief that fibroblasts, in general, perform both functions simultaneously. Additionally, there is a functional division in the production of BMP/Wnt molecules. Telocytes contribute to BMP production, playing a role in epithelial differentiation, whereas trophocytes/ ECM fibroblasts and fibroblasts support the epithelial stem cell niche by producing Wnt molecules and BMP antagonists.</p><p id="P48">Moreover, subepithelial fibroblasts exhibit distinct shapes and localizations within the colonic mucosa but individual subtypes have similar morphology in the proximal and distal colons. Trophocytes/ ECM fibroblasts, fibroblasts, and telocytes are stellate-shaped and located close to the epithelium, forming a basket around the crypt. While trophocytes/ ECM fibroblasts produce ECM and cytokines essential for maintaining the stem cell niche, telocytes support the differentiation of epithelial cells.</p><p id="P49">In contrast, myofibroblasts and smoth muscle/pericyte-like fibroblasts are spindle-shaped. Some cells of these subpopulations span from the bottom to the top of the crypts, making contact with blood vessels on the crypt top. Further investigation into the function and development of this cluster is necessary, as close contact with the blood vessel may indicate a role in the control of blood vessel perfusion. Although the markers of contractile fibroblasts (myofibroblasts and SM/pericyte-like cells) are well described, the role of these cells in gut homeostasis remains unclear. Cell contractility is essential for physiological functions such as muscle contraction and cell migration, and it also plays a role in several human diseases, including fibrosis, scarring, and cancer. As described previously, besides muscle cells, myofibroblasts are another type of professional contractile cells. Typically arising from normal fibroblasts upon stress stimuli, activated contractile myofibroblasts (αSMA+) aid in wound repair by remodeling the connective tissue. Once the wound is repaired, myofibroblasts usually die. If they persist beyond the healing phase, they may contribute to scarring and fibrosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Interestingly, unlike in other organs, contractile fibroblasts (αSMA+ myofibroblasts and SM/pericyte-like fibroblasts) are also present in gut homeostasis. Why does the gut need special contractile equipment of fibroblasts around its crypts? We hypothesize that they might be involved in the maintenance of mucosal architecture during feces transit or that they aid in mucus expulsion from the crypts, similar to myoepithelial cells, which aid in milk ejection from the breast glands <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P50">The analysis of cell cycle markers revealed minimal proliferation within all fibroblast clusters except trophocytes/ ECM fibroblasts and fibroblasts, where a small subset of cells displayed slightly higher score levels.

Single stained tissues were tissue slices obtained from non-treated non-fluorescent C57BL/6J mice and stained just for one particular antigen using the same concentrations of antibodies as the one used in a full panel of antibodies, following the same experimental procedure already described. Single color controls of αSMA:Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup>/R26<sup>mT/mG</sup> mouse (Tomato and EGFP) were non-stained tissue slices obtained from it. Stainings that label the same cell structures were put in channels with minimized cross-talk.
