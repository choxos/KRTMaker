Rather, transcription factors rely on receptive cell states to induce novel identities. Cell state emerges from and is shaped by cellular history and the activity of diverse processes. Here, we define the cellular and molecular properties of a highly receptive state amenable to transcription factor-mediated direct conversion from fibroblasts to induced motor neurons. Using a well-defined model of direct conversion to a post-mitotic fate, we identify the highly proliferative, receptive state that transiently emerges during conversion. Through examining chromatin accessibility, histone marks, and nuclear features, we find that cells reprogram from a state characterized by global reductions in nuclear size and transcriptional activity. Supported by globally increased levels of H3K27me3, cells enter a quiescent-like state of reduced RNA metabolism and elevated expression of REST and p27, markers of quiescent neural stem cells. From this transient state, cells convert to neurons at high rates. Inhibition of Ezh2, the catalytic subunit of PRC2 that deposits H3K27me3, abolishes conversion. Our work offers a roadmap to identify global changes in cellular processes that define cells with different conversion potentials that may generalize to other cell-fate transitions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2">

Thus, cell states that arise in both conversion and development may reveal common, possibly essential characteristics of this cell-fate transition. During conversion, cells do not necessarily transit through a known progenitor state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and proliferation is not required for reprogramming.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> However, highly proliferative cells reprogram at higher rates to both iPSCs and post-mitotic neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> Similarly, prior to differentiation, neural stem cells divide before neuronal fate commitment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> In both cell fate transitions, proliferation may support commitment.</p><p id="P5">Potentially, proliferation drives cells to a state that is more receptive to the instructive cues from transcription factors and lineage-specific signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> DNA replication limits active transcription and, at the same time, provides an opportunity for TFs to compete for access to the genome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> In absence of competing factors, the symmetrical deposition of existing chromatin modifications allow propagation of chromatin states through recruitment of read-write enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> The division of chromatin modifications between daughter strands following replication may transiently dilute chromatin modifications and create a window of opportunity for TFs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> TFs may therefore act in this window to compete with the propagation of histone marks over multiple cell cycles. Through passive loss of chromatin marks and by reducing the concentration of TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, proliferation may favor specific TFs that are retained on chromatin during mitosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> Thus, proliferation may support cell fate transitions by progressively priming the enhancer network and preparing for lineage-specific enhancer commissioning, while decommissioning enhancers of alternative fates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup></p><p id="P6">Direct conversion provides a well-defined model system to disentangle the intertwined role of proliferation in facilitating changes in cell fate from the cell fate itself.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> In particular, direct conversion of fibroblasts to motor neurons is well-defined with established murine transgenic reporters for staging the reprogramming process in living cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> Importantly, direct conversion to a post-mitotic identity provides several advantages over reprogramming to iPSCs. Conversion to a post-mitotic cell type, such as motor neurons, allows us to decouple transient changes in proliferation from proliferation associated with the new cell identity. Unlike transcription factors used to generate iPSCs, motor neuron transcription factors drive cells to exit the cell cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> In other words, direct conversion to a post-mitotic cell type allows us to examine cells that are transiting <italic>through</italic> a proliferative state instead of transiting <italic>to</italic> a proliferative state. To improve our ability to track states that result in successful conversion, we have recently improved the robustness and efficiency of reprogramming to generate larger numbers of reprogrammed cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> Importantly, we developed live-cell labeling methods to isolate cells with different reprogramming potentials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> This system allows us to finely dissect the molecular processes and cellular states that support conversion. With the direct conversion to neurons, we can identify transient states that would be nearly-inseparable during reprogramming to a highly proliferative cell type.</p><p id="P7">Here, using the model of direct conversion of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to induced motor neurons (iMNs), we identify a highly receptive cell state that emerges following hyperproliferation. Driven to this transient cell state by hyperproliferation, cells convert at high rates in response to the activity of neuronal transcription factors. By profiling patterns of chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activity in single cells, we find that cells transit to neurons via a quiescent-like state characterized by globally-elevated levels of H3K27me3, low transcriptional activity, reduced nuclear volume, and increased markers of quiescence. Proliferation induces global increases in H3K27me3, which supports cells’ transit through a state of altered RNA metabolism. Inhibition of Ezh2, the catalytic subunit of the Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) responsible for depositing a tri-methyl mark on H3K27, compromises the cells’ transit to this quiescent-like state, abolishing conversion to iMNs. Cells rapidly and simultaneously remodel their profile of biomolecules and epigenetic states, allowing transit through a quiescent-like state. Putatively, in this quiescent-like state, cells become receptive to neuronal transcription factors through the global weakening of interlocking forms of epigenetic and transcriptional feedback that reinforce fibroblast identity.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Reduced accessibility across the axis of conversion defines reprogrammable cells</title><p id="P8">To induce direct conversion, we transduced transgenic primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) bearing the motor neuron transgenic reporter Hb9::GFP with retroviruses encoding motor neuron transcription factors Lhx3, Ngn2, and Isl1 (LNI) on a single transcript.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> The pioneer factor Ngn2 is essential for conversion to induced motor neurons (iMNs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> Substitution of the pioneer factor Ngn2 with a DNA-binding domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> mutant of Ngn2 abolishes the formation of iMNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1a-b</xref>).

We then use fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate cells with a history of hyperproliferation (HyperP cells). HyperP cells have a lower CellTrace signal compared to cells that have not divided as frequently in this time window (Non-HyperP cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). We define HyperP cells as those cells with CellTrace signal dimmer than the dimmest 20 percent of MEFs infected only with a control retrovirus expressing the Puromycin-resistance gene (Control-Puro) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). RIDD increases the percentage of HyperP cells in MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1c-d</xref>). Motor neuron transcription factors alone do not induce proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1c-d</xref>). As expected, conditions with a high fraction of HyperP cells show higher cell numbers at 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1e</xref>). Activity of the motor neuron transcription factors is necessary for conversion. However, deletion of the DNA-binding domain of Ngn2 does not affect proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1f</xref>).</p><p id="P10">At 4 dpi, we isolated the Non-HyperP and HyperP subpopulations of MEFs infected with LNI and RIDD viruses (LNIRIDD) by FACS and re-plated the subpopulations at equal seeding densities. Reprogramming outcomes for each subpopulation were tracked to 14 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). At 14 dpi, we quantified the number of Hb9::GFP positive cells via flow cytometry. To assess conversion, we calculated the iMN yield, defined as the number of Hb9::GFP positive cells divided by the number of cells re-plated at 4 dpi. HyperP cells convert at nearly three times the rate of Non-HyperP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> HyperP cells have lower, not higher, levels of LNI transcription factors than Non-HyperP cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Thus, we could not attribute differences in conversion to increased levels of transcription factors. Rather, we hypothesize that proliferation induces a cell state that is more receptive to transcription factor-driven conversion.</p><p id="P11">Given the substantial differences in conversion potential, we considered that differences in chromatin state may render HyperP cells more receptive to transcription factors compared to non-HyperP cells. To examine chromatin state, we used single cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with combinatorial indexing and high-throughput sequencing (sciATAC-seq)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> to profile LNIRIDD HyperP and Non-HyperP cells and compare their accessibility profiles to the starting and final cell types, MEFs and iMNs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). In addition, we also profiled LNI-only cells.</p><p id="P12">To convert, cells open genomic regions that are specific to the motor neuron identity and close regions that are specific to fibroblasts, generating an axis of conversion. We defined the axis of conversion as regions that are differentially accessible between MEFs and iMNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). We hypothesized that, given their higher rates of conversion, the HyperP subpopulation would adopt a chromatin state closer to iMNs and more distant from fibroblasts compared to non-HyperP cells. Alternatively, hyperproliferative cells may represent a state that is merely more receptive to transcription factors. If the features that support plasticity are orthogonal to the axis of conversion, cells with greater receptivity may not be distinguishable by differences in chromatin accessibility across this axis.</p><p id="P13">After filtering for high quality cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1e</xref>), we identify differentially accessible regions (DARs) between MEFs and iMNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>). MEF and iMN DARs are enriched for transcription factor motifs associated with their respective cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref>), validating our approach for identifying representative regions across the axis of conversion. We find the differences in proliferation history are reflected in chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1i-k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1f-h</xref>). Interestingly, HyperP cells do not have greater accessibility at iMN DARs than Non-HyperP cells. Instead, HyperP cells have decreased ATAC signal at MEF DARs compared to Non-HyperP cells. Thus, conversion potential more strongly correlates with closing of fibroblast-associated chromatin rather than opening regions associated with the motor neuron identity.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Receptive cells display reduced nuclear volumes, increased silent euchromatin</title><p id="P14">Changes in accessibility and chromatin structure may reflect or be reflected by changes in nuclear compaction and morphology, including nuclear volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> To better define the connection between reprogramming efficiency, chromatin organization, and nuclear state, we explored whether transposition patterns correlate with broader nuclear characteristics. As nuclear condensation has been linked to hyperproliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that highly proliferative cells would show increased chromatin compaction and reduced nuclear volume.</p><p id="P15">To observe nuclear morphology, we examined cells reprogramming with the transcription factors in low and high efficiency conditions. In the presence of RIDD, most cells are hyperproliferative (HyperP; 75%) whereas in the absence of RIDD, the majority of cells with LNI are non-hyperproliferative (Non-HyperP; 83%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a-b</xref>). Measuring <italic>in situ</italic> we can avoid the confounding influence of dissociation on our ability to observe nuclear features such as area and volume. We used confocal microscopy to capture z-stacks of nuclei at 4 dpi. By reconstructing these projections, we calculated the nuclear volume and obtained across-sectional area of the nucleus. Cells in the LNIRIDD condition displayed significantly smaller, more compact nuclei compared to cells in the LNI condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c-e</xref>). In highly proliferative conditions, cells showed nearly a two-fold reduction in nuclear volume and cross-sectional area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d-e</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Changes in compaction and chromatin structure can affect accessibility of chromatin-binding proteins to their targets which may reflect specific histone modifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> We wondered if the substantial reduction in nuclear volume coincides with a global transition to a silent chromatin state marked H3K27me3. Staining for H3K27me3 reveals that LNIRIDD cells display elevated levels of total H3K27me3 than LNI-only cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c, f-g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2a-b</xref>). We do not observe an increase in H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2a, c</xref>). As nuclear area decreases, the mean intensity of H3K27me3 per nuclear area further increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e, g</xref>). In the presence of RIDD, cells show an increase in the levels of H3K27me3 per nuclear area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g</xref>), suggesting a correlation between compaction and H3K27me3 in highly proliferative cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Hyperproliferative cells broadly enrich H3K27me3 across the genome</title><p id="P17">Potentially, H3K27me3 may preferentially enrich in fibroblast-associated genomic regions, accelerating reprogramming by suppressing donor cell identity. Alternatively, H3K27me3 may globally increase across the genome, regulating both fibroblast and iMN gene regulatory networks. To examine these competing models, we used Cleavage Under Targets &amp; Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> with spike-in normalization to identify regions marked by H3K27me3 in LNIRIDD HyperP and Non-HyperP cells as well as MEFs for reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). Additionally, we profiled H3K4me3 to examine the distinct patterns of regulation across the genome.</p><p id="P18">We first identified regions marked with H3K27me3 in hyperproliferative and non-hyperproliferative cells during conversion by calling peaks using MACS2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> and retaining peaks that are present in replicate datasets. H3K27me3 peaks called in our HyperP CUT&amp;Tag dataset correlate with low accessibility in our HyperP sci-ATAC dataset, while H3K4me3 peaks correlate with high accessibility, validating our CUT&amp;Tag assay and peak calling pipeline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3a</xref>). Annotating the locations of these peaks relative to annotated transcripts using HOMER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, we observe peaks called in hyperproliferative and non-hyperproliferative cells are distributed similarly across the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3b</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We combined the peak lists from hyperproliferative cells and non-hyperproliferative cells and merged overlapping peaks to create a master peak list with contiguous peaks. Of the genomic regions in this master peak list, a larger number are called peaks in hyperproliferative cells than in non-hyperproliferative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). We then quantified the CUT&amp;Tag signal in these regions as the number of reads that overlap the region, normalized by the number of spike-in reads. Examining the common peaks between these two conditions, we find that the spike-in normalized H3K27me3 signal increases by ~25% in hyperproliferative cells compared to non-hyperproliferative cells in these shared regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c-d</xref>). We also observed an increase in H3K4me3 signal in common peaks in HyperP cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3c</xref>). As expected, H3K27me3 peaks are broader than H3K4 peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3d</xref>). H3K27me3 peak width distributions do not change significantly between hyperproliferative and non-hyperproliferative conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3e</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To erase donor identity and accelerate conversion, silencing may be focused at fibroblast regions. To examine this idea, we asked if H3K27me3 accumulated at or around regions defined as accessible in MEFs or iMNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4a</xref>). Because of the low CUT&amp;Tag signal at ATAC peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4b</xref>), we expect the data at ATAC peaks for each sample to contain subpopulations corresponding to background and true H3K27me3 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>). The fraction of ATAC peaks falling in the “true” signal distribution corresponds to the fraction of ATAC peaks with enrichment of the H3K27me3 or H3K4me3 mark. To quantify the fraction of peaks with histone methylation above background, we fit a two-component, 2D Gaussian mixture model to the data. Specifically, we began by pooling data across all CUT&amp;Tag samples for each histone mark and fitting a model for MEF ATAC peaks and iMN ATAC peaks separately (H3K27me3: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4f</xref>, H3K4me3: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4c-e, g</xref>). By optimizing the weights of each Gaussian, the model provides an unbiased estimate of the fraction of peaks with histone mark enrichment over background within each sample. As estimated by our mixture model, the fraction of iMN ATAC peaks that have high H3K27me3 decreases between MEFs and both converting populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3g</xref>). HyperP cells show a marginal increase in the fraction of MEF ATAC peaks with high H3K27me3. For both the iMN and MEF ATAC peak sets, the fraction of peaks with high H3K4me3 changed very little between populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4e</xref>). Our data suggests that during conversion, iMN ATAC peaks lose H3K27me3, but proliferation does not specifically focus H3K27me3 increases within MEF-associated regions.</p><p id="P21">We wondered if proliferation drives a global increase in H3K27me3 levels. Expanding beyond predefined peaks, we sought to examine global changes in H3K27me3 levels. To do this, we binned the genome into 5 kb regions, assigned CUT&amp;Tag reads to bins based on the midpoint of the read, normalized the binned counts using spike-in normalization, and compared the normalized signal between HyperP and Non-HyperP cells for signs of either site-specific or global enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3h</xref>). When comparing signal across bins between replicate datasets, we observe strong correlation and bins are distributed around the x=y line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4h-i</xref>). When comparing signal between HyperP and Non-HyperP cells, we observe that the joint distribution shifts above the x=y line, indicating a global increase in H3K27me3 signal in HyperP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3i</xref>).

Briefly, unloaded Tn5 (2 mg/mL; Diagenode C01070010-20) was loaded with barcoded transposition primers and an initial transposition was carried out to validate the Tn5 concentration per cell required for transposition to yield fragment distributions with a mean fragment size around 800-1000bp. The validated concentration used was 1 uL of 40-fold diluted Tn5 per well (1000 cells).</p><p id="P56">Five cell populations were sorted: 1) MEFs, 2) LNI treated cell at 4 dpi, 3) LNI-RIDD treated cells at 4dpi, sorted as HyperP, 4) LNI-RIDD treated cells at 4dpi, sorted as “not HyperP” (e.g. above the HyperP gate), 5) Hb9:GFP+ iMNs at 14dpi. These cells were fixed with a final concentration of 0.1% formaldehyde at room temperature for five minutes.

Fragments from high quality cells were then split into two fragments centered on the fragment ends (the transposition sites) and extended 100 bp in each direction. These transposition-centered fragments were used as inputs for the MACS2 peak caller run with options “--nomodel --nolambda --keep-dup all -f BEDPE --call-summits -q 0.01” to call peaks for each condition. Shifting reads to transposition sites before MACS2 is equivalent to using the MACS2 options “---shift -100 --extsize 200.” The transposition-centered fragments from each condition were also evenly split into 2 “pseudoreplicate” files and peaks were called on each pseudoreplicate.
