releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via IP<sub>3</sub> receptors and modulates adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity in atrial myocytes. Lysosomes participate in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis by mobilising Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to Nicotinic Acid Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NAADP). We postulate that both downstream activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive AC (AC1 and AC8) and lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling in response to IP<sub>3</sub>R activation contribute to atrial myocyte function and pacemaking. Ectopic application of phenylephrine (PE) increased chronotropy and inotropy and this response was reduced in the presence of NAADP pathway inhibitors (BZ-194 and SAN4825) and Bafilomycin A1. PE increased cyclic adenosine 3’-5’ monophosphate (cAMP) activity in neonatal rat atrial myocytes (NRAMs) and this was inhibited by NAADP pathway inhibitors. This inhibition was not observed in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), revealing specificity of this response to NRAMs. We investigated expression of AC1 and AC8 as a possible explanation to these observations. Genetic perturbation of AC1 and AC8 by double-knockout of <italic>Adcy1</italic> and <italic>Adcy8</italic> in a mouse model showed a decrease in positive chronotropic and inotropic response upon cumulative dose of PE in atrial tissue, reduced PE stimulated amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in isolated atrial myocytes and presented decreased cytosolic cAMP levels in response to PE in neonatal atrial myocytes that was not inhibited by NAADP pathway inhibitors. Our data identifies a link between NAADP and α-adrenergic signalling pathways in atrial myocytes, highlighting that lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> is an important component of α-adrenergic stimulation in the cardiac atria and warrants further investigation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Alpha-adrenergic signalling</kwd><kwd>adenylyl cyclase</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>cyclic AMP</kwd><kwd>cardiac atria</kwd><kwd>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling</kwd><kwd>inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) release from intracellular organelles is a driving force for normal cardiac pacemaker cell automaticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Maltsev, Vinogradova et al. 2006</xref>). In 1983, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was demonstrated in pancreatic acinar cells for the first time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Streb, Irvine et al. 1983</xref>). Since then, this mechanism has been shown in many other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Berridge 2009</xref>); as well as in non-excitable cells such as proliferating lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Feske 2007</xref>) and excitable cells including cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kockskämper, Zima et al. 2008</xref>). IP<sub>3</sub> signalling enhances Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced force oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zhu and Nosek 1991</xref>) but compared to the role played by type 2 ryanodine receptors (RyR2) in Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR), the involvement of IP<sub>3</sub> signalling in cardiac cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling is less well studied. Abnormal cardiac intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics has been identified as a significant contributor to both ventricular and atrial arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Deo, Weinberg et al. 2017</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling is normally highly coordinated in atrial myocytes and abnormal intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is observed in chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nattel and Dobrev 2012</xref>). RyR2 are Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels found on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the heart (Wang, Shi et al.), and have received significant attention over the years. More recently, IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>R) have been identified as a second pathway for agonist-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and have been gaining significant interest due to the importance of IP<sub>3</sub>-inducing agonists such as angiotensin II, endothelin-1 (ET-1), and norepinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hund, Ziman et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P3">IP<sub>3</sub> as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mobilizing second messenger has recently been shown to modulate adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity in atrial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Capel, Bose et al. 2021</xref>) and sino-atrial node myocytes, with IP<sub>3</sub>R activation leading to increased cyclic adenosine 3’-5’ monophosphate (cAMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bose, Read et al. 2022</xref>).

To label atrial myocytes, 50nM LysoTracker™ red was incubated with the cells at room temperature in the dark for 20 minutes in Tyrode (in mM: NaCl 136, KCl 5.4, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 12, sodium pyruvate 1, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, EGTA 0.04, glucose 5) to allow it to partition into the acidic organelles. Myocytes were then washed twice and left in Tyrode for live imaging using Nikon Eclipse Ti Inverted Fluorescence Microscope with a 40x oil-immersion objective with illumination light at 546 nm.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>High resolution episcopic microscopy</title><p id="P37">High resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM) was conducted on murine WT and DKO hearts as previously described (Kalisch-Smith, Ved et al. 2021). Whole hearts were fixed overnight at room temperature using Bouin’s fixative (HT10132, Merck), then thoroughly rinsed in PBS and subjected to gradual dehydration in a methanol series, starting at 10% + 10% between each step, up to 90% and then 90 %, 95 %, 100 % for 2 hours each step on a rocker at room temperature. Hearts were then embedded using a JB-4 kit (Catalogue number 00226-1, Polysciences). Briefly, hearts underwent overnight infiltration at 4 °C with a 50:50 mixture of methanol and infiltration solution (JB-4 Solution A plus 1.25% (w/v) Benzoyl Peroxide Plasticizer); they were rinsed in 100% infiltration solution for 1 hour in the dark at room temperature on rocker to minimise residual methanol; and left to incubate for up to 1 week at 4 °C in fresh infiltration solution. Finally, 6% (v/v) JB-4 solution B was added to the infiltration solution to initiate polymerization. Subsequently, analysis was carried out using a 3D Optical high-resolution episcopic microscopy imaging system (Indigo Scientific). HREM data were evaluated using Horos 3.3.6 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://horosproject.org">https://horosproject.org</ext-link>), and Amira for Life &amp; Biomedical Sciences version 2019.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Mouse Atrial preparations</title><p id="P38">Male mice (between 25-35g) were terminated by concussion followed by cervical dislocation, the chest cavity was opened, and the heart was rapidly excised and placed in warm, oxygenated physiological saline solution (PSS, in mM: NaCl 125, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, KCl 5.4, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, glucose 5.5, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8, pH to 7.4 with NaOH) oxygenated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) containing heparin (10U/mL). Hearts were transferred to a dissection chamber under a microscope, ventricular tissue was discarded, and the atria were cleared of any overlying tissue such as cardiovascular tubing and adipose tissue. Right and left atria were separated, and loops of thin suture were tied to the lateral edges of each atrium by directly knotting around a small area of the tissue before being mounted to a force transducer in an organ bath. One loop was anchored to a hook, and the other tied to the tension transducer with a resting tension between 0.22-0.24g, a correct weight to visualise contraction without adding a strain to the atrium. The preparation was hung in an organ bath filled with PSS, maintained at 37°C and oxygenated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Tension data were digitised using a PowerLabs bridge amplifier and recorded on LabChart5 software (all from ADInstruments, UK). Chronotropic effect was measured from the time interval between contraction of spontaneously beating right atrium and beating rate was calculated in real-time from the upstroke of the tension signal using the Chart5 Ratemeter function. Inotropic effect was measured from stimulated left atrium at 5Hz during these experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Phenylephrine dose response curves</title><p id="P39">After the frequency force of right atrial contractions and force of contraction of left atrial contractions had stabilised (variation of no more than 2 beats per minute (bpm) and 0.2g over a 10 minute period in the right and left atrium respectively), the effects of PE were investigated over a cumulatively increasing concentration range of 0.1 μM to 30 μM. Preparations were excluded if stabilised beating rate under control conditions only in the presence of PSS was under 300 bpm or if preparations were arrhythmic. Agonist doses were administered every 4 minutes using Gilson pipettes into the organ baths, with the tips submerged in the PSS. Atrial preparations were pre-treated with 1 μM Metoprolol 1 hour before the first dose of PE to avoid any interference from β-adrenoceptors. Inhibitors were administered 30 minutes prior to the first dose of PE, allowing sufficient time for these pharmacological agents to penetrate the multicellular preparations.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Neonatal myocytes isolation</title><p id="P40">Neonatal rat atrial myocytes (NRAMs) were isolated using a modified protocol from (Burton, Klimas et al. 2015, Burton, Tomek et al. 2020). Hearts were isolated from 3-day-old Sprague Dawley rat pups, culled by cervical dislocation followed by exsanguination. Following dissection, atria were separated from the ventricles, transferred to 2ml Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) and cut into 1-2 mm<sup>3</sup> pieces. Atrial myocytes were enzymatically isolated by a series of enzymatic digestions; in trypsin (1 mg/ml, Merck, UK, rocked at 4°C for 2 hours) followed by collagenase (type IV, 1mg/ml, Merck, UK). For the collagenase digestions, the trypsin was replaced by 4ml collagenase solution and tissue was gently triturated using a plastic pipette for 1 minute. The tissue plus collagenase solution was then stirred gently in a bath at 37 °C for 2 minutes and the first supernatant was discarded. A further 4ml collagenase solution was added to the tissue pellet and triturated for 1 minute using a wide bore pipette. This solution was then stirred gently in a bath at 37°C for 2 minutes and the supernatant (4ml) added to 3ml HBSS and stored in a 15ml centrifuge tube. This process was repeated a further 3 times to produce a total of 4x7ml cell suspensions. Tubes were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 8 minutes. Supernatant was then removed, and the cells were resuspended in 2ml cardiomyocyte plating media (CPM: 85% DMEM, 17% M199, 10% horse serum, 5% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin) before being centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes. All samples were then strained using a cell strainer and pooled into a single 50ml centrifuge tube. Isolated cells were pre-plated and incubated at 37°C (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) for 1 hour to allow separation of fibroblasts. Supernatant containing suspended atrial myocytes was then removed and cell density measured using a haemocytometer and trypan blue. Myocytes were seeded onto 24mm laminin (40μg/ml, Merck, UK) coated glass coverslips in 35mm 6-well plates at a density of 15000 cells per ml in CPM. Cell media was changed every 48 hours. NRVMs were isolated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zaccolo and Pozzan 2002</xref>).For isolation of neonatal mouse atrial myocytes (NMAMs) from WT or DKO C57BL/6, a similar protocol was followed. Enzymatic digestion was shorten du to smaller size and less amount of tissue. Enzymatic digestions: in trypsin rocked at 4 °C for 1.5 hours instead of 2 h. The collagenase digestions, atria were stirred gently in a bath at 37 °C for 1 minute instead of 2 minutes.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Adult mouse atrial isolation</title><p id="P41">WT or DKO C57BL/6 mice hearts were dissected and washed in heparin-containing PSS (20 IU per mL) on a Langendorff setup for retrograde perfusion via the aorta.

Cells were then plated to a glass coverslip for 10 minutes to adhere before imaging. Carbon fibre electrodes were used to field-stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at 1Hz. All recordings were at 37°C under gravity-fed superfusion of Tyrode (recipe in 1.10 Solutions, page). Cells were visualised using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 with attached Nipkow spinning disk confocal unit (CSU-10, Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Japan). Excitation light, transmitted through the CSU-10, was provided by a 488-nm diode laser (Vortran Laser Technology Inc., Sacramento, CA). Emitted light was passed through the CSU-10 and collected by an iXON897 EM-CCD camera (Oxford Instruments, UK) at 60 frames per second with 2×2 binning (pixel size = 0.66667 μm<sup>2</sup>). To avoid dye bleaching, video recordings were 10-20 seconds long (between 1000-2500 images) every minute to not continually be exposed to 488nm light. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were measured using regions of interests (ROIs) in Andor iQ software (version 1.7) to record average whole cell fluorescence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Fret</title><p id="P43">FRET imaging experiments were performed on day 4 of culture and 24 h after infection of the neonatal myocytes with adenovirus carrying EPAC-S<sup>H187</sup> cytosolic biosensor (Klarenbeek, Goedhart et al. 2015) at a multiplicity of infection of 1000 virus particles per cell. During experiments, cells were maintained at room temperature in a modified Ringer solution (recipe in 1.10 Solutions, page). Dynamic measurements were done using an inverted microscope attached to a cool SNAP HQ2 camera and an optical beam splitter (Photometrics) for simultaneous recording of YFP and CFP emissions. FRET changes were measured as changes in the background-subtracted 480nm/545nm fluorescence emission intensity on excitation at 430 nm. For recording, cells were left to settle for 4 minutes before any additions of pharmacological agents. Saturation levels were ensured by addition of 10μM of forskolin that activates ACs and increases intracellular levels of cAMP and 100μM of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) a competitive non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor which raises intracellular cAMP, activates PKA was added for maximum response.

Approved protocols granted by the Ethical Committee of Brescia (protocol number 1737) and a written consent obtained from the patients, in agreement with the declaration of Helsinki. hiPSC-aCM lines were maintained on human Biolaminin 521 LN-coated dishes in TeSR-E8™ medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cardiac differentiation was carried out by monolayer culture on Matrigel<sup>®</sup> hESC-qualified Matrix (Corning, Corning, NY, USA) coated dishes using the PSC Cardiomyocytes Differentiation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), following manufacturer instructions. To induce atrial differentiation, an adaptation of the method previously described (Devalla, Schwach et al. 2015) was used. Briefly, cells were treated with 1 μmol/L atRA (Sigma) starting from day 3 of differentiation, and the medium was changed every day until day 7. Then, cells were maintained in Cardiomyocytes Maintenance Medium (Thermo Fisher), changing the medium every other day. On the 21st day of differentiation, hiPSC-aCM culture was enriched using the PSC-Derived Cardiomyocyte Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotech) following manufacturer instructions, which allows magnetic separation with highly specific CM surface markers. Immediately after magnetic separation, iPSC-CMs were collected and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. For the experiments, atrial differentiated hiPSC-aCM were thawed on Matrigel-coated dishes and maintained at 37°C (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) with Cardiomyocyte Maintenance Medium with B-27 Supplement 50X and penicillin/streptomycin 100X (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

NAADP acts to release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from lysosomes through TPC2 channels also leading to activation of AC1 and/or AC8. Activation of α1-AR (by PE) leads to increased atrial cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and cAMP production.
