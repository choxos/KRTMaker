While the gut-brain axis has been extensively studied, the contribution of the oral microbiome and gut-oral tropism in neurodegeneration has been largely overlooked. Cognitive impairment (CI) is common in neurodegenerative diseases and develops on a spectrum. In Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients, CI is one of the most common non-motor symptoms but its mechanistic development across the spectrum remains unclear, complicating early diagnosis of at-risk individuals. Here, we generated 228 shotgun metagenomics samples of the gut and oral microbiomes across PD patients with either mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) or dementia (PDD), and a healthy cohort, to study the role of the gut and oral microbiomes on CI in PD. In addition to revealing compositional and functional signatures, the role of pathobionts, and dysregulated metabolic pathways of the oral and gut microbiome in PD-MCI and PDD, we also revealed the importance of oral-gut translocation in increasing abundance of virulence factors in PD and CI. The oral-gut virulence was further integrated with saliva metaproteomics and demonstrated their potential role in dysfunction of host immunity and brain endothelial cells. Our findings highlight the significance of the oral-gut-brain axis and underscore its potential for discovering novel biomarkers for PD and CI.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Oral-Gut-Brain Axis</kwd><kwd>Parkinson’s Disease</kwd><kwd>Cognitive Impairment</kwd><kwd>Virulence</kwd><kwd>Microbiome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Neurological disorders are the leading cause of physical and cognitive disability around the world, currently affecting approximately 15% of the worldwide population and expected to increase in future decades due to an ageing population, industrialization and changes in environmental impacts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease with the fastest growing prevalence worldwide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. While it is primarily characterized by motor symptoms such as involuntary shaking, slow movements, and muscle stiffness, one of its most common non-motor dysfunctions is cognitive impairment (CI). There is a high risk of dementia in patients with PD with nearly half of patients reaching the dementia stage within 10 years after diagnosis and virtually all patients develop full dementia within 20 years after diagnosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. CI develops on a spectrum that ranges from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to full-scale dementia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Identification of the risk of developing CI and cognitive decline are important for clinical management of NDs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. However, the evaluation of cognition remains challenging and there is currently an unmet need on whether patients with neurodegenerative diseases have CI or are at risk for further cognitive decline. Non-genetic factors, such as microbiome and environmental impacts, including diet, pollution, and drugs exposure, may have a significant role in this <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">A growing body of evidence links the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, and GI dysfunction is common in patients with PD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. As such, several studies have investigated the role of the gut microbiome in PD for novel diagnostic and treatment avenues as well as a better understanding of the gut-brain axis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> Several studies consistently indicated an increased abundance in <italic>Akkermansia, Bfidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, and a depletion in butyrate producers such as <italic>Roseburia, Faecalibacterium</italic> and <italic>Blautia</italic> in PD patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. One of the key mediating factors of the gut microbiome composition is microbial metabolites and virulence that can have an impact on PD and CI onset and progression. This could be through induction of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress that exacerbate neurodegeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Among microbial metabolites, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production and especially butyrate has shown to have neuroprotective effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. At the same time the secretion of bacterial endotoxins and cell components have been increasingly linked to the pathogenesis of the NDs and, in particular PD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The presence of the lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a major component of gram-negative bacteria and indication of the gut-brain axis dysfunction, in blood can activate microglia and eventually leads to chronic neuroinflammation. LPS can also promote α-synuclein aggregation, a hallmark of PD and its progression, which could also lead to further neurodegeneration and CI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Release of gram-positive bacterial components such as peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid, could stimulate immune responses and promote the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and contribute to the neuroinflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Similarly, oral health of PD patients has also been shown to impact the course of disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. α-synuclein, the molecule that forms aggregates in neurons in PD, can be detected in saliva. The presence of α-synuclein in the oral cavity frequently results in reduced saliva production and difficulty swallowing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, and report the association of NDs with dysphagia. Oral bacteria contribute to chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration through various mechanisms. Opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity, which proliferate due to dysbiosis within the oral ecosystem, can form biofilms leading to bacterial overgrowth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> These biofilms, often associated with gingivitis and periodontitis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, enable bacteria to enter the bloodstream, potentially causing bacteraemia and systemic inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> is a well-studied oral pathogen and has been observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains and active periodontitis have been reported to impact CI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, and in bacteraemia cases it can induce the blood-brain permeability barrier <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The presence of inflammation, bacteraemia, and dysfunction of the mucosal barriers can lead to spontaneous dissemination of the bacteria across tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Simultaneously, the use of specific drugs, such as proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics, to treat stomach reflux, gastritis, and ulcers, that are common conditions in PD patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, modulate and accelerate the microbial translocation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The presence of oral pathobionts and their overgrowth, exacerbates gut dysbiosis and systematic inflammation, as has been reported in several other diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In this study we used metagenomics of faeces and saliva in a cohort of PD patients with MCI (PD-MCI) or full dementia (PDD), together with a healthy control cohort.

We use a combination of machine learning approaches together with functional, correlative and network analyses associate microbiome changes with CI.</p><p id="P7">Through this, we aim to establish an oral-gut-brain axis in PD to bring forth a more mechanistic understanding of the human microbiome in ND.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Gut and oral microbiome composition is associated with cognitive decline in Parkinson’s Disease</title><p id="P8">We performed shotgun metagenomics on 228 saliva and faecal samples taken from 41 Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), 47 patients with full dementia (PDD) and 26 healthy controls (HC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold>). The age and gender distribution between the PD-MCI and PDD groups were similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), with a mean age of 67.27 years (SD = 8.75 years) and 70.89 years (SD = 7.34) for PD-MCI and PDD, respectively, and 34.15% and 40.43% of females for PD-MCI and PDD, respectively. Cognitive assessment using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDRS) revealed a significant difference between PD-MCI and PDD patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, motor function parameters, including the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HYE), and disease duration, also showed significant differences between the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Overall, these findings indicate that patients with MCI exhibit distinct cognitive and motor characteristics compared to those with full dementia.</p><p id="P9">To study the in-depth compositional and functional changes of the gut and oral microbiomes on cognitive impairment and progression in Parkinson’s Disease (PD), we performed deep sequencing with an average of 31.9 reads and 28.2 million reads per sample, respectively, and quantified microbial genes and metagenomic species (MGSs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Stool and saliva samples were mapped to respective gene catalogues to satisfactory standard with and average mapping rate of 67.50% and 39.32%, respectively, which allowed us to confidently proceed with downstream analysis to identify MGSs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Table S3, Supplementary Table S4</bold>). Our analysis revealed a significant decrease in gut microbiome diversity in PDD patients compared to those with PD-MCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) and a decrease in both diversity and MGS richness in the oral microbiome of PDD patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Method</xref>). Taxonomic profiling at the phylum level in gut and oral microbiome showed Actinobacteria was increased in the gut of PD-MCI and PDD patients while Bacteroidetes was decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B, Figure S1C</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Table S5</bold>). In the oral cavity we found a decrease in Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes, specifically in PDD patients. These findings suggest that global alterations in both gut and oral microbiomes are present and may be linked to cognitive decline in PD.</p><p id="P10">To further investigate how the composition of the microbiome changes at varying levels of cognitive impairment, we performed differential abundance testing of MGSs together with functional enrichment analysis. In the gut microbiome, we identified three clusters of signatures characterized by distinctly different genera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). The first genera cluster showed the enrichment of species for <italic>Bifidobacterium longum, Bilophila wadsworthia, Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans</italic> in PD-MCI patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>). Notably, consistent with a previous report, <italic>Desulfovibrio</italic> genus also increases with PD severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. These species were functionally enriched for energy generating metabolic pathways such as citrate cycle, as well inositol-phosphate metabolism but depleted for glutathione biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). The second cluster represents a significant enrichment in PDD patients with opportunistic pathogen species from genera such as <italic>Olsenella sp. Marseille-P2912</italic> and <italic>Hungatella</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>) and with functional enrichment like those of PD-MCI but additionally enriched for several amino acid transport systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). The third cluster represents a distinct depletion signature characteristic in PDD patients that predominantly consists of commensal and beneficial microbes. Several butyrate-producing microbes such as <italic>Roseburia faecis, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic> together with several <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> species were all depleted in PDD compared to PD-MCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>). In addition, compared to HC patients, PDD patients also show enrichment of <italic>B. longum, B. adolescentis, R. lactatiformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). We then reconstructed a correlation network using the gut microbiome genera of these three clusters which showed that cluster 1 and cluster 2 have an overall negative correlation with cluster 3 further supporting that the depletion signature in PDD identified in cluster 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F</xref>). As expected, genera in cluster 2 had a stronger negative correlation with cluster 3 compared to cluster 1 and cluster 3, however, we interestingly also observed a strong negative correlation between <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> in cluster 1 and other genera in cluster 3 suggesting that <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> is a strong driver in gut microbiome community structures and that its increase leads to depletion of other species.</p><p id="P11">In the oral cavity, we observed an overall depletion of several species in PD-MCI and PDD patients compared to HC, which could show the loss of diversity and commensalism in the oral cavity and opportunity for pathogens to triumph (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1G</xref>). We did, however, find a significant increase in abundance of <italic>Oribacterium asaccharolyticum</italic> in PD-MCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). Other potential pathogenic species such as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Prevotella pallens</italic> were also increased in PD-MCI compared to HC, albeit not significantly. Our functional enrichment showed that hexose sugar transport, chemosensory two component regulatory system and neocarzinostatin antibiotic biosynthesis are enriched in PD-MCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Enterotypes and salivatypes revealed distinct functional features for Parkinson’s disease and cognitive impairment</title><p id="P12">To understand the compositional changes of gut and oral communities we performed principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Although there was a statistically significant separation in the gut (gut; PERMANOVA p-value=0.017, oral; PERMANOVA p-value=0.495), the clustering in both cases were discernible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A, Figure S2B</xref>). Dirichlet multinomial mixture modelling has previously been shown to bring about hidden community structures in microbiome data that otherwise cannot clearly be distinguished<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Using this approach, we identified three clusters for gut microbiome, termed enterotypes, enriched for different bacterial genera (ENT1,2 and 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our clinical study groups (PD-MCI and PDD) were enriched with different enterotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), and we found significant clustering of enterotypes using PCoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). HC patients were enriched for ENT2 with a distinct signature of commensal <italic>Prevotella</italic> bacteria while PD-MCI and PDD showed a decrease in ENT2 instead. ENT2 was depleted for cytochrome C oxidase that potentially indicate deficient energy metabolism in the gut of PD patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). PD-MCI patients were enriched for ENT1 that showed a signature for <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Alistipes</italic>. PDD were enriched for <italic>Bacteroides</italic> of ENT1 and ENT3. ENT3 in PDD was depleted for aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and ribosomal pathways suggests overall less translation of proteins and a reduction in citrate cycle pathways can potentially also indicate reduced production of SCFAs. In contrast, branch-chain amino acid (BCAA) production such as isoleucine was enriched which has been shown to be linked to different diseases including PD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">We then identified three clusters, termed salivatypes, in the oral cavity (SAL1, 2 and 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). This result pointed out the PD-MCI and PDD groups were enriched to different salivatypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>), and salivatypes clustered significantly using PCoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). SAL1, enriched in PDD patients, was increased in pathobionts such as <italic>Streptococcus, Rothia</italic> and <italic>Veillonella</italic> and showed an enrichment for proline biosynthesis. PDD patients also showed a depletion in SAL2 that were dominated by <italic>Neisseria</italic>. Interestingly, SAL2 were enriched for multidrug resistance and its depletion in PDD potentially indicate a dysfunctional microbial community.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Gut and oral biomarkers accurately predict clinical phenotypes</title><p id="P14">The observation that patients can be stratified by their gut and oral microbiomes could reflect the potential to use the microbiome for prediction of clinical outcomes and further be extended to identify novel prognostic biomarkers. We therefore used the abundances of gut and oral microbial species together with clinical metadata as features for predicting clinical outcomes (PD-MCI and PDD) using two machine learning (ML) algorithms and then used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) scoring to interpret model predictions and explain the contribution of features, or species, towards model predictions.</p><p id="P15">In four different predictions, we used gut (SIM1), oral (SIM2), both (SIM3; gut and oral) and both together with age, gender, and education (SIM4) of these patients, as features for ML prediction. Using AUCROC and accuracy we showed that SIM4 performed the best compared to other models with an average AUCROC of 69.42% and average accuracy score of 66.91% (<bold>Supplementary Table S6</bold>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). It was particularly interesting to see that the inclusion of clinical metadata (age, gender, and education) improved the AUCROC score. We therefore focussed further analysis and feature selection on outcomes of SIM4 that included gut and oral species abundances together with clinical metadata.</p><p id="P16">We first showed accurate prediction of PD-MCI compared to HC (AUCROC: SVC=0.84, RF=0.89; Accuracy: SVC=0.88, RF=0.77; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>) as well as PDD compared to HC (AUCROC: SVC=0.82, RF=0.86; Accuracy: SVC=0.73,</p><p id="P17">RF=0.78; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Of particular interest was to assess whether the microbiome can be used to distinguish different levels of cognitive decline by comparing PD-MCI and PDD patients. It was therefore supportive to also accurately predict PDD compared to PD-MCI (AUCROC: SVC=0.59, RF=0.57; Accuracy: SVC=0.45, RF=0.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, in predicting PDD versus PD-MCI the inclusion of clinical metadata in SIM4 improved the AUCROC and accuracy of the model compared to SIM3 where only gut and oral metagenomics was used (AUCROC: SIM3=0.41, SIM4=0.58; Accuracy: SIM3=0.395, SIM4=0.475; <bold>Supplementary Table S6</bold>).

Negative values indicate that a lower relative abundance is more likely to classify the disease than in healthy samples.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Integrative correlation network analysis of VFs and MGSs</title><p id="P48">We first mapped the gut metagenomes against the oral gene catalogue to identify oral specific genes in the gut. Enriched and depleted VFs were calculated using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (p-value &lt; 0.05) considering a positive and negative log-fold change, respectively. We then performed a Spearman’s rank correlation between enriched VFs and MGSs in the gut and oral, respectively, using a p-value cut-off of 0.01. The protein sequences of enriched VFs were aligned to previously generated saliva metaproteomics using BLASTP with an e-value cut-off of 10<sup>-7</sup> and percentage identity of higher than 50. The integrative network was then visualised in Cytoscape and used to calculate the degree of connections of each node.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS199459-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d11aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by grants from Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), EP/S001301/1, Biotechnology Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) BB/S016899/1 and Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) to Saeed Shoaie and from the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBITAK) (grant no. 315S301) to Suleyman Yildirim.

This included 41 Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), 47 patients with full dementia (PDD) as well as 26 healthy controls (HC). Saliva and faecal samples were collected from all individuals and used for DNA extraction to perform shotgun metagenomics (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). We first performed intra-tissue analysis by investigating compositional and functional microbial changes in gut and oral separately. Thereafter, we combined gut and oral data to perform predictive modelling using machine learning.
