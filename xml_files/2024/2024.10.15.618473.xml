However, dose limiting toxicity has hampered NAMPTi in clinical trials. To maximise the therapeutic window, we set out to identify predictive genomic biomarkers. Bioinformatic analysis and screening of a panel of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell lines revealed that cells with RAS/PI3K pathway mutations were sensitive to the NAMPTi FK866. Activity of olaparib and FK866 was associated with a reduction in nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and the PARP substrate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), with coincident increases in ROS production, DNA damage and apoptosis induction. Caspase 3/7 activity was upregulated to a greater extent in RAS/PI3K mutant cell lines. Finally, the combination significantly reduced omental tumour weight and increased overall survival in mice injected with ID8 <italic>Trp53<sup>-/-</sup>;Pten<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells.

The most common ovarian cancer subtype, high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), frequently harbours mutations in <italic>BRCA1/2</italic>, leading to a homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). HRD tumours are exquisitely sensitive to inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), such as olaparib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are approved in BRCA-mutated (BRCAm) patients for front-line maintenance therapy and maintenance in the recurrent setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. However, evidence is emerging suggesting that patients could benefit from PARPi-therapy independent of BRCAm status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Despite this, the majority of patients will relapse within 3 years while on PARPi maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, highlighting the need to identify combination therapies to tackle treatment resistance.</p><p id="P4">PARPs regulate cellular processes, such as DNA repair, by catalysing post-translational ADP-ribosylation. This involves the covalent attachment of one or more ADP-ribose units onto targets proteins, using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) as a substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The majority of NAD<sup>+</sup> is supplied through the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway, and the rate limiting step is catalysed by the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). NAMPT converts nicotinamide into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which is then used to synthesise NAD<sup>+<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Because of the link between NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism and PARP catalytic activity, groups have investigated whether use of a NAMPT inhibitor (NAMPTi) and PARPi combination could be beneficial. Encouragingly, PARPi/NAMPTi combinations have shown synergistic activity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, Ewing’s Sarcoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and HGSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However NAMPTis, such as FK866<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, have not proved successful as monotherapies in clinical trials largely because of toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Considering this, there is value in identifying predictive biomarkers to improve the therapeutic window and reduce NAMPTi-associated toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. To date only <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> loss has been identified as a potential biomarker for the combination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Interestingly, a post-hoc exploratory biomarker analysis from the ARIEL2 study revealed that rucaparib-treated patients harbouring alterations in genes involved in the RAS pathway or PI3K/AKT signalling (‘RAS/PI3K-mutant’) had poorer outcomes when compared to other groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. RAS proteins exert their functions through several effector pathways, particularly PI3K signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Given these pathways are frequently mutated in up to 45% of HGSC cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, and in other EOC subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, there is a need to identify therapeutic strategies that can extend the benefit of PARPis within this group of patients.</p><p id="P6">Hyperactivation of RAS/PI3K signalling results in uncontrolled proliferation and increased demands on cellular metabolism. In this context, NAD<sup>+</sup> recycling must increase to sustain high proliferation rates, because NAD<sup>+</sup> plays an essential role as a coenzyme in key cellular metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and the TCA cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Interestingly, a relationship between the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway and RAS/PI3K signalling is emerging. <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutant tumours have been shown to possess lower intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, reflecting increased metabolic demand. PTEN expression inversely correlates with <italic>NAMPT</italic> expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, and oncogenic <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> mutations can induce NAMPT overexpression, leading to NAMPTi sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Considering this, we hypothesised that RAS/PI3K-mutant EOC cells have an increased demand for NAD<sup>+</sup> that can be exploited with a NAMPTi, and consequently may exhibit greater responses to treatment with a PARPi/NAMPTi combination. To address this, we assessed the efficacy of a PARPi/NAMPTi combination <italic>in vitro</italic> using a panel of EOC cell lines, and <italic>in vivo</italic> using the ID8-<italic>Trp53<sup>-/-</sup>; Pten<sup>-/-</sup></italic>model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Our experiments demonstrate that RAS/PI3K-mutant EOC cells are sensitive to FK866, and benefit from combined treatment with olaparib and FK866. The combination has anti-cancer activity in a murine model of HGSC with a <italic>Pten</italic> deletion. Together our data demonstrate the utility of a PARPi/NAMPTi combination in EOC models with genomic alterations in RAS/PI3K-pathways and suggests these mutations could be used as a predictive biomarker.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>RAS/PI3K pathway mutant EOC cell lines are sensitive to the NAMPT inhibitor FK866</title><p id="P8">To investigate the role of NAMPT in EOC, data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancerrxgene.org/">https://www.cancerrxgene.org/</ext-link>) were analysed. This analysis demonstrated that ovarian cancer cell lines are not intrinsically sensitive to the NAMPTi FK866 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). However, when ovarian cancer cells were segregated based on their <italic>KRAS</italic> mutational status, FK866-sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub>) was more comparable to the most sensitive cell types (highly sensitive blood cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>)). A significant difference in FK866-sensitivity could be observed between <italic>KRAS</italic>-wildtype and -mutant ovarian cancer cells (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001).</p><p id="P9">To validate these findings, a panel of ten ovarian cancer cell lines was assembled, with genomic features that reflect different EOC subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The panel included six RAS/PI3K-wildtype cell lines. COV318, COV504 and 59M cells have <italic>TP53</italic> mutations.

COV644 cells do not possess mutations in these pathways. Four RAS/PI3K-mutant cell lines were included in the panel. A2780 cells possess <italic>BRAF</italic>, <italic>PI3K</italic> and <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations. HEY-A8 cells have <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations.

Finally, TOV21G cells have <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>PI3K</italic> and <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations. To assess their relative FK866 sensitivity, the panel was treated with the NAMPTi for 6-days and IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). This confirmed that the four RAS/PI3K-mutant lines were more sensitive to NAMPT-inhibition than the RAS/PI3K wildtype cell lines.</p><p id="P10">To investigate whether increased FK866 sensitivity in RAS/PI3K-mutant cell lines was due to increased depletion of NAD<sup>+</sup> pools, cells were treated with FK866 for 24-hours and NAD<sup>+</sup> assays were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). When treated with a low dose of FK866 (0.5nM) clear differences emerged. The three most sensitive RAS/PI3K mutant cell lines (A2780, OVCAR-8 and TOV21G) achieved the greatest reduction in their NAD<sup>+</sup> pools (&gt;82% reduction), whilst a ~65% reduction was achieved in the less-sensitive HEY-A8 cell line. Interestingly, the level of NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion was found to correlate with FK866 sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub>) (r = 0.8211, p = 0.0036) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). To gain further insight into the impact of FK866 on NMN and NAD<sup>+</sup> pools, a UPLC-MS/MS metabolomics assay was performed using COV318 (RAS/PI3K-wildtype) and OVCAR-8 (RAS/PI3K-mutant) cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>). This revealed that COV318 cells had larger NMN (~336% larger) and NAD<sup>+</sup> (~298% larger) pools when compared to OVCAR-8 cells under basal conditions. Furthermore, 24-hours treatment with 1nM FK866 reduced NMN and NAD<sup>+</sup> pools to a greater extent in OVCAR-8 cells (91% and 96%, respectively) when compared to COV318 (~51% and 68%, respectively).</p><p id="P11">NAMPT inhibition with FK866 inhibits ATP synthesis, which leads to the delayed induction of cell death, as NADH is a substrate for the mitochondrial electron transport chain and NAD<sup>+</sup> is a co-factor required for glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. To investigate the impact of FK866 treatment on ATP levels, the EOC panel was treated for 48-hours with FK866, and an ATP assay was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). This revealed 5nM FK866 could reduce ATP levels in the majority of EOC cell lines tested. However, the greatest reduction were observed in the RAS/PI3K-mutant cell lines (&gt;47%). Interestingly, the level of ATP depletion also correlated with FK866 sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub>) (r = 0.9119, p = 0.0002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Combined PARP and NAMPT inhibition is more effective in RAS/PI3K pathway mutant 3D spheroids</title><p id="P12">We evaluated whether FK866 could enhance PARPi responses in the EOC panel in 2D culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). In this experiment, cells were treated for 6-days with olaparib and low doses of FK866 (100pM or 500pM) that did not impact cell proliferation as monotherapy. Due to their increased FK866-sensitivity A2780, OVCAR-8 and TOV21G cells were only co-treated with 100pM FK866. In all cell lines tested co-treatment with FK866 reduced olaparib IC<sub>50</sub> values.

TOV21G cells were not included as they did not form spheroids. Interestingly, co-treatment with FK866 significantly improved PARPi responses in all three RAS/PI3K-mutant cell lines, but not in the RAS/PI3K-wildtype COV318 cell line.</p><p id="P13">Since inhibiting PARP activity is known to decrease NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, we also evaluated the influence of the PARPi/NAMPTi combination on NMN and NAD<sup>+</sup> pools using a UPLC-MS/MS metabolomics assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>). This revealed that 24-hours treatment with 1μM olaparib leads to a slight increase in NMN and NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in COV318 but not in OVCAR-8 cells. However, when cells were co-treated with olaparib and FK866, the NAMPTi-induced reduction of NMN/NAD<sup>+</sup> pools far outweighed any reduction in NMN/NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption caused by the inhibition of PARP activity (ADP-ribosylation).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Combined PARP and NAMPT inhibition induces apoptosis by depleting NMN and NAD<sup>+</sup> in RAS/PI3K pathway mutant EOC cell lines</title><p id="P14">Next, we assessed the influence of olaparib, FK866 and the combination on apoptosis induction in COV318 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>), A2780 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>) and TOV21G cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>).

There is evidence that suggests NAMPT-dependency in <italic>RAS</italic>-mutant tumours could be due to regulation of its expression by STAT5 (via the BRAF/ERK pathway)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. However, the PI3K/AKT-axis may also regulate NAMPT-dependency, as its expression has been shown to inversely correlate with PTEN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This highlights oncogenic activation of Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways can lead to the development of an actionable metabolic bottleneck in the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway.

Maintenance of MMP is essential to maintain the election transport chain to generate ATP. NAD<sup>+</sup> plays an important role in this process, its depletion (and NADH consequently) will limit the mitochondrial respiratory substrates availability, leading to a loss of MMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Indeed, our data demonstrate that in the RAS/PI3K-mutant A2780 cell line, FK866-treatment leads to a loss of MMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c,d</xref>). To our surprise, given PARP inhibition is reported to lead to mitochondrial protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, we did observe a significant loss of MMP compared to the vehicle group following olaparib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Furthermore, combined olaparib and FK866 treatment led to the largest MMP loss, although this was not statistically significant when compared to FK866-monotherapy.

In brief, medium was aspirated from wells and replaced with 50μL PBS, or 50μL PBS with diluted NAD<sup>+</sup> standards (50-2000nM) was added into cell free wells. 50μL 1% dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) with 0.2N NaOH was added to each well and plates were briefly mixed to ensure homogeneity and cell lysis. 50μL lysate was transferred into an empty well and 25μL 0.4N HCl was added. Plates were covered with foil and incubated for 15 minutes on a ThermoMixer® C (Eppendorf) heat block at 60°C. Plates were allowed to equilibrate for 10 minutes at RT before adding 25μL 0.5M Trizma® Base (Sigma-Aldrich, 93352) solution. 50μL of this mixture was then transferred into a white walled 96-well plate along with 50μL of the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH-Glo detection reagent, which was made up with reagent at the following ratio: 1000μL Luciferin Detection Reagent, 5μL Reductase enzyme, 5μL Reductase substrate, 5μL NAD Cycling Enzyme and 25μL NAD Cycling Substrate. Plates were mixed for 30 minutes at RT before luminescence was measured on a FLUOstar Omega Microplate reader (BMG LABTECH). Cell free wells were used as blanks to remove background luminescence. Data were normalised to VC wells. NAD<sup>+</sup> levels were determined by normalising to cell biomass (SRB assay).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>ROS assay</title><p id="P43">COV318, A2780, TOV21G and ID8 <italic>Trp53</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>Pten</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells were seeded into white 96-well plates, and a parallel clear 96-well plate was seeded for normalisation against cell biomass (SRB assay). After overnight incubation and cell attachment to the plates, medium was removed and 80μl of fresh DMEM media with 0.1% DMSO, FK866 and/or Olaparib was added to each well. During ROS rescue experiments, 2-hours prior to drug-treatment cells were pre-treated with 10mM NAC. The NAC concentration was reduced to 5mM during drug treatment. After 24-(human) or 48-hours (ID8) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was measured using ROS-Glo H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> assay (Promega, G8820) according to manufacturer’s manual. Briefly, 6-hours before the endpoint is reached, 20μL of combined H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> substrate (provided in the kit) and test compound were added to reach the final concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> substrate at 25μM and drug concentrations were kept unchanged. After a 6-hour incubation, 100μL ROS-Glo™ detection solution (provided in the kit) was added, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 20-minutes. Next, luminescence was measured using a FLUOstar CLARIOstar Plus Microplate Reader (BMG LABTECH). To subtract background signals, cell-free wells were processed using the same protocol. To correct for cell biomass, luminescence signal was normalised to SRB readings from the parallel plates (SRB assay).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Sulforhodamine B (SRB) cell growth assay</title><p id="P44">Human cell lines were seeded on 96-well plates at a pre-determined density. The following day, wells were aspirated and replaced with medium containing vehicle (0.1% DMSO), FK866 (50pM-50nM) (APExBIO, A4381) or olaparib (1nM-200μM) (Selleckchem, S1060). Both inhibitors were prepared in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, D2650). Where indicated, drugs were added in combination and/or medium was supplemented with 250μM of NMN (Sigma-Aldrich, N3501). After 3- (ID8) or 6-days (Human) of treatment, cells were fixed for 1 hour at 4°C with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution (Sigma-Aldrich, T6399). Wells were washed with water and left to dry at room temperature (RT) overnight. Cells were stained for 30 minutes at RT with 0.4% SRB (Sigma-Aldrich, 230162) solution (w/v) in 1% (v/v) acetic acid (ThermoFisher, 10005920). Wells were washed four times with 1% acetic acid (v/v) to remove excess dye and plates were left to dry overnight at RT. 200μL 10mM Tris Base solution (Sigma-Aldrich, T1699) was added to wells and plates were placed on a shaker to solubilise the protein bound SRB dye. Absorbance was then measured on a SpectraMax Gemini XPS Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices) at 565nm. A minimum of three technical replicates were used for each condition. Cell free wells were used as blanks to remove background absorbance.
