Mitoribosomes are specific ribosomes found in mitochondria, which have been shown to be remarkably diverse across eukaryotic lineages. In plants, they possess unique features, including additional rRNA domains stabilized by numerous pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms of translation by plant mitoribosomes remain largely unknown. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to provide a high-resolution structural characterization of the flowering plant mitoribosome, in translating and maturation states. The structure reveals the mitoribosome bound to tRNA in the peptidyl site, along with a segment of mRNA and a nascent polypeptide. Moreover, we identify an extensive set of ribosomal RNA modifications that we confirmed by nanopore sequencing. Additionally, we observe a late assembly intermediate of the small ribosomal subunit, in complex with the RsgA assembly factor. This reveals how a plant-specific extension of RsgA blocks the mRNA channel to prevent premature mRNA association before complete small subunit maturation. Our findings elucidate key aspects of translation in flowering plant mitochondria, revealing its distinct features compared to other eukaryotic lineages.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Mitochondria are vital organelles found in nearly all eukaryotic organisms, where they play a central role in energy production and metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Through oxidative phosphorylation, these organelles are responsible for recycling ADP to ATP, the energy currency of the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. They are also involved in numerous core cellular functions, such as calcium signaling, apoptosis, the synthesis of heme and other essential metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In photosynthetic eukaryotes, such as plants and algae, the role of mitochondria is closely linked to that of chloroplasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. While chloroplasts are responsible for producing energy-rich molecules, they are not capable of carrying out all the necessary metabolic processes on their own<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. To overcome this limitation, photosynthetic organisms rely on their mitochondria to carry out these metabolic processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Due to their endosymbiotic origin, mitochondria possess their own genomes and specific gene expression machineries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Among these, the mitochondrial ribosome (called mitoribosome hereafter) is an essential molecular machine that synthesizes proteins within the organelle. In particular, some genes encoding subunits of respiratory complexes are encoded in mitochondrial genomes and mitoribosomes are thus essential for the biogenesis of oxidative phosphorylation complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Because respiratory proteins are often intrinsic membrane proteins, mitoribosomes have evolved and specialized for the synthesis of these hydrophobic proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the study of mitoribosomes at high resolution, providing valuable insights into their composition, architecture and function. Mitoribosomes were characterized in a wide diversity of eukaryotes, i.e., in mammals, fungi, kinetoplasts, ciliates, flowering plants and green alga<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. These studies have revealed the remarkable diversity of mitoribosome composition and structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Still, a common feature of mitoribosomes is their high protein content, with at least 60 novel ribosomal proteins occurring in the respective mitoribosomes as compared to the bacterial ribosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Interestingly, helical repeat proteins such as pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are prevalent among mitoribosome-specific proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The initial description of mammalian mitoribosomes has shown that ribosomal RNA content is extremely reduced in these eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. This led to the hypothesis that the contraction of rRNA in mitoribosomes could be compensated by increased numbers of ribosomal proteins. Likewise, this suggested that mitoribosomes could follow an evolutionary trend to reduce rRNA size, that could ultimately result in the complete loss of rRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Even though this model applies to several eukaryotes, it was contradicted by the characterization of fungal and, in particular, of flowering plant mitoribosomes that contain both increased numbers of proteins and expanded rRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Flowering plant mitoribosomes were characterized at the biochemical and structural level in the closely related Brassicaceae species Arabidopsis and cauliflower<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. This revealed a very distinctive, enlarged mitoribosome with several plant-specific ribosomal proteins, among which 10 are PPR proteins. The small subunit (SSU) is particularly singular as it is larger than the ribosomal large subunit (LSU) and contains a distinctive plant-specific elongated domain on the head of the SSU<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Despite these advances, many features of plant mitochondrial translation remain elusive. For instance, how these ribosomes assemble, are tethered to the membrane or the way mRNAs are recruited to the SSU remain speculative. Likewise, the molecular details of the actual translation process catalyzed by the plant mitoribosome are unknown.</p><p id="P5">To address some of these open questions, we produced a sub 3 Å cryo-EM structure of the flowering plants mitoribosome. It reveals new details about rRNA modifications and previously unaccounted r-proteins. Along with the improved resolution, we also describe the structure of a translating mitoribosome with mRNA and a P-site tRNA, stalled in the presence of chloramphenicol. Moreover, a very late assembly intermediate of the SSU, bound with the assembly factor RsgA, was obtained revealing the function of its plant-specific domain and thus for the first time the mode of action of this factor in the context of a mitoribosome.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results &amp; Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>Structure determination</title><p id="P6">To improve our understanding of flowering plant-specific translation processes, we purified mitochondria from cauliflower and subsequently purified mitoribosomes (see methods). We purified them in the presence of chloramphenicol or non-hydrolysable GTP analog to stall translation and/or other processes that might require GTP hydrolysis. Four datasets were collected (see methods), resulting in the three main structures presented here: a full ribosome structure without tRNA resolved to 2.1 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">2</xref>), a stalled ribosome harboring a P-site tRNA and mRNA resolved to 3.0 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig 3</xref>), and a late SSU assembly intermediate in presence of the assembly factor RsgA obtained at 2.2 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Fig 4</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Given the large flexible extensions of this mitoribosome, we first used 3D Flexible Refinement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie 1</xref>), to investigate the major modes of motion of its different domains. On top of the classical ratcheting motion, we also observed the head extension motion, previously described, but also the movement of the SSU foot and of the LSU back extension. Then, extensive masking and focused refinements revealed parts of the mitoribosome that remained poorly resolved in the previous studies, notably the SSU head extension. Given the high local resolution for the different parts of the ribosome (up to 1.8 Å locally, permitting to place ions and solvent molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">2</xref>)), we decided to adopt an unbiased approach to rebuild and identify the ribosomal proteins. We used ModelAngelo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> to sequence the proteins directly from the density and the resulting models were verified against the protein candidates previously obtained by MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. This allowed the identification of a total of 85 proteins (47 in the LSU and 38 in the SSU) which we consider to be the complete set of core r-proteins of this mitoribosome (complete table of proteins <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Supplementary Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">3</xref>). Compared to the previous structure, we discovered new proteins and features that were previously unidentified.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Newly resolved features</title><p id="P8">In the large subunit, the remodeled domain III of the 26S rRNA on the LSU back is highly flexible (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie 1</xref>) and was thus poorly resolved. There, the rRNA is remodeled mainly by PPR proteins mL104 (rPPR9) and mL101 (rPPR4). Using focused refinement, we resolved it in greater detail, notably their interaction with the rRNA. Additionally, it also revealed the presence of a new r-protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 5a-d</xref>). This protein is an isoform of bL25m, that we name bL25m-2, interacting with both the remodeled domain III and mL101. There, it shapes and stabilizes the remodeled domain III by mimicking the interaction of bL25m with the 5S and 26S rRNA located between the L7/L12 stalk and the base of the Central Protuberance (CP) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). Focused refinement on the L7/L12 stalk revealed the presence of mL54 (conserved with algae, mammals and yeast) which was previously identified only by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>). uL2m is split into two parts in the flowering plants, one encoded in the mitochondrial genome (N-terminal portion) and one in the nuclear genome (C-terminal portion), and forms an intricate network of protein-protein interactions with multiple r-proteins. First it interacts with mL86, and then extends far away from the uL2 region to closely interact with bL28m, bL9m as well as mL102 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The largest PPR protein of the LSU, mL102 (rPPR5), contacts the 26S rRNA at different positions of the LSU plus several proteins, namely uL15m, mL59/mL64 and the N-ter portion of uL2m. mL102 contributes to the reorganization of the domain I of the 26S rRNA mostly through its N-ter part (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). We could resolve how the domain I plant-specific helices p15, p17 and p21-22 are folded. This portion of the rRNA and the protein mL102 are less well resolved because they extend far into the solvent, but also because they might be involved in membrane interaction during translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In the stalled state of the mitoribosome (described later) we could also partially resolve uL1m on the L1 stalk (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The small subunit is where the model improved the most, allowing clear identification of several proteins that were previously modeled but not identified. The most drastic improvement can be observed on the SSU head extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). In flowering plants, the 18S rRNA harbors a large extension at the tip of the SSU’s head, rooting from h39 of domain 3’M. Here we resolve this specific domain to approximate 4Å (compared to the previously reported 8Å). This allowed, both thanks to improved resolution and improved structure prediction using AlphaFold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, the unambiguous identification of the two r-proteins located there (rPPR6 and rPPR8) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>), as well as building a more accurate rRNA. mS80 (rPPR6) is positioned at the base of the head extension, whereas mS81 (rPPR8) wraps around and follows the shape of the head extension. Two PPR modules are found, the longest one (aa 219-656) follows the two parallel RNA helices, while the second one (aa 76-218) is bent almost 90° relative to the first one, and helps form the tip of the SSU head extension.</p><p id="P11">On the opposite side of the SSU, at the foot, we clearly identify mS76 (rPPR1) and mS83 (rPPR10), which were previously modeled as Unknown proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). mS76 contributes to the stabilization of the h6 helix of domain 5’ of the 18S rRNA whereas mS83 mostly contributes to the stabilization of h44 tip, as well as h6. A recent study has performed the functional analysis of mS83 (called mTRAN by authors)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. A global impairment of mitochondrial translation in mS83 mutants was observed and mS83 was found to be able to bind RNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. The authors proposed that mS83 is a general factor for translation initiation in plant mitochondria. However, here we place mS83 at the tip of the foot of the SSU, interacting with plant specific rRNA expansion segments, which is not consistent with a role in translation initiation.</p><p id="P12">At the exit of the mRNA channel we find mS77, another PPR protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>). It wraps around the SSU body, rooting from the SSU protuberance, where it is anchored and extends in the back of the SSU, close to the mRNA exit channel where its PPR domain is found. Originally listed as two proteins in UNIPROT (Q8LEZ4, NFD5, N-ter part, making part of the body protuberance and Q940Z1, PPR51, C-terminal part containing the PPR motifs), we instead describe it as a single protein like in the UNIPROT entry A0A654ECT9. Moreover, at low threshold we also observe an additional density at the tip of the PPR domain, suggesting that this protein might act as a platform, to recruit specific plant translation factors, or allow polysome formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>). Next to this protein, we also identify a small portion of the N-terminal part of mS86 (GRBP6), (residues 1 to 28, the protein being 155aa), sandwiched in between uS2m and mS23 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Fig. 7c</xref>). mS86 was previously identified through mass spectrometry but not resolved in the structure. Its position next to the mRNA exit channel may suggest an interaction with mRNA, like mS77, or a role in polysome formation. These additional proteins might also have been recruited to the exit channel to compensate for the absence of uS1.</p><p id="P13">Additionally, on the head of the SSU, we fully resolve the composition of the protein protuberance located close to the beak. It is formed by mS31/mS46, that is also newly identified, mS35, and uS3m, which was predicted to form part of this protuberance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>). Together they form an intricate network of proteins close to the mRNA entrance channel. Finally, the improved resolution reveals the contacts between the LSU’s CP to SSU head via bL31m, mL40 and mL46, and unravel the presence of ATP in mS29 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig 8a</xref>), that is also present in human mitoribosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">Altogether, out of the 85 mitoribosomal proteins, 53 are conserved with bacteria, 22 are shared with mitoribosome of other eukaryotic species and 10 proteins are specific to flowering plants, among which 8 are PPR proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13">Supplementary Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>rRNA modifications of the plant mitoribosome</title><p id="P15">rRNA modifications are hallmarks of subunit maturation towards a translationally active ribosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. To date, the rRNA modifications present in plant mitochondria have not been described. Our map resolution allowed us to identify in total 19 rRNA modifications, 6 in SSU and 13 in LSU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-b</xref>). Additionally, we used nanopore direct RNA sequencing of the native cauliflower rRNAs to confirm the modifications detected in the structure or identify others when the map resolution was not adequate for their visual identification. Nanopore RNA sequencing has been successfully applied before to detect RNA modifications, for instance in ribosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. This second approach indicated the presence of 24 rRNA modifications, 10 in SSU and 14 in LSU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In total, structure inspection and nanopore sequencing resulted in the identification of 31 rRNA modifications, 11 being in the SSU and 20 in the LSU, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Surprisingly, this number deviates considerably from the ones of the scarcely modified mammalian or yeast mitoribosomes that contain 10 and 5 rRNA modifications, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">We found 9 types of base modifications, including an extensive network of pseudouridines (Ψ) and 3 types of 2’-O ribose methylation (Nm). Similar to their bacterial and cytosolic counterparts, rRNA modifications of the plant mitoribosome are located in clusters close to functionally important sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Near the decoding center, we located the universally conserved methylated residues m<sup>6</sup><sub>2</sub>A1827 and m<sup>6</sup><sub>2</sub>A1828. These adjacent modified adenosines aid the P-site in acquiring its mature conformation by establishing contact between helices h44 and h45. In this vicinity, m<sup>2</sup>G1825 of h45 and two modifications located at the base of h44, m<sup>3</sup>U1807 and m<sup>4</sup>Cm1664 were further identified, with the former two being characterized for the first time in a mitoribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). m<sup>4</sup>Cm1664 interacts directly with the mRNA and has been proposed to fine-tune the decoding center in bacteria by preventing translation initiation at the alternative initiation codon AUU and by maintaining the reading frame<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">Another cluster of rRNA modifications was observed around the peptidyl transferase center (PTC). Among them, we were able to identify the highly conserved Gm2560 and Um2857 at the helices 80 and h92, respectively. Gm2560 is in the P-loop region and supports the positioning of the P-tRNA by interacting with its CCA-end, whereas Um2857 resides in the A-loop region and assists in the accommodation of the tRNA at the A-site. Interestingly, mammalian mitoribosomes possess an additional 2’-O methylation at the adjacent G2858 residue, which we could not model due to lower resolution in that region. Nonetheless, our nanopore data point to the existence of a modification on this specific residue, thus we do not rule out the existence of Gm2858. The A-tRNA accommodation is further stabilized by the pseudouridine Ψ2885, similar to human mitoribosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. The domain IV of the LSU rRNA establishes the intersubunit bridges of group B2, crucial for ribosome assembly and translation. In this region, we identified the methylated sites m<sup>5</sup>U2257 (h70) and m<sup>5</sup>C2280 (h71) as well as the pseudouridine Ψ2188 (h68) which is plant-specific. Moreover, our nanopore data suggests the potential presence of four additional pseudouridylation sites in helix 69, although these sites could not be confirmed by cryo-EM, as the resolution is lower in that area of the map. Finally, the presence of the modified nucleotide m<sup>2</sup>A2808 was observed at the PTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The methyl group of m<sup>2</sup>A2808 extends its stacking range allowing the interaction with A2377, thus promoting the folding of their cognate single-stranded rRNA segments to form the peptide exit tunnel wall.</p><p id="P18">Overall, the plant mitoribosome is highly modified and has retained a significant number of the modifications present in its bacterial ancestor. Thus, it appears to have followed an evolutionary route that allowed for the preservation of many bacterial modifications in direct contrast to its mammalian and yeast counterparts who were able to retain only a few. This also suggests that many bacterial modification enzymes must be conserved in plants, or have been replaced by new ones, to maintain these modifications.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Translating ribosome</title><p id="P19">To trap ribosomes in translation states, we collected a dataset for mitoribosomes purified from mitochondria and ribosomes treated with chloramphenicol, a classical inhibitor of bacterial-type ribosomes. Chloramphenicol binds to the PTC of the ribosome, stalling translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. During data processing, we identified a subclass corresponding to mitoribosomes in a P-site tRNA-accommodated state, which we resolved to approximately 3 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). This allowed us to build a detailed model that includes the tRNA, the messenger RNA path, the binding site of chloramphenicol, and the peptide route through the peptide channel.</p><p id="P20">At the PTC, within the LSU, we fully resolved the binding site of chloramphenicol, responsible for stalling the ribosome in the P-site tRNA-accommodated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). At this site, the first four amino acids of the nascent peptide chain were clearly visible. Since this represents a mix of averaged densities from different nascent proteins, we modeled it as poly-alanine. At lower threshold, we could observe the complete peptide chain extending from the PTC to the peptide exit via the peptide tunnel. Interestingly, the structure of the peptide tunnel and exit was found to be very similar to that of bacterial ribosomes, with less extreme adaptations compared to animals, yeast, and green algae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>.

This is not surprising, as the PTC is one of the most highly conserved regions of the ribosome, alongside the decoding center<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. The chloramphenicol binding in the mitoribosome is positioned similarly to its location in bacterial ribosomes, reinforcing the conserved nature of its inhibitory mechanism across species.</p><p id="P22">In the decoding center of the small subunit (SSU), we also observed the mRNA being translated, from which we resolved six nucleotides, three of which were interacting with the anticodon loop of the stalled tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Similar to the peptide observed at the PTC, these nucleotides represent an averaged mix of densities from different mRNAs. Nonetheless, we were able to observe how they are accommodated within the small subunit. Here, conserved residues of the 18S rRNA, G956, and C1746 help stack and position the tRNA. The ribosomal protein uS13m probes the base of the tRNA anticodon region with its C-terminal extension, behaving in a manner identical to bacterial ribosomes, while uS9m, which has a slightly extended C-terminus compared to its bacterial counterpart, probes a different region of the tRNA anticodon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P23">At a lower threshold, we could also visualize densities corresponding to mRNA at the entry and exit sites of the mRNA channel, allowing us to trace the full putative mRNA path within the SSU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). At the entry point, the conserved core of proteins uS4m, uS5m, and uS3m (located on the head of the SSU) form the majority of the entry channel. Extensions of uS5m and a portion of uS4m, which form parts of the SSU body protuberance, further delineate and extend the entrance of the mRNA channel. On the SSU head, uS3m, together with mS31/46 and mS35, contributes to the SSU head protuberance near the beak. Notably, 300 amino acids from the N-terminus of mS31/46 remain unresolved and point toward the solvent, in close proximity to the mRNA entrance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>). Altogether, the SSU body and head protuberances located near the mRNA entry channel could play a role in species-specific recruitment of mRNA or polysome formation, which has been observed <italic>in situ</italic> in Chlamydomonas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P24">On the opposite side, at the mRNA exit, the ribosomal proteins uS11m, bS21m, and the mitochondria-specific mS37 form the exit channel. Additionally, we observed a larger portion of mS86 in the ribosome charged with tRNA and mRNA compared to empty ribosomes. An additional helix in mS86 is stabilized up to residue 54 (compared to 28 amino acids in the empty ribosome) at the mRNA exit channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). The fact that this protein is stabilized in the stalled ribosomes, where mRNA is present, supports the hypothesis that mS86 may be important for mRNA interaction and/or polysome formation.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>A late SSU assembly intermediate</title><p id="P25">Mitoribosome biogenesis is coordinated by the orchestrated action of a series of assembly and auxiliary factors that guide the rRNA to adopt its mature conformation and in parallel drive the integration of the complete set of ribosomal proteins to generate two functional ribosomal subunits. Structural and mechanistic insights into the assembly pathway of mitoribosomes have been recently provided in kinetoplastid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> and yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, what assembly factors participate in the biogenesis of plant mitoribosomes and the mechanisms under which they operate, remain elusive. To address these questions, we tried to capture native assembly intermediates by stalling the assembly process of the plant mitoribosome. We targeted assembly factors of the GTPase family, known to be important enzymes for ribosome maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. To do so, we isolated mitoribosomes in the presence of a non-hydrolysable GTP analog, GTPγS. Even though no clear new state of the fully assembled mitoribosome could be identified, analysis of the GTP analog SSU only fraction revealed a subclass of 208,855 particles with an additional density located near the decoding center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). This class reached 2.2 Å resolution globally, allowing us to directly identify the additional factor from the density as the assembly factor RsgA. This is the first description of RsgA as part of an assembly intermediate in any mitoribosome. RsgA adopts a conformation where its central GTPase domain docks at the decoding center of the SSU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>) while its oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding-fold domain (OB-domain) spans towards the uS12m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>) and the Zinc-binding domain interacts with the head of the SSU via helix 29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). This conformation is similar to the one observed in bacterial ribosomes bound to RsgA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. The bacterial RsgA is considered to act as a late checkpoint for the maturation state of the decoding center, via its direct interaction with h44<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. Consistent with this notion, we observed a similar interaction of Arg<sup>84</sup> with A1802 of h44. Also, considering the overall maturation state of the SSU, the plant RsgA acts upon the late steps of the SSU biogenesis. Despite the similarities shared by the two homologs, plant RsgA possesses a 66 amino-acid long C-terminal extension that appears to have a dual function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). First, it reinforces the positioning of RsgA by interacting with mS33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>), and second adopts a certain conformation that allows its entry into the mRNA channel. Remarkably, the plant-specific extension folds into an alpha-helix that threads into the mRNA channel via its placement in between uS3m, uS5m, and uS4m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Therefore, RsgA blocks the mRNA channel and prevents the premature accommodation of the mRNA, during the assembly process. The function of sequestering the immature SSU particles from those that are fully functional is pivotal and is served by various mechanisms along the assembly pathway, mainly by making the mRNA channel inaccessible. Interestingly, during the late stages of SSU biogenesis of the human mitoribosome, this role is performed by the assembly factor RBFA, which has acquired a mitochondria-specific C-terminal extension that spans across the mRNA channel preventing the mRNA recruitment. It is apparent that the plant RsgA and the human RBFA are two evolutionary unrelated assembly factors, that have independently acquired lineage-specific extensions in their amino acid sequence. These extensions perform a novel similar function, expanding their basic functional repertoire in the assembly process. Thus, these assembly factors constitute a fine example of convergent evolution between plants and human mitochondria.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P26">In this study, we provide new insights into the function and assembly of the translation apparatus in flowering plants using cryo-EM. While it was already known that plant mitoribosomes exhibit significant structural complexity, with expanded rRNA domains and numerous plant-specific ribosomal proteins, the data presented here provide significantly improved resolution and identify previously uncharacterized r-proteins. Furthermore, we detected novel features such as nucleotide modifications, revealing a high number of rRNA modifications in plant mitoribosomes as compared to mammalian and yeast mitoribosomes. These modifications are located near functionally critical regions such as the decoding center and the peptidyl transferase center, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of certain bacterial features in plant mitoribosomes. Although some modifications were acquired during the evolution of eukaryotes, most rRNA modifications represent ancestral features of mitoribosomes. Furthermore, our study identifies the plant specificities of key functional domains of the mitoribosome, in particular the decoding center and mRNA path as well as the peptidyl transfer center, further elucidating unique aspects of translation in plant mitochondria. Finally, we captured a late-stage assembly intermediate of the mitoribosome, bound to the assembly factor RsgA. This interaction reveals the mechanism by which RsgA ensures the proper maturation of the small subunit by blocking the mRNA channel during assembly, thanks to a plant-specific domain.</p><p id="P27">Altogether, this study advances our understanding of the plant mitochondrial translation apparatus structure and function, revealing novel features that distinguish plant mitoribosomes from their counterparts in other eukaryotes as well as in prokaryotes. These results show that while plant mitoribosomes have followed a distinct evolutionary path, they have preserved bacterial-like rRNA modifications in their comparatively well-conserved core domains while also incorporating unique plant-specific proteins and evolving specific assembly mechanisms. These structural features underscore the functional complexity and evolutionary adaptations of plant mitoribosomes, possibly required to fulfil plant-specific functions, such as decoding a set of mRNAs that are more diverse and more complex than in other eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Mitochondria and ribosome purification</title><p id="P28">Mitochondria from cauliflower were purified as previously described (Waltz 2019; Waltz 2020; Waltz 2021).
