Symptoms usually manifest in the first year of life and include prolonged severe seizures, developmental delay and severe intellectual disability. DS patients have an increased mortality rate, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Approximately 90% of patients carry a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>SCN1A</italic> gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium ion channel, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1. The Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 channel is expressed in the brain and at a lower level, in the heart. Previous studies have identified a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) which specifically downregulates <italic>SCN1A</italic> gene expression. This natural antisense transcript (NAT) can be modulated by AntagoNATs, small synthetic oligonucleotides developed to inhibit NAT function. In a DS mouse model, AntagoNATs were shown to modulate <italic>Scn1a</italic> expression by targeting the <italic>Scn1a</italic> NAT, improving seizure frequency after repeated administration. Here, we have developed novel AntagoNATs and incorporated these into a clinically relevant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) gene therapy vector, to test in a DS mouse model (<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) and provide a one-off treatment approach.</p><p id="P2">Eighteen AntagoNATs were tested <italic>in vitro</italic>; from the best performing candidates, we selected two AntagoNAT sequences (K &amp; H) for <italic>in vivo</italic> testing as they had the highest homology (90%) to human <italic>SCN1A</italic> NAT. We administered both vectors to newborn <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice via intracerebroventricular (ICV) and intravenous (IV) injection to target the brain and heart. AAV9-AntagoNAT-H significantly increased survival, decreased febrile seizures and reduced spontaneous seizure frequency compared to the PBS control group. When administered at P14 by ICV and IV injection, AAV9-AntagoNAT-H increased survival. In this proof-of-concept study, we have demonstrated for the first time the delivery of AntagoNAT technology via an</p><p id="P3">AAV9 vector and thus offering the possibility of a one-time treatment for DS patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SMEI</kwd><kwd>Gene Therapy</kwd><kwd>AAV</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe early onset genetic epilepsy, which manifests in the first year of life, with an incidence of 1 in 15,400 to 1 in 40,900 live births world-wide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> DS patients exhibit frequent prolonged febrile and afebrile seizures, generalised tonic or hemiclonic seizures, status epilepticus events, with cognitive decline, developmental delay, ataxia and many other comorbidities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> Unfortunately, DS patients have an increased mortality rate, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">More than 90% of DS patients harbour a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>SCN1A</italic> gene, which encodes the a subunit of the voltage-gated ion channel, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> In the human brain, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 expression has been identified in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA2, layer V/VI of the cortex, granular layer, molecular layer, deep nuclei and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> Animal studies have also identified Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 expression in the hippocampus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> thalamus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> deep cerebellar nuclei,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and the spinal cord,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> specifically in inhibitory interneurons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Purkinje neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and CA1 pyramidal cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 has been detected in the human heart and studies have investigated altered electrical cardiac function in DS patients and mouse model, suggesting a possible contribution to SUDEP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup></p><p id="P6">Multiple models of DS have been established to study disease mechanisms, which have demonstrated spontaneous seizures, febrile seizures, SUDEP, cognitive deficits, and other comorbidities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> Many of these models have shown a notable dependence on genetic background.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> Yu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> developed a heterozygous loss of function DS model (<italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) where <italic>Scn1a</italic> exon 25 was disrupted. The study revealed, <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice on a C57BL/6J strain resulted in a more severe disease phenotype than on a 129/SvJ background. They also developed a mix DS model 129/SvJ:C57BL/6J, demonstrating that Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 loss of function in inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus resulted in spontaneous seizures and increased mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> Cheah et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> provided further evidence of the importance of GABAergic interneurons in DS by selectively deleting <italic>Scn1a</italic> in forebrain GABAergic neurons, which also resulted in tonic-clonic seizures, febrile seizures and premature death. Another <italic>Scn1a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> model was developed by deleting the first coding exon of <italic>Scn1a</italic> in a mixed 129/SvJ:C57BL/6J background strain.

DS patients demonstrate autonomic symptoms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> in some cases resulting in reduced heart rate variability, which may act as a potential biomarker for SUDEP risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> DS mouse model have also showed an increase of sodium currents in ventricular myocytes resulting in altered electrical cardiac function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup></p><p id="P8">Overall, the DS mouse model studies have demonstrated that the loss of <italic>Scn1a</italic> in multiple regions of the brain and the association of the heart contributes to disease phenotype. Therefore, there is a need to develop a wide-spread genetic therapy approach to restore function of <italic>SCN1A</italic> in multiple neuronal cells and the heart.</p><p id="P9">Current anti-seizure medications such as valproate, stiripentol and clobazam<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> are often ineffective in reducing seizure frequency and other comorbidities associated with DS. Therefore, there is a great need for alternative therapies. Gene supplementation therapy using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have demonstrated tremendous clinical success for severe early onset neurological disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> However, the <italic>SCN1A</italic> gene (6kb), exceeds the packaging capacity of AAV (~4.7kb).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> Therefore, gene supplementation using a single AAV is not feasible for treating <italic>SCN1A</italic> related DS. Gene supplementation approach using an Adenoviral vector has been developed for DS, as it has a larger packaging capacity than AAV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> Numerous other genetic therapies for DS have been developed which aim to upregulate <italic>SCN1A</italic> expression and some of these are in clinical trials. Stoke Therapeutics have developed an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy, that aims to increase the synthesis of productive <italic>Scn1a</italic> mRNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> This treatment is currently in Phase 1/2a clinical trials, where the ASO is delivered via repeated intrathecal delivery to DS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> Encoded Therapeutics have also developed an AAV9 based therapy to deliver a transcription factor to upregulate <italic>SCN1A</italic> specifically in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> which is currently in Phase 1/2 clinical trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup></p><p id="P10">AntagoNATs are small synthetic oligonucleotides that modulate RNA function, in this case by targeting the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) from the natural antisense transcript (NAT) of <italic>SCN1A</italic>.
