Perspective-taking is usually an embodied egocentric process whereby people mentally rotate themselves away from their physical location into the other’s orientation. This is accompanied by increased theta-band (3–7 Hz) brain oscillations within a widespread fronto-parietal cortical network including the temporoparietal junction. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been reported to experience challenges with high-level perspective-taking, particularly when adopting embodied strategies. To investigate the potential neurophysiological basis of these autism-related individual differences, we used magnetoencephalography in combination with a well-replicated perspective-taking paradigm in a group of 18 autistic and 17 age-matched non-autistic adolescents. Findings revealed that increasing the angle between self and other perspective resulted in prolonged reaction times for the autistic group during perspective-taking. This was accompanied by reduced theta power across a wide network of regions typically active during social cognitive tasks. On the other hand, the autistic group showed greater alpha power decreases in visual cortex compared with the non-autistic group across all perspective-taking conditions. These divergent theta and alpha power effects, coupled with steeper response time slopes, suggest that autistic individuals may rely more on alternative cognitive strategies, such as mental object rotation, rather than an egocentric embodied approach. Finally, no group differences were found when participants were asked to track, rather than take, another’s viewpoint, suggesting that autism-related individual differences are specific to high-level perspective-taking.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Humans possess highly developed social skills that allow us to imagine what others might be experiencing, thinking or feeling to an extent not shared by other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Tomasello et al., 2005</xref>). One important aspect of this is the ability to understand another’s visuospatial experience of the world – a skill termed visuospatial perspective taking, VPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Flavell et al., 1981</xref>). In this study, we used MEG to investigate the neurocognitive basis of perspective-taking between autistic adolescents and age-matched non-autistic participants.</p><sec id="S2"><title>Perspective-Taking versus Perspective Tracking</title><p id="P3">Considering another’s visuospatial perspective of the world can take one of two forms or levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Flavell, Everett, Croft, &amp; Flavell, 1981</xref>). First, one can track another’s view (“can the other person see the object?”), sometimes termed level 1 perspective-taking, VPT-1. Second, one can understand <italic>how</italic> the world looks from another’s point of view (“how does the world look like to the other person?”), also termed level 2 perspective-taking, VPT-2. Experimentally, perspective-<italic>tracking</italic> (VPT-1) is often tested by employing visibility judgements (e.g. “is the target visible or occluded from the other’s viewpoint?”, Michelon &amp; Zacks, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kessler &amp; Rutherford, 2010</xref>; for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Samuel et al., 2024</xref>), while perspective-<italic>taking</italic> (VPT-2) is typically measured by asking participants how a visual scene would appear from another’s distinct visual perspective (e.g. “is the object to the left or right from the other’s viewpoint?” e.g. Michelon &amp; Zacks, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hamilton, Brindley &amp; Frith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kessler &amp; Rutherford, 2010</xref>, for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Samuel et al., 2024</xref>). The two processes have been related to different developmental stages, with perspective-tracking emerging around age 2, and perspective-taking emerging around ages 4-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Flavell et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gzesh &amp; Surber, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Moll &amp; Tomasello, 2006</xref>). Furthermore perspective-tracking has been observed in other species such as apes and corvids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bugnyar et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bräuer et al. 2007</xref>), whereas perspective-taking seems to be uniquely human (Karg et al., 2016).</p><p id="P4">There is growing evidence that perspective-taking (VPT-2) typically recruits an embodied cognitive process, grounded in the internal bodily and action representations of the observer. Using posture manipulations, several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gooding-Williams et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kessler &amp; Rutherford, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kessler &amp; Thomson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Surtees et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) have shown that perspective-taking engages large parts of the neuronal bases of the body schema, i.e. the cortical correlates of the internal representation of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Coslett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Medina et al., 2009</xref>), with some studies also showing that this embodied process is only engaged during VPT-2 but not during VPT-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kessler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kessler &amp; Rutherford, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Martin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that high-level perspective-taking involves the simulated rotation of the embodied self into another’s orientation and perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kessler &amp; Thomson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Surtees et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In other words, humans literally rotate their own perspective to understand another’s viewpoint. It is important to note that embodied mental self-rotation is not engaged during level-1 perspective-tracking, which seems to recruit a simpler process of inferring another’s line of sight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kessler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kessler &amp; Rutherford, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Martin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zacks &amp; Michelon, 2005</xref>); for a recent discussion see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Samuel et al., (2024)</xref>. Interestingly, there are individual differences in the efficiency of this embodied strategy, with East-Asian participants faster than Western participants, potentially reflecting an egocentric bias in Western cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kessler et al., 2014</xref>) and with participants with lower social skills scores showing slower perspective taking times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brunyé et al., 2012</xref>) and less embodiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kessler &amp; Wang, 2012</xref>), potentially reflecting alternative strategies when computing another’s perspective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kessler &amp; Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Samuel, 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>The Neural Correlates of Embodied Perspective-Taking</title><p id="P5">Since the advent of modern brain imaging there has been steady progress in characterising the neural correlates of embodied perspective-taking. In particular, the posterior division of the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) (Igelström, Webb and Graziano 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bzdok et al. 2013</xref>), seems to play a key role in perspective-taking and more generally in representing other’s mental states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bögels et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Schurz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Van Overwalle, 2011</xref>). Using MEG, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al. (2016)</xref> investigated embodied simulation during perspective-taking using a well replicated paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kessler &amp; Rutherford, 2010</xref>). In contrast to perspective-<italic>tracking (visibility judgements)</italic>, increases in low-frequency theta-band oscillations (3-7Hz) were found for both the cognitive effort (amount of angular disparity between self vs. other’s viewpoint) and for embodied processing (posture congruence) during perspective-<italic>taking (directionality judgements)</italic>. These effects converged in the right pTPJ for perspective-taking, while for tracking the frontal eye fields were primarily involved, corroborating previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Grosbras et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wallentin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wallentin et al., 2008</xref>) in support of a gaze-based line-of-sight mechanism.</p><p id="P6">Brain stimulation has also been used to add causal evidence to these neuroimaging findings. Using disruptive dual-pulse TMS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., (2016)</xref> demonstrated that interfering with the TPJ significantly reduced congruent posture effects, strongly supporting the role of embodiment in perspective-taking. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Martin et al., (2020)</xref> used HD-tDCS to target the right TPJ during perspective-taking and tracking, reporting an increased posture congruency effect for perspective-taking during stimulation compared to SHAM, but no such effect for VPT-1. In a further TMS study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gooding-Williams et al. (2017)</xref> used repetitive TMS entrainment over right pTPJ to show that TMS pulses administered at theta frequency (6Hz) accelerated perspective-taking, while alpha (10Hz) entrainment slowed perspective-taking down.</p><p id="P7">Theta rhythms may therefore be the crucial neural frequency to facilitate brain connectivity between the TPJ and other brain regions involved in perspective-taking. In support of this <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Seymour et al. (2018)</xref> reported top-down directional connectivity from prefrontal areas to right TPJ, as well as increased phase-coupling at theta frequencies between right TPJ and the wider social brain network (e.g. ventromedial prefrontal cortex and medial parietal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alcalá-López et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lieberman, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., (2016)</xref> also reported increases in theta-band power for the lateral PFC during the cognitive effort of perspective-taking, which was replicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Seymour et al (2018)</xref> and extended to include anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Activity within these regions during social cognition has been argued to reflect high-level reasoning and working memory processes recruited more generally during complex perspective-taking and mentalizing tasks (for a meta-analysis see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Van Overwalle, 2011</xref>). Overall there is emerging evidence that perspective-taking is underpinned by an embodied cortical network centred on the right TPJ, as well as including the wider social brain network, body schema and executive control regions, coordinated via theta rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Seymour et al., 2018</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Perspective-Taking in Autism Spectrum Disorder</title><p id="P8">In this study we investigated the neural basis of perspective-taking in participants diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) – a neurodevelopmental condition characterised by difficulties in social interaction, language, repetitive behaviours and sensory sensitives (APA, 2013). Research in this area has used a mixture of methodologies and produced ambiguous results, with some studies reporting reduced perspective-taking accuracy in autistic children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baron-Cohen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hamilton et al., 2009</xref>; Yirmiya, Sigman, &amp; Zacks, 1994), whereas others suggest performance on-par with non-autistic control participants (Hobson, 1984; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Tan &amp; Harris, 1991</xref>; Leslie &amp; Frith, 1988). Reviewing the literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pearson et al., (2013)</xref> suggest that overall, ASD participants display a selective impairment for embodied perspective-<italic>taking</italic> (VPT-2), but not perspective <italic>tracking</italic> (VPT-1).</p><p id="P9">Impaired perspective-taking could also link with so-called “mindblindness” theories of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Baron-Cohen, 1997</xref>). It has been argued that embodiment scaffolds the development of high-level social cognitive functions like theory of mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aichhorn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hamilton, 2009</xref>). Taking another’s viewpoint involves transforming our own sense of self onto another, not in a physical sense as per visual perspective-taking, but in a highly conceptual manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hamilton, 2009</xref>). Impaired visual perspective-taking could therefore impact the development of social skills in autism more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hamilton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pearson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Surtees et al., 2013</xref>), especially theory of mind. This also raises the intriguing possibility that perspective-taking interventions in ASD may transfer into beneficial outcomes for high-level social and cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pearson, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P10">If autistic individuals fail to use embodiment, could they turn to alternative compensatory strategies? One study suggests so, with autistic participants favouring a mental object rotation strategy during perspective-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pearson et al., 2016</xref>). In other words, autistic participants tend to mentally rotate the world towards their own perspective. This approach leads to the correct answer, but is more cognitively demanding than embodiment, resulting in longer reaction times and decreased accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kessler &amp; Thomson, 2010</xref>). In support of this idea, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kessler &amp; Wang (2012)</xref> reported that participants with higher levels of autistic traits, but not diagnosed with autism, showed reduced embodiment effects, compared to participants with lower levels of autistic traits. That is, adults with more autistic traits appeared to be less inclined to complete tasks by mentally rotating their body schema into the target orientation. Instead, these individuals were more likely to select an alternative method to embodied transformation such as mentally rotating the target objects (allocentric rotation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Shepard &amp; Metzler, 1988</xref>) or making a visuospatial transposition judgement in form of “my left is their right” at high angular disparities (e.g. “spatial transposers”, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kessler &amp; Wang, 2012</xref>). Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brunyé et al., (2012)</xref> also showed increased response times for participants with stronger autistic traits. While impaired embodied perspective-taking in autism has been reported behaviourally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pearson et al., 2013</xref>), no study to date has investigated the oscillatory neural correlates of perspective-taking and perspective-tracking in autism.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Current Study</title><p id="P11">The current study aimed to investigate autism-related differences in the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying perspective-taking, using MEG. We collected data from a group of 18 autistic adolescent participants and 17 age-matched controls, using the same perspective-taking paradigm and data analysis pipeline as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Seymour et al. (2018)</xref>. It was hypothesised that the adolescent control group would adopt an embodied egocentric strategy during perspective-taking, resulting in increased theta-band power (3-7Hz) within the TPJ, prefrontal executive control regions and regions coding for body schema, as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., (2016)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Seymour et al. (2018)</xref>. However, for the autistic group it was hypothesised that alternative strategies would be preferred. That is, either an object mental rotation strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Conson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pearson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kessler &amp; Wang, 2012</xref>) or a visuospatial transposition strategy (“my left is their right”) would be adopted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kessler &amp; Wang, 2012</xref>). Especially an object rotation strategy would result in longer reaction times (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kessler &amp; Thomson, 2010</xref>) and oscillatory signatures in the alpha frequency range reflecting increased processing in visual/parietal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gardony et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hanslmayr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kasten &amp; Herrmann, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Klimesch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Riečanský &amp; Katina, 2010</xref>). This hypothesis was additionally motivated by neurostimulation research showing enhanced mental object rotation performance during alpha-band repetitive TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Klimesch et al., 2003</xref>), as well as alpha-specific TACS stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kasten &amp; Herrmann, 2017</xref>). A visuospatial transposition strategy should also result in stronger alpha signatures, given alpha’s pivotal role in visuospatial attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Sauseng et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, it has suggested that perspective-taking difficulties in autism are specific to VPT-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pearson et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">2016</xref>), thus, we hypothesised no significant oscillatory differences in perspective-tracking (VPT-1) between autistic and non-autistic groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S7" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P12">Data were collected from 18 autistic participants and 17 age-matched typically developing controls, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

The stimuli were coloured photographs (resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels), showing an avatar seated at a round table from one of four possible angular disparities (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In each trial, one of the grey spheres on the table turned red indicating this sphere as the target. From the avatar’s viewpoint, the target could be either visible/occluded (VO) by a centrally presented black screen (perspective-tracking); or to the left/right (LR) (perspective-taking). Stimuli were presented in 12 mini-blocks of 32 trials, alternating between LR and VO conditions. On each trial, participants were asked to make a target location judgement according to the avatar’s perspective by pressing the instructed key on an MEG-compatible response pad: the left key for “left” or “visible” targets from the avatar’s viewpoint and the right key for “right” or “occluded” targets. Accuracy feedback was provided after each trial in the form of a short tone. As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kessler and Rutherford (2010)</xref>, we collapsed across clockwise and anticlockwise disparities, and separately collapsed correct responses for left and right and visible and occluded, respectively. This resulted in four separate experimental conditions (for examples see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>): left/right judgements where the avatar is 160<sup>0</sup> from own perspective (LR-160); left-/right judgements where the avatar is 600 from own perspective (LR-60); visible/occluded judgments where the avatar is 1600 from own perspective (VO-160); visible/occluded judgments where the avatar is 600 from own perspective (VO-60). This 2x2 design allowed us to disentangle perspective-taking from perspective-tracking and investigate the effect of an increased angular disparity, which has been shown to lengthen reaction times for perspective-taking but not for perspective-tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kessler &amp; Rutherford, 2010</xref>; Michelon &amp; Zacks, 2006).

For each participant, the entire recording was band-pass filtered between 0.5-250Hz (Butterworth filter) and band-stop filtered to remove residual 50Hz power-line contamination and its harmonics. Data were then epoched into segments of 2.5s (1s pre, 1.5s post stimulus onset) and each trial was demeaned and detrended. Trials containing artefacts (SQUID jumps, eye-blinks, head movement) were removed by visual inspection, resulting in removal of an average of 86.5 trials per condition, per participant. Four MEG channels containing large amounts of non-physiological noise were removed from all source-level analyses.

However, when examining alpha rhythms a very different picture emerged. Here, there were no group differences when the angular disparity increased from 60° to 160°.

Stronger theta power in the non-autistic group localised to ventral visual and occipito-temporal cortex, right temporo-parietal and medial parietal cortex, sensorimotor cortices, as well as lateral, medial, and ventral prefrontal cortex (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). This replicates previous MEG studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Seymour et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) showing increased theta power in a similar set of brain regions during perspective-taking, coordinated by the right TPJ. We believe this pattern of brain network activation in the non-autistic control group, especially theta activity within right TPJ and sensorimotor cortex, reflects the use of an embodied strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kessler &amp; Thomson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gooding-Williams et al., 2017</xref>). The involvement of medial and lateral prefrontal regions is thought to manage conflict between self and other perspectives, which has been shown to be affected in autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Carrington &amp; Bailey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Conson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hartwright et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings imply that autistic adolescents are less able to, or simply less inclined to use such an embodied mental self-rotation strategy.</p><p id="P39">The perspective-taking paradigm used in this study can, however, be solved in another way – through mental object rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kessler &amp; Thomson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Samuel et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Zacks &amp; Tversky, 2005</xref>). Alternatively, autistic participants might favour a visuospatial strategy where the other’s left and right are still aligned with the egocentric left and right at low angular disparity (60°), allowing for a very quick left/right decision, while at high angular disparity (160°, i.e. almost face-to face) their egocentric left would be the other’s right and their right the other’s left, only requiring a visuospatial transposition (e.g. Garnder et al., 2013). Our finding of stronger posterior alpha desynchronization hints at the possibility that the autistic group were using one of these alternative strategies to solve the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Conson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pearson et al., 2016</xref>). Posterior alpha power desynchronisation reflects reduced functional inhibition during visual perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Jensen &amp; Mazaheri, 2010</xref>), suggesting a far more sensory, bottom-up manipulation of the visual stimuli in the ASD group. Furthermore we found a significant negative correlation between alpha desynchronisation and the amount of V4-to-V1 feedback connectivity as measured during a complimentary low-level visual task in the same participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Seymour et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). These findings imply that when ASD participants are able to use an alpha-based visual or object-rotation strategy they do so, but at the detriment of the more efficient as well as more socially engaged strategy of embodying another’s perspective through mental self-rotation into their viewpoint. In support of an object-rotation strategy, previous research using TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Klimesch et al., 2003</xref>), TACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kasten &amp; Herrmann, 2017</xref>) and neurofeedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hanslmayr et al., 2005</xref>) have shown that alpha-band oscillations are causally linked with mental object rotation abilities. Interestingly, our alpha desynchronisation group difference did not interact with angular disparity – no effect of alpha power was found when comparing trials where the object was 160° versus 60° from the participant’s perspective. This implies that the same amount of visual processing was engaged by the autistic group despite the 100° difference in rotation required. This could suggest that a visuospatial transposition strategy explanation might be likely (“my left is their right” at 160°) or that the stimuli in this study required only very simple mental rotations along just one dimension rather than true three-dimensional object rotation as often used with Shepard &amp; Metzler type stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Shepard &amp; Metzler, 1988</xref>).</p><p id="P40">More generally, our findings underscore the importance of studying different cognitive strategies in perspective-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kessler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Samuel et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">2024</xref>). Alpha desynchronisation is likely to be a neural signature of effortful and slower object-rotation strategy or indicative of a visuospatial transposition strategy (e.g. “spatial transposers” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kessler &amp; Wang, 2012</xref>), whereas increases in theta power associated with the faster and more embodied self-rotation strategy in controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Future research could investigate this further by characterising the neural dynamics of embodied processing and mental rotation within the same participants. Repetitive TMS entrainment could also be used to investigate the causal role of alpha vs theta oscillations as a function of neurocognitive strategy during perspective taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gooding-Williams et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P41">Finally, our results show that when instructed to imagine the world from another’s perspective, autistic participants activate visual regions rather than the extended network of regions supporting embodied transformation, including temporal, parietal, sensorimotor, and prefrontal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Seymour et al., 2018</xref>). A bias towards prioritising bottom-up sensory information, at the expense of top-down prior information, has been described by predictive-coding accounts of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kessler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Palmer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Pellicano &amp; Burr, 2012</xref>). These generally focus on sensory aspects of ASD but can be easily extended for social and embodied processes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kessler et al., 2016</xref>). Just as one can represent an object for perceptual inference, one can also represent another’s perspective, or mental state, if it helps to predict the causes of sensory input and minimise prediction error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Palmer et al., 2015</xref>). Embodied processing may be particularly affected in autism as another’s perspective is abstractly inferred, presumably involving top-down mechanisms and regions at the top of the cortical hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Friston, 2011</xref>). Our findings hint at the intriguing possibility of a common mechanism underlying both sensory and social symptoms in ASD. Impaired embodied abilities may result in cascading deficits or atypicality in the development of social cognitive skills like Theory of Mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kessler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pearson et al., 2013</xref>). While the paradigm in this study required a relatively simple spatial judgement (left/right), there is evidence to suggest that visual perspective-taking performance can predict theory of mind in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hamilton et al., 2009</xref>). For perspective-taking, ASD participants can adopt alternative compensatory strategies, potentially supported by increased alpha desynchronisation over visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hanslmayr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kasten &amp; Herrmann, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Klimesch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pearson et al., 2016</xref>). However, as tasks become more abstract, for example false belief tasks requiring representing what others are thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Yuk et al., 2020</xref>), this strategy becomes inefficient, if not impossible.</p><sec id="S22"><title>Limitations</title><p id="P42">We note three limitations. First, our assertion that alpha desynchronisation reflects mental rotation strategy relies on reverse inference. However, there are both theoretical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pearson et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Samuel et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">2024</xref>) and quantitative grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gardony et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hanslmayr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kasten &amp; Herrmann, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zacks &amp; Michelon, 2005</xref>) to support this. To further our argument, future MEG studies could explicitly ask participants about which strategies they are using, and/or measure mental rotation alongside perspective-taking in the same participants. Second, we did not collect a formal clinical assessment of autism, e.g. the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lord et al., 2000</xref>), to ascertain symptom severity. Instead, strict participant exclusion criteria were implemented, and only autistic participants with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of ASD or Asperger’s syndrome were included. Between groups, there were significant differences in autistic and sensory traits, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Future research with larger cohorts of autistic individuals (across a wider age range) would be beneficial for determining how perspective-taking and embodiment interacts with the development of language acquisition, theory of mind and sensory sensitivities in autistic individuals. Finally, we note that based on the current findings we cannot disambiguate between a mental rotation and a visuospatial transposition strategy. Future research should aim to understand in more detail what strategy is preferably engaged by autistic participants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P43">Using MEG, we show that the neural basis of visual perspective-taking differs between autistic adolescents and non-autistic age-matched controls.

In contrast, the control group showed strong neural responses within an extended theta-band network of temporo-parietal and pre-frontal regions required for embodied transformation.

Our findings also support claims that ASD is solely associated with differences in perspective-taking (VPT-2) rather than tracking (VPT-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pearson et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS199650-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d65aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to thank the volunteers and their parents who gave their time to participate in this study.</p><sec id="S25"><title>Funding</title><p>We thanks the Wellcome Trust (088314/Z/09/Z), Dr Hadwen Trust and Tommy’s Fund for supporting research costs.

In the top panel, sensor-level topoplots (gradiometers only) are shown for the difference in theta-band (3-7 Hz, 0-0.65 s) oscillatory power between LR-160 vs. LR-60 trials. Scales represent MEG field strength, with units of decibels (dB). Statistical comparison of the two groups is shown on the far right, with units of t-values. Sensors showing a significant difference between groups, p&lt;.05, are highlighted with a boldened black dot. In the bottom panel the theta-band group difference source-localisation results are shown on an inflated cortical mesh, after correcting for multiple comparisons.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199650-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Sensor-level alpha-band (8-12 Hz) perspective-taking results. In the top panel, sensor-level topoplots (gradiometers only) are shown for LR-160 and LR-60 trials (8-12 Hz, 0-0.8 s). Scale represents MEG field strength, baseline-corrected, with units of decibels (dB).

Alpha-band power (8-12 Hz, 0-0.8 s) was localised using a beamformer. In the top panel baseline corrected alpha power results are plotted for each condition (LR-160, LR-60) and group (autistic, non-autistic). Only clusters passing a p&lt;.05 corrected threshold are shown. A region of interest was defined in primary visual cortex (V1) and the alpha power change versus baseline was calculated for LR-160 and LR-60 trials. The bottom panel plots this in a time-resolved manner separately for non-autistic (yellow) and autistic groups (blue). Error bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199650-f004"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Participant demographic and behavioural data. <bold>*</bold> = behavioural scores significantly greater in Autistic &gt; Non-Autistic group, t-test, p&lt;.05.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="middle" align="center"/><th valign="middle" align="center"><underline>N</underline></th><th valign="middle" align="center"><underline>Age</underline></th><th valign="middle" align="center"><underline>Male/Female</underline></th><th valign="middle" align="center"><underline>Autism</underline><break/><underline>Quotient</underline><break/><underline>(Adult)</underline></th><th valign="middle" align="center"><underline>Raven</underline><break/><underline>Matrices</underline><break/><underline>Score</underline></th><th valign="middle" align="center"><underline>Glasgow</underline><break/><underline>Sensory</underline><break/><underline>Score</underline></th><th valign="middle" align="center"><underline>Mind</underline><break/><underline>in the</underline><break/><underline>Eyes</underline><break/><underline>Score</underline></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="middle" align="center"><bold>Autistic</bold><break/><bold>group</bold></td><td valign="middle" align="center">18</td><td valign="middle" align="center">16.67</td><td valign="middle" align="center">14 male; 4<break/>female</td><td valign="middle" align="center">32.6*</td><td valign="middle" align="center">43.8</td><td valign="middle" align="center">65.3*</td><td valign="middle" align="center">21.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="middle" align="center"><bold>Comparison</bold><break/><bold>group</bold></td><td valign="middle" align="center">17</td><td valign="middle" align="center">16.41</td><td valign="middle" align="center">14 male; 3<break/>female</td><td valign="middle" align="center">10.71</td><td valign="middle" align="center">48.8</td><td valign="middle" align="center">38.4</td><td valign="middle" align="center">25.5</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
