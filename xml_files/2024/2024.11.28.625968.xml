Molecular mechanisms, including epigenetic modifications play an important role in the body’s adaptation to ever changing environmental conditions.

Only small-scale twin studies measured BWD associated gene expression patterns on genome-wide level using neonatal cells. Most DNA methylation twin studies used epigenome-level analyses, but the analysed tissue and age of sampling varied widely (blood from adults, saliva samples from children, placenta at delivery).

Multiple birth situation is likely to affect birth weight, as babies are prone to be born prematurely or before 37 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Birth weight is considered as an important indicator of environmental conditions during prenatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Birth weight discordance (BWD), i.e., substantial difference in birth weight between newborns, occurs in 10-29% of twin pregnancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Greater BWD has been associated with poor perinatal outcome, such as preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), cumulative morbidity and neuro-developmental impairment in the twin with the lower weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), intraventricular hemorrhage and cerebral palsy in the larger twin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), and intrauterine or perinatal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). BWD is therefore of great importance for obstetrical risk assessment and for adjusting the prenatal management of such pregnancies. Numerous twin studies have assessed the underlying molecular mechanisms (e.g., gene expression or DNA methylation differences in twins), but there is no recent synthesis of this literature, which limits our ability to inform prevention and intervention strategies aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality rates in children.</p><sec id="S7"><title>Birth weight and epigenetic markers</title><p id="P7">Molecular mechanisms, including epigenetic modifications play an important role in the body’s dynamic adaptation to environmental conditions during life, starting after conception, at implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Given that birth weight is considered as a proxy of prenatal development and is also indicative of adult health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, might provide explanations on how adverse prenatal environment is associated with low birth weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), and how birth weight may in turn affect health later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Recent findings suggest that interindividual differences of DNA methylation patterns at certain gene regions potentially reflect distinct environmental effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Therefore, epigenetic patterns associated with an indicator of growth may serve as biomarkers of adverse prenatal environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Given that epigenetic modifications may be reversible, understanding these molecular mechanisms associated with birth weight could be an attractive therapeutic target that can help to minimize the long-term consequences of adverse prenatal environment.</p><p id="P8">The associations between birth weight and epigenetic markers, like DNA methylation patterns have been previously examined in several singleton studies. The most frequently measured marker in the human genome is the methylation of the cytosine base in a CpG dinucleotide (the letter “p” represents the phosphodiester bond between cytosine and guanine). Recently, patterns of additional covalent modifications, such as DNA hydroxymethylation, have been also analysed. Hydroxymethylcytosine is thought to be an important intermediate in active demethylation processes catalyzed by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenase enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p><p id="P9">A large meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) conducted on 24 birth cohorts with a total number of 8,825 neonates showed that DNA methylation level at 1,029 CpG sites in 807 genes was associated with birth weight, in both positive and negative directions (45% and 55% of the sites, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). After removing unreliably associated sites, 914 loci from 729 genes were selected for further analyses. The largest positive association was found between DNA methylation at cg06378491 in the gene body of <italic>MAP4K2</italic> (coding for mitogen-activated protein kinase activating kinase enzyme, which can be triggered by tumor necrosis factor alpha) – for each 10% increase in methylation at this site the birth weight was 178 grams higher. The CpG site with the largest negative association was cg10073091 in the gene body of the <italic>DHCR24</italic> oxidoreductase (catalyzing the reduction of the delta-24 double bond at cholesterol biosynthesis), which showed a 183 gram decrease in birth weight per 10% increase in methylation. Interestingly, 55 out of 914 differentially methylated sites were previously related to maternal smoking. An important technical point at this meta-analysis was that problematic pregnancies (e.g., mothers with preeclampsia or diabetes; multiple births, and preterm births) were excluded, hindering the applicability of the findings to any type of pregnancies.</p><p id="P10">Overall, the accumulated results from singletons’ pregnancies support the model that intrauterine environmental factors induce epigenetic alterations, which influence fetal growth and hence correlate with birth weight. These epigenetic alterations can be long lasting, but still reversible during an individual’s lifetime, therefore, the authors analysed three age groups separately. The DNA methylation data of blood samples taken in childhood (2–13 years; n = 2,756 from 10 studies) and adolescence (16–18 years; n = 2,906 from 6 studies) pointed to a few steadily affected sites, for examples in genes coding for the <italic>GLI2</italic> zinc finger protein and the <italic>HOXC4</italic> homeobox transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). However, these birth weight associations were not detected in the adult samples (30-45 years; n = 1,616 from 3 studies).</p><p id="P11">In order to explore methylation changes during lifetime, a more appropriate type of analysis was available within the prospective Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children study in the UK. Analysing 974 children with DNA methylation data from 3 timepoints (cord blood at birth, peripheral blood at age 7 and 15-17), the Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomic Studies identified that birth weight was associated with increased DNA methylation level at 23 CpG sites in 14 genes, but these associations could not be detected at age 7 and 17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). However, several associations of developmentally important genes, including the nuclear factor 1 X-type and the lymphotoxin alpha cytokine, could be found with later developmental phenotypes during adolescence, e.g., with weight, height, bone and fat mass. Later on, childhood DNA methylation levels were associated at two CpG sites with rapid weight gain, risk for obesity using independent cohort of 104 children from the Southampton Women’s Survey as a replication sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Taken together, the results of singleton studies suggest that prenatal environment can affect fetal growth and birth weight through epigenetic mechanisms, and epigenetic markers may reflect risk for long-term health problems. However, the essential question remains of how to differentiate genetic effects from environmental effects in a sample of singleton pregnancies with substantial genetic heterogeneity. A twin design can be used to identify the role of unique environmental contributions (e.g., food and blood supply, unequal partitioning of nutrients) while controlling for genetic variation and shared <italic>in utero</italic> environment (e.g., maternal diseases, smoking or alcohol use) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The contribution of twin design</title><p id="P12">Twin design offers a unique possibility to study phenotypic variance in complex inheritance traits and diseases, because monozygotic (MZ) twins share almost identical genetic information, whereas dizygotic (DZ) twins share about 50% of genetic variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Although twins share many environmental factors before birth, such as those connected to maternal habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), there are certain <italic>in utero</italic> factors, such as placental sharing and velamentous cord insertion, which create unequal food supply for the embryos, and can be related to BWD within a MZ twin pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Twin studies are also valuable in testing postnatal environmental effects, if a proportion of twins are exposed to different physical, chemical or social environments. Therefore, twin design can be used in various models, e.g., the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease theory hypothesizing that exposure to prenatal and early life events during critical periods of development and growth may shape adult health and vulnerability to disease later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). It is argued that epigenetic processes can account for these long-lasting effects. Consequently, many studies examined associations between gene expression or DNA methylation patterns and BWD using twin models. Here we summarize the state of research about epigenetic changes associated with BWD in twins. Although BWD can be used as a continuous variable (scale) within twin pair comparison in the association analyses, many researchers compared low vs. high BWD pairs, but the grouping methods differed in the epigenetic studies. Therefore, we will first discuss the epidemiological twin studies creating threshold values of BWD, then we present the state of research on BWD, gene expression and DNA (hydroxy)methylation.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Factors associated with birth weight discordance and threshold values</title><p id="P13">Substantial difference in birth weight of twins is argued to be related to prenatal factors acting asymmetrically on the two embryos, affecting the intrauterine growth of one of them while the growth of the larger twin is apparently not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Depending on the type of placentation, i.e., monochorionic (MC) or dichorionic (DC) pregnancies, several intrinsic and extrinsic factors have been associated with BWD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Intrinsic factors can be attributable to the twin pregnancy situation or to the twins themselves. For example, unequal placental sharing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), velamentous or other abnormal cord insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), and twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), i.e., when blood moves from one twin to the other, can lead to fetal growth restriction (FGR) in MC twin pregnancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). The TTTS happens approximately 15% of MC twin pregnancies, when the placenta cannot provide enough oxygen and nutrients for both fetuses, and subsequently blood flows from one of the twins to the other (creating donor and recipient twin). The ultrasound signs therefore polyhydramnios in the recipient twin (due to increased blood flow, and subsequent urination into the amniotic fluid) and oligohydramnios in the donor twin, who grows slower, because of less blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Umbilical blood vessel abnormalities can cause growth retardation even is DC pregnancies (see for examples, 30; 31). Hormone imbalances, such as lower adiponectin concentration can also result in growth restriction in discordant twins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Extrinsic factors include maternal medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, preeclampsia, hepatitis C infection, and delayed childbearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), socioeconomical status of the family, reflected by parental education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), or maternal habits, e.g., smoking during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The discordance of birth weights (in %) is calculated as = (weight of larger twin - weight of smaller twin) / weight of larger twin × 100. The BWD thresholds are used for the prediction of perinatal mortality and morbidity. However, there is still no consensus among researchers and clinicians on BWD thresholds which have been ranging between 15-40% depending on type of twins, type of placentation (chorionicity), and sex of twins (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Important technical differences come from the study design: population-based studies with more than thousands of twin pairs used only birth and death certificates and did not have data on zygosity and chorionicity, therefore, specific subsets were analyzed separately (see for example 36). Also, the threshold values of gestational age ranged widely, most studies included pregnancies after 24 weeks of gestation, but a few selected only term pregnancies (e.g., 37), or excluded fetal death cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Therefore, the inconsistent results about threshold of BWD may be due to the fact that most research groups have relied basically on the level at which adverse perinatal and postnatal outcomes are more likely to occur in their specific subset of twin pregnancies.</p><p id="P15">The largest epidemiological twin studies (using nation-wide datasets) divided their analyses into same sex and different sex groups, because zygosity and chorionicity data was not available. They found BWD cut-off values of 15% for same sex twins and 30% for different sex (i.e., DZ and hence DC) twins conferring the greatest risks for fetal and neonatal death, and preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Demissie et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) showed that fetal mortality rates differed between the smaller and larger twins of the opposite sex (adjusted odds ratio &gt; 2.7 from BWD &gt; 20% among the smaller twins, but no consistent increase in the odds among the larger twins), whereas same sex twins had similar odds for fetal death (adjusted odds ratio &gt; 1.7 from BWD &gt; 20%). Later, Y. Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) included only mixed gender twins as a surrogate data for chorionicity. Among sex-discordant premature DZ twins a cut-off value of 40% was associated with adverse neonatal outcomes (for details, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The earliest clinical studies included MC twins with TTTS, when blood flows from one of the twins to the other (creating donor and recipient twin). In this setup, Victoria et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) found that severe BWD (&gt; 25%) was more frequent in MC than DC twins, explained mostly by small placenta and umbilical cord abnormalities. Later, Breathnach et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) showed that difference in BWD cut-off values associated with perinatal mortality and morbidity among DC and MC twins (18% <italic>vs</italic> 15%) disappeared when MC twins with TTTS were excluded from the analyses. Therefore, most research groups examined twin pairs without TTTS and also excluded the rare monoamniotic twin pregnancies in order to rule out exceptional cases leading to extreme adverse neonatal outcomes. It has to be noted, that severe TTTS cases can be treated with laser surgery during pregnancy, which can normalize the conditions for both fetuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>).</p><p id="P17">One of the first studies was conducted in the United States by Redman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) who reported that 95th percentile (BWD &gt; 30%) was the threshold most predictive of adverse neonatal outcomes, like cesarean section, umbilical artery and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Later, a prospective study conducted in Ireland by Breathnach et al. (2011) showed lower threshold; adverse neonatal outcome was increased with BWD exceeding 18%. In order to rule out other confounding factors, such as separate vs common placenta between DC and MC twins, Amaru et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) controlled for chorionicity in their analyses, and reported that 20% BWD cut-off value was associated with cesarean delivery and adverse neonatal outcomes, like neonatal intensive care unit admission, oxygen requirement and hyperbilirubinemia. A Danish study found a threshold value of 15% in DC twins where low birth weight was associated with mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Recently, in a Chinese cohort Ye et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) reported cut-off values between 15-30% associated with different adverse neonatal outcomes.</p><p id="P18">In twin cohorts of unknown chorionicity and much larger sample size, BWD cut-off values ranged from 20 to 40%. For example, threshold values between 30-40% were reported by an early study by Cooperstock et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) who used a large US database from 1978 until 1990 to study the association between BWD and preterm birth. Using a population-based retrospective analysis of birth certificates and fetal/infant death certificates in the state of Washington, Hartley et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>) found BWD cut-off value of 25% indicative for perinatal and neonatal mortality. Boghossian et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) examined BWD in premature, very low birth weight twins and found that most adverse outcomes including death before discharge from the hospital, necrotizing enterocolitis, severe retinopathy, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, were more common among the smaller twins with the highest BWD (&gt; 30%). The larger twins with the highest discordance level had increased odds of patent ductus arteriosus, moderate-to-severe cerebral palsy, and blindness. Even among term babies born between 36-40 weeks, Kim et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) reported 20% BWD cut-off value associated with worse perinatal outcomes in a cohort of twins with vertex twin A delivered vaginally. Taken together, BWD cut-off values indicative for adverse perinatal outcomes are around 20-30%, their determination depends on the chorionicity, the sex of twins, the gestational age, and the presence of TTTS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P19">We searched for papers studying the association between BWD and gene expression or DNA methylation using two databases up to the date April 19, 2024. The following keywords were used in the PubMed database: “birth weight discordance” / “discordant growth” / “twin birth weight difference” &amp; “gene expression” / “DNA methylation” / “DNA hydroxymethylation”. At the Ovid MEDLINE(R) we used “birth weight” / “growth restriction” &amp; “twin” &amp; “gene expression” / “DNA methylation” / “DNA hydroxymethylation” keyword combinations in order to include wider range of reports. The automatic search was performed independently by two authors (DW and ZN), who reviewed all abstracts independently. The inclusion criteria for our review were the followings: (i) published in peer-reviewed journal, (ii) examine BWD in human twins, (iii) focus on epigenetic mechanisms, like DNA methylation or gene expression. Disagreements about exclusion were resolved by discussion. Abstracts and full text of the potential papers were reviewed.</p><p id="P20">The PubMed search resulted in 36 papers with human data, the Ovid MEDLINE(R) search resulted additional 6 papers on human samples (another 2 studies were conducted on animals). Finally, the automatic search was completed with a manual search from the reference lists of previous systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and the retrieved articles (adding one more paper). The combined search yielded 43 papers (after removing duplicates), from which 9 were excluded, because the report used the same twin cohort as in Gao et al.

At the end, 34 independent papers were eligible for our review: 19 had gene expression, 21 had DNA methylation, and 2 had DNA hydroxymethylation measurements (8 of them were overlapping having both gene expression and (hydroxy)methylation data).</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S12"><title>Gene expression and birth weight discordance</title><p id="P21">The majority of gene expression studies selected <italic>a priori</italic> candidate genes implicated in metabolism or cardiovascular development or fetal growth (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). For example, Gao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) used placental samples to examine the expression of the human endogenous retrovirus group W member 1, envelope gene (<italic>HERVWE1</italic>) known to be highly expressed in syncytiotrophoblasts when creating the syncytial layer of the placenta. In addition, HERVWE1 is involved in several endocrine hormone pathways, such as the human chorionic gonadotrophin and somatomammotropin pathways, that promote fetal growth. In addition to 56 MZ DC twin pairs, they collected data from 10 singleton pregnancies (for comparisons’ reason, none of them had growth restriction, and all of them were delivered by cesarean section between 30-36 gestational weeks). Significant differences were observed only among the 21 discordant twin pairs with at least 20% BWD: <italic>HERVWE1</italic> mRNA and protein levels were increased in the smaller twins compared to the larger twins, with an accompanying decrease in DNA methylation level at the gene’s promoter region. Furthermore, the <italic>HERVWE1</italic> transcript level was negatively correlated with birth weight in all the groups, which was attributed to the unique characteristics of the study population, consisting of discordant (but not FGR) twins with birth weights within the normal range.</p><p id="P22">Some researchers examined twin pregnancies with selective FGR, i.e., when the smaller twin’s birth weight is less than 10<sup>th</sup> percentile in the third trimester, with inter-twin BWD &gt; 20-25%. For example, Schrey et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) investigated 88 angiogenesis-related genes in placental samples of 10 severely growth-discordant MC twins (BWD ≥ 20%, without TTTS) and 5 growth-concordant MC twins. They found 3 genes showing mRNA expression differences between the smaller and larger twins, and confirmed at the protein level that leptin expression, which regulates food intake and plays a vital role in foetal growth, was increased in the smaller twins of the discordant growth group. The DNA methylation analysis of the leptin gene promoter showed higher methylation in the smaller twins, potentially resulting in a reduced binding of a repressor type of transcription factor at this regulatory region.</p><p id="P23">Using a similar study design, Chang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) measured cord blood erythropoietin level and placental erythropoietin gene expression in MC twins delivered through elective cesarean section (9 normal pairs, 9 pairs with selective FGR but without umbilical artery abnormalities, 8 pairs with FGR and with artery abnormalities), and calculated ratio of erythropoietin level of the smaller / larger twin within each twin pair. They found good correlation between fetal plasma erythropoietin and placental expression ratios in the whole sample. Twins with FGR and umbilical artery abnormalities had the highest plasma erythropoietin level (compared to the other two groups), possibly compensating for the suboptimal circulation, increasing erythropoiesis to enhance the oxygen-carrying capacity of their blood. The smaller twins of pregnancies with umbilical artery abnormalities had two times higher cord plasma erythropoietin level and placental expression compared to their co-twins, who had significantly elevated erythropoietin level compared to the other groups (they also had significantly shorter gestation period and smaller birth weight compared to the other twins). The same group later examined placental glucose transporters’ expression. Only twins with FGR and umbilical artery abnormalities differed from the others at the glucose transporter 3 (<italic>GLUT3/SLC2A3</italic>) level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Using placental mesenchymal stem cells derived from MC pregnancies with selective FGR, Chang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) finally showed that the group of growth-restricted fetuses had lower capacity to increase the placental glucose transporter expression under hypoxic conditions compared to their appropriate-for-gestational-age co-twins.</p><p id="P24">An Australian study investigated expression level of <italic>HLX</italic> homeobox gene coding for a transcription factor and its downstream target genes (e.g., retinoblastoma and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors) in placental samples of 23 DZ twins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Decreased expression of <italic>HLX</italic> and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (<italic>CDKN1C</italic>) was detected in the FGR group at both the mRNA and protein levels, relative to the normal group, potentially reflecting slower development and subsequently retarded fetal growth. Another type of regulation was studied by Li et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), analysing microRNAs in 18 placenta sections of diamniotic MC twins (excluding TTTS, chromosomal abnormalities, and maternal diseases). Increased expression of miR-210-3p was found in the FGR group, which can lead to decreased expression of fibroblast growth factor 1. Their <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments supported the following model: under hypoxic conditions, level of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (<italic>HIF-1α</italic>) is increased, causing an increased miR-210-3p expression, which in turns inhibits fibroblast growth factor 1 gene expression. Altogether, this leads to impaired proliferation of the trophoblast cell line.</p><p id="P25">
<italic>In vivo</italic> assays were also used in twin studies to decipher birth weight-related epigenetic mechanisms leading to health problems later in life, since metabolic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus are often linked to prenatal risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). In a series of papers, almost a hundred healthy, full-term twin pairs (born 40 ± 3 gestational weeks) from the Danish Twin Register were analysed for metabolic markers in muscle biopsy samples taken before and during insulin infusion (testing their insulin sensitivity). Among the 41 MZ twin pairs with gene expression data, birth weight was positively associated with the insulin-stimulated expression of <italic>PPARGC1A</italic> (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) and glucose oxidation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Significant positive association was found between birth weight and both baseline and insulin-stimulated glucose transporter 4 level measured in the muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Later, they showed similar positive association of birth weight and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta muscle expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). In addition, plasma samples were analysed for adiponectin, which is an insulin-sensitizing adipokine acting on muscle metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). Nongenetic influence of birth weight was observed on both plasma adiponectin level and muscle expression of adiponectin receptor 1 among MZ twins. Interestingly, birth weight was also associated with <italic>in vivo</italic> measures of glucose metabolism in these twins, highlighting the fetal programming effects on glucose homeostasis, and their possible roles in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes later in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>) (for more details see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Analysing the role of oxidative stress in delayed fetal development and subsequently low birth weight, Dugmonits et al.

Higher levels of hydrogen peroxide and nitrate, and consequently elevated protein and lipid damages were reported in twin neonates compared to singletons. Expression levels of nitric oxide synthase and other enzymes of the antioxidant defence system (including catalase, superoxide dismutases and haemoxygenases) showed that premature twins with lower birth weights had the lowest antioxidant capacity.</p><p id="P27">One of the first genome-wide studies analysing associations between BWD and gene expression without <italic>a priori</italic> hypotheses used multiple tissue types from the Peri/postnatal Epigenetic Twins Study. Gordon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>) showed significant negative correlation between low birth weight and expression of genes related to metabolism and cardiovascular function. They found 41 genes significantly linked to birth weight in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) analysed from 14 twin pairs. Comparing cord blood mononuclear cells, only DC twins showed differential expression at 342 genes, highlighting the possibility that MC twins, who share the same placenta, have lower gene expression difference. They highlighted three genes involved in fetoplacental growth and metabolism, which expression in HUVECs was negatively correlated with birth weight: adrenoreceptor beta 3, glucose transporter 3, and the leptin receptor overlapping transcript, which has an important regulatory role in the cell surface expression of growth hormone and leptin receptors (for more details, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). These results suggest compensatory mechanisms at the expression of genes involved in fetoplacental growth and supplying energy.</p><p id="P28">Recently, a Chinese group compared placental mRNA levels and DNA hydroxymethylation patterns of 4 twin pairs with selective FGR to 4 normally developing MC twin pairs. Their mRNA-sequencing data showed 81 up-regulated and 614 down-regulated genes in the placental shares of the FGR group compared to the co-twins. Analysis of the overlapping genes with differential mRNA expression and DNA hydroxymethylation levels pointed to the involvement of angiopoietin-like 4 (<italic>ANGPTL4</italic>) gene. Based on functional assays, the authors suggested a model in which hypoxia through the HIF-1α pathway changed the <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> gene promoter methylation pattern, leading to decreased <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). Further exploring the molecular process of this regulatory pathway, Jiang et al.

They identified a downregulated microRNA (miR-29b-3p) causing increased TET2 enzyme activity and subsequently increased transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) level in the FGR samples. Since TGFB1 is an important regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation, the authors highlighted the role of miR-29b-3p-TET2-TGFB1-smad axis leading to reduced trophoblast invasion and to increased apoptosis in growth retardation.</p><p id="P29">Altogether, using neonatal cells from cord blood or placental tissues at birth, gene expression studies provided evidence that prenatal environment can affect expression of genes involved in fetal growth (e.g., <italic>LEPROT, HERVWE1, TGFB1</italic>), oxygen and glucose delivery (e.g., erythropoietin, glucose transporters), and hypoxia-signaling cascade (e.g., HIF-1α). However, it has to be noted that most reports did not have replication cohort and used relatively small sample size.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>DNA methylation and birth weight discordance</title><p id="P30">Except for a few studies analysing placental tissues, most research groups investigated BWD associated DNA methylation patterns in cord blood or later in life using peripheral blood or saliva samples. The most recent analyses used sequencing or the Illumina EPIC array with over 850 thousands of CpG sites, whereas the majority of published data is based on the Illumina 450k array (see details in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Researchers also started to examine another covalent modification of the genomic DNA, the hydroxymethylation, which can serve as a marker for active demethylation, hence gene activating processes. The above-mentioned Chinese workgroup analysed hydroxymethylated regions of the genome in placental samples of pregnancies with selective FGR and compared them to expression changes. In this way they highlighted the aberrant hydroxymethylation pattern at the <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> gene, resulting in reduced protein expression in the smaller placental shares, leading to reduced trophoblast functions, and subsequent suboptimal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>).</p><p id="P31">The earliest epigenetic twin studies used tissues at birth and concentrated on FGR or others medical problems. For example, Bamforth et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>) analysed X-inactivation patterns in chorion, amnion, and cord samples of 79 female twin pairs, specifically selected for BWD, discordance for congenital anomalies, TTTS, but no correlation was seen with BWD or with any other clinical outcome. The latest studies rely on more sophisticated methods, which allow detection of smaller differences in DNA (hydroxy)methylation levels, either via candidate gene approach or at the epigenome level. The majority of studies selecting <italic>a priori</italic> candidate genes analysed imprinted regions, e.g., the maternally imprinted insulin-like growth factor 2 gene (<italic>IGF2</italic>) and the paternally imprinted <italic>H19</italic> gene (coding for a tumor-suppressor long non-coding RNA), which have a common imprinting center at the 11p15 chromosomal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). Once the specific gene is methylated by the imprinting process, it is inactivated on either the maternal or paternal chromosome in a parent-of-origin effect, e.g., the growth regulator <italic>IGF2</italic> gene is expressed only from the paternal chromosome, because it is imprinted, hence inactivated on the maternal chromosome.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Candidate gene approach</title><p id="P32">One of the earliest studies analysed the promoter region of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (<italic>COMT</italic>) gene using buccal cells of 5-year-old healthy MZ twin pairs with high (27-40%) BWD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>). The methylation level of the studied CpG sites showed wide variation among the 12 MZ twin pairs, and there was no correlation with birth weight. Later, Schreiner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>) examined 20 MZ twins at age 3-5 years, who were treated for TTTS before the 27<sup>th</sup> gestational week. They analysed peripheral blood and saliva samples from the twin pairs and unrelated control children and reported high intra-twin-pair correlation in the methylation level of the <italic>COMT</italic> promoter region in both biological sample types. Importantly, they could not detect any correlation between methylation differences and pre- or postnatal growth patterns. We have to note that these early studies did not control for cell heterogeneity, which can cause substantial differences in tissue-specific methylation patterns both in blood-related and oral samples, especially in alternative promoter regions, such as the one regulating the soluble <italic>COMT</italic> isoform, studied by Mill et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>) and Schreiner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). In this aspect, tissue samples with predominantly one cell type are more comparable. Using placental samples (from which blood was carefully removed by washing steps), Gao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) reported reduced DNA methylation at the <italic>HERVWE1</italic> gene promoter in the lower birth weight twins within the discordant pairs, compared to their larger siblings, whose methylation values were similar to that of singleton babies born at similar gestational age via cesarean section.</p><p id="P33">Later on, the majority of epigenetic twin studies using the candidate gene approach focused on the imprinted region on chromosome 11p15 containing the <italic>IGF2</italic> and <italic>H19</italic> genes. Various biological samples from individuals of different ages were used. The first such report analysed neonatal and placental samples collected at birth from the Australian Peri/postnatal Epigenetic Twins Study. They examined multiple tissues, such as cord blood (separated to mononuclear cells and granulocytes), HUVECs and buccal cells from 35 DZ and 56 MZ twins, among whom 19 were DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>). Substantial differences due to tissue specific methylation patterns were observed, but no strong correlation could be detected with BWD (Spearman correlation coefficients ranged from -0.45 to 0.58). Analysing 4-year-old children previously treated for TTTS, Schreiner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>) could observe only one weak association between BWD and slight increase in methylation at the <italic>IGF2</italic> gene region, more pronounced in saliva than in blood (with Spearman correlation coefficient 0.51). However, no difference was found in the serum IGF2 level between donors and recipients either at birth or at age 4. Furthermore, no correlation was observed between IGF2 serum levels and methylation values using the intra-twin differences. After widening the candidate regions and including IGF2-related developmental genes, such as <italic>IGF2BP1-3</italic> (IGF2-binding proteins 1-3), Córdova-Palomera et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>) found a positive association between birth weight and DNA methylation level of two CpG sites in the <italic>IGF2BP1</italic> gene in peripheral blood samples of 17 healthy adult MZ twin pairs (among the 248 preselected sites of the IGF2 pathway). Each kilogram increase in birth weight correlated with approximately 8.3% rise in DNA methylation level of the growth-regulator <italic>IGF2BP1</italic> gene, after controlling for sex and gestational age, as well as for age at sampling (which ranged from 22 to 56 years). Since this RNA binding protein stabilizes <italic>IGF2</italic> transcripts, its reduced expression can result in lower IGF2 level (see more details in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). It has to be emphasized that the rest of the studied sites did not show substantial inter-individual variation (less than 5% of methylation differences), hence they were not informative to reflect non-shared environmental effects.</p><p id="P34">Taken together, candidate gene twin studies resulted mostly in negative findings, either because of the low variability in the methylation level at the targeted sites or the less sensitive methods used, since we should expect to deal with less than 10% of methylation differences in easily available, heterogenous samples, such as whole blood or saliva samples.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Epigenome-wide association studies</title><p id="P35">The first EWAS of BWD used samples collected at the Peri/postnatal Epigenetic Twins Study. Gordon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>) compared different tissues obtained at birth from MZ and DZ twin pairs, and found a few significant associations between DNA methylation levels at genes involved in lipid metabolism and birth weight of twins (for details see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Afterwards, Martino et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>) compared DNA methylation patterns of buccal epithelial cells collected at birth and 18 months later with the wide-spread methylation array type from Illumina (450k BeadChip array). It should be noted that these pilot measurements regarded the biological samples (relatively) homogenous and no adjustment for cell composition was mentioned at their analyses. Their main aim was to estimate the genetic and non-shared environmental effects in the framework of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease theory by studying MZ and DZ twins. Afterwards, only MZ twins were examined with sample sizes ranging from 17 to 150 pairs (see details in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p id="P36">In their landmark paper using saliva samples from female MC twin pairs, Souren et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>) showed that heterogenous cell composition was driving the largest methylation differences in their epigenome-wide dataset obtained with the Illumina 450k array. After controlling for the buccal epithelial cell ratio (and removing the outlier twin pair, who were the only heavy smokers in the cohort), they showed that BWD was associated with more than 3,000 CpG sites, but only 45 of them had methylation differences &gt; 5%, which was regarded as the threshold for technical variation. Importantly, they applied a different technique, the deep bisulfite sequencing to confirm methylation changes at 8 selected CpG sites. Although the methylation values showed good correlation at 5 out of 8 loci between the two methods, the sequencing data produced much less variation (the 5-7% methylation differences between the discordant twins reduced to ≤ 1 % differences), doubting the biological relevance of the studied CpG sites. In order to support their negative findings, DNA methylation levels at repetitive sequences were also measured, resulting in non-significant differences between the heavy and light co-twin groups. Using bigger sample sizes and younger age range, later EWAS could not detect any significant association either between BWD and salivary DNA methylation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Similarly, no significant associations were observed between pre-selected epigenetic markers and birth weight in a sample of 1,040 twins using buccal cells collected at age 6-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). Interestingly, using blood samples of adult twins from the Netherlands Twin Register (collected at age 18-79) weak association was detected between birth weight and DNA methylation score (calculated from Illumina array data of 934 CpG sites indicated by the meta-analysis of 18). However, this combined DNA methylation score explained only 0.39% of the variance (whereas polygenic scores explained 1.52% of the variance) in birth weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). For reasons of comparisons, we have to note that much higher variance was explained by combined DNA methylation scores at prenatal maternal smoking (16.9%), and body mass index (6.4%) in the same adult dataset.</p><p id="P37">Similar to the gene expression studies, few research groups selected extreme cases of BWD to find differentially methylated regions in the genome. The first pilot study examined a special sample of children, survivors of TTTS, treated with laser surgery between 16-24 weeks of gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>). Only subtle changes (∼ 5% differences) were detected at specific CpG sites from blood and saliva samples between donors and recipients, but they were more likely situated in genes controlled by polycomb group proteins, highlighting developmentally important regions. Subsequent epigenome-wide studies examined placental tissues from twin pregnancies with selective FGR. Using the most common DNA methylation array, a Canadian group detected at least 10% within-pair methylation differences at 8 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> for study cohort description). Applying a similar twin design but more in-depth analyses, He et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>) found 2,930 differentially methylated promoter regions. Selecting four genes related to specific biological functions (e.g., involved in cell migration, RNA binding, vitamin A metabolism, and folate transportation), methylation differences at three target regions were validated in an independent sample of 12 twin pairs. However, DNA methylation differences at these regulatory regions were not correlated with gene expression differences in the placental tissues from 11 pairs. Compared to normally developing co-twins, the placental shares of growth-retarded twins showed lower general DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation levels (measured by mass spectrometry), supporting the epigenetic differences between discordant twins.</p><p id="P38">Measuring placental samples of MC growth-restricted fetuses compared the their co-twins, Shi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>) found hundreds of CpG sites differentially methylated. Their analysis of affected pathways revealed dysregulation primarily in steroid hormone biosynthesis, metabolism, cell adhesion, and immune response. Importantly, in an integrative analysis of the promoter methylome of FGR placentas, hypomethylation at the <italic>CYP11A1</italic> gene was highlighted when they compared their own dataset with previously published ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>). The <italic>CYP11A1</italic> gene codes for a cytochrome <italic>P450</italic> monooxygenase involved in the synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, including vitamin D. It catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, the first, rate-limiting step in the synthesis of the steroid hormones. Therefore, up-regulation of this enzyme in placenta can potentially disturb progesterone synthesis and can even trigger oxidative stress, leading to growth restriction.</p><p id="P39">Most of the EWAS used the Illumina 450k methylation array with easily accessible samples, e.g., saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>) or whole blood samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>). Only one of them reported a differentially methylated CpG site at the genome-wide significance level using a female MZ twin sample with BWD &gt;20% selected from the TwinsUK cohort. Interestingly, this site in the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (<italic>IGF1R</italic>) gene could be detected only with quantitative analysis using BWD as a continuous variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>). Using the same TwinsUK sample in their ageing-related metabolic analyses, Menni et al.

Association between glycosylated tryptophan metabolite and DNA methylation level at cg12757143 in the promoter region of the diphthamide biosynthesis 7 gene pointed to the involvement elongation factor 2 regulation, which is important not only in protein synthesis but also in the regulation of cell proliferation and migration.

In the same dataset of the Danish twin cohort, M. Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>) searched for differentially methylated gene regions.

We have to mention that birth weight is predominantly driven by shared environmental factors, mostly by gestational age and maternal factors. After controlling for gestational age, genetic and unique environmental effects accounted for roughly equal shares of the variation in birth weight (20-25%), although there were some cultural-geographical differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>). Therefore, researchers tried to explore these unique environmental effects and their potential underlying biological mechanisms. As in many complex, polygenic traits, birth weight is controlled by hundreds of genetic variants and possibly similarly high numbers of epigenetic modifications, each contributing a small percentage to the variance. Confirming the relevance and importance of such variants, meta-analyses with thousands of study participants are needed (see for example 18).</p><p id="P43">Using the candidate gene approach, researchers have focused on genes with profound roles in fetal growth, oxygen-regulation, glucose metabolism and neurodevelopment. The genome-wide expression analysis by Gordon et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>) showed significant associations between measures of BWD and metabolism-related genes, like Leptin Receptor Overlapping Transcript (<italic>LEPROT</italic>), adrenoreceptor beta 3, and glucose transporter 3. Candidate gene analyses also supported the involvement of leptin signaling pathway and glucose transport. It should be noted that most expression studies used less than 30 samples per group, therefore, they can be regarded as small-scale pilot studies. Much bigger sample sizes were available at the DNA methylation studies, but the results obtained from recent EWAS are still inconsistent. It might be because of the weaker functional relevance, since DNA methylation changes by themselves do not necessarily reflect gene expression changes, as it has been demonstrated at the imprinted <italic>H19</italic> or <italic>IGF2</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>). Importantly, most studies could not detect any significant differences in DNA methylation patterns between the heavy and light co-twins using categorical analyses. The most promising findings were obtained from blood samples of MZ twins with BWD &gt; 20% using quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>). Epigenetic profiles of saliva samples showed much more variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>).</p><p id="P44">Reasons for discrepancies may lie in the study design. First, the age of sampling, i.e., the time period at which methylation measurements were taken, differs from study to another. For example, DNA methylation was examined after delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>), during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>) or in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>). The results are therefore not always comparable, since DNA methylation is not fixed at many CpG sites over the life span, although there are certain sites with stable methylation pattern, as shown by longitudinal studies with multiple timepoints (e.g., 88, 20). Second, DNA methylation level was measured mostly only once, and from only one tissue type, using Illumina arrays which have preselected CpG sites of the human genome. Third, potential differences may also stem from the type of tissues used in these studies (e.g., saliva, blood, neonatal tissues) since cellular heterogeneity was not controlled in the earlier studies and each cell type has its unique epigenetic landscape that likely reflects its specific function and response to environmental exposures. It should be also noted, that most of the EWAS included all ∼ 480 thousand CpG sites from the 450k methylation array, although the majority of CpG sites on the Illumina arrays are not variable between individuals, which potentially had a major effect at the statistical analyses (therefore the analysed numbers of CpG sites are indicated <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Newer types of analyses on merged, large-scale datasets are needed for convincing results.</p><p id="P45">Epigenetic regulation of growth-related genes in the offspring may be a relevant mechanism through which adverse prenatal environment is associated with low birth weight. The literature also shows similar trends in studies of singletons. In fact, most researchers that examined singletons showed that birth weight (adjusted or not for gestational age) was associated with DNA methylation patterns at birth or later in life at certain CpG sites involved in growth or in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Newer studies did not replicate the previously highlighted genes, however, they used much smaller sample sizes, hence they were underpowered to detect few percentages of epigenetic difference between low and high birth weight infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>). Taken together, this review showed how DNA methylation patterns associated with BWD are characterized by variability in methodology (e.g. sampling time, tissue type and DNA methylation measure used), likely contributing to the inconsistency of results reported.</p><p id="P46">We can potentially expect a couple of reliable findings on the genome-wide significance level in the near future, as there are many large twin studies with EWAS data using peripheral blood samples collected from young adults (age 18-36 years), such as the UK-based E-Risk Twin Study (N = 1629), the Finnish Twin Cohorts (N = 757), and Netherlands Twin Register (N = 2059) (see the discovery and replication samples of a recent meta-analysis by 91). These twin samples are part of the project “Unraveling gene-environment interplay to inform Treatment and Intervention strategies” which is now in the analytical phase. Newer, more sophisticated analyses could detect important epigenetic alterations from early developmental stages, which can stay stable in our genome and can serve as useful epigenetic markers later in life (at the potential disease prognostic stage). Although it is easier to collect thousands of adult participants with retrospective data, these analyses should control for larger environmental effects first, such as current metabolic and behavioral variables (e.g., body mass index, smoking). Prospective studies with reliable, detailed information about perinatal factors are needed to highlight individual DNA methylation sites with small effects.</p><p id="P47">Finally, we would like to note some gaps in the literature, which can be addressed by future studies. For example, researchers could examine several attractive candidate genes with known involvement in fetal growth (e.g., <italic>IGF2</italic>, <italic>LEPROT, ADRB3</italic>, <italic>GLUT3</italic>) in two or more tissues and developmental stages (e.g., in placenta, cord blood or umbilical vein cells, and in child and adult blood or saliva samples), which can help finding stable epigenetic modifications associated with DNA methylation differences between the co-twins. Further, most studies conducted to date have been cross-sectional in design and relied on single epigenetic measures using samples collected only once at different time points, like delivery, early childhood, adolescence or adulthood. Longitudinal studies with several data collection points for epigenetic measures would be useful to comprehensively and prospectively investigate the long-term effects of prenatal environmental exposures indicated by BWD. In addition, few of the association studies used extreme BWD pairs of twins (i.e. BWD &gt; 30-40%). Our understanding may be improved by including twins with wide range of BWD. Lastly, looking at potential confounding factors, many studies did not control for some major confounders, such as chorionicity, gestational age, zygosity and sex, which can likely account for a large proportion of the observed association between prenatal environmental exposures, BWD, and epigenetic changes as suggested by researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P48">This review found several studies which showed that prenatal environment experienced <italic>in utero</italic> by twins can be associated with BWD through altered gene expression, particularly at genes involved in pathways affecting fetal growth, which in turn can affect birth weight. However, these studies had small sample sizes and did not include replication cohorts. Larger size twin studies are available examining BWD and DNA methylation patterns, but have not provided consistent evidence yet, possibly due to the small methylation differences in tissue samples with heterogenous cell compositions. In order to reveal true associations, future epigenome-wide analyses should pay attention to several confounding parameters to be controlled for (e.g., smoking), and include sample size with sufficient power to detect a few percentages of methylation differences.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This project was supported by a grant from the Swiss Government Excellence Scholarships (2018.0801, 2018) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (P1FRP1_199872, 2021) awarded to DLW.

1</label><caption><p>(Created in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorender.com/">https://BioRender.com</ext-link>)</p><p>Although monozygotic twins have almost the same DNA sequence (see double stranded DNA helix in the middle), there are many molecular regulatory processes differentially affected by certain <italic>in utero</italic> environmental factors (such as unequal blood supply). Therefore, in a proportion of twin pregnancies, the intrauterine growth of the developing embryos is uneven, resulting in substantial birth weight difference. The underlying epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation changes can be long-lasting, measurable after birth and may serve as biomarkers reflecting risk for later health problems. An important technical feature is that the DNA molecule is quite stable and the methyl groups are attached covalently (shown as Me), hence methylation analyses are wide-spread in medical studies.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201644-f001"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float" orientation="landscape"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Threshold values for birth weight discordance used in epidemiological twin studies.</title><p>At the sample description the number of monozygotic (MZ) or dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs are shown. Wherever possible, the number of monochorionic (MC) and dichorionic (DC) pregnancies are indicated. Only percentages are indicated when chorionicity data was partially available. Most studies excluded monoamniotic twins, major congenital abnormalities (except for persistent ductus arteriosus in case of preterm birth), and twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS); * shows where information on possible TTTS could not be obtained. Fetal death was defined as intrauterine death of the fetus ≥ 20 weeks of gestation, neonatal death was defined as death of the infant within 28 days after birth, whereas combined perinatal mortality included loss of twin(s) after 24 completed weeks or newborn weighting at least 500 g. Hospital death means death of newborn before discharge or within 120 days for infants still hospitalized. Preterm birth was defined as a birth that takes place before 37 weeks of pregnancy have been completed, if not otherwise specified by the study protocol (see details in the last column).</p><p><italic>Other abbreviations:</italic> BW: birth weight; BWD: birth weight discordance; CI: confidence interval; GA: gestational age; NICU: neonatal intensive care unit; NRDS: neonatal respiratory distress syndrome; OR: odds ratio; RR: relative risk; SGA: small for gestational age (less than the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile); SES: socioeconomic status; twin A: the first baby delivered at birth</p></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="top">Authors, birth cohort</th><th align="center" valign="top">Sample characteristics, exclusion criteria</th><th align="center" valign="top">Covariates (infant, maternal and pregnancy related variables)</th><th align="center" valign="top">BWD cutoff</th><th align="center" valign="top">Outcome variables associated with BWD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Ye et al.
