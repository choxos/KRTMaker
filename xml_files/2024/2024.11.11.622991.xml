If not engaged in active transport, kinesin-1 limits futile ATP hydrolysis by adopting a compact autoinhibited conformation that involves an interaction between its C-terminal tail and the N-terminal motors domains. Here, using a chimeric kinesin-1 that fuses the N-terminal motor region to the tail and a tail variant unable to interact with the motors, we employed high-resolution cryo-EM in the presence of MTs to investigate elements of the mechanochemical cycle. We describe a missing structure for the proposed two-step allosteric mechanism of ADP release, the ATPase rate limiting step. It shows that MT association induces remodeling of the hydrogen bond network at the nucleotide binding site triggering removal of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion from the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP complex resulting in a strong MT-binding apo-like state before ADP dissociation. We further demonstrate that tail association does not directly affect this mechanism, nor the adoption of the ATP hydrolysis-competent conformation, nor neck linker docking/undocking, even when zippering the two motor domains. Based on this structural evidence, we propose a revised mechanism for tail-dependent kinesin-1 autoinhibition and suggest a possible explanation for its characteristic pausing behavior on MTs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Kinesin-1 (also known as conventional kinesin) is an essential ATP-driven molecular motor of the kinesin superfamily capable of processive movement as stepping dimers toward the (+)-end of polarized microtubules (MTs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. This enables the transport of a range of cargoes required for cellular function including mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, synaptic vesicle and plasma membrane precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Several viruses also hijack the MT transport machinery of the host cell to facilitate their replication and spread<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The two motor-bearing heavy chains (Kif5) are typically associated with two light chain (KLC) adaptors that form the tetrameric kinesin-1 complex. KLCs often mediate the interaction with the proteinaceous components of cellular cargoes by recognizing short-linear motifs (SLiMs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and other ordered regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, they are not always required as transport of mitochondria and mRNA granules has been shown to be KLC-independent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In the case of mitochondria, KLCs even negatively impact on the recruitment of the necessary Milton/Miro adaptor complex that binds directly to Kif5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Kif5 contains a N-terminal motor domain (also known as the head) that generates force and processive stepping via Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ATP hydrolysis and exchange, multiple coiled-coil (CC) regions with breaks (stalk) that mediate dimerization, and an unstructured C-terminus (tail) involved in autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). ATPase activity is strongly activated by MT binding that induces conformational changes in the motor stimulating both ATP hydrolysis and ADP release steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. One of the key structural elements undergoing transitions that are coupled to the nucleotide state is the neck linker, that connects the motor domain to CC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). This element, which is critical for force generation under physiological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, goes from being docked along the core motor domain in the ATP-bound state to being flexible in both the ADP-bound and nucleotide-free states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. For kinesin-1, MT binding speeds up the rate-limiting step of ADP release more than ~104 fold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The structural mechanisms governing MT-stimulated ADP release have been disputed for decades and are still unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Another key aspect of kinesin-1’s mechanochemical cycle is its autoinhibition. To limit wasteful ATP hydrolysis and futile runs, cargo-less Kif5 adopts a compacted autoinhibited conformation that involves an interaction between the motor domain and the unstructured C-terminal tail centred on its IAK (isoleucine-alanine-lysine) SLiM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (hereafter just IAK motif, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Binding of a single tail to the kinesin-1 dimer is sufficient for inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> preventing MT-dependent stimulation of ATPase activity, particularly, the acceleration of ADP release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. A cryo-EM reconstruction of MT-bound monomeric heads chemically cross-linked to the IAK motif indicated that this inhibitory region engages with the nucleotide-binding switch I motif of loop 9 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref> for secondary structure elements of the kinesin-1 motor), with this interaction suggested to directly inhibit ADP release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. However, a subsequent crystallographic structure of the autoinhibited ADP-bound <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinesin-1 motor dimer showed the IAK motif zipping the heads by binding away from the nucleotide binding site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. This work proposed a ‘double-lockdown’ model of autoinhibition, whereby zipping the heads locks them in a conformationally restricted orientation that, in turn, prevents, undocking of the neck linker from the motor that has been suggested to facilitate ADP release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Recent studies have shown that critical to the achievement of the compact autoinhibited conformation is a short break (elbow) in CC3 of Kif5 that allows the molecule to fold on itself such that the unstructured C-terminal tail is in proximity of the motors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). These studies suggest that portions of the stalk would reduce MT binding in the folded conformation by sterically interfering with the MT-binding surface of at least one of the motor domains. This is supported by the observation that compared to the motor domain in isolation, MT affinity/landing rate of full-length Kif5 is reduced, with or without KLCs, unless autoinhibition is relieved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. However, full-length Kif5 still displays a basal level of landing events and, when MT-associated, reduced motility and longer association/run durations compared to truncated tailless motors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. The ‘stalling’ behavior characteristic of full-length kinesin-1 motility has been shown to depend on the tail/IAK motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Furthermore, addition of a tail peptide to dimeric tailless constructs decreases MT-stimulated ATPase and ADP release rates and motility, stalling kinesin in a strongly-MT-associated state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that at least some aspects of kinesin-1’s mechanochemistry are independent of purely steric effects and depend on the direct interaction of the tail with the motor.</p><p id="P8">Using engineered stalkless chimeric constructs of human Kif5, we present here MT-bound high-resolution cryo-EM structures that explain key aspects of kinesin-1’s mechanochemical cycle and autoinhibition. We have visualized an apo-like transition state of MT-bound kinesin-1 with ADP but lacking Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Our structural analysis shows the MT-induced conformational changes that remove the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion leading, in turn, to ADP destabilization and, ultimately, its release. Moreover, we show that whilst the autoinhibitory tail can crosslink the motors in a zipped dimer this arrangement is not rigid and, importantly, it does not prevent undocking of the neck linker. Based on our structures, we propose a revised mechanism for kinesin-1 autoinhibition and suggest an explanation for its distinctive stalling behavior.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>‘Bonsai’ kinesin-1 chimeras for cryo-EM studies</title><p id="P9">It is currently unclear if the association of the autoinhibitory tail affects nucleotide-dependent structural transitions of MT-bound kinesin-1. To explore this, we designed a stalk-less ‘bonsai’ kinesin-1 chimera, dubbed Kif5b<sup>MoNeIAK</sup> (Motor-Neck-IAK motif), which fuses the N-terminus of human Kif5b (motor domain up to the end of CC1) to its C-terminal IAK motif via a flexible linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). The linker is sufficiently long to allow the free interaction of the tail with the motor. Additionally, we generated an IAK-variant chimera in which we replaced residues 919-QIAKPIR-925 with an unrelated amino acid sequence (TGSTSGT) that was predicted to abrogate motor-tail interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). We refer to this variant as Kif5b<sup>MoNeXXX</sup>. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) runs are consistent with Kif5b<sup>MoNeIAK</sup> and Kif5b<sup>MoNeXXX</sup> dimers and monomers, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). This supports the notion that the IAK motif is involved in crosslinking the motors in the autoinhibited state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Tail-bound motors can interact with MTs both as monomers and as zipped dimers</title><p id="P10">We next sought to assess the structural impact of the tail on Kif5b in ADP and ATP nucleotide states. The ATP analogue adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMPPNP) or the ADP+Pi analogue ADP-AlF4 can be used to stabilize indistinguishable ATP-like conformational states of the Kif5b motor domain on MTs or tubulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, a cryo-EM dataset was collected of taxol-stabilized MTs decorated with Kif5b<sup>MoNeIAK</sup> in the presence of AMPPNP for comparison with the high-resolution X-ray crystallographic model of ADP-AlF4-bound Kif5b in complex with a tubulin dimer and a DARPin (PDB code 4hna)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Moreover, considering that a high-resolution model of the MT-bound Kif5b motor domain in the presence of ADP is not available, we also collected datasets of taxol-stabilized MTs decorated with Kif5b<sup>MoNeIAK</sup> and Kif5b<sup>MoNeXXX</sup> in the presence of ADP. Data collection statistics for all datasets are reported in (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P11">MT segments of thirteen protofilaments were processed with a modified version of the MiRP MT processing pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> (see also the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref> section), followed by symmetry expansion, focused extraction, focused 3D classification and focused 3D refinement on the asymmetric unit. This allowed conformational sorting of individual motor-(αβ)tubulin complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e-i</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). For Kif5b<sup>MoNeIAK</sup> we recognized two distinct populations of MT-bound motors. Irrespective of the nucleotide state, they were present either in a two-headed state with motors zipped by the autoinhibitory tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e,g</xref>) or in a one-headed state with some tail density still visible associated with the MT-bound motor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f,h</xref>). The fraction in the two-headed state was more abundant with AMPPNP (47% of the total) compared to ADP (26%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). For ADP-Kif5b<sup>MoNeXXX</sup> we only observed one-headed motors and no density for the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i,j</xref>). Whilst one-headed Kif5b<sup>MoNeXXX</sup> is fully consistent with the monomeric population seen in SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), in the case of Kif5b<sup>MoNeIAK</sup> its one-headed fraction can be rationalized either because of monomerization due to dilution required for cryo-EM grid preparation or because of flexibility in regions of the neck linker and therefore heterogeneity in the position of the CC and distal head (2<sup>nd</sup> head) compared to the MT-bound one (1<sup>st</sup> head) making the later invisible due to the averaging process in cryo-EM reconstruction. In all reconstructions, quality and resolution varied within the asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 3-6</xref>), with the MT-motor domain interface being resolved best at ~2.8-3 Å resolution and decreasing to around ~3.4–4 Å at the motor tip and tail density. In the two-headed states, the resolution dropped rapidly from ~3.5 Åto ~8 Å for the distal motor head moving away from the dimer interface/tail. This decrease in resolution is consistent with some variability in position or conformation for the distal head.</p><p id="P12">Overall, the arrangement of the MT-bound two-headed complex observed here is consistent with the X-ray crystallographic structure of the autoinhibited MT-free <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> kinesin-1 motors (PDB code 2y65)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. However, structural superposition of our cryo-EM structures with the crystallographic one using one of the motors as a frame of reference (the MT-bound one for the cryo-EM structures) reveals variability in the relative positioning of the distal head. This is quantified by ~14° and ~21° rotations, in opposite directions and around independent axes, for the AMPPNP and ADP and states, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). This suggests that, differently from the symmetric crystallographic complex, some variability in the relative orientation of the zippered heads is compatible the presence of the tail.</p><p id="P13">In Kif5b<sup>MoNeIAK</sup>, density for the tail is visible in all states — though with varying levels of order — in a cleft between loop 8 and a region leading from the C-terminal tip of helix α2 though loop 6 to the N-terminal end of β4 strand of the core motor domain β-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k-n</xref>). This location matches that seen in the MT-free crystallographic structure of autoinhibited <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinesin-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Although our construct contains a 24 aa-long tail region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), a maximum of nine amino acids (AQIAKPIRP) could be modelled in the two-headed AMPPNP-Kif5b<sup>MoNeIAK</sup> structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k</xref>). Like in the X-ray structure, we could not define a clear directionality for the pseudo-palindromic IAK motif thus the peptides were modelled in both polarities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref> – for clarity, only one peptide is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k-n</xref>). Sitting at the center of the pseudo-palindrome, K922 has the same location in the complex regardless of polarity with either I920 or I924 embedded in a hydrophobic pocket lined by I130 and F128 of strand β4, I119, Y120 and F116 of helix α2 and C174 of loop 8 of the motor domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a,b</xref>). Tail binding is not restricted to the two-headed states that offers pseudo-symmetric stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k,m</xref>) as density is clearly present also in the one-headed states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1n,l</xref>). Whilst for ADP-Kif5b<sup>MoNeIAK</sup> only the IAK tripeptide (KPI in the opposite direction) could be modelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1n</xref>), for AMPPNP-Kif5b<sup>MoNeIAK</sup> the ordered region is longer (AQIAKP or AKPIRP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1l</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8a</xref>). Overall, these observations suggest a mechanism for the formation of the autoinhibited zipped dimer in which a ‘IAK half-site’ binds first to one motor head leading then to the recruitment of the other motor by avidity.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Association with MTs removes the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion from ADP-bound kinesin-1, resulting in an apo-like intermediate state</title><p id="P14">Currently, there is no high-resolution structure of the MT-bound kinesin-1 motor in the ADP state. Thus, our ~2.9 Å resolution ADP-Kif5b<sup>MoNeXXX</sup> structure fills an important gap in knowledge. For this chimera, which lacks the endogenous IAK motif, only one-headed MT-bound motors were observed that are devoid, as designed, of the extra density for the tail at its binding location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Density for the neck linker is also absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), indicating that it is undocked and flexible, in keeping with low-resolution reconstructions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Noticeably, whilst ADP is present in its binding pocket, density for Mg<sup>2+</sup> is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), despite its clear presence at the N-site of α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>). Compared to the crystallographic ADP-bound Kif5b motor structure solved in the absence of MTs (PDB code 1bg2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), here, loop 9 that harbors the ‘switch I’ motif, unfurls from a short helical segment becoming partially disordered, loop 11 that contains the ‘switch II’ motif, adopts an ordered helical turn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>) whilst the MT-interacting helix a4 is extended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Overall, these observations indicate that, bar the presence of the bound nucleotide, the MT-bound structure of ADP-Kif5b<sup>MoNeXXX</sup> resembles more the nucleotide-free conformation of Kif5b in complex with a tubulin dimer and a DARPin (PDB code 4lnu)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> than the MT-free ADP-bound structure of Kif5b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The nucleotide-free (apo) conformation of kinesin-1 represents a ‘strong’ binding state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, with enhanced MT contacts formed by the ordering of the a4 helix extension and loop 11 region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Structural superposition upon the P-loop/a2a helix that holds ADP reveals that our structure and the tubulin dimer-bound motor in the apo state exhibit low RMSD values globally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>), whilst MT-free Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP-bound Kif5b is structurally divergent on one side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). If analyzed in terms of the kinesin subdomain scheme used in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>), the whole P-loop subdomain stays relatively unchanged while the switch I/II and MT-binding subdomains undergo significant conformational rearrangements. This results in a novel network of interactions between conserved residues of the extended helix a4/loop 11 region and loop 7/loop 9 of the switch I/II subdomain. One such new interaction is between R203 of switch I (in loop 9) and E236 of switch II (in loop 11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). In the MT-free Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP structure, the latter residue is bonded to T87 of the P-loop, thus locking the P-loop and loop 11 together in a manner crucial to stabilizing the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ADP state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). In our structure, loop 7/loop 9 and helix a4-proximal regions of the core β-sheet in the switch I/II subdomain (β strands 4-7) are drawn towards helix a4 and the MT-binding subdomain, while regions of the core β-sheet in the P-loop subdomain (β-strands 1, 3 and 8) remain relatively static (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). This causes ‘twisting’ of the core β-sheet that has been suggested to happen upon ADP release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. However, we show here that this occurs upon MT-binding and Mg<sup>2+</sup> release prior to ADP exit.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Structural basis for a two-step MT-stimulated ADP release mechanism</title><p id="P16">MT-stimulated ADP release has been proposed to be biphasic, with the first phase being inhibited by Mg<sup>2+18,30,50</sup>.

This has been suggested on the basis of FRET measurements to anticipate and accelerate ADP release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Our cryo-EM sample preparation conditions have a &gt;1000-fold molar excesses of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ADP compared to the motor.

Retention of the latter, owing to its very high concentration, allowed us to analyze the conformational changes that impact on ADP affinity following MT binding and Mg<sup>2+</sup> release.</p><p id="P17">The MT-induced structural changes discussed in the previous section induce significant displacements of key Mg<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating side chains of loop 9 and β7 relative to ADP, the ADP-binding P-loop and the helix α2a region in the P-loop subdomain that are not compatible with Mg<sup>2+</sup>retention. In particular, prior to Kif5b interaction with the MT, conserved D231 on β7 indirectly coordinates Mg<sup>2+</sup> via a water molecule and the hydroxyl group on helix α2a’s T92 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Upon MT binding, however, the Ca atoms of D231 are displaced by ~3 Å relative to the P-loop and helix α2a, such that these interactions are broken with D231 forming instead a new hydrogen bonding network with conserved R190 on loop 9 (also enabled by its Cα atom moving ~6.5 Å relative to the P-loop) and conserved K91 on α2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Moreover, while interactions between ADP and the backbone of the P-loop and helix 2a as well as with the side chains of R14, R16, P17 and H93 are maintained, thus conferring residual stability to the nucleotide in its binding pocket, the β-phosphate-coordinating K91 side chain adopts a new rotamer that is H-bonded to D231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The reorientation of K91, alongside the loss of β-phosphate-coordination by Mg<sup>2+</sup> and its associated water network is therefore expected to lead to a significant loss of ADP affinity driving its release under physiological conditions.</p><p id="P18">Given that the conformational changes driven by MT binding leading to a ‘strong’ MT-bound state are incompatible with Mg<sup>2+</sup> remaining associated with ADP in the nucleotide pocket, we therefore predicted that in the presence of ADP, increasing Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations would reduce MT affinity by preventing the conformational changes that lead to the ‘strong’ MT-bound state. To assess this, we performed MT co-sedimentation assays with Kif5b<sup>MoNeXXX</sup> in the presence of ADP and increasing concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. As expected, MTs pellet at high centrifugal forces, while in the absence of MTs Kif5b<sup>MoNeXXX</sup> remains chiefly in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). In the presence of a molar excess of MTs, we find that at [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] ≲ 10 mM all detectable Kif5b<sup>MoNeXXX</sup> binds and co-pellets with the filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). However, as [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] rise above ~10 mM, Kif5b<sup>MoNeXXX</sup> progressively moves from the pellet to the supernatant, indicating that MT binding is reduced in a [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). We could not test Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations above 50 mM due to significant MT destabilization, however, a large a molar excess is clearly needed to decrease Kif5b<sup>MoNeXXX</sup> MT-association. This is consistent with the notion that MTs increase kinesin-1 ATPase rates by ~1000 fold, by stimulating the rate-limiting Mg<sup>2+</sup> and subsequent ADP release steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.

When the motor domain of the latter (PDB code 6wwm) was superimposed onto the motor domain in our ADP-bound Kif5b<sup>MoNeXXX</sup> model, the structures showed high similarity apart from the divergent loops 2, 3 and 8 and 9, which was similar at its base but more ordered at its apex in Kif14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>). Furthermore, a similar ‘apo-like’ network of key conserved residues was seen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11b</xref>), including the interactions between R591, D638 and K488 (equivalent to Kif5b R190, D231 and K91 respectively) which we regard as critical for the Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ADP release mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). Kif14 also exhibits an apo-like ADP-bound conformation lacking Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the absence of MTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, except for loop 11 being more disordered and loop 9 being more disordered at its apex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11c</xref>). Compared to other kinesins, Kif14 has an uncommonly high affinity for MTs in the presence of ADP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, which can be explained by the lack of Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordination and the adoption of this apo-like conformation including an extended/stabilized helix α4 MT-interacting element, even in the absence of MTs. The extension and orientation of helix α4 in Kif14 in the absence of MTs coincides with a core-β twist and movement of the overlying loop 9, leading to the R591 and D638 interaction (R190 and D231 in Kif5b) precluding Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 11c</xref>). An apo-like conformation in solution explains the unusually high basal ATPase rate of Kif14<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, as ADP-release is accelerated by the lack of Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordination.

Transition to the ‘strong’ binding state coincides with the ordering of the MT-interacting helix α4 and loop 11 elements prior to ADP release. This produces a new set of interactions with the core β-sheet and associated loop 7 and loop 9, causing a ‘twist’ of the β-sheet and displacement of these loops relative to the nucleotide-holding P-loop/helix α2a. As a result, interactions between the conserved D231 of the core β-sheet (a switch-II motif residue), T92 (helix α2a) and the water ‘cap’ holding the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion are broken, leading to its release (step 1). Concomitantly, D231 forms a new hydrogen bonding network with R190 on the displaced loop 9 and with K91 on helix α2a, such that neither Mg<sup>2+</sup> or K91 remain bound to the β-phosphate of ADP, suggesting a mechanism for MT-dependent and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-loss-triggered stimulation of ADP release (step 2). A recent magic-angle-spinning NMR study of nucleotide-free Kif5b bound to MTs also shows an interaction between K91 and D231, as in our ADP-bound structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. The importance of conserved D231 and R190 as part of the ‘Mg<sup>2+</sup>- stabilizer’ network has previously been noted, and replacement of these residues drastically reduced the ATPase rate whilst increasing ADP release rates in kinesins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The key role of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in ADP retention is also clear from the observation that mutation of the P-loop Mg<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating residue T92 results in a drastic loss of ADP affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Our observation that K91 additionally no longer supports the ADP β-phosphate suggests this as an auxiliary factor in reducing ADP affinity in response to MT binding. K91 is a highly conserved residue in the P-loop Walker A motif (GxxxxGK(S/T)) that spans P-loop and helix α2a structural elements, and a substitution at the site was recently identified as causing kyphomelic dysplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">Another finding of the present study is that the IAK motif containing tail, even when zippering the second head, has no structural effects on the MT-bound motor in the presence of either ADP or AMPPNP. Therefore, any influence of the IAK tail on kinesin-1’s mechanochemistry is unlikely to be mediated by steric or allosteric effects on the nucleotide binding site affecting nucleotide binding, release or hydrolysis. This contrasts with a previous ~8 Å cryo-EM study of a kinesin-1 motor domain without nucleotide which found tail-peptide density alongside the switch I-motif containing loop 9, which was suggested to inhibit ADP-release by preventing conformational changes around the MT-binding region and nucleotide pocket upon MT binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. However, as this sample was chemically cross-linked, sample preparation artefacts cannot be ruled out. The location of the bound tail and the mode of zippering of the second head observed in our study is akin to that seen in the X-ray crystallographic structure of the MT-free ADP-bound autoinhibited <italic>Drosophila</italic> kinesin-1 dimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. In the latter structure, CC1 was ordered with the neck linker docked in both heads prompting the authors to suggest a ‘double-lockdown autoinhibition mechanism’, whereby the tail locks the two heads in a restricted orientation (lock 1) that, in turn, prevents neck linker undocking (lock 2) such that ADP release is inhibited. However, we unambiguously show here that in the presence of ADP, the MT-associated motor domain undocks its neck linker regardless of the presence of the bound tail or of the distal motor head zippered to the first. This implies that the ‘double-lockdown’ mechanism of autoinhibition needs to be refined.</p><p id="P29">What role does tail binding then play in kinesin-1 autoinhibition? Full-length kinesin-1 with or without KLCs is autoinhibited in a manner that strongly suppresses MT association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> and according to recent models based on low-resolution negative stain EM and cross-linking mass-spectrometry, autoinhibited full-length kinesin-1 folds such that regions of the stalk obscure a MT-binding surface of at least one of the motor domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. In these models, one of the two IAK-motif containing tails in the dimer folds back to associate with and zip up the two motor domains (as in the current study), thanks to an ‘elbow’ that allows flexibility in the stalk. Although kinesin-1 appears to have a built-in tendency to fold back on itself<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, the presence of the IAK motif-containing tail is required for full inhibition of ATPase activity, ADP release and motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Taken together, in full-length kinesin-1 a key function of the IAK motif-containing tail appears that of acting as a ‘safety belt’ ensuring a stable compacted fold, thereby indirectly preventing MT landings due to regions of the stalk sterically blocking the MT-binding interface. However, although MT landing events of cargo-free full-length kinesin-1 are minimal, a basal level remains and when MT-associated these motors display reduced motility with frequent pausing and longer association/run durations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Furthermore, truncated dimeric kinesin-1 constructs lacking the tail, and in some cases most of the coiled-coil, associate strongly with MTs but are stalled and display reduced MT-stimulated ATPase and ADP release rates in the presence of exogenous tail peptide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore, this represents an additional autoinhibitory mechanism mediated by the IAK-containing tail independent of simple reduction of MT-binding via steric inhibition in the folded conformation. The structures presented here demonstrate that this does not arise from any direct influence of the tail on the conformational transitions of the MT-associated head and suggest that initial MT-stimulated ADP-release, ATP-binding or hydrolysis steps are unaffected. However, our structures would indicate that upon ATP binding to the MT-associated head, the distal one is not thrust forward by neck linker docking but is instead restricted by the tail in a new orientation dictated by the two-headed complex. Consequently, the second head is not presented to the next binding site on the MT track thus preventing MT-stimulated ADP release and ultimately processive motility. In support of this hypothesis, an initial transient of MT-stimulated ADP release occurs in the presence of the tail before further ADP release is prevented, with a similar effect found when chemically crosslinking the heads together in a tailless construct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. This mechanism can also account for tail-dependent stalling of kinesin-1 on MTs in a strongly associated state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. As only one of the two tails of kinesin-1 associates with the heads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and promotes autoinhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, it is possible that intermolecular interactions with other kinesin-1 molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>) results in zippering leading to cross-motor inhibition resulting in the characteristic tail-dependent pausing events. Autoinhibition in kinesin-1 therefore appears to be composed of multiple mechanistic layers, including those dependent on steric hinderance of MT association by regions of the stalk and those dependent on the reduction of processive stepping behavior.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p id="P30">A codon-optimized DNA sequence of human Kif5b (Uniprot entry P33176) encoding the motor domain, neck linker and CC1 (residues 1-357) fused via a flexible (Thr-Gly-Ser)9 linker to the C-terminal tail region encompassing the autoinhibitory IAK motif (residues 912-935) was purchased from Genscript and subcloned between the NdeI/XhoI sites of a pET28 vector (Novagen).

From this stage, MT segments were processed with a modified and extended version of MiRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> implemented within Relion v3.0. Briefly, a supervised 3D classification was run to undecorated 11-16 protofilament MT references, with the modal class designated within each MT assigned to all segments within that MT. The dominant 13 protofilament class was then selected and aligned to a 12 Å low-pass filtered reference of a 13-protofilament MT decorated with ADP-AlF4-bound kinesin-1 motor domains, generated from PDBs codes 5syf and 4hna using ChimeraX’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> ‘molmap’ command. Rough <italic>x</italic>-<italic>y</italic> translations and ψ angles found were then smoothed between adjacent segments along each MT using custom scripts. Rough φ (Phi) angles were then determined for segments with a second 3D refinement and the median φ angles for each MT were assigned to all segments in a given MT. Following another round of smoothing <italic>xy</italic> translations and Euler angle assignments, a fine C1 3D local refinement was then performed with 4x binned segments. ‘Segment averages’ were then generated, by averaging each segment with its 7 adjacent partners within each MT. Using segment averages, assigned φ angles for each MT were checked by supervised 3D-classification without alignment to low-pass filtered kinesin-only references rotated and translated to represent all possible seam positions and αβ-tubulin registers (i.e 26 references for a 13-protofilament MT, with 13 seam positions and their counterparts translated one monomer along the helical axis). Rough final φ angles were assigned according to the modal 3D class of all segments within each MT. Non-binned segments were then reextracted and a fine C1 3D local refinement performed followed by per-particle CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing, each followed by another fine C1 3D local refinement. MT segments were then subjected to an unsupervised 3D classification without alignment using 4 classes and the high-resolution classes selected and inputted into another round of fine C1 3D local refinement.</p><p id="P38">Symmetry expansion using 13pf MT symmetry parameters determined in Relion was performed. The symmetry expanded coordinates were then used to extract 1 x binned particles (240 pixels at 1.08 Å/pix) focused on the Kif5b<sup>MoNeIAK</sup> kinesin-tubulin interface of each asymmetric unit. To carry both CTF-refinement and polishing information from whole MT segments to individual asymmetric unit sub-particles, a signal subtraction job, but without signal subtraction applied, was used for this extraction step. Using a reference generated from this extracted asymmetric unit data, a 3D local refinement with a wide circular mask was then performed on these particles. Following this step, a supervised 3D classification without alignment was performed, using references with or without a MT-associated kinesin head. The kinesin-decorated class was selected and then either processed further (for Kif5b<sup>MoNeXXX</sup> data and Kif5b<sup>MoNeIAK</sup> data when combining one and two-headed states for maximum resolution of the MT-bound head) or re-extracted focused on the tail density in each asymmetric unit (for separate processing of Kif5b<sup>MoNeIAK</sup> one and two-headed states focused on the tail region). Particles focused on the kinesin-tubulin interface were subjected to a final local 3D refinement using a soft mask inclusive of the tubulin dimer and MT-associated motor domain. Kif5b<sup>MoNeIAK</sup> particles extracted focused on the tail were subjected to an unsupervised 3D classification without alignment using a soft mask inclusive of the distal motor head. Two classes one with and one without the second motor head were found. The one-headed class was then subjected to a final local 3D refinement using a soft mask inclusive of the tubulin dimer and MT-associated motor domain. The two-headed class was then subjected to a final local 3D refinement using a soft mask inclusive of either tubulin and both motor domains or just both motor domains without tubulin.</p><p id="P39">Global resolutions were estimated at the gold-standard FSC 0.143 cut-off (noise-substitution test-corrected), using soft masks around the refined density.

MT binding triggers transition to an apo-like state, including helix α4 extension and twisting of core β-sheet (β-core) along with movements of overlying helix α3 and loop 9 elements. These movements dismantle a hydrogen bonding network involving D231 and T92 that coordinates Mg<sup>2+</sup> through a water ‘cap’ (blue dashed lines). This drives Mg<sup>2+</sup> out of the complex, with D231 forming a new bonding network with R190 and K91 (red dashed lines). These changes disrupt key bonds stabilizing ADP’s β-phosphate (cyan dashed lines), leaving ADP only weakly coordinated by remaining contacts with helix α2a and the P-loop, promoting its subsequent release. a and β are α-phosphate and β-phosphate, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS200055-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
