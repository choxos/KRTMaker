Despite its well-established function in the animal germline, piRNAs and PIWI proteins are expressed in somatic tissues across arthropod species, raising questions about piRNA functions outside the gonads. For example, <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes express four PIWI genes, <italic>Piwi4</italic>, <italic>Piwi5</italic>, <italic>Piwi6</italic> and <italic>Ago3,</italic> in both germline and somatic tissues. We generated <italic>Piwi6</italic> knockout <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> cell lines and observed a substantial upregulation of Long Terminal Repeat (LTR)- retrotransposons, among which a full-length endogenous retrovirus that we named <italic>AalERV1</italic>. We found that Piwi6 silences <italic>AalERV1</italic> at the transcriptional level by guiding the deposition of the repressive H3K9me3 histone mark. Importantly, the control of <italic>AalERV1</italic> is recapitulated <italic>in vivo</italic> as <italic>Piwi6</italic> knockdown increased <italic>AalERV1</italic> expression in both somatic and germline tissues of <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. These results establish <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes as a model to study nuclear PIWI functions and suggest that somatic piRNA-mediated transposon silencing is evolutionarily conserved across arthropod species.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Transposable elements (TEs) are selfish genetic elements capable of moving within host genomes, integrating into new sites, and causing mutations that can harm the cell's genetic identity. In most animal species, the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway serves as a specialized defense mechanism to control TEs in the gonads. The piRNA pathway has been extensively studied in the germline of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, where 24–32 nt sized piRNAs originate from discrete genomic regions known as piRNA clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. These piRNA clusters are rich in repetitive and transposon derived sequences from past invasions and produce piRNAs that associate with PIWI proteins and guide them to their targets through sequence complementarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Target engaged PIWI-piRNA complexes can induce silencing via two distinct mechanisms: post-transcriptional gene silencing by degradation of existing RNAs and transcriptional gene silencing by establishing repressive chromatin at transposon loci. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, these modes of silencing are executed by distinct PIWI proteins. Post-transcriptional gene silencing is mediated by Aubergine (Aub) and Argonaute3 (Ago3), which cleave transposon transcripts and participate in a piRNA amplification loop termed the ping-pong cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of germ cells in a membrane-less organelle called the nuage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. In contrast, transcriptional gene silencing is mediated by Piwi and occurs in the nucleus in a slicing-independent manner. Once loaded with a piRNA, Piwi translocates to the nucleus where it recognizes nascent transposon transcripts and recruits chromatin modifiers, resulting in heterochromatin formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P5">In contrast to <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the function of the piRNA pathway in most arthropod species extends beyond the gonads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. For example, multiple PIWI genes in <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes are expressed both in somatic tissues and the germline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Interestingly, seven and nine PIWI genes are annotated in the current genome annotations of the closely related <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (yellow fever mosquito) and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (Asian tiger mosquito), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], compared to the three PIWI genes of <italic>Drosophila.</italic> This gene expansion suggests potential functional diversification of the piRNA pathway in <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. Indeed, PIWI proteins associate with piRNAs from diverse sources, including cytoplasmic viral RNA, non-retroviral endogenous viral elements (nrEVEs), protein-coding genes, and a highly conserved satellite repeat, in addition to TEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>].</p><p id="P6">In <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, the PIWI genes <italic>Ago3</italic>, <italic>Piwi4</italic>, <italic>Piwi5</italic> and <italic>Piwi6</italic> are ubiquitously expressed both in somatic and germline tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Whereas functions of Ago3, Piwi4 and Piwi5 have been characterized in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], the function of Piwi6 has thus far remained unclear. We previously showed that <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> Piwi6 associates with TE derived piRNAs, an unexpected finding given that <italic>Piwi6</italic> knockdown did not affect piRNA biogenesis. In contrast, Piwi5 and Ago3 were found to mediate TE derived piRNA biogenesis and, accordingly, to associate with these piRNAs, with Ago3 exclusively required for production of piRNAs by ping-pong amplification) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. The role of Piwi6 in <italic>de novo</italic> production of piRNAs from viral RNA seems to be minor and virus dependent. For example, <italic>Piwi6</italic> knockdown did not affect viral piRNA biogenesis in infections with Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], while it reduced dengue virus-derived piRNA levels, albeit to a lesser extent than <italic>Piwi5</italic> and <italic>Ago3</italic> knockdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, mass spectrometric analyses indicated that Piwi6 interacts with piRNA biogenesis factors such Yb, vreteno, minotaur, tejas, as did Piwi4, Piwi5 and Ago3. Intriguingly however, Piwi6 was the only protein that also interacted with proteins with putative nuclear functions in chromatin assembly, nucleic acid binding, or regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], suggesting that Piwi6 mediates transcriptional gene silencing.</p><p id="P7">In this study, we investigated Piwi6 function in <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockouts (KO) in U4.4 cells, a cell line that mimics PIWI protein and piRNA expression of somatic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Through small-RNA sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing analyses, we found that Piwi6 mediates transcriptional gene silencing of LTR retrotransposons, including a putatively mobile, full-length LTR/Gypsy-like endogenous retrovirus that we named <italic>AalERV1</italic>. Furthermore, structure-guided mutational analyses revealed that the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of Piwi6 is crucial for nuclear localization and transcriptional gene silencing. Our results establish that the <italic>Aedes</italic> piRNA pathway has a nuclear arm that functions in transcriptional silencing of TEs in the soma, which evolved independently of the nuclear function of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Piwi.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>Piwi6</italic> is broadly expressed in the soma and germline of <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic></title><p id="P8">PIWI proteins in <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are highly similar to those of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and share the overall domain structure with their orthologs in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (Piwi) and the silk moth <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (Siwi). Specifically, <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> Piwi6 is &gt; 90% identical to <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> Piwi6 at the amino acid level, while it has around 55% similarity and 40% identity to Piwi and Siwi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). Moreover, experimentally validated residues with crucial functions, such as piRNA binding sites and catalytically active sites are conserved in <italic>Aedes</italic> Piwi6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). We evaluated the expression pattern of PIWI genes in dissected tissues from non-blood fed, female <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes by RT-PCR. <italic>Piwi4</italic>, <italic>Piwi6</italic> and <italic>Ago3</italic> were broadly expressed in legs, heads, midguts, salivary glands, Malpighian tubules, carcasses and ovaries, while <italic>Piwi5</italic> was highly expressed in carcasses and ovaries, lowly expressed in legs, heads, salivary glands and Malpighian tubules, and undetectable in midguts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, expression of <italic>Piwi2</italic> and <italic>Piwi3</italic> was found in the ovaries and carcasses, and <italic>Piwi7</italic> was undetectable in any adult tissue. These results confirm and extend previous observations in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> that the expression of members of the expanded PIWI family is not restricted to the germline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Piwi6 is not required for the biogenesis of virus and host derived piRNAs</title><p id="P9">We used CRISPR/Cas9 engineering to generate <italic>Piwi6</italic> knockouts in the <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> U4.4 cell line. Sanger sequencing of two independent clones revealed frameshift mutations leading to premature stop codons in all <italic>Piwi6</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>), which was confirmed by RT-qPCR analysis showing a strong reduction in <italic>Piwi6</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>), likely as a result of nonsense-mediated RNA decay. Indeed, Piwi6 protein was undetectable in western blot analysis, confirming the knockout phenotype of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Overall, microRNA and endogenous piRNA counts, as well as mRNA and TE expression correlated well between both <italic>Piwi6</italic> KO clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>), and we therefore used the average read counts from both clones throughout this study. In parallel to the <italic>Piwi6</italic> KO cells, we used <italic>Cas9</italic> transfection in the absence of gene-specific guide RNAs to generate control cells (Ctrl), which were used along with the parental wild-type (WT) U4.4 cells in some experiments.</p><p id="P10">Previous studies have found that viral RNA is processed into viral (v)piRNAs in <italic>Aedes</italic> cell lines and adult mosquitoes upon infection with arthropod-borne viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. To assess whether Piwi6 plays a role in vpiRNA production, we infected <italic>Piwi6</italic> KO and WT cells with recombinant Sindbis virus expressing GFP (SINV-GFP) and analyzed small RNA expression by RNA sequencing. While the size distribution of small RNAs mapping to the SINV-GFP genome did not change in <italic>Piwi6</italic> KOs compared to WT cells, the number of SINV-derived piRNA reads was reduced in <italic>Piwi6</italic> KOs, which could not be explained by differences in viral RNA replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S2C-S2D</xref>). This reduction in vpiRNA levels was relatively minor compared to the effect observed for <italic>Piwi5</italic> KO cells (described elsewhere), in which vpiRNA production was completely abolished. Moreover, the sequence logos of the remaining vpiRNAs were unaffected by Piwi6 loss, with strong enrichments for a uridine at position 1 of antisense piRNAs and an adenosine at position 10 of sense piRNAs, indicative of a functioning ping-pong amplification cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure S2E</xref>). These results argue against an essential role for Piwi6 in vpiRNA biogenesis and are in line with our earlier observations upon <italic>Piwi6</italic> knockdown in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] (manuscript in preparation).</p><p id="P11">We next mapped the small RNA sequences to the <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> genome to study how Piwi6 loss affects the expression of endogenous small RNAs. While the levels of 21–24 nt reads, depicting putative small interfering RNAs and microRNAs, were unaffected by Piwi6 loss, the levels of piRNA-sized reads were increased in <italic>Piwi6</italic> KO cells compared to WT and Ctrl cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This was unexpected as we anticipated that loss of a PIWI protein would result in reduced expression of the piRNA population bound to it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. To study which specific population of piRNAs were deregulated upon Piwi6 loss, we systematically analyzed the main classes of endogenous piRNAs derived from nrEVEs, piRNA clusters, TEs and other repeat elements. No major differences were observed in the expression of nrEVE-mapping piRNAs in <italic>Piwi6</italic> KO compared to WT cells, regardless of their orientation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure S4A-B</xref>). We next analyzed piRNA clusters, using our recent annotation containing 285 piRNA clusters in <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> U4.4 cells, 37 of which were ubiquitously expressed across tissues (core-clusters) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Although an increased number of piRNAs mapped to some clusters upon Piwi6 loss, this effect was relatively mild (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure S4C-D</xref>). Moreover, the same clusters were also affected in the Ctrl cells, suggesting a clonal effect rather than a direct effect of Piwi6 loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure S4C-D</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that Piwi6 is not generally required for the biogenesis of virus-, nrEVE-, and piRNA cluster-derived piRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Increased expression of LTR retrotransposons upon Piwi6 loss</title><p id="P12">TEs are a major source of endogenous piRNAs, and we thus counted and categorized TE-mapping piRNAs using the RepeatMasker annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] and noticed a 1.7- and 1.9-fold increase in the total number of LTR retrotransposon-derived piRNAs upon Piwi6 loss compared to WT and Ctrl cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), In contrast, piRNAs mapping to other TE classes, as well as satellite repeats, simple repeats and unclassified repeat classes were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, increased expression was most prominent for piRNAs mapping in sense orientation to TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure S4C</xref>), and these sense piRNAs had a stronger 10A bias in <italic>Piwi6</italic> KO cells than in WT and Ctrl cells, a signature of ping-pong amplified piRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In ping-pong amplification, antisense piRNAs guide the recognition and cleavage of mRNA transcripts, after which these are processed into sense piRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Given the significant increase in sense piRNAs originating from LTR retrotransposons in <italic>Piwi6</italic> KO cells, we speculated that Piwi6 loss may result in desilencing of these elements, resulting in an increased number of transposon transcripts that serve as substrates for piRNA production. To test this hypothesis, we performed RNA-sequencing on WT, Ctrl and <italic>Piwi6</italic> KO cells and mapped the reads to the <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> repeat annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. <italic>Piwi6</italic> loss resulted in differential expression of 206 out of a total of 2533 TE sequences (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; no threshold for log2 fold change) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). Of those, 145 elements were significantly upregulated and 61 downregulated compared to Ctrl cells, and similar results were obtained when differential expression was tested against WT instead of Ctrl cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure S3E-F</xref>). Among the differentially expressed TEs, LTR retrotransposons were particularly affected, with 108 LTR elements significantly upregulated and 32 elements downregulated in <italic>Piwi6</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure S4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Beyond the number of differentially expressed TEs, LTR elements also showed the highest level of desilencing in <italic>Piwi6</italic> KO cells: 19 elements showed an increase in expression of &gt; 16-fold (range, 16 to 826-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data indicate that Piwi6 is particularly required for silencing LTR retrotransposons, the elements with the highest abundance and rate of recent transposition in the <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Piwi6 regulates a full-length endogenous retrovirus</title><p id="P14">To find out which regions in the genome were affected by Piwi6 loss, we manually inspected genomic regions and noticed a 7904 bp sequence that was strongly upregulated in <italic>Piwi6</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). These upregulated transcripts seem to be processed into piRNAs, as expression of both sense and antisense piRNAs derived from this sequence was increased in <italic>Piwi6</italic> KO cells. This locus was flanked by sequences corresponding to LTR/Gypsy family-43 at both the 5’ and 3’ ends and contained sequences corresponding to LTR/Gypsy family-210 as well as a region that was unannotated in the <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Moreover, one of the TE elements that showed the highest upregulation upon <italic>Piwi6</italic> loss, LTR Gypsy family-3394 (22-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), aligned to this locus with high identity over two regions (96% and 99% for the first and the second region, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The locus was predicted to encode ORFs with similarity to the <italic>gag</italic>, <italic>pol</italic> and <italic>env</italic> genes of infectious endogenous retroviruses, such as the gypsy element in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).
