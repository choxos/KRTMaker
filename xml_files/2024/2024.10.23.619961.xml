We present here the discovery and characterization of a small molecule chemical inducer of proximity that activates mutant p53. We named this compound <underline>TR</underline>anscriptional <underline>A</underline>ctivator of <underline>p</underline>53 (<bold>TRAP-1</bold>) due to its ability to engage mutant p53 and BRD4 in a ternary complex, which potently activates mutant p53 and triggers robust p53 target gene transcription. Treatment of p53<sup>Y220C</sup> expressing pancreatic cell lines with <bold>TRAP-1</bold> results in rapid upregulation of p21 and other p53 target genes and inhibits the growth of p53<sup>Y220C</sup>-expressing cell lines. Negative control compounds that are unable to form a ternary complex do not have these effects, demonstrating the necessity of chemically induced proximity for the observed pharmacology. This approach to activating mutant p53 highlights how chemically induced proximity can be used to restore the functions of tumor suppressor proteins that have been inactivated by mutation in cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The p53 protein is a transcription factor that activates multiple antiproliferative signaling pathways, including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, in response to DNA damage, ribosomal stress, and oncogenic signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. In the absence of these stresses, the ubiquitin ligase Mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) keeps p53 protein levels low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. When this negative regulation is released, p53 activates anti-neoplastic programs, such as cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Due to these functions, <italic>TP53</italic> is the most mutated gene found in cancer with ~50% of patients showing somatic mutation across a range of tumor types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Approximately 80% of sequenced p53 lesions are missense mutations that cluster in the DNA-binding domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. These mutations cause reduced thermal stability and/or impaired DNA binding, thus compromising the tumor suppressor function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">For decades, restoring p53 function has been a goal in the development of cancer therapeutics. These efforts have stimulated the development of MDM2 inhibitors, such as nutlin-3a, which lead to stabilization of p53<sup>WT 8</sup>. Severe thrombocytopenia limits the therapeutic use of nutlin-3a and related molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Another approach to restoring p53 function is to stabilize the mutated protein with directed small molecule ligands. Recently, several groups have developed small molecule p53 “correctors” that increase the thermal stability and partially restore the transcriptional activity of mutated p53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. These p53 corrector molecules target a structural cavity created by p53<sup>Y220C 12</sup>, a hotspot mutation affecting ~120,000 patients per year and accounting for approximately 1.6% of tumor p53 missense mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Several successful medicinal chemistry campaigns have targeted the p53<sup>Y220C</sup> pocket to improve the thermal stability of mutant p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). An initial <italic>in silico</italic> screen followed by structural investigation identified a carbazole fragment PhiKan083 with weak binding affinity to p53<sup>Y220C 15</sup>. Further optimization of this scaffold produced the lead compounds PK5196 and PK9328 with enhanced binding affinity, leading to increased expression of p53 target genes and improved antiproliferative activity in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Using a similar approach, PMV Pharmaceuticals and Jacobio Pharmaceuticals have developed the mutant-specific small molecule p53 binders rezatapopt (PC14586) and JAB-30355<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, respectively. In addition, the presence of a reactive cysteine in the p53<sup>Y220C</sup> inspired synthesis of covalent-acting fragments such as KG13, which selectively targets mutant p53 via covalent modification of the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine 220 side chain using a methyl acrylamide warhead<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Despite these advances, it is not clear to what extent partial p53<sup>Y220C</sup> functional restoration will provoke a clinically meaningful outcome. A major unresolved question is whether enhancing the thermal stability of mutant p53 to wild-type (WT) level is sufficient for cancer therapy, or if further activation is also required. Small molecule p53 activators are required to answer this question.</p><p id="P4">The advent of event-driven pharmacology, enabled by chemically induced proximity, has expanded the scope of targets addressable by small molecules. Leveraging molecular proximity as a unifying regulatory principle, small molecules that induce new protein-protein interactions have enabled precise control over cellular signaling, including rewiring of protein degradation pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. These strategies offer major advantages beyond traditional occupancy-based pharmacology: <italic>i</italic>) a single small molecule may catalyze multiple rounds of degradation, transcription, etc., <italic>ii</italic>) efficacy does not require complete target occupancy, and <italic>iii</italic>) the use of dual targets creates a logical “AND” gate, resulting in enhanced cellular and biochemical selectivity. Recently reported p53-targeting small molecules that purport to take advantage of these characteristics include those that induce mutant p53 degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, p53 acetylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, p53 stabilization by deubiquitylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, and selective mutant p53 cancer cell killing by inducing p53-dependent toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Here we seek to leverage the induced proximity strategy to directly activate the core function of mutant p53: transcriptional activity.</p><p id="P5">To activate p53, we took inspiration from an approach we have recently developed that uses small molecules to reprogram transcription factors. These small molecules, which are called transcriptional/epigenetic chemical inducers of proximity (TCIPs), recruit transcriptional coactivators (BRD4 or CDK9/pTEF-B) to gene promoters bound by the transcriptional repressor protein, BCL6 (B cell lymphoma 6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Treatment of BCL6-high B cell lymphomas with TCIPs rapidly activates a suite of cell death genes normally repressed by BCL6, resulting in tumor cell-specific cell death. Here we apply this logic to develop mutant-specific small molecules <underline>TR</underline>anscriptional <underline>A</underline>ctivators of <underline>p</underline>53 (TRAPs). We report proof-of-concept TRAPs that recruit the transcriptional coactivator protein BRD4 to p53<sup>Y220C</sup>. These small molecules activate p53 and produce exaggerated pharmacology when compared with existing small molecules that can only restore p53 thermal stability. Further development of TRAPs towards clinical candidates has the potential to provide clinical benefit to patients with p53<sup>Y220C</sup> cancers.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Small molecules that specifically activate a p53 mutant</title><p id="P6">To enable discovery of p53 activator compounds, we established a p53 luciferase reporter assay in BxPC-3 cells. In these cells, the sole remaining <italic>TP53</italic> allele codes for p53<sup>Y220C 30</sup>. We first used this assay to search for small molecule p53 binders that could serve as starting points for bivalent compound synthesis. We screened a series of published p53<sup>Y220C</sup> correctors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and the acetylation targeting chimera (AceTAC) molecule MS78<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Among these, the B-1 binder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, which shares the same chemotype as the currently reported p53<sup>Y220C</sup> selective clinical candidates, was the only compound that activated the reporter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Encouraged by these results, we next synthesized a tool compound, <bold>B-1 linker</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>), where the methyl piperidine in B-1 was functionalized with a short alkyl linker through amide bond coupling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. <bold>B-1 linker</bold> produced enhanced transcriptional activation in the reporter assay relative to the parental B-1 molecule (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). This suggests that functionalization of B-1 with a linker did not impede p53 binding and possibly contributed additional favorable protein-ligand interactions, aiding in the restoration of p53 function.</p><p id="P7">Knowing that presence of a linker did not affect the functional response, we used <bold>B-1 linker</bold> as the basis for a library of bivalent molecules where the B-1 binder was linked to the bromodomain ligand JQ1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> through alkyl, PEG, and rigid diamine linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). JQ1 recruits BRD4 without inhibiting its transcriptional activator function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We next asked if the compounds in the library can induce a complex between BRD4 and p53<sup>Y220C</sup> <italic>in vitro</italic>. To test this, we purified recombinant p53<sup>Y220C</sup> DNA binding domain and established a time-resolved fluorescent energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay between BRD4<sub>BD1</sub> and p53<sup>Y220C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Due to the bifunctional nature of the molecules, we expected to observe a reduction of complex formation when excess bivalent molecules saturate individual protein binding sites rather than forming the ternary complex, a phenomenon commonly called the “hook effect”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Among the tested compounds, those with methylene-connected (<bold>462, 463</bold>) or spiro (<bold>464</bold>) six-membered heterocycle linkers showed bell-shaped curves, with the greatest TR-FRET ratios at the peak and a visible hook effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), while compounds with smaller rigid linkers, flexible alkyl, and PEG linkers produced much weaker signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Additionally, minor structural changes in the linkers, such as removing the methylene spacer (<bold>537</bold>) or replacing one nitrogen atom on the six-membered ring (<bold>540</bold>), resulted in a rightward shift of the curve (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Taken together, the biochemical data identified compounds <bold>462</bold> (<bold>TRAP-1</bold>), <bold>463</bold> (<bold>TRAP-2</bold>), and <bold>464</bold> (<bold>TRAP-3</bold>) as small molecules that induce proximity between the p53<sup>Y220C</sup> DNA binding domain and BRD4<sub>BD1</sub>.</p><p id="P8">Using the p53 reporter assay, we proceeded to screen our bivalent compound library to assess p53-dependent transcriptional activity. We compared these results with co-treatment of cells with the individual binders as a control. JQ1 did not induce p53 target gene activation at concentrations up to 10 µM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Co-treatment with the <bold>B-1 linker</bold> and JQ1 produced modest reporter activation (12-fold versus DMSO) compared with the <bold>B-1 linker</bold> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In contrast, <bold>TRAP-1, TRAP-2</bold>, and <bold>TRAP-3</bold> each produced dose-dependent reporter activation, with <bold>TRAP-1</bold> inducing 40-fold target gene transcription upregulation at 10 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Further increasing the concentration beyond 10 µM resulted in a decrease in luciferase signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), recapitulating the “hook effect” observed in the TR-FRET dimerization assay. Compounds that showed lower dimerization ability in the TR-FRET assay induced lower or no transcription activation at the concentration range that we tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>). This observation, along with strong overall correlation between reporter gene induction and biochemical binding as measured by TR-FRET (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E</xref>), suggested that transcriptional activation of p53-dependent transcription depends on chemically induced BRD4-p53 proximity. Collectively, the data suggest that <bold>TRAP-1, TRAP-2</bold>, and <bold>TRAP-3</bold> are potent p53<sup>Y220C</sup> transcriptional activators.</p><p id="P9">We next sought to explore bivalents featuring different p53<sup>Y220C</sup> selective binders. For this, we focused on PK9328<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> as the p53<sup>Y220C</sup> binder which has been previously used for the development of MS78, an acetylation-inducing chimera<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). Treatment with PK9328 alone did not produce transcriptional activation in the reporter assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>), and the synthesis of a similar small library of TRAP candidate compounds produced no active compounds in the TR-FRET dimerization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>) or luciferase reporter assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Transcriptional activation requires ternary complex formation</title><p id="P10">To test whether transcriptional activation by our molecules depends on co-binding to p53<sup>Y220C</sup> and BRD4, we designed and synthesized negative control compounds with minor chemical modifications that disrupt binding to either p53<sup>Y220C</sup> or BRD4. Using <bold>TRAP-1</bold> as a template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), <bold>TRAP-1-Neg1</bold> was synthesized with an opposite chiral configuration to reduce BRD4 binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Likewise, <bold>TRAP-1-Neg2</bold> was designed with two extra methylations on the B-1 nitrogen atoms to remove the H-bond interactions that were shown to be crucial for p53<sup>Y220C</sup> binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Compared with the lead compounds, the negative controls showed negligible ternary complex formation in the TR-FRET dimerization assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>) and no transcriptional activation in the reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). A TR-FRET assay between p53<sup>WT</sup> and BRD4 also resulted in no TRAP-induced ternary complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). These data confirm that the enhanced transcriptional activation is associated with the ternary complex formation between p53<sup>Y220C</sup>, BRD4, and compound. Furthermore, chemically induced proximity is p53 mutant-specific.</p><p id="P11">To test the idea that TRAPs induce p53-BRD4 binding in cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids coding for FLAG-BRD4 and p53<sup>Y220C</sup>-V5, and anti-FLAG beads were used to isolate BRD4-associated proteins from cell lysates after cellular compound treatment. p53<sup>Y220C</sup> pulled down with BRD4 after cell treatment with TRAPs; <bold>TRAP-1</bold> and <bold>TRAP-2</bold> induced stronger interactions than <bold>TRAP-3</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Co-treatment with the two parental compounds did not induce an interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that TRAPs induce a stable interaction between p53<sup>Y220C</sup> and BRD4.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>TRAP-1 activates p53 target genes</title><p id="P12">We next evaluated the immediate transcriptional consequences of treatment with TRAPs. To do so, we examined validated direct transcriptional targets of p53 with known functions in p53 regulation (<italic>MDM2</italic>), cell cycle arrest (<italic>CDKN1A</italic>), and apoptosis (<italic>PMAIP1, BBC3</italic>, and <italic>BAX)</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. We used reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to measure mRNA levels in BxPC-3 cells. Time course experiments after treatment with 3 µM of <bold>TRAP-1</bold> showed time-dependent upregulation of <italic>MDM2</italic> and <italic>CDKN1A</italic> as early as 2 h after incubation, with maximum levels accumulating at approximately 8 h post-treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). The apoptosis-effector genes <italic>PMAIP1</italic> and <italic>BBC3</italic> showed modest mRNA increases. <italic>TP53</italic> mRNA levels were not affected by the molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). To compare TRAPs with the parental compounds, we measured p53 target gene levels by RT-qPCR after 8 h of treatment. We tested <bold>TRAP-1</bold>, the parental binders, and the two negative controls in BxPC-3 cells. <bold>TRAP-1</bold> induced mRNA expression for <italic>MDM2, CDKN1A</italic>, and <italic>BBC3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Induction was stronger for <bold>TRAP-1</bold> compared with B-1, JQ1, or <bold>TRAP-1-Neg1</bold> and <bold>TRAP-1-Neg2</bold>. These data match the results from reporter gene assays and the kinetics of gene activation we have observed for the best TCIP compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Overall, these results indicate that TRAPs induce robust expression of direct p53 target genes, likely by recruiting BRD4 to the sites bound by chemically corrected p53<sup>Y220C</sup>.</p><p id="P13">We next used Western blotting to evaluate whether elevated mRNA levels for p53 target genes corresponds to elevated protein expression. Treatment with <bold>TRAP-1, TRAP-2</bold>, and <bold>TRAP-3</bold> for 16 h in BxPC-3 cells caused robust upregulation of p21 and MDM2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The parental binders did not have this effect. We observed no significant changes in p53, PUMA, or BAX protein levels at this time point for any of the tested compounds. Potent upregulation of p21 was evident as early as 2 h after treatment with <bold>TRAP-1</bold>, highlighting the rapid and likely direct effect of the small molecules on p53 target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Induction of cell cycle arrest factors, and p21 in particular, suggests that TRAPs may irreversibly reprogram cancer cell transcription. To test the idea that a pulsatile treatment with the most potent TRAPs might be sufficient to trigger an inescapable growth arrest, we conducted a washout experiment. BxPC-3 cells were treated with TRAPs for two hours – sufficient time to induce high levels of p21 protein – and the small molecules were subsequently washed away. After this, the cells were allowed to proliferate unperturbed for 72 h. Both <bold>TRAP-1</bold> and <bold>TRAP-2</bold> inhibited cell proliferation in this assay, while the parental B-1 binder did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).

While there have been successful approaches to inhibiting oncogenic transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, there have not been actionable strategies for activating tumor suppressor transcription factors like p53. Proof of concept experiments carried out in mouse models of disease demonstrate that p53 reactivation is a viable strategy to treat cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Until now, chemical activators of mutant p53 have yet to deliver on the promise of this concept.</p><p id="P17">Here we developed a small molecule approach to generate p53 transcriptional activators. To do this, we chemically fused the transcriptional co-activator function of BRD4 to the restored DNA binding activity of p53<sup>Y220C</sup>. The resulting lead compound <bold>TRAP-1</bold> induced an interaction between p53<sup>Y220C</sup> and BRD4. The ternary complex was p53 mutant-specific and activated p53 target gene transcription rapidly, potently, and dose-dependently in p53<sup>Y220C</sup> bearing BxPC-3 cells. The transcriptional activation was significantly stronger than that observed upon treatment with parental p53<sup>Y220C</sup> corrector, B-1, either given alone or in combination with the BRD4 binder JQ1.</p><p id="P18">Our experiments indicate that <bold>TRAP-1</bold> activates p53 by an induced proximity mechanism. Previous studies describe a synergistic relationship between BRD4 (with CPI203) and MDM2 inhibition (with nutlin-3). This was observed in acute myeloid leukemia cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Our biochemical and cellular data indicate that transcriptional activation induced by <bold>TRAP-1</bold> is fundamentally distinct at a mechanistic level. <bold>TRAP-1</bold> induced both p21 and MDM2, produced a modest increase in apoptosis-related genes at mRNA levels, and displayed antiproliferative activity in BxPC-3 cells. These and other activities correlated well with biochemical ternary complex formation and were obviated by minimal chemical modifications of <bold>TRAP-1</bold> to produce negative control compounds. Further efforts to find TRAP candidates using a different p53<sup>Y220C</sup> ligand, PK9328, which was inactive in our p53 reporter assay, failed to produce active compounds, suggesting the activities of <bold>TRAP-1</bold> are not simply due to co-inhibition of BRD4 and p53, but rather reflect formation of a specific ternary complex.</p><p id="P19">This work demonstrates a new approach to activating p53 through the formation of a complex with BRD4 via chemically induced proximity. Further optimization is needed to enhance potency and mitigate cell cytotoxicity from BRD4 inhibition. Efforts to use different effector proteins are also currently underway. Besides BRD4, chromatin-modifying enzymes such as bromodomain and PHD finger containing 1 (BRPF1), histone acetyltransferase paralogues p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP), and others have been recruited for endogenous gene activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

In addition to these effectors, disease-specific driver proteins are potential candidates for the development of advanced TRAP molecules with improved selectivity.</p><p id="P20">Previous studies on bifunctional compounds that target p53 mainly focused on p53 post-translational modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, protein abundance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, and cellular enrichment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Direct potentiation of p53 transcriptional activity is heretofore unreported in the published literature. <bold>TRAP-1</bold> embodies an approach to drugging p53 that depends on protein-protein interaction induction by bivalent or monomeric molecular glue compounds. This strategy demonstrates the potential of chemically induced proximity to directly activate transcription factor function.
