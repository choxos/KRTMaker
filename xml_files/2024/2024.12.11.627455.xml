It is a particularly unpleasant kind of pain, often described with adjectives such as ‘shooting’, ‘burning’ or ‘stabbing’. Unfortunately, it is also rather common; a recent epidemiological study estimates that 9% of individuals in the UK live with the condition, with middle- to older-age women particularly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baskozos et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Mechanistically, neuropathic pain arises as a result of peripheral and central nervous system hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Colloca et al., 2017</xref>). In the periphery, this hyperactivity is believed to be significantly driven by the local inflammatory milieu; most work to date has focused on immune cells – suggesting involvement of e.g. macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gylfadottir et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Sandy-Hindmarch et al., 2024</xref>), natural killer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Davies et al., 2019</xref>) and other adaptive immune cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Davoli-Ferreira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Singh et al., 2022</xref>). However, it is becoming clearer that mesenchymal lineage cells like fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Shinotsuka and Denk, 2022</xref>) are also likely to play significant roles.</p><p id="P8">From both animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Singhmar et al., 2020</xref>) and human studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hofmann et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kreβ et al., 2021</xref>), evidence is accumulating that certain fibroblast subtypes and the mediators they release can be pro-algesic in the context of neuropathic pain. This makes perfect sense when we consider that fibroblasts are well-known to be crucial drivers of chronic inflammatory states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Parsonage et al., 2005</xref>), with tissue-independent, universal sub-types present in pathologically inflamed tissues in conditions as wide-ranging as rheumatoid arthritis, interstitial lung disease, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Buechler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Korsunsky et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P9">One subtype of note is a population of NOTCH3+ (neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 3) fibroblasts that has been shown to proliferate in the sub-lining of joint synovial membrane in arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). This population is also positive for marker genes <italic>THY1</italic> (thymus-cell antigen 1), <italic>CCL19</italic> (C-C motif chemokine ligand 19) and <italic>PDGFRB</italic> (platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta); it has been reported to be a universal pathological subset present in inflamed skin, colon, joint and lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Buechler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Korsunsky et al., 2022</xref>). Crucially, Wei and colleagues demonstrated that the identity of this cell sub-population is positionally determined, with signals from perivascular endothelial cells controlling their phenotype as well as that of NOTCH3+ mural cells. These could be either vascular smooth muscle cells, if located around arteries or arterioles, or pericytes, if wrapped around capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Davis and Attwell, 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Mural cells have been very poorly studied in neuropathic pain to date, although pioneering work and proposals by Heike Rittner’s group suggest they could play a role in the blood-nerve barrier breakdown that has been observed in some experimental models of neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Reinhold et al., 2023</xref>). They are also thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of conditions that can cause neuropathic pain, such as diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Mateus Gonçalves et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Here, we present novel evidence for the involvement of both pathological fibroblasts and mural cells in neuropathic pain. We show that these cell types contain particularly high levels of known and putative pro-algesic mediators in a mouse model of traumatic neuropathy. We further demonstrate that the number of mural cells in nerve is increased for 2 months after model induction, with significant pain-relevant transcriptional dysregulation observable in both Pdgfrb+ fibroblasts and mural cells. Finally, we show that human nerve pericytes, when stimulated, release pro-algesic mediators at protein level and can induce intracellular activation of induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSC)-derived sensory neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animals</title><p id="P12">We used either C57BL/6J wild-type mice purchased from Charles River, UK, or Pdgfrb-CreERT2-tdTomato mice, with both strains obtained from the Jackson Laboratory: RRID:IMSR_JAX:029684, allele: Tg(Pdgfrb-cre/ERT2)6096Rha/J (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gerl et al., 2015</xref>) &amp; RRID:IMSR_JAX:007908, Ai14 tdTomato allele: Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>). Pdgfrb-CreERT2-tdTomato mice were bred in-house at King’s College London to be homozygous for tdTomato and hemizygous for the Pdgfrb-CreERT2 allele. All mice were housed in individually ventilated cages in a 12-hour light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. Experiments were conducted in accordance with the United Kingdom Home Office Legislation (Scientific Procedures Act, 1986) and were approved by the Home Office to be conducted at King’s College London. All mice were adult at the point of nerve injury (i.e. at least 8 weeks of age), with both males and females used as indicated in the individual experimental methods below. To induce tdTomato in Pdgfrb+ cells, tamoxifen was injected once intraperitoneally at 75 mg/kg, one week before surgery. All mice tolerated the surgery well, but during the tissue clearing study, one sham-operated mouse had to be culled due to malocclusion. During the FACS experiment for bulk-sequencing, one mouse had to be excluded as it did not have any tdTomato signal. For single cell sequencing, the n numbers refer to a pool of animals; in all other instances n numbers refer to individual mice.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Neuropathic pain model</title><p id="P13">Partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL) was carried out according to previously published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liang et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, after pre-operative subcutaneous administration of 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine (Henry Schein, Melville, NY, Cat# 988-3245), mice were anaesthetised with isoflurane. An incision was made in the skin over the left thigh of the mouse, and the underlying muscle was blunt dissected. Approximately two-thirds of the sciatic nerve was ligated with a 5.0 VICRYL absorbable suture (Ethicon, Cincinnati, OH, Cat# W9982). The wound was closed with a metal clip (Reflex, 7mm, Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA, Cat# 12032-07), which was removed 7-10 days after the procedure. Sham surgery was performed in identical fashion, but the nerve was only visually exposed by blunt dissection without being mechanically disturbed. Animals were not randomised into sham or surgery groups, but rather age-matched littermates were chosen for one or the other procedure. Allocation was thus not concealed. The success of surgery and persistence of nerve damage was confirmed by checking that all PSNL mice continued to display the expected postural abnormalities in the operated hind-leg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liang et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p id="P14">At acute (5 days after PSNL) and chronic (2 months after PSNL) timepoints, mice were transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline, after which ipsi- and contralateral sciatic nerves were dissected into F12 solution (Gibco, New York, NY, Cat# 21765-029) and trimmed to a 0.5 cm (data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) or a 1 cm piece around the lesion site (all other experiments). In either case, the distal and proximal pieces were kept at the same length (0.25 or 0.5 cm each). The suture was removed at this point, if still present. A single cell solution was generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liang et al., 2020</xref>).

Analysis did not proceed blind to condition, but identical gates were used for all samples within an experiment and initially placed with the help of fluorescence-minus one controls. Cell counts were used as the outcome measure and compared between groups using a non-parametric Mann Whitney t-test; sensitivity analysis indicates that with n = 10, this t-test will have an 80% chance to detect effect sizes of d = 1.36 or larger, with alpha at 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)</title><p id="P15">At acute (4-6 days after PSNL) and chronic (2 months after PSNL) timepoints, C57BL/6J wild-type mice were transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline, after which ipsilateral sciatic nerves were dissected to a 0.5 cm piece around the lesion site, as described above.

Briefly, nerves were gently shaken in blocking buffer at 37°C for two days, consisting of 0.3% Triton-X-100 (Sigma, #T-9284) and 2% BSA (Sigma, #A3294-100G) in PBS, with 1 μg/ml DAPI (SLS, #D9542-1M). They were then washed in 0.2% Triton and placed in CUBIC R1 solution: 25% N,N,N’,N’-tetrakis (Sigma, #122262-1L), 15% Triton X-100, 25% Urea (Sigma, #U-6504) in distilled water. Nerves were kept in CUBIC R1 for 5 days, refreshing the solution once during incubation the period. After that, they were transferred into CUBIC R2 solution for 24hr: 50% Sucrose, 25% Urea, 10% Triethanolamine (Sigma, #90279-500ML), 0.1% Triton in distilled water. Nerves were mounted on microscope slides in home-made wells containing CUBIC R2 solution and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope using a 20x objective (20x/0.8na).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Imaging and analysis</title><p id="P26">To image whole, cleared sciatic nerves, the 20x objective (0.8na) was used, and clearly visible blood vessels were identified based on FITC staining. A z-stack at 2-8 μm intervals was taken for each nerve region selected, capturing the whole thickness of the selected vessel. For sham ipsilateral and PSNL contralateral samples, two distinct regions per nerve were selected to image from. For PSNL ipsilateral samples, one or two images from the area of the lesion and one or two from either side of the lesion were taken. When collecting the first batch of samples for the 5-day timepoint, there were no markings to aid with identification of the orientation of the nerve; therefore, at the 5 day timepoint, we could only define images as captured at the “Site of Lesion” and “Away from Lesion”. In this one batch, we also did not perform any sham surgeries. For later experiments (including a second batch at day 5 post-PSNL), sham surgeries were preformed, and the sciatic nerve was marked using a diagonal incision during collection; this meant that regions upstream and downstream from the lesion could be conclusively identified during imaging. The two batches of the day 5 experiments are shown separately in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>.</p><p id="P27">Analysis of the images proceeded in FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) by an experimenter blinded to treatment group. In brief, vessel area was determined based on FITC signal. FITC thresholds were set based on vessel visibility. Tdtomato thresholds were set as recommended by the software for the day 5 experiments. For the 2-month imaging data, the thresholds set by the software appeared to differ between experimental conditions. We therefore chose to apply the FITC thresholds to the TdTomato images instead for this timepoint, as these did not appear to be impacted by experimental condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figure 5C &amp; G</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Once thresholds were set, the FITC signal was artificially broadened to identify tdtomato positive cells in close proximity to vessels (putative mural cells). DAPI staining was then used to identify nuclei using the StarDist Plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Schmidt et al., 2018</xref>). Nuclei which overlapped with putative mural cells (tdtomato/FITC double positive) and putative fibroblasts (tdtomato alone) were exported as regions of interest (ROIs) and further analysed in Excel. ROIs were exported for five z-planes per nerve region, each 8 μm apart, and an average of all measurements taken for each nerve region. Where two images per nerve region were captured and analysed, an average was taken for that region.</p><p id="P29">For all experiments, the number of nuclei was determined by counting all ROIs with an area of at least 10 μm<sup>2</sup>; the number of mural cells was determined by counting the number of nuclei overlapping with tdTomato-FITC co-expression; while the number of tdTomato positive cells was determined by counting the number of nuclei overlapping with tdTomato expression. The vessels in the analysed images were also classified as arterioles, venules, epineurial and endoneurial capillaries by a blinded experimenter, based on morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). This was done to ensure the image selection did not bias the results of the analysis. In the chronic injury samples, extensive morphological and vascular disorganisation was observed, which means vessel classification in these conditions may be less accurate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S16"><title>Nerve fibroblasts and mural cell populations contain particularly high levels of known and putative pro-algesic mediators</title><p id="P30">We performed scRNA-seq on mesenchymal lineage cells in mouse nerves 5 days and 2 months after partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL).

This was observed across three different experiments performed by different experimenters with distinct flow cytometry panels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figures 1-3</xref>) and with Pdgfrb as an antibody or genetically labelled using PdgfrbCre-ERT2-tdTomato mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). In one of the FACS experiments, we also checked numbers 2 months after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>); once again, Cd146+/Pdgfrb+ numbers were still increased, both in terms of absolute numbers and relative to total live cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>).</p><p id="P32">To further investigate the localisation of mural cells, as well as overall Pdgfrb+ populations in the injured nerve, a whole cleared tissue approach was taken.

Using this method, we did not observe a significant increase in the number of mural cells 5 days post-PSNL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), but we did observed a significant increase in Pdgfrb+ cells, specifically at the site of lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>; p = 0.0157 compared to contralateral nerve, post-hoc comparison after significant Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA).</p><p id="P33">At day 60 post-PSNL, where we had a higher sample size in a single batch, our results were more clearly in line with our flow cytometry data; we observed a significant increase in the number of mural cells in the distal part of the nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>; p = 0.0318 compared to contralateral nerve, post-hoc comparison after significant Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA). It is important to bear in mind that our images contained a variety of blood vessel types. However, the proportions of different vessel types imaged in each condition are unlikely to be driving the observed injury-induced increase in mural cells: our own in-house observations suggest that arterioles have the highest mural cell density in peripheral nerve followed by endoneurial capillaries; neither of these were disproportionally represented in our images of distal ipsilateral chronic PSNL nerves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).

This was an expected result, given that we have previously shown that high levels of inflammation persist in nerve months after PSNL surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Liang et al., 2020</xref>). Our current data suggest that this chronic inflammation is not limited to changes in immune cell numbers and phenotypes, but also encompasses Pdgfrb+ mural cells and fibroblasts. From our immunostaining experiments, it appears that the lesion site and the regions downstream of the lesion are particularly affected, i.e. stromal cell dysregulation is highest in what would likely be areas of Wallerian degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Coleman and Höke, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Bulk RNA-seq of Pdgfrb+ mesenchymal cells reveals upregulation of pain-relevant mediators</title><p id="P34">To obtain well-powered differential gene expression data for Pdgfrb+ fibroblasts and Pdgfrb+/CD146+ mural cells, we performed bulk sequencing on these populations, sorted 5 days after PSNL (see gating strategy in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).

We also obtained both flow cytometry and immunostaining data to suggest that the number of Pdgfrb+ mural cells is persistently increased in damaged sciatic nerve, detectable up to 2 months after an initial insult. Finally, we provide evidence that the pro-algesic potential of mural cells translates to human, with a nerve pericyte line expressing some of the same pro-algesic mediators and inducing STAT3 phosphorylation in human stem-cell derived sensory neurons upon activation. It remains to be determined whether this translates into regulation of pain-relevant genes as well as neuronal hyperactivity, as we have previously observed following stimulation with JAK-STAT cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Li et al., 2024a</xref>).</p><p id="P44">Some of our day 5 flow cytometry results at first glance appear to be contradicted by later tissue clearing data.

We believe that this is a reflection of the challenges associated with attempting to capture changes in a small population of cells while being faced with not insignificant within- and across-batch variation; for example, the number of mural cells we determined in our day 5 post-PSNL imaging experiments ranged from 50-350, with batch 1 displaying higher counts and injury-induced changes more in line with our flow cytometry results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). At the two-month time-point, the increase in Pdgfrb+ cells replicated across both flow cytometry and tissue clearing, suggesting that, if anything, the dysregulation in Pdgfrb+ fibroblasts and mural cells worsens over time.</p><p id="P45">Fibroblasts have been implicated previously in nerve-injury induced pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Singhmar et al., 2020</xref>), with a particular focus on a Pi16+ population, which is contained amongst our Pdgfrb+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).

However, given the small sample size (n = 3), it remains to be determined whether this is a replicable effect.</p><p id="P46">Mural cells have not been explicitly studied to date with respect to traumatic neuropathic pain states. In contrast, in the central nervous system (CNS), their altered functions in ischemic and neurodegenerative conditions are well-described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dalkara et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, pericytes contract when blood flow is interrupted in a mouse model of ischemic stroke and remain contracted even when middle cerebral artery occlusion is lifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Yemisci et al., 2009</xref>). There is evidence to suggest that this failure to allow re-perfusion is due to pericytes dying in a state of rigour, with their ‘corpses’ constricting the capillaries they envelop, presumably until they are removed by phagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dalkara et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hall et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P47">Whether similar mechanisms will be at play in our specific nerve injury model is less clear. While peripheral nerves can develop the same re-perfusion injuries that are detectable in CNS, it is generally very difficult to render them ischemic. In fact, most rodent studies report that crush or focal nerve injuries result in hyperemia, i.e. increased rather than decreased blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Zochodne, 2018</xref>). This also appears to be the case for human entrapment neuropathies, specifically carpal tunnel syndrome, where hypervascularisation appears to correlate with symptom severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kutlar et al., 2017</xref>).

In the clinic, the nature of blood flow alterations (hyperemia vs. ischemia) and the degree of inflammation will likely vary across individuals and nerve injury types.

Ironically, this may be an unfortunate side-effect of the system trying to remodel and repair its blood supply, with many of the pro-algesic mediators we observe upregulated after injury (<italic>Ngf</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Lif</italic>, <italic>Ccl2</italic>) also having known roles in angiogenesis, vasodilation and vascular remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Funamoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hilgendorf et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Nian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Peplow, 2014</xref>). As expected, given the discovery of universal, cross-tissue fibroblast sub-types, our results in nerve parallel what is being reported in joint, where fibroblast dysfunction is increasingly being linked to sensory neuron hyperactivity and pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Shinotsuka and Denk, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Wijesinghe et al., 2024</xref>), most recently also in patient cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bai et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P49">In conclusion, we propose that mesenchymal cell abnormalities should be considered when developing novel strategies to tackle pain as a result of physical nerve entrapment. They are also likely to be relevant to other conditions which can cause chronic pain, including arthritis and diabetic neuropathy, where alterations in pericyte and blood-nerve-barrier function have consistently been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Richner et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, a recent single cell atlas of human sural nerves taken from individuals living with polyneuropathy identified vascular smooth muscle cells and perineural fibroblasts as two of the cell types that were more abundant in disease and that correlated with the extent of disability experienced by the donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Heming et al., 2024</xref>). More work is now needed to turn these novel mechanistic insights into future drug development opportunities to finally provide relief for the millions of people suffering from neuropathic pain every day.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary R Notebooks</label><media xlink:href="EMS202016-supplement-Supplementary_R_Notebooks.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d7aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS202016-supplement-Supplementary_Table_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d7aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS202016-supplement-Supplementary_Table_5.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d7aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Table 6</label><media xlink:href="EMS202016-supplement-Supplementary_Table_6.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d7aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Table 7</label><media xlink:href="EMS202016-supplement-Supplementary_Table_7.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d7aAcEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Table 8</label><media xlink:href="EMS202016-supplement-Supplementary_Table_8.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d7aAcEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplementary Tables &amp; Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS202016-supplement-Supplementary_Tables___Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d7aAcEhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>SV and LF were funded by an Ono Pharmaceuticals Rising Stars Award held by FD.
