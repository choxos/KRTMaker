Standard therapies have not significantly improved patient outcomes over the past two decades. While recent advancements in targeted drug combination therapies, such as dabrafenib and trametinib, show promise for certain GBM subgroups, identifying drug combinations effective across the broader GBM population remains a challenge. Integrin-mediated signalling, particularly through Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), plays a pivotal role in GBM pathogenesis and invasion, making it a potential therapeutic target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].</p><p id="P3">In our study, we utilized a chemogenomic screening approach to identify synergistic drug combinations that target FAK in glioblastoma. We initially employed a CRISPR-engineered GBM model to assess the effects of FAK depletion and discovered that combining FAK inhibitors with MEK inhibitors, particularly trametinib, demonstrated synergistic effects. This potent combination was validated through various 2D &amp; 3D assays, including cell viability/apoptotic assessment, synergistic analysis, cellular imaging, and target engagement assays. The combination also effectively inhibited spheroid growth and invasion across a diverse panel of patient derived GBM stem cells. Molecular mechanisms underlying these effects included suppression of multiple kinase signalling pathways and enhanced apoptosis, elucidated using Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) profiling and western blot validation. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the combination therapy significantly reduced tumour volume in orthotopic transplantation models.

The current standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM patients consists of surgery, temozolomide (TMZ), and ionizing radiation (IR) which provides an overall 15-month survival benefit and has not been improved upon since the EORTC-NCIC trial published in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. The self-renewing capacity of GBM stem cells is an inherent feature of GBM to which the tumour microenvironment contributes supporting adaptive signal rewiring, heterogeneous tumour evolution and therapeutic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Current treatment and clinical trials of modern targeted therapies have been largely ineffective because they fail to address inherent tumour heterogeneity contributing to incomplete treatment response and resistance due to the emergence of hypermutator phenotypes and rapid rewiring across multiple signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Large-scale genomic analyses performed over the past decade has enhanced our understanding of GBM biology supporting classification of GBM into different subtypes based on gene signatures that may help predict prognosis and therapeutic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. However, this new understanding of the GBM genomic landscape has not yet yielded effective personalized medicine strategies across the GBM population predominantly as a result of the fact that GBM is driven by multiple intracellular signalling pathways rather than single gene alterations. Thus the challenge in GBM is identifying effective drug combinations which overcome tumour heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance by targeting the tumour’s ability to re-wire its signalling networks following treatment with single pathway blocking therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Despite the challenges, new hope is provided from the recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the combination of the targeted BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and MEK inhibitor trametinib for the treatment of nearly any type of advanced solid tumour that has a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Studies have shown that treatment of tumours with BRAF inhibitors (such as dabrafenib) develop resistance by activating signals from the MEK protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Thus, combining dabrafenib with the MEK inhibitor trametinib was postulated to prevent tumours from using this escape mechanism and has demonstrated increased efficacy in preclinical tumour models and clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. The phase II Rare Oncology Agnostic Research (ROAR) clinical trial of dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive recurrent or refractory High Grade Glioma (HGG, including GBM), and Low Grade Glioma (LGG) constitutes part of a larger basket trial BRF117019 (NCT02034110), evaluating dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy across multiple BRAF V600E-mutant tumours. The ROAR clinical trial primary endpoint of investigator-assessed overall response rate was 33% in the HGG cohort. Secondary endpoints of median duration of response was 31.2%, progression-free survival, 5.5% and median overall survival was 17.6 % in HGG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. While only 2% of adult GBM express BRAF V600E the incidence of activating oncogenic BRAFV600E mutation is higher across other central nervous system primary tumours in paediatric and adult patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], thus dabrafenib combined with trametinib represents a potential alternative treatment option for these subsets of patients.</p><p id="P7">With an almost infinite multi-drug possibilities, identifying the most effective drug combinations across other GBM patient subgroups presents a significant challenge as evidenced by the failure of the majority of drug combination trials performed in GBM to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The scientific rationale and preclinical evidence supporting many drug combination trials are often unclear and it appears that many drug combination strategies are opportunistic with selection based on pragmatic considerations including drug access and often representing an after-thought to rescue poor response of single agent therapy. Recent high throughput systematic testing of drug combinations across cancer cell models indicates that synergy between drugs is rare and highly context-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Thus, application of more evidence-based approaches to the discovery of novel drug combination strategies incorporating GBM models that represent the heterogeneity of disease are required to validate and prioritize the most promising drug combination strategies for clinical development.</p><p id="P8">Altered extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling and intracellular signalling mediated by the integrin family of ECM receptors and their downstream kinases effectors such as Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) has been proposed as an important mechanism influencing GBM pathogenesis, formation of the tumour niche and brain tissue invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Overexpression of integrin receptor subunits, β1, β3, α3, α5, αv and high expression of FAK and its closely related homolog PYK2 are associated with reduced overall survival of GBM patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. However, therapeutic strategies to directly inhibit aberrant integrin-mediated ECM adhesion and signalling, as exemplified by the peptidomimetic drug candidate cilengitide, which blocks the ECM-RGD binding site of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins failed to improve overall survival of patients with GBM despite promising preclinical data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. The failure of such integrin-targeting therapy has been proposed to be a consequence of a variety of pro-survival bypass signalling pathways mediated by multiple other integrin receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] and other upstream ECM adhesion signalling receptors known to be dysregulated in GBM including discoidin domain receptors (DDR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] and CD44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. These findings suggest that targeting downstream mediators positioned at the intersection of multiple integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases signalling pathways such as FAK may have additional therapeutic benefit. We and others have demonstrated that FAK is an important downstream mediator of invasion and survival pathways in multiple cancer cell types including GBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. In human GBM cell models both small molecule pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockdown of FAK suppress the proliferation, survival, and 3D invasion of glioma stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK has also been shown to enhance the effect of temozolomide on tumour growth in a C57BL/6-GL261 mouse glioma model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] and displays radiosensitizing effects in a subset of GBM cell models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, in a murine <italic>in vivo</italic> surgical resection model FAK and PYK2 signalling are upregulated in recurrent tumour samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. Treatment with the small molecule PYK2/FAK inhibitor PF-562271 reversed PYK2/FAK signalling activation in recurrent tumours, reducing tumour volume by 43%, and increased animal survival by 33% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. While these results are promising, more effective, and durable responses would be desirable. Collectively, these studies indicate that FAK is a promising therapeutic target in GBM but may only yield maximum patient benefit when exploited as part of a synergistic therapeutic drug combination.</p><p id="P9">In this study we employed an unbiased chemogenomic screening approach in an isogenic model of FAK-kinase deficient (KD) and FAK-wild-type (WT) expressing GBM cells to identify drug combinations that could potentially synergise with depletion of FAK kinase activity. Our screen identified a number of drug candidates including four distinct MEK inhibitors that enhance GBM cell death when combined with FAK-KD cells, relative to FAK-WT. Focussing on the most clinically advanced MEK inhibitor trametinib, we demonstrate low level synergistic activity upon FAK-WT GBM cell survival and invasion endpoints when combined with multiple small-molecule FAK inhibitors. Post-translational pathway profiling indicates that trametinib promotes multiple compensatory signalling and pathway rewiring events in GBM cells when used as single agent. Validation studies across a heterogenous panel of patient-derived GBM stem cells demonstrate potent FAK+MEK inhibitor combination activity at nanomolar concentration across 2D and 3D phenotypic assays and reduced tumour area in an <italic>in vivo</italic> orthotopic transplantation model. Our systematic GBM phenotypic discovery platform demonstrates the robustness of FAK+MEK inhibitor combination treatment across heterogenous GBM stem cell models, supporting the case for further preclinical development toward clinical studies.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P10">To explore the role of FAK in GBM, we utilised a recently-described transformed neural stem cell-derived GBM cell model featuring CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of the tumour suppressor genes <italic>Nf1</italic> (N) and <italic>Pten</italic> (P), and concomitant expression of the constitutively active, oncogenic EGFR (E) variant EGFRVIII (hereafter termed NPE cells)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].

Cell lysates were mixed with 4× SDS sample buffer without bromophenol blue and supplemented with 10% 2-β-mercaptoethanol, at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml and final volume of 150 μl. Samples were stored at −80 °C prior to further analysis. Samples were denatured by heating to 95 °C for 5 min prior to printing as serial dilutions (1.50 mg/ml, 0.75 mg/ml, 0.375 mg/ml and 0.1875 mg/ml) in arrays consisting of 36 × 12 spots at a 500 μm spot-to-spot distance on the Aushon 2470 Arrayer Platform (Quanterix, MA, USA) using 8 × 185 μM pins, with 2 deposition rounds per feature. Each sample dilution series was spotted on all arrays with 8 arrays per slide on single pad Supernova nitrocellulose slides (Grace BioLabs, OR, USA). Sample loading on the slides, for normalisation purposes, was determined with Fast-Green dye staining and scanning using the InnoScan 710 slide scanner (Innopsys, Carbonne, France) at 800 nm. The RPPA slides were then washed with deionized water for 4 × 15 min on a platform shaker, prior to a 15 min incubation with Antigen Retrieval Reagent (1× Reblot strong). The slides then underwent two more 5 min washing steps with deionized water. Subsequently, the RPPA slides were placed in a ProPlate chamber (Grace BioLabs, OR, USA) in fresh deionized water and washed with 1× PBS twice for 5 min. The slides were then incubated for 10 min in the Superblock T20 Blocking Buffer (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), prior to TBST washing twice for 5 min. The RPPA slides were then incubated for 60 min with the 120 primary antibodies all diluted at 1:250 in Superblock buffer prior to two more TBST washes (5 min each) and a second 10 min incubation with the Blocking buffer, as described above. The RPPA slides were then incubated for 30 min with the DyLight-800-labelled anti-species secondary antibody diluted at 1:2500 in Superblock, followed by two 5 min washes in TBST and a final rinse with deionized water. Non-specific background signal was determined for each slide by performing the primary antibody incubation step solely with Superblock, without antibodies, on 1 array followed by fluorescent tracer secondary antibody. The slides were dried for 10 min at RT prior to imaging with an InnoScan 710 slide scanner (Innopsys, Carbonne, France). Microarray images were analysed using the Mapix software (Innopsys, Carbonne, France). The spot diameter of the grid was set to 270 μm. Background intensity was determined for each spot individually and subtracted from the sample spot signal, thus generating a net signal for each spot. Relative quantification of each analyte was determined for each spot by measuring fluorescence intensity. The validity of the serial dilutions was ensured by generating a linear fit curve from the 4-point dilution series for all samples, on all arrays, using a flag system where an R2 value was generated and R2 &gt; 0.9 values were deemed good. Relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) values corresponding to relative abundance of total and phosphorylated proteins across the samples set were calculated and normalised to total protein by calculating the ratio of Antibody RFI/Fast-Green RFI for all samples.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S15"><title>Chemogenomic screening to identify synergistic combinations with loss of FAK kinase activity</title><p id="P23">We sought to first identify novel drug combinations which synergize specifically with loss of FAK in GBM by using a chemogenomic screening strategy.

RSK2, a serine/threonine kinase downstream signalling mediator in the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway, has been identified as driving invasiveness/migration in glioma and other cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>], hence is a favourable downstream target and potential biomarker of the FAK+MEK inhibitor combination.</p><p id="P41">Crosstalk and compensatory signalling between the RAS/RAF/MEK and FAK/SRC signalling axis has been reported in multiple cancer cell line and preclinical tumour models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. FAK has been shown to be activated following pharmacological inhibition of the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway in several pre-clinical tumour models and in patient tumour samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. FAK signalling can be negatively regulated by the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway through multiple mechanisms for example, ERK-mediated phosphorylation of FAK on S910 results in FAK inactivation by dephosphorylation and focal adhesion turnover during migration. In addition, ERK-mediated phosphorylation of calpain2 on Ser50 promote proteolysis of FAK and focal adhesion disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]. In our study we observed an increase in the levels of autophosphorylated FAK-Y397 in G7 cells following treatment with trametinib in 3D in vitro culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B and E</xref>). However, this compensatory upregulation of FAK activity was not observed in the other GBM stem cell lines (E57 and E13) which also exhibit enhanced response to the FAK+MEK combination treatment. Rather in these cell lines the FAK+MEK combination results in enhanced downregulation of FAK-Y397 compared to FAK inhibitor alone suggesting that the MEK inhibitors are cooperating with the FAK inhibitor to repress upstream pathways promoting focal adhesion signalling.</p><p id="P42">Importantly, potent additive or synergistic activity of the trametinib + FAK inhibitor combination is observed across multiple murine and human models and is independent of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation status, or specific compensatory signalling mechanisms, suggesting that this combination may serve a wider population of GBM patients than current personalised treatment propositions, such as the trametinib &amp; dabrafenib combination, which is currently restricted to 1-2% of GBM patients that express the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p id="P43">Combining FAK and RAF/MEK inhibitors has shown clinical activity in low grade serous ovarian cancer regardless of KRAS mutant status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>] with an ongoing registration-directed study of VS-6766 (RAF/MEK inhibitor) ± defactinib (FAK inhibitor) in patients with recurrent LGSOC (ENGOT-ov60/NCRI/GOG-3052; NCT04625270) underway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. These studies indicate that the FAK+MEK inhibitor combination may potentially be re-purposable for other tumours, however, improving physicochemical properties of each individual compound component, such as CNS penetrance, may be required to achieve optimal activity in GBM. Improvements in medicinal chemistry, particularly those aimed at improving the CNS penetrance of trametinib, a PgP substrate, with poor BBB permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>] are underway. Novel, BBB permeable MEK and ERK inhibitors for BRAF-mutant brain metastases are also being developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>]. Systemic toxicity and drug delivery across the BBB could also be overcome by emerging drug delivery devices, such as nanoparticles designed for selective delivery to tumour sites, including GBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>], Using the same NPE glioma model used in the current studies we have recently reported on another integrin adhesome node, namely integrin linked kinase (ILK), which controls transcriptional plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>]. Depletion of ILK drives conversion of GBM stem cells from a heterogenous population to a more homogenous one, thus the FAK+MEK combination treatment may also target plasticity to provide broad activity across heterogenous GBM stem cell models. Future studies to promote translation of FAK+MEK inhibitor combination therapy into GBM clinical trials include broader profiling across a larger panel of GBM stem cell models and correlation of phenotypic outcome with gene expression profiles to identify molecular biomarkers that predict optimal synergy to support patient stratification for personalised medicine strategies. Identification of proof-of-mechanism and target engagement biomarkers to guide optimal dosing and scheduling of the combination and preclinical toxicology, considering targeted drug delivery strategies, if necessary, to decipher the therapeutic window and safety margins of FAK+MEK inhibitor combination will also build confidence in the clinical potential of FAK+MEK inhibitor combination therapy in GBM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS201648-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary TableS1</label><media xlink:href="EMS201648-supplement-Supplementary_TableS1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d23aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary TableS2</label><media xlink:href="EMS201648-supplement-Supplementary_TableS2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d23aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary TableS3</label><media xlink:href="EMS201648-supplement-Supplementary_TableS3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d23aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Video1</label><media xlink:href="EMS201648-supplement-Supplementary_Video1.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d23aAcEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Video2</label><media xlink:href="EMS201648-supplement-Supplementary_Video2.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d23aAcEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplementary Video3</label><media xlink:href="EMS201648-supplement-Supplementary_Video3.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d23aAcEhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Supplementary Video4</label><media xlink:href="EMS201648-supplement-Supplementary_Video4.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="d23aAcEiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by a joint Cancer Research UK (C42454/A28596) and The Brain Tumour Charity award (GN-000676) to D.E., N.O.C. and M.C.F.
