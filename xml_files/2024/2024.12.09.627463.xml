Whereas differentiation is typically stimulated when keratinocytes are prevented from spreading, we previously identified two micron-scale topographical substrates that regulate differentiation of spread cells. On one substrate (S1), individual cells interact with small circular topographies, and differentiation is stimulated; on the other (S2), cells interact with larger triangular topographies, and differentiation is inhibited. By scanning electron microscopy we visualised substrate interactions at higher resolution than previously and using live cell imaging we established that induction of the differentiation marker involucrin did not involve transient cell rounding on S1. Bulk gene expression profiling did not reveal any differences between cells on S1 and S2 prior to the selective upregulation of differentiation markers at 12h on S1 and cell stiffness was lower on both S1 and S2 than on flat substrates. Nevertheless, cells on S2 differed from cells on flat and S1 substrates because they exhibited reduced cell volume, prompting us to explore whether cell volume could regulate differentiation independent of culture substrate. Treatment with polyethylene glycol (PEG) reduced cell volume and inhibited differentiation regardless of whether keratinocytes were seeded on flat, S1 or S2 substrates, micropatterned islands or in suspension. Conversely, treatment with deionised water increased cell volume and stimulated differentiation of substrate adherent keratinocytes. On flat substrates treatment with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator 1,2-bis- (2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester or an inhibitor of the water channel aquaporin 3 blocked induction of differentiaton by deionised water, whereas the gadolinium<sup>3+</sup>, a stretch-activated calcium channel blocker, did not. Our studies identify a new mechanism by which keratinocyte-niche interactions regulate initiation of differentiation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Human skin comprises the epidermis, which is formed of multiple layers of epithelial cells called keratinocytes, and the underlying connective tissue, or dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Rognoni and Watt, 2018</xref>). The epidermis and dermis are separated by a basement membrane. The basal epidermal layer, which is attached to the basement membrane, contains a patterned distribution of stem cells and cells that have initiated terminal differentiation. Differentiating cells detach from the basement membrane and move through the suprabasal epidermal layers to the skin surface, from which they are shed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zijl et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Human epidermal keratinocytes can be grown in culture under conditions that support maintenance of stem cells and the process of terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zijl et al., 2022</xref>).

When single cells are seeded on ECM-coated micro-patterned islands, differentiation is triggered by restricted spreading, which is dependent on the ratio of F- to G-actin and activation of serum response factor (SRF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Watt et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Connelly et al., 2010</xref>). Differentiation is also triggered when cells are plated on ECM coated soft hydrogels or hydrogel-nanoparticle composites with high nanoparticle spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Trappmann et al., 2012</xref>). On soft hydrogels differentiation is mediated by downregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity.</p><p id="P6">Whereas keratinocyte differentiation is typically associated with reduced cell spreading, we have also found that micron-scale substrate topographies can promote differentiation of spread cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Zijl et al., 2019</xref>). In particular we have fabricated a substrate (designated S1), comprising circular topographical features of approximately 3 μm diameter, 5 μm height and unequal spacing, that promotes differentiation of spread cells via a mechanism that is blocked by Rho kinase inhibition or treatment with the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin, but not by SRF inhibition. Conversely, a substrate comprising regularly spaced right-angled triangles (8 μm sides) of 5 μm height (designated S2) suppressed differentiation relative to flat surfaces. In the present study we have explored how keratinocytes respond to each of these substrates, uncovering a potential role for cell volume in regulating keratinocyte differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Keratinocytes on S1 substrates can initiate differentiation while spread</title><p id="P7">In order to enrich for undifferentiated keratinocytes (stem cells) we seeded single cell suspensions, comprising a mixture of basal and differentiated cells, on collagen-coated S1, S2 or flat surfaces for 1 h and washed off the non-adherent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jones and Watt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Zijl et al., 2019</xref>). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of keratinocytes 24h after plating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) revealed that cells on the S1 substrates spread over the individual pillars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, D</xref>); some pillars at the edges of the substrates were bent, suggesting that they had been subject to pulling force by the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). The cytoplasm of cells on S2 appeared to be draped over the triangular features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E, F</xref>).

To examine whether there were unique features of the gene expression programme of keratinocytes undergoing commitment on S1, we seeded keratinocytes on S1 or S2 substrates and extracted RNA at 1h (initial adhesion), 4h (differentiation commitment) and 12h (increased differentiation on S1 versus S2). RNA was harvested in three independent experiments and subject to bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In total 18 samples were submitted for RNA seq (3 time points in 3 independent experiments on each substrate).

Nevertheless, cells on S1 and S2 showed significant differences in gene expression at 12h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The majority of differentially expressed genes (100/109 genes, 92%) at 12h were downregulated on S2 (log2 fold change &gt; 1or &lt; -1, padj &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

Thus the majority of the genes corresponded to genes that are upregulated during keratinocyte terminal differentiation, consistent with our earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Zijl et al., 2019</xref>). The top three genes upregulated on S2 at 12h were TGFBI, COL4A1 and WNT5A, all of which are known to be expressed in the basal epidermal layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Romanowska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Li et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). VIM is expressed at low levels by cultured keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kariniemi et al., 1982</xref>) and was upregulated on S2 compared with S1. Real-time quantitative PCR of differentially expressed genes at 12h confirmed that differentiation was upregulated on S1 and downregulated on S2 compared to the flat substrates, while WNT5A, TGFBI and VIM were selectively upregulated on S2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A, B</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We conclude that using bulk RNAseq we could confirm the stimulation of differentiation on S1 but could not identify a distinct commitment programme.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Effects of S1 and S2 on cell volume and stiffness</title><p id="P16">We next compared cell and nuclear volume on the different topographies by confocal microscopy of keratinocytes labelled with anti-keratin 14 (K14) and DAPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hansen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Koushki et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Li et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Since the cell volume on S1 was similar to that on flat substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B, D</xref>), the changes in cell volume were specific to S2.</p><p id="P17">It has previously been reported that changes in cell volume affect cell stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Guo et al., 2017</xref>).

Overview of the FACS sorting strategy to select INV-mCherry negative cells expressing GFP (IVL-LifeAct-GFP+ cells) prior to plating on the substrates. Each plot represents a sequential gating step. Arrows indicate the gating sequence. Keratinocytes were first gated by forward (FSC-A) and side scatter (SSC-A), then for single cells and then live cells (DAPI-negative). mCherry-negative (IVL-negative) cells were selected for seeding. In the final gate the co-expression of mCherry and GFP by cells with high SCC is shown. (B-D) IVL-LifeAct-GFP+mCherry- cells selected as in (A) were plated on S1 substrates for 45-60 minutes and non-adherent cells were washed off. Adherent cells were monitored by live cell imaging. (B) Representative field of cells. Two cells marked with arrowheads initiated mCherry expression while spread. (C, D) 30 cells that initiated mCherry expression during the imaging period were pooled from three independent experiments for analysis. The IVL-mCherry intensity of each cell was measured by calculating the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of cells at different time points. Cells with an MFI &gt; 500 were considered to be undergoing differentiation. (C) Traces of individual cells are shown. (D) Mean mCherry signal of all 30 cells.
