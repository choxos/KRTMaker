However, we lack evidence on how different sources of trait variation shape tree-tree interactions. Along a diversity gradient from one to eight tree species, we sampled 4,568 leaves from 381 trees to study changes in intraspecific and intraindividual leaf trait variability and assessed their contribution to community functional diversity. Intraspecific variability decreased with tree species richness, while intraindividual variability barely responded. Functional overlap between conspecific trees increased with tree species richness and through intraindividual variation, but was reduced through intraspecific variability, meaning that intraspecific variability may reduce intraspecific competitive interactions while intraindividual variability could arise due to varying microenvironmental conditions within the canopy. Last, intraspecific and intraindividual variability explained high community functional richness and divergence, respectively, especially in mixtures. Our findings emphasize that fine-scale variability influences tree-tree interactions and can be a driver of local functional diversity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Plant trait-based ecology focuses on phenotypic differences as a way to understand ecological and evolutionary processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). While the field has typically focused on differences between species, substantial trait variation occurs at different levels of biological organization (among populations, between individuals within the same population, or within individuals; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) which could be important to understand adaptations to the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) and species coexistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). For instance, in response to competition, individuals are able to shift the trait expression to adopt a more conservative strategy in the use of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) or to prevent local competitive exclusion by increasing dissimilarities with other individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). However, while these shifts have been widely studied, less attention has been paid to the variability of traits within the same population, hereafter referred to as intraspecific trait variability (i.e. the extent of the differences between the trait values of individuals from the same population of a species).</p><p id="P3">Intraspecific trait variability within populations may reduce intraspecific competition by allowing individuals from the same species (conspecifics) to exploit alternative resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Therefore, given that conspecifics acquire and use resources in a similar way, intraspecific trait variability is expected to be larger in species-poor communities. Further, intraspecific trait variability depends not only on intraspecific competition but also on niche availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). That is why, when the number of species in a community increases (which commonly results in resource partitioning; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), trees tend to become more dissimilar from the heterospecific neighbors. As a result, species may adopt a so called niche packing strategy characterized by the exploitation of a specific resource in a specific manner, resulting in lower intraspecific trait variability compared to monocultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). For example, conspecific trees in monocultures have been found to produce leaves with different specific leaf areas (SLA) to exploit different sections of the light gradient; by contrast, in mixed communities, as species specialize in exploiting specific parts of the canopy space, conspecifics tended to produce leaves with similar SLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). As a result, limited intraspecific variability may act as a mechanism that would allow species to exploit different niches, resulting in species complementarity in species-rich communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). In fact, recent studies found that intraspecific leaf variability of plant populations decreased with increasing plant diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). However, these results contrast with other studies and with the responses found for other tree organs other than leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). For instance, Yang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) suggested that inferior competitor species may express higher intraspecific trait variability, especially in seedling roots, to reduce the chances of being outcompeted when growing with a strong competitor species. These contrasting results among studies propose that there is no general direction of change of intraspecific trait variability in response to species diversity, but that it likely depends on the specific interaction partners as well as the plant organ studied.</p><p id="P4">Scaling down in the levels of biological organization, intraindividual variability, i.e., the extent of different trait values across different repeated architectural units of the plant body structure (e.g. leaves from the same plant; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), could also matter for plant-plant interactions. Such plastic responses are especially noticeable in trees because they have a great potential to express intraspecific and intraindividual trait variability due to their longevity and extensive modularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). For instance, as the light interception by leaves is a key factor in competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), trees express different leaf phenotypes within individuals to adjust to light exposure (e.g. leaves directly exposed to sunlight show higher photosynthetic rates and lower drought tolerance than shade leaves; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Additionally, it has been suggested that plants can experience intraindividual changes in eco-physiological traits that may eventually lead to enhanced water-use efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) or cope with environmental unpredictability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). As tree composition affects crown packing and, therefore, light exposure, leaves also respond to the surrounding diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). In fact, intraindividual leaf variability in trees was observed to decrease with local tree species diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) and it has been suggested that, similarly to intraspecific variability, high intraindividual leaf variability could support intraspecific complementarity (functional complementarity between conspecifics). This would imply that, under scenarios of high intraindividual variability, conspecifics may tend to be dissimilar in their leaves by exploiting new niches. Nevertheless, this role of intraindividual variation in interactions between trees and the mechanisms involved remain still unclear. For instance, these changes can be useful for trees growing in monocultures, where canopy density and structural diversity are lower and therefore temperatures less buffered compared to mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). That is why, in order to clarify whether intraindividual variability generates intraspecific complementarity, it is important to understand the patterns of intraindividual variability along tree species diversity gradients as well as its effect on how different conspecifics overlap in their traits.</p><p id="P5">Functional diversity (i.e. the extent of phenotypic differences in a community) is one of the most common tools in trait-based ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) and can reveal key facets of ecosystem functioning (e.g. net primary productivity, biochemical cycles) and community assembly (e.g. environmental filtering, limiting similarity; 1, 34). Functional diversity estimations typically consider a single mean trait value for each species; this strategy reduces the amount of trait measurements but neglects trait variation within species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Nevertheless, intraspecific trait variability can account for a non-negligible proportion of the total trait variability within and across ecological communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Further, approaches considering intraindividual trait variability have shown that the sum of the variation occurring intraspecifically and intraindividually may be even larger than the differences between species in the case of some leaf traits such as SLA or leaf nitrogen content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). This shows the importance of studying species traits beyond single mean trait values to quantify community functional diversity, especially at local scales and in species-poor communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Therefore, it has been suggested that the different sources of trait variation occurring within species, from the variability between populations to the intraindividual variability, could affect community functional diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). In recent years, different methods to incorporate variability into functional diversity metrics have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). The use of these methods allows testing the notion that community functional diversity is higher when considering intraspecific or intraindividual variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), as well as understanding how this effect changes with species richness.</p><p id="P6">Here, we studied the patterns of intraspecific and intraindividual leaf trait variability in a tree diversity experiment in subtropical China (BEF-China; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). By using leaf spectroscopy, we estimated seven morphological and chemical leaf traits in 381 tree individuals from eight species along a tree species richness gradient with monocultures and mixtures of 2, 4 and 8 tree species. We assessed population functional trait variability by using two functional indices that measure different facets of the functional space (functional richness and functional divergence) at the intraspecific (mean trait values of individual trees) and the intraindividual level (leaf trait values within an individual tree), respectively. Further, we assessed intraspecific overlap as the shared trait space between the trait distributions of conspecific trees belonging to the same population. Specifically, we aimed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) to determine how tree species richness affects intraspecific and intraindividual leaf trait variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) to assess the direct and indirect effects (via intraspecific and intraindividual variability) of tree species richness on intraspecific trait overlap. Further, we used a framework that allows including hierarchical sources of trait variation on community functional diversity, from the population level to the leaf level, passing through the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), and null models to identify which sources of variation within species affect functional diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). With this, we aimed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) to characterize the influence of intraspecific and intraindividual variability on the functional diversity of a community across levels of tree species richness. We hypothesized that:</p><p id="P7">H1: Intraspecific and intraindividual variability decrease with increasing tree species richness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">H2: Intraspecific overlap increases with tree species richness along a spectrum from high intraspecific complementarity in monocultures to low intraspecific complementarity in mixed communities (H2a; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Intraspecific overlap increases with tree species richness via a decreasing intraspecific and intraindividual variability (H2b).</p><p id="P9">H3: As the organization of intraspecific and intraindividual trait variability is expected to contribute to community functional diversity, the observed functional diversity of tree communities is expected to be higher than the functional diversity measured from null models that randomize different sources of trait variation (H3a; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Moreover, the deviations of observed functional diversity from null models decrease with tree species richness due to the expected responses of intraspecific and intraindividual trait variability with the number of species in a community (H3b; see H1). Last, these differences are expected to be highest in null models that randomize trait variation at the lowest level of biological organization measured (i.e. leaf level), as these randomizations imply random intraspecific and intraindividual variability (H3b).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Responses of intraspecific and intraindividual variability to tree species richness</title><p id="P10">The first two axes of a principal component analysis (PCA) on the leaf-level values of seven functional traits (N = 4,568) explained 68% of the total variation in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). PC1 was strongly associated with leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf carbon content (C) (with loadings -0.94, 0.89 and -0.73, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) and reflected differences in the acquisition of resources from conservative leaves to acquisitive leaves. PC2 was related to leaf nitrogen content (N), leaf phosphorus (P) and stomatal density (SDens), followed by stomatal size (Ssize) (with loadings 0.75, 0.64, 0.63 and -0.42, respectively) and reflected differences in nutrition status, which seems to be closely linked to the stomatal morphology.</p><p id="P11">Overall, intraspecific leaf trait variability within populations decreased with tree species richness. First, analyses with single axes of leaf trait variation, which aimed to detect changes associated with specific axis of leaf trait variation, revealed that intraspecific variability in PC1 decreased with tree species richness (P = 0.01 for functional richness (FRic; the extent of the functional volume of the population); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, Table S2). However, this effect was not significant for the intraspecific variability of PC2. Second, we estimated trait probability densities based on both PC1 and PC2 (multivariate FRic) to assess the main changes in the total trait space. This analysis revealed that tree species richness also had a significant negative effect on multivariate FRic (P = 0.047, N = 63; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). In contrast, we found no effect of tree species richness on multivariate functional divergence (FDiv; the degree to which the abundance in the trait space is distributed towards the extremes of the functional volume) (P = 0.36; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The results for intraspecific variability contrast with the effects found for the intraindividual level, as only intraindividual FDiv of PC2 responded negatively to tree species richness, and this response was small (P = 0.04; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). This result is consistent with the effects of tree species richness on the intraindividual FRic of stomatal density (P = 0.03; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). We found no effect of tree species richness on any of the multivariate functional indices used at the intraindividual level (FRic and FDiv with P = 0.51 and P = 0.69, respectively; N = 381; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B, D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Effects of intraspecific and intraindividual trait variability on intraspecific overlap</title><p id="P12">We used a structural equation model (SEM) to understand the relationships leading conspecific trees to overlap in the functional trait space of their population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4, S5</xref>). Our model fit the data well (Fisher’s C = 0.68, df = 2, P = 0.76, N = 63). We found that changes in the intraspecific overlap (the mean overlap between the functional volumes of conspecific trees within a population; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) are well explained by tree species richness and multivariate intraspecific and intraindividual FRic (marginal R2 = 0.57, conditional R2 = 0.72). Intraspecific FRic significantly decreased with tree species richness (P = 0.04) and had in turn a negative impact on intraspecific overlap (P &lt; 0.001). However, we did not find any effect of tree species richness on intraindividual FRic (P = 0.49), and we found an increase of intraspecific overlap with intraindividual FRic (P &lt; 0.001). Additionally, tree species richness also had a direct positive effect on intraspecific overlap (P = 0.01). These results remained qualitatively similar in SEMs with functional indices based on single axes of trait variation (PC1 or PC2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Effects of trait variation on community functional diversity</title><p id="P13">In order to study the importance of intraspecific and intraindividual trait variability in the assessment of functional diversity of a community and its dependence on species richness, we built four null models that randomized trait probability densities at three different levels where trait variation arises (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7, S8</xref>). This approach ensured that simulated assemblages had identical tree species composition as the observed communities, but differed in the trait variability within species. Specifically, the sources of random trait variation differed between the four null models: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) random population model (assuming random trait distribution of the populations in an assemblage, but within the constraints of the species to which each population belongs), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) random tree model (assuming random trait distribution among trees from the same population, but within the constraints of the species to which each tree belongs), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) random leaf model (assuming random trait distribution among leaves from the same tree, but within the constraints of the species to which each tree belongs) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) population-restricted random leaf model (assuming random trait distribution among leaves from the same tree, but within the constraints of the population to which each tree belongs; see methods for details on the null models). Based on 500 simulations we calculated the standardized effect sizes (SESs) of FRic and FDiv for every type of null model and every sampled community to determine how much the observed functional diversity deviates from what would be expected under the null models. We then used linear mixed-effects models to study differences in SESs among null models and along a gradient of tree diversity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We found a significant interaction between tree species richness and the type of model on SESFRic (P &lt; 0.001, N = 128; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). Specifically, SESFRic did not differ from 0 in the random population model, suggesting no differences between the FRic of null models and observed communities. Still, SESFRic became significantly higher than 0 with increasing tree species richness in the random tree null model and the population-restricted random leaf model, suggesting that FRic in the diverse observed communities was higher compared to FRic from the null models. In the case of the random leaf model, SESFRic was lower than 0 with low tree species richness and similar to 0 in the highest levels of tree diversity, suggesting that in monocultures, observed SESFRic values were lower compared to the null model, and there were no differences between the null model and observed FRic in diverse communities. A significant interaction was also found for SESFDiv (P &lt; 0.001, N = 128), but for this functional index the random population and the random tree models did not differ from 0 and only the random leaf and population-restricted random leaf models were significantly higher than 0 in more diverse communities, suggesting that only for these two last null models the observed values of FDiv were higher than the ones from the null models in diverse communities. All analyses remained qualitatively similar when studying functional indices on single axes of trait variation (PC1 or PC2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">With our study, we show that intraspecific leaf trait variability correlated negatively with tree species richness and in turn, had a strong negative correlation with intraspecific trait overlap within a community.

In contrast, intraindividual leaf trait variability was weakly correlated with tree species richness, but strongly and positively correlated with intraspecific trait overlap. We interpret that, as the leaves within each tree become functionally more similar, the trait expressions of individual trees become more dissimilar to each other. Our results also show that the organization of intraspecific and intraindividual variability influences community functional diversity, especially at higher levels of tree species diversity.</p><sec id="S7"><title>Leaf intraspecific and intraindividual trait variability decrease along tree species richness gradients</title><p id="P16">Our approach allowed us to study how trait variability responded negatively to tree species richness in terms of functional variation between and within individuals (H1). The negative association of tree species richness with functional variability between individuals of a species is consistent with the theoretical predictions suggesting that higher intraspecific variability would minimize intraspecific competitive interactions in monocultures, while intraspecific variability is of secondary importance for species coexistence in species-rich communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>).

However, these results contrast with previous observational studies on trees that found an increase in intraspecific trait variability with tree species richness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). These studies mentioned that higher structural complexity (i.e. the structural diversity in the occupancy of the aboveground space) could release competition, allowing species to occupy a larger niche space. In fact, most of the responses found in these studies involved architectural traits (e.g. crown projection area), for which increasing tree species richness often leads to higher complexity in canopy space-filling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). However, most of these studies were observational and included trees differing in age and distance from neighbors. Such heterogeneous settings would impede, for instance, separating the variability arising from neighborhood diversity from that associated to ontogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Our results also indicate that variability in the leaf economics spectrum (LES, 56), accounts for most of the changes at the intraspecific level (as indicated by the results of functional richness for PC1). Therefore, most of the variability occurs between conservative leaves which are expected to have a long lifespan and high resistance against abiotic and biotic hazards, and acquisitive leaves with short lifespans which are expected to be fast in the acquisition of resources and efficient in photosynthetic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). This pattern is consistent with the responses found in other studies for SLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), a trait widely used as a proxy for acquisitiveness. It suggests that conspecifics adjust their leaf design in terms of resource use (some individuals more conservative and some more acquisitive), resulting in intraspecific coexistence. Consistently, we found a trend towards a positive effect of tree species richness on intraspecific trait overlap (H2a). These results reinforce the idea that species richness leads to the convergence of conspecifics in their leaf phenotypic space, resulting in higher niche packing of species due to the higher similarity between conspecifics in the resource-use strategy (H2b).</p><p id="P18">Recent studies suggest that intraindividual variability, which primarily relies on epigenetics and phenotypic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), has evolved in natural populations in order to adapt to changing environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). However, this source of variation has been widely disregarded and its role in the context of tree-tree interactions remains largely unclear. Proβ et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) suggested that intraindividual variability in leaves could act in a similar way as intraspecific variability, meaning that higher intraindividual variability could minimize competitive interactions among conspecifics. Therefore, intraindividual trait variability should be higher in monocultures compared to mixtures. However, while a clear decrease in intraindividual variability in response to tree species richness previously reported, these studies did not explore how this could be related to intraspecific trait overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). In contrast, our results indicate that intraindividual leaf variability promotes trait overlap within a population, suggesting that the role of intraindividual variability in intraspecific complementarity could have been overestimated (H2b). Further, tree diversity seems to affect intraindividual variability in nutrition status and stomatal morphology, with more similar leaves in mixtures than monocultures (as indicated by the results of functional divergence for PC2 and functional richness for stomatal density; H1). Additionally, we have observed differences between leaves from the bottom and the top of the tree crown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>), with lower stomatal density at the bottom compared to that at the top. Therefore, higher intraindividual differentiation in leaves may appear due to the higher photosynthetic activity of leaves in the upper part of the canopy, as higher photosynthetic rates require higher CO2 assimilation via stomata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). Indeed, this may be consistent with the alignment between nutrient concentration and stomatal density we found. Thus, the lack of clear stratification of the canopy in monocultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>) could result in a higher differentiation in the photosynthetic capacity between sun and shade leaves, which would be expected to affect stomatal morphology. As an additional explanation, as diversity can reduce water stress in mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>) and provide microclimate buffering due to higher canopy density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), stronger differentiation between “water spender” and “water saver” leaves within individuals could appear as a mechanism to cope with water stress in monocultures. In this context, it makes sense that leaves in the upper part of the crowns, which are exposed to higher evaporative demand, adopt a “water saver” strategy that allows them to respond more quickly to water stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>). Indeed, intraindividual variability has already been suggested as a mechanism to prevent water stress in the case of perennial herbaceous species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). In sum, our data suggest that intraindividual variability in tree-tree interactions is associated with intraspecific overlap and may arise as a response to varying light and microclimatic conditions within the canopy and the (associated) environmental stressors that trees face.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Intraspecific and intraindividual trait variability shapes the high functional diversity in ecological communities</title><p id="P19">Our results, interpreted in terms of the deviation of observed functional diversity from null models, showed that the structure of intraspecific and intraindividual trait variability contribute positively to communities’ functional diversity (H3a). While differences among species are still the most prominent source of trait variation, intraspecific and intraindividual variability can represent almost half of the total leaf trait variability in our species, especially in the case of predicted leaf nitrogen and phosphorus contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>). Therefore, it becomes reasonable that the variability within species will also partly explain how functional diversity is distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). Surprisingly, although we expected to find a higher contribution of trait variability in monocultures, the increase of the divergence from the null models suggests that intraspecific and intraindividual trait variability contributed more to functional diversity in species-rich communities (H3b). One possible explanation is that trees tend to differ in trait values from the other trees in the community (from the same or a different species). As a result, this would lead to an increase in the functional diversity of the community that would be more noticeable as the number of species increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Differences between the deviations in different null models revealed that intraspecific and intraindividual trait variability contribute to different facets of functional diversity (H3c). In the case of intraindividual variability, the negative departure of FRic from the random leaf null model indicate that, as different populations are exposed to different environmental conditions, the leaves belonging to the same population are highly similar among them compared to other leaves from the same species. Further, the coincidence in the discrepancies between the observed and expected FRic in the random tree and the population-restricted random leaf null models may mean that higher FRic in observed communities is only attributable to intraspecific trait variability. In contrast, the higher observed functional divergence (FDiv) in comparison to the expectations of the random leaf and the population-restricted random leaf null models suggests that communities have a more multimodal distributions, that is, there are several modes (“peaks”) across the functional space, resulting from intraindividual trait variability. Indeed, while the role of intraspecific variability in producing multimodal trait distributions had already been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>), our results indicated that this effect could be amplified when considering intraindividual variability. This means that, even within one experimental plot, there is not a unique optimal trait value, but different optimal leaf designs are expressed. This is consistent with previous literature, as due to microenvironmental conditions along the tree crown, multiple leaf designs can be expressed in order to maximize fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>), affecting the distribution of traits in the community. Interestingly, while we found differences between the observed functional diversity and the expectations in the random tree, random leaf and population-restricted random leaf model, observed populations did not depart significantly from randomly chosen populations for either functional richness or functional divergence. This suggests that, despite the responses found for intraspecific trait overlap, population identity does not matter for functional diversity. However, we should be careful when interpreting this result because, while we did not find differences in the contributions of different populations from the experiment presented here, populations in natural systems with higher environmental heterogeneity could differ substantially in their contribution to the functional diversity of the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In summary, both intraspecific and intraindividual trait variability affected the distribution of functional diversity. This outcome provides a better understanding of how the variation within species influences functional diversity and supports the idea that intraspecific variability is an important component to be considered when studying the functional diversity of ecological communities at fine or local scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). Additionally, we show that intraindividual variability does not only matter for the ecological processes occurring at the population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>), but also shapes the trait distribution of ecological communities.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Outlook</title><p id="P22">Using a trait dataset that accounts for hierarchical sources of trait variation for eight tree species across a gradient of tree species richness, we showed that trait variability within and between individual trees is relevant for understanding patterns of intraspecific functional diversity. Traits are a response to pressures from the abiotic and biotic environment, but simultaneously affect ecosystem functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). For instance, intraspecific variability in trees has also been shown to be an important factor increasing primary productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>), and similar effects are expected for intraindividual trait variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). Therefore, understanding the patterns of trait variation could reveal new facets of the mechanisms behind ecosystem functioning. Altogether, our study demonstrates the importance of considering biological units below the population or species level in trait-based ecology, thus highlighting the importance of moving from a species-based trait ecology to an individual-based trait ecology, that could enable better understanding of processes occurring at the local scales</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Study site and experimental design</title><p id="P23">This study was conducted in a biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiment, the BEF-China tree diversity experiment, located in Xingangshan, in Jiangxi Province, China (lat. 29°08’11”N, long. 117°90’93”E). While BEF-China was primarily created to investigate ecosystem functions in planted areas with different levels of tree-species diversity, thereby simulating the impact of species extinction, this experiment has also been used to address intraspecific changes of trees in response to their biotic context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>). The climate is subtropical with a mean annual temperature of 16.5°C (ranging from 0.4°C in January to 34.2°C in July) and mean annual precipitation of 1,821 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>).

In each plot, 400 saplings were planted in a uniform grid with 1.29-meter spacing, with species randomly allocated to planting positions. In the experiment, the trees are arranged according to the ‘broken-stick’ design outlined by Bruelheide et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). This design involves dividing the species pool into two equal groups for each subordinate richness level. From the total pool of 24 species, we worked with eight tree species: Castanea henryi Rehder &amp; E.H.

In every plot, we randomly chose six individuals from every species, and every species was sampled in two plots at each diversity level. This results in a total of 384 trees from eight different species in 30 plots. However, the theoretical number of 384 trees was reduced to 381 due to the high mortality of Triadica sebifera in one of the plots, where we found only three individuals for that population. In order to capture the variability of the whole individual, from each tree we collected 12 fully developed leaves free from apparent mechanical or pathogen damage at three different heights and four different orientations of the crown, resulting in 4,572 leaves. Immediately after collection, leaves were stored in sealable plastic bags with moistened tissue. Samples were transported in an isothermal bag equipped with cooling bags to prevent dehydration. In the laboratory, samples were temporarily stored at 6–8 °C for a maximum of 12 hours before further processing.</p><p id="P25">In addition, we collected independent sets of leaf samples in order to predict the leaf economics spectrum (LES) and stomata trait values for the samples of the regular set based on the relationship between reflectance spectra and measured trait values of the calibration and stomata sets (see ‘leaf trait prediction‘ section for details). As the methods for measuring traits from the LES were incompatible with the methods used to measure stomata traits, we used two independent sets for these predictions: calibration LES set and calibration stomata set. For the calibration LES set, we included 20 leaf samples per species across all species richness levels, collected at different heights and orientations within the crown, in order to maximize the sampled scenarios (i.e., combinations of species considering closest neighbors, different positions of the leaf within the crown, and the tree’s location within the experiment). Each of the 160 samples was composed of four leaves on average depending on the leaf size, to ensure sufficient material for laboratory analyses. For the calibration stomata set we collected 16 leaves per species (totaling 128 samples), also covering all species richness levels and four different heights within the tree crown.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Spectroscopy and laboratory analyses</title><p id="P26">Visible-near infrared spectrometry (Vis-NIRS) is emerging as a high-throughput phenotyping technique to manage large sample sizes and predict individual leaf trait values using calibration models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>). For all leaves (regular, calibration LES and calibration stomata samples), we acquired reflectance spectra with a portable Vis-NIRS device (ASD “FieldSpec4” Wide-Res Field Spectroradiometer, Malvern Panalytical Ltd, Almelo, Netherlands). Reflectance was measured across the full range of the solar radiation spectrum (350-2500 nm) by taking three repeated measures on the adaxial side of each leaf while avoiding main veins. The equipment was optimized regularly with a calibration white panel (Spectralon, Labsphere, Durham, New Hampshire, USA). For each measurement, ten spectra were averaged internally to reduce noise. A splice correction was applied to the spectral data to minimize the disjunctions between the three sensors of the ASD FieldSpec (VNIR, SWIR1 and SWIR2, with ranges 350-1000 nm, 1001-1800 nm and 1801-2500 nm, respectively). Therefore, the splicing regions were configured according to the points between sensors (from 750 to 1000 and from 1800 to 1950; 74)). After splice correction, outlier detection was performed by using a similar procedure as in Li et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). First, all spectra were visually inspected in the laboratory after acquisition. Additionally, for every species separately, we calculated the local outlier factor of every spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>) and hence considered as outliers 25 spectra that had a value higher than 2 for the local outlier factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13</xref>).</p><p id="P27">For the samples of the calibration LES set, we determined five morphological and chemical leaf traits which are assumed to reflect a plant’s strategy in terms of the investment of nutrients and dry mass in the leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>) and are key components of the leaf economics spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>): specific leaf area (SLA; leaf area divided by leaf dry mass; mm<sup>2</sup>/mg), leaf dry matter content (LDMC; leaf dry mass divided leaf fresh mass; mg/g), carbon content (C; %), nitrogen content (N; %), and phosphorus content (P; μg/g). Additionally, from the calibration stomata set, two traits involved in the regulation of the use of water regulation were assessed: stomatal density (SDens; mm<sup>-2</sup>) and stomatal size (SSize; μm). In our experiment, these two traits have been shown to represent an orthogonal source of leaf variation relative to the traits from the leaf economics spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>). After collection, the saturated fresh leaves of the calibration LES samples were weighed (DeltaRange Precision Balance PB303-S; Mettler-Toledo GmbH, Gießen, Germany) and scanned at a resolution of 300 dpi to measure leaf area (WinFOLIA; Regent Instruments, Quebec, QC, Canada). Leaves were oven-dried at 80°C for 72 h and weighed to calculate SLA and LDMC. Dried leaves were ground (Mixer Mill 400; Retsch, Haan, Germany), and 200 mg of the resulting powder was used for a nitric acid digestion. After the digestion, P was measured through a molybdate spectrophotometric method (UV-VIS Spectrophotometer UV-1280; Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>). Additionally, we used an elemental analyzer (Vario El Cube; Elementar, Langenselbold, Germany) to gas-chromatographically determine C and N contents. Imprints for measuring SDens and SSize were taken from fresh leaves of the calibration stomata set by applying transparent nail polish to the abaxial leaf surface and peeling it off once it dried naturally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>). Afterward, stomata were counted at three different locations of the imprints by using an optical microscope (Zeiss Axiostar Plus) with a magnification of 400×. SDens of every leaf were estimated as the mean number of stomata divided by the area of the field of view. A magnification of 1000× was used later for assessing the length of the guard cells in three randomly selected stomata for every imprint. SSize of every leaf was calculated as the mean guard cell length.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Leaf trait prediction</title><p id="P28">The calibration LES and calibration stomata datasets (spectral data and corresponding trait measurements) were then divided into train and test sets, which account for a proportion of 75% and 25%, respectively. Finally, after excluding the spectral region between 350 and 399 nm for subsequent analyses due to the typical large amount of sensor noise in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>), we used a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for leaf trait prediction based on the spectral data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). First, input spectra from the train and test sets were augmented from 2,501 to 12,255 wavelength features by using transformations based on a combination of standard normal variates and Savitzky-Golay derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>).

To avoid overfitting, batch normalization was applied after the convolutional layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>). Hyperparameter tuning for every CNN was performed independently for every trait, by adjusting the number of filters, their size for the convolutional layers, and the number of nodes in the dense layers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>). For model optimization, an Adam algorithm and a loss function based on the mean squared error was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>). We tested the predictive ability of the CNNs by assessing the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) for the predicted and measured values in the test set and in the train set. The mean R2 of the test set was 0.74 ± 0.15 (mean ± standard deviation), with a maximum R2 for SLA and LDMC (both 0.91) and minimum for P (0.54).

Therefore, we assessed trait variability by considering probabilistic multivariate trait distributions with two dimensions (PC1 and PC2). Further, trait variability for single axes (for PC1 and PC2 independently) was also assessed. First, by considering leaf-level values on PC1 and PC2, we compiled a trait probability density for every individual tree as an approach to intraindividual trait variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>).

In addition, tree diameter at breast height (DBH) and slope of the terrain in the position of the tree were included as covariates in the model for intraindividual variability, while the mean slope of the terrain in the plot was included as a covariate in the model for intraspecific trait variability due to its variability across the study site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12</xref>).

The community trait probability densities were then used to assess FRic and FDiv as metrics of functional diversity in a plot. For this last step, the contribution of the trait probability density of every population was weighted according to the sum of wood volume of every species in the central area of every plot (including the 36 trees in the centre of the plot). To assess the wood volume (WV) of the trees, basal area and height were measured in 2022 and the conversion factor calculated by Huang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>) for our study species in our study site was used to estimate wood volume as: <disp-formula id="FD1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.5412</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:msup><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1985</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:msup><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold-italic">basal</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mtext>area</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mtext mathvariant="bold-italic">height</mml:mtext></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P35">Following this framework, we ran simulations randomizing hierarchically different sources of variation occurring within the species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>).

Therefore, we decided to build another null model for the assignment of random leaves in which the pool of leaves was more restricted than in the “random leaf null model” model: <list list-type="simple" id="L2"><list-item><label>(4)</label><p id="P40">Population-restricted random leaf null model: Leaf values were shuffled for every population before calculating functional diversity.

SESs were calculated independently for every plot and type of null model. To test the effects of tree species richness and the type of null model on the SES for every functional index, we used LMMs and included the plot identity nested in tree species composition, as a random effect. In every model, we included the SES of every functional index as a response variable. Thus, we fitted two models with tree species richness (log2 transformed), type of the null model, and their interaction as response variables. Then, we tested the significance of fixed effects by using likelihood ratio tests, following the same procedure described previously for LMMs fitted for the intraspecific and intraindividual trait variability. All LMMs were fitted using the ‘lmer‘ function in the ‘lmerTest‘ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref>). We considered that the fitted null model coefficients were significantly different from the random scenario when the 95%-confidence intervals did not overlap with zero.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS201303-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d110aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to L.

Curves represent the trait distributions of populations, with inner stacked curves belonging to the trait distribution of tree individuals. The structure of trait variation within species can influence community functional diversity and that is why (<bold>B</bold>) we expect functional diversity in observed communities (represented as a baseline with a grey dashed line) to be higher compared to the functional diversity of virtual assemblages (colored values) for which different sources of trait variation have been randomized. Specifically, we expect that the functional diversity of observed communities would be more similar to those assessed with models that randomize the identity of the populations (pink points) compared to those assessed with models that randomize the identity of the trees (purple points), and the total pool of leaves within a species (blue points), respectively. In addition, we expect these differences to be higher with low tree species richness due to the importance of intraspecific and intraindividual trait variability in the functional diversity of species-poor communities.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201303-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Main axes of leaf trait variation and effect of tree species richness on intraspecific and intraindividual leaf trait variability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Biplot for the first two axes of a principal component analysis (PCA) of seven functional traits predicted for leaves collected in eight tree species growing in a subtropical tree diversity experiment (N = 4568; colored points: mean species values). Data are based on spectroscopically predicted trait values of leaves collected from trees growing along an experimental species richness gradient with mixtures of 1, 2, 4 and 8 tree species. The color gradient visualizes different probability densities, with red colors corresponding to portions of the space displaying the highest densities of observations. The first component (PC1) reflects a gradient from “conservative” leaves (towards the left) that are expected to have a longer lifespan and higher survival probability in response to abiotic and biotic hazards than cheaply constructed “acquisitive” leaves (towards the right) which are expected to have higher photosynthetic rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2, S3</xref>). The second component (PC2) reflects a gradient in nutrition status and stomatal morphology ranging from “low nutrient content” and “water spender” leaves (towards the bottom) with low photosynthetic capacity and few large stomata to “high nutrient content” and “water saver” leaves that could show high photosynthetic rates and have many small stomata that could decrease stomatal conductance quickly in response to water shortage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Colors and leaf silhouettes correspond to the different tree species included in the study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). Regression estimates from linear mixed-effects models to study intraspecific and intraindividual variability of PC1 and PC2 (<bold>B</bold>) show a significant decrease in intraspecific functional richness of PC1 with increasing tree diversity (P = 0.01) and a significant decrease of intraindividual functional divergence of PC2 (P = 0.04). Regression coefficients are shown for the intraspecific level (top, N = 63) and intraindividual level (bottom, N = 381).

Linear mixed-effects models showed that the responses of (<bold>B</bold>) SES<sub>FRic</sub> and of (<bold>C</bold>) SES<sub>FDiv</sub> to tree species richness depended on the type of null model (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively; N = 120). SESs are lower than zero (below the dashed line) when the observed values of functional diversity are lower than the simulated ones, while SESs are higher than zero when the observed values are higher than the simulated ones. Semi-transparent bands represent a 95% confidence interval. Points correspond to the mean value of SESs and error bars represent their standard deviation. Boxplots for comparing the values for the SESs in different models are included in the right panels.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201303-f005"/></fig></floats-group></article>
