A promising therapeutic avenue for treating destabilizing variants is pharmacological chaperones (PCs, also known as correctors or stabilizers), small molecules that bind to and stabilize target proteins. PCs have been approved as clinical treatments for specific variants, but protein energetics suggest their effects might be much more general. Here, we test this hypothesis for the first time by comprehensively quantifying PC efficacy for all missense variants in a human disease gene, the vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R), a G-protein coupled receptor in which loss-of-function variants cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). Strikingly, treatment with a PC rescues the expression of nearly all destabilized variants, with non-rescued variants identifying the drug’s binding site. Our results provide proof-of-principle that a single small molecule can rescue destabilizing variants throughout a protein’s structure. The application of this principle to other proteins should allow the development of effective therapies for many genetic diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Rare genetic diseases pose a formidable challenge for global health. While the number of affected individuals for any disease is a small percentage of the population, in total as many as 300 million people are affected by rare diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Despite recent progress in computational methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, the identification of causal pathogenic variants and the determination of molecular mechanisms remains an arduous challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, developing effective therapies for genetic diseases where only a small number of patients carry each causal variant is extremely challenging.</p><p id="P3">The most frequent mechanism by which missense variants cause rare diseases is reduced protein stability. Large-scale experimental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and computational<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> surveys estimate that 40-60% of pathogenic variants are explained by loss of stability. Compensating for this reduced stability therefore represents a potentially general strategy to treat rare diseases. Pharmacological chaperones (PCs) are typically small molecules whose binding increases the thermostability and subsequent steady state expression level of a target protein. A striking example of PC success is in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, where a combination treatment of two PCs and a channel potentiator offers effective treatment for patients with the most frequent Phe508del and some other variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. PCs – also referred to as protein stabilizers or correctors – have also been developed for non-membrane proteins, including clinically approved PCs for lysosomal storage disease proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and the amyloidogenic transthyretin protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, as well as experimental PCs for the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor protein, p53<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. To maximize the effectiveness of PC therapy though, it is necessary to identify the mechanism of all pathogenic variation for a given protein, as well as the response to PC. These data do not currently exist for any protein.</p><p id="P4">Depending on the mechanism of action, PCs could have high specificity, rescuing only subsets of pathogenic variants localized in particular regions of the protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Alternatively, PCs could have largely nonspecific stabilizing effects that offset the destabilization by most variants in a protein, wherever they are located<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Most human proteins are marginally stable, meaning that only small changes in folding energy are required to produce large changes in the abundance of folded protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Indeed in a collated set of 223 experimentally determined changes in Gibbs free energy of folding (ΔΔG) values for membrane protein mutations, 91% were less than 3 kcal/mol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Similarly, massive experimental mutagenesis of soluble proteins has confirmed the vast majority of variants only cause small changes in folding energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, as do known pathogenic variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Such small changes in fold stability could potentially be easily compensated for by small molecule binding, which can confer similarly sized changes in free energy as mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Moreover, provided that free energies combine mostly additively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, the stabilization conferred by small molecule binding should be largely independent of where a small molecule binds and where a mutation is located, provided the compound specifically binds the native folded state.</p><p id="P5">The vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R) is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) with an important role in water homeostasis in the kidneys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) is the primary endogenous ligand of V2R, and AVP levels regulate the permeability of the collecting duct of the kidneys: increased levels of AVP lead to increased permeability and a higher level of water reabsorption. Upon AVP binding, V2R adopts an active conformation and couples primarily with G<sub>αs</sub> containing heterotrimeric G-proteins, leading to intracellular signaling that results in translocation of aquaporin-2 water channels to the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. When the function of V2R is lost, water reabsorption is compromised, leading to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Individuals with NDI suffer from chronic dehydration that can lead to severe clinical outcomes, and treatment options exist only for managing symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Highlighting the sensitivity and importance of this system, rare gain-of-function mutations that increase the basal activity of V2R cause an opposite clinical designation of nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (NSIAD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The gene encoding V2R, <italic>AVPR2</italic>, is on the X-chromosome. The majority of NDI-affected individuals are hemizygous males, although skewed X-inactivation has been reported to cause NDI or subclinical phenotypes in some females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Hundreds of <italic>AVPR2</italic> variants have been found in individuals with NDI, of which about half are missense variants and the remainder being nonsense, small insertions or deletions, or splice-site mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Only a fraction of the missense variants have been experimentally characterized <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Here we use V2R as a model system to directly test the hypothesis that PCs can rescue destabilizing mutants across the structure of a complex human protein. First, we employ a multiplexed assay to quantify the effects of all possible variants on the cell surface expression of V2R, revealing that more than half the known pathogenic variants strongly impair V2R expression, as do thousands of other missense variants throughout the protein. Strikingly, treatment with the V2R small molecule binder Tolvaptan rescues the expression of nearly all these variants. Only a small number are not compensated for, with these identifying functionally important sites and the drug binding site. Our results provide proof that a single small molecule can rescue the expression of reduced expression mutations throughout the structure of a protein. The application of this principle to other proteins should allow the development of general stabilizers for many different genetic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Massively parallel measurement of V2R surface expression</title><p id="P7">We used SUNi mutagenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> to generate a saturation variant library containing all single amino acid changes to the V2R coding sequence. Mutagenesis primers were designed to introduce a degenerate NNK or NNS codon at each position (depending on the wild-type codon, K=G or T, S=G or C) and random DNA barcodes were subsequently inserted into the plasmid backbone to enable identification of each variant with short-read sequencing. In order to link the full V2R variant sequence with the short DNA barcode, we used long read sequencing and successfully linked 66,031 barcode-variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 1a</xref>). In total, 7,005 out of a possible 7,400 missense and nonsense variants (94.7% of possible) were represented by at least one barcode, with a median of 5 barcodes per variant.</p><p id="P8">We implemented a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based approach to measure the surface expression of the library of variants in human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. First, the library of plasmids was recombined into HEK293T landing pad cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Materials and Methods</xref>), ensuring that each cell carried exactly one variant. The V2R construct had a HA-epitope tag at the N-terminus, which would be extracellular in a properly folded and trafficked receptor. Therefore, we performed immunostaining with a fluorescent antibody but without permeabilizing the cells, so that only receptors that had reached the membrane would contribute to signal. Then we sorted cells into four bins, isolated DNA from the cells in each bin, and used short-read sequencing to count the frequency of each variant across the bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Surface expression scores were calculated using the frequency of each variant in each bin multiplied by the geometric mean fluorescence value associated with each bin (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Materials and Methods</xref>). Across four replicates we obtained high-confidence measurements for 6,844 (92.5% of possible, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Materials and Methods</xref>) variants with high reproducibility (average pairwise replicate Pearson’s r=0.90, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>, data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Multiplexed scores correlate very well with FACS measurements of a series of isogenic cell lines bearing single V2R variants (r=0.95, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). Scores were normalized between complete loss of function (i.e. the median score of all nonsense variants in the first 300 positions of the receptor), assigned score 0, and the wild-type genotype assigned score 1. Synonymous wild-type variant scores are well separated from nonsense scores, and the distribution of all missense variants is bimodal, with a large fraction expressed near the level of wild-type and a smaller fraction expressed near the level of nonsense variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). We used the upper 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of truncation scores (0.35) and the lower 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of synonymous wild-type scores (0.825) to categorize missense variants as well expressed (3,415 variants), moderately expressed (1,772 variants), or poorly expressed (1,025 variants, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P10">A heatmap representation of the data reveals that nonsense mutations are uniformly damaging through all seven transmembrane (TM) helices but mostly do not compromise surface expression in the unstructured, C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Transmembrane helices are particularly intolerant to mutation, especially to charged amino acids. In fact, mutations within the transmembrane helices as a population are significantly more damaging than the extra- or intracellular loops (Mann-Whitney U test, p=3.16x10<sup>-135</sup>, p=8.54x10<sup>-153</sup>, respectively), while there is no difference between the extra- and intra-cellular loops (p=0.39, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, g</xref>). Comparing the surface expression scores of all variants in each TM helix, variation in TM3 is the most damaging (median=0.49, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). This is consistent with previous work suggesting that TM3 has a critical role in receptor stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and acts as a “structural hub”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> for the TM bundle across class A GPCRs. TM2 is the second most mutation-sensitive (median=0.56) TM helix. The predicted free energy change (ΔG) of membrane integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> for these helices is relatively unfavorable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>) suggesting that mutations here could further compromise an already inefficient process.</p><p id="P11">TM regions are solvated in lipid and are therefore enriched in hydrophobic residues, compared with extra- or intracellular residues. Mutations within the TM regions that decrease hydrophobicity have negative effects on surface expression (Spearman’s ρ=0.28, p=1.8x10<sup>-48</sup>) while the relationship is much weaker and in the opposite direction for the extra- or intracellular regions (ρ=-0.05, p=0.002, Supp. Fig. 1c). Visualization of each residue’s preference for hydrophobicity (calculated as rank correlation of surface expression scores with Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity) agrees with this notion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>) but also highlights several residues within the core of the receptor that prefer hydrophilic residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>).</p><p id="P12">V2R undergoes post-translational modification in the form of O- and N-glycosylation on the N-terminal tail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> as well as palmitoylation on the C-terminal tail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> Positions 22-24 represent the N-glycosylation motif (N-X-S/T), and mutations at position 22 and 24 are much more deleterious than their neighbors in the unstructured N-terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). While O-glycosylation was reported at several serines and threonines in the N-terminus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, we only see strong mutational effects at S5 and T6, suggesting these are the only critical glycosylation sites, at least in HEK cells. Finally, palmitoylation at cysteines 341 and 342 have been reported to be important for surface expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>; our data show that in HEK cells mutations at these sites are well tolerated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The contribution of V2R surface expression to pathogenicity</title><p id="P13">We next sought to understand the contribution of surface expression defects to V2R-related disease. To do this, we collated clinical variants from ClinVar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, population variants from gnomAD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and variants reported in individuals with NDI or NSIAD from the Human Gene Mutation Database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. There are striking differences between the surface expression scores for putatively benign variants (in gnomAD, or benign or likely benign in ClinVar) and the putatively loss-of-function ones (pathogenic or likely pathogenic in Clinvar, or NDI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). There are no poorly expressed variants in the gnomAD, benign, or likely benign sets, and only 30.7% and 26.6% moderately expressed in likely benign and gnomAD, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). In contrast, 40%, 53.3%, and 55.6% of pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and NDI variants are poorly expressed, while 26.6%, 26.6%, and 30% are moderately expressed, respectively. There are only five known NSIAD variants and they are constitutively active<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Four are moderately and one is well expressed, consistent with the gain-of-function mechanism. Among variants of uncertain significance, 15.6% and 25% are poorly and moderately expressed, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Stratifying gnomAD variants by allele frequency shows that common variants (allele frequency &gt;0.001) are all well expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Classifying pathogenic variant mechanisms</title><p id="P14">While computational variant effect predictors (VEPs) are increasingly accurate at distinguishing pathogenic from benign variation, they cannot perform the crucial task of determining molecular mechanisms for pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). First, we evaluated how well computational VEPs can discriminate pathogenic (NDI alleles) from putatively benign variation (gnomAD alleles). ESM1b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, a protein language model, achieves an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.91. EVE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, which uses multiple sequence alignments to model evolution, achieves AUROC of 0.92. Finally, AlphaMissense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, which uses structural predictions, population variant frequencies, and evolutionary data, achieves an AUROC of 0.94. As a comparison, surface expression scores achieve AUROC of 0.84, again suggesting that surface expression is a major determinant of pathogenicity.</p><p id="P15">On the other hand, models designed to predict protein stability effects of variation performed less well than the empirical surface expression scores. RaSP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> achieved AUROC of 0.76 and ThermoMPNN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> achieved 0.80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). We also compared the predictors to the surface expression scores and to each other. The VEPs correlated better with the surface expression data, with ρ=0.6, 0.57, and 0.56 for AlphaMissense, EVE, and ESM1b, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 2a-c</xref>). ThermoMPNN and RaSP correlated less well, at 0.46 and 0.33, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. d-e</xref>). The poorer correlation of the stability predictors likely reflects the difficulty of predicting stability changes for membrane proteins, especially as RaSP and ThermoMPNN were trained on soluble proteins. Finally, we were curious whether mutation effect predictors could capture the pathogenicity of the NSIAD gain-of-function mutations. The number of variants is too small to make strong conclusions, but there seems to be much variability for the different models’ predictions, suggesting that gain-of-function variants could be more difficult to predict than loss-of-function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 2a-e</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We hypothesized that our surface expression scores could help disambiguate the mechanism for pathogenic variants; specifically, whether a V2R variant is pathogenic due to decreased surface expression or a presumed signaling deficit. We considered that variation at positions close to the natural ligand (AVP) binding site in 3D space would be likelier to disrupt signaling than variation far away. Indeed, we found that well and moderately expressed NDI variants are closer to AVP in a solved structure (Mann-Whitney U test, p=1.5x10<sup>-3</sup> and 7.7x10<sup>-4</sup> for well and moderately expressed compared with poorly expressed variants, PDB structure 7KH0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g, h</xref>).</p><p id="P17">While there are over a hundred known NDI variants, this likely represents only a small fraction of pathogenic variation in V2R. Therefore, we used AlphaMissense to predict all pathogenic variants in V2R (AlphaMissense threshold=0.564<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>). 2,911 variants are predicted to be pathogenic, of which we have high confidence surface expression scores for 2,595. Of these, 979 (37.7%) are poorly expressed, 953 (36.7%) are moderately expressed, and 663 (25.5%) are well expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>). AlphaMissense predicted pathogenic variants have bimodal surface expression scores, just like the distribution of all missense variants. However, while the mode of the higher expression peak for all missense is near 1.0, the mode of the higher expression peak for AlphaMissense pathogenic variants is lower, around 0.8; this is likely due to a majority of these variants being in transmembrane helices (1,789 out of 2,595, 68.9%). The mode of the higher expression peak for transmembrane variants is also near 0.8 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Finally, we compared the proximity of AlphaMissense pathogenic variants to AVP in the solved structure of V2R. As with the NDI variants, the well and moderately expressed pathogenic variants are closer to AVP in 3D space compared with the poorly expressed variants (p=2.2x10<sup>-21</sup> and 0.03, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref>), consistent with a specific signaling defect for variants that have at least moderate expression level. For this much larger set, the well expressed variants are also closer to AVP than the moderately expressed ones (p=1.9x10<sup>-9</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Thermodynamic rescue of V2R variants</title><p id="P18">In principle, variants that are poorly expressed due to decreased thermodynamic stability should be rescued by incubating the cells expressing the variant library at reduced temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We sought to understand what fraction of V2R variants could be rescued by thermodynamic stabilization by culturing the cells expressing the V2R variant library at 27°. After 24 hours at 27°, FACS analysis revealed a shift in the distribution of surface expression, with more cells highly expressing V2R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 3a</xref>). To gather quantitative data for all variants, we then sorted and sequenced the 27° rescued libraries. High confidence measurements were collected for 6,787 missense and nonsense variants (91.7% of possible) and replicates were well correlated (r=0.91, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 3c</xref>, data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). The distribution of multiplexed missense variant scores mirrors the FACS data, with a shift of some variants from the low expressing to the high expressing peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Then, we compared the surface expression of all variants at 27° compared to the control condition, 37°. The magnitude of rescue is greatest for variants with moderate expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). On the other hand, variants that are well- or poorly-expressed in the control condition do not show large changes. This result is consistent with temperature reduction contributing a constant, additive free energy change, but that free energy change having a non-linear effect on the phenotype of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, in this case steady state expression level. Namely, the magnitude of rescue is greatest for variants with starting free energy values in the steepest part of the free energy-expression level curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To further investigate the generality of rescue afforded by temperature reduction, we designed an approach to identify positions that have more or less rescue compared to all other positions. First, we fit a Lowess curve to control vs. rescue data, which represents a null expectation for the magnitude of rescue at each control surface expression value. After fitting the curve, we calculate residuals between each variant and the fit line.

While PCs have shown effectiveness for correcting NDI-associated V2R variants both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in the clinic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, a major obstacle has been the uncertainty of how general the effect of any PC would be<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.

Tolvaptan is remarkably effective at rescuing NDI alleles: of 69 poorly expressed variants in the control condition, 60 (87.0%) are rescued to at least moderately expressed levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e-f</xref>). We next evaluated effectiveness on variants predicted to be pathogenic by AlphaMissense.

For 27° rescue, three out of ten outlier positions are glycosylation sites. Both O-glycosylation sites (S5 and T6) are rescued less than expected, but S24 is actually rescued more than expected, suggesting that temperature reduction can compensate the N-glycosylation defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>, residues colored according to FDR-adjusted p value, residues outlined in yellow are rescued more than expected, those not outlined are rescued less than expected). Of the others, three are near the orthosteric site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a1</xref>) and two are in or near helix 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a2</xref>).</p><p id="P27">For Tolvaptan, all four glycosylation sites (S5, T6, N22, and S24) are rescued less than expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>), implying that Tolvaptan cannot compensate for the lack of proper glycosylation. In addition, a cluster of residues on one side of the orthosteric binding site are rescued less well than expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b1</xref>). We suspected that this could be the binding site of Tolvaptan. Indeed, a study employing molecular dynamics and site-directed mutagenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> determined that the most important residues for Tolvaptan antagonism are M123<sup>3x36</sup>, F178<sup>3x36</sup>, Y205<sup>5x39</sup>, V206<sup>5x40</sup>, and F287<sup>6x51</sup>, of which all but F178<sup>3x36</sup> are rescued less than expected by Tolvaptan. Finally, R137<sup>3x50</sup> of the highly conserved E/DRY motif and two arginines in close proximity (R158<sup>4x44</sup> and R143<sup>3x56</sup>) are rescued less well than expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b2</xref>). Mutations at R137<sup>3x50</sup> cause constitutive signaling activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, so this cluster of mutations might render Tolvaptan less effective by biasing the receptor to the active conformation. An examination of the sites where variants are rescued more than expected highlights a cluster of residues at the intracellular interface of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b3</xref>). Mutations at these sites could potentially affect signaling and/or internalization; PC stabilization of the inactive state might therefore have an exaggerated effect here.</p><p id="P28">Taken together, these results demonstrate nearly universal surface expression rescue of destabilized V2R variants with the PC Tolvaptan. The few sites where variants are consistently not rescued inform on the likely binding site of Tolvaptan as well as other functional sites of the receptor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">Reduced expression due to impaired fold stability is the predominant mechanism by which missense variants cause disease, including in both soluble<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> and membrane proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. The destabilization conferred by most missense variants in most proteins is, however, small, suggesting that re-stabilization of a protein by a small molecule PC that binds the native state might confer sufficient free energy to rescue the effects of very diverse mutations throughout a protein’s structure. In order for this approach to be effective, though, it is necessary to prospectively classify the mechanism for all pathogenic variants in a protein, as well as their response to PC. Here we have implemented this framework and tested the ‘universal PC’ hypothesis for V2R. First, we show that over half of known loss-of-function variants are poorly expressed, and use temperature reduction to show that the vast majority of variants lose expression as a result of thermodynamic instability. Based on this, we then test the efficacy of Tolvaptan, a well-characterized antagonist and PC of V2R. Our results show that binding of a single small molecule PC can rescue the cell surface expression of nearly all variants throughout the receptor’s structure.</p><p id="P30">Previous low-throughput studies mostly tested the efficacy of PCs for a small number of variants, with the failed rescue of individual variants leading to suggestions of widespread idiosyncratic effects between PCs and variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. More systematic efforts testing hundreds of variants in rhodopsin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> and CFTR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup> demonstrated rescue of many variants, but with the authors also suggesting substantial region-specific differences in rescue. In contrast, we have profiled an order of magnitude more variants to demonstrate protein-wide, nearly universal PC rescue of variants.</p><p id="P31">We believe there are good empirical and theoretical reasons to expect our results to generalize to other proteins and PCs. Most proteins are marginally stable, meaning that large changes in expression result from mutations with ΔΔG of only a few kcal/mol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, and indeed large-scale surveys of mutational effects show most pathogenic mutations only cause small changes in fold stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. It is reasonable to believe that such small changes in fold stability can be easily compensated for by small molecule binding in many proteins. Tolvaptan binding to V2R, for example, confers a free energy change of approximately -12 kcal/mol,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> so potentially completely offsetting the destabilizing effects of nearly all variants, provided drug concentrations are high enough.</p><p id="P32">Accordingly, small molecules may represent a much more general strategy to rescue poorly expressed variants than is commonly perceived. The law of mass action means that to rescue expression, a small molecule only needs to bind specifically to the folded conformation of a protein and with sufficient energy to shift the folding equilibrium towards the folded state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). There is no requirement to specifically recognize the mutated amino acid and no requirement to bind any particular region of the protein. Similar principles apply when multiple mutations are combined in a protein, where large-scale experimental analyses have revealed that changes in fold stability are nearly always additive when diverse mutations are combined in a single protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. We believe, therefore, that many small molecules binding to proteins with sufficient free energy will behave as general or universal PCs.</p><p id="P33">In further support of the general, energetically additive view of PC efficacy, the small number of variants that are not rescued by Tolvaptan mostly have clear mechanistic explanations: mutations in the binding site of Tolvaptan interfere with binding of the drug and variants that affect expression by mechanisms other than reduced fold stability are not rescued, here exemplified by variants in post-translational modification sites. These variants that are not rescued by a PC can be rapidly identified by selection and sequencing experiments and so excluded from inclusion in clinical trials. We also note that this approach of identifying changes in abundance not rescued by small molecule binding is a potentially very general strategy to rapidly identify drug binding sites in proteins.</p><p id="P34">High-throughput protein abundance selection assays have now been developed for many different classes of protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>. As we have demonstrated here, these assays can be used to rapidly quantify the efficacy of PCs across all variants in a protein to prioritize broadly effective PCs. One limitation of our Tolvaptan rescue finding is that we have not established what fraction of rescued variants can signal at the membrane. However, there is reason to expect that a significant portion will retain signaling activity.

Such general PCs will not have to bind to specific sites in a protein and they will not need to be tailored for each specific pathogenic variant.

Then, all barcode-variants that code for the same amino acid change are combined, and the log10 transformed geometric mean fluorescence (fluor) value of all cells sorted into each bin is combined with the estimated cell counts to arrive at the raw surface expression estimate: <disp-formula id="FD1"><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo>#</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p id="P45">Then, these surface expression scores are normalized such that wild-type = 1 and the median of known loss-of-function variants (premature stop codons before the 300<sup>th</sup> residue) = 0. Variants were retained and considered high confidence if the estimated number of cells sorted for that genotype was &gt;=50. For the control scores, four replicates were combined-these were the controls for the rescue experiments. Namely, one condition with normal culture conditions (37° condition), two conditions with 0.1% DMSO (DMSOA and DMSOB, controlling for tolvaptan), and one condition with 1% DMSO. Since these replicates were well-correlated with each other, they were all used for deriving the control estimates.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Modeling rescue and identifying outliers</title><p id="P46">LOWESS curves were fit to the controls vs. rescue data with the python package statsmodels.nonparametric.smoothers_lowess<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup> with these parameter values: frac=0.3, it=3, delta=0.0. After fitting the LOWESS curve, residuals were calculated for all variants as the distance in the y-axis between the curve and the variant. Then, for each position, a Mann-Whitney U test was conducted comparing the residuals of all variants at that position with control surface expression below 0.85 with all other variants with control surface expression below 0.85. This threshold was intended to only include variants that actually had the potential to be rescued.
