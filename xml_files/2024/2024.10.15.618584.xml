They constitutively produce different kinds of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which mediate cell-to cell communication and play diverse roles in immune regulation and inflammatory processes. Here we provide a resource documenting the composition of activated TH cell EVs and demonstrating their ability to instigate pro-inflammatory response in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). EVs were characterized by lipidomics, proteomics, and NanoFCM. The activated TH cells derived EVs (act-EVs) were found to be enriched in TH cell-specific proteins, transmembrane and cytosolic EV marker proteins, and HLA proteins relative to resting CD4 T cells EVs (rest-EVs). The pro-inflammatory effect of act-EVs vs rest-EVs on donor matched APCs were characterized by chemokine and cytokine profiling and flow cytometry analysis. There was no discernible contrast in endotoxin levels between act-EVs and rest-EVs. Functional distinctions were seen to arise from variations in the content and composition of these EVs. Moreover, we validated our findings with an in-vivo investigation in mice, demonstrating the recruitment of monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, and NK cells in the spleen, accompanied by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum after administering act-EVs. In summary, this study sheds light on the role of TH cell released EVs in modulating the immune response during pro-inflammatory responses and this resource provides a foundation for development of novel therapeutics on EV based scaffolds.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Extracellular vesicles</kwd><kwd>CD4 T cells</kwd><kwd>Pro-inflammatory response</kwd><kwd>Antigen presenting cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">CD4 T helper cells (TH cells) are central in mounting adaptive and humoral immune responses in infection and inflammation. Through cytokine release, they activate and polarize many immune cells to ensure sufficient antibody production, engulfment and killing of infected cells, and further immune cell recruitment to the site of infection. Whilst cytokines are receptor-specific in their action, immune cells also release extracellular vesicles (EVs) which, whilst arguably less specific, are proving no less important in mediating an immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dong, 2021</xref>). EVs are nanoscale vesicles which deliver multiple cargos to immune cells that can include DNA, RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hirsch et al., 2023</xref>), lipids, glycans and proteins in compositions that overall, concisely reflect that of the parent cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kalluri, 2024</xref>). In this manner, EVs could be considered as waste material, yet in an immune context this ‘waste’ is recycled to fulfil an essential role in mediating cell-cell communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Buzas, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Ginini et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kalluri, 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P3">TH cells regulate the release of distinct exosomes, a subtype of EVs, under different activation contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">van der Vlist et al., 2012</xref>). For instance, Cai et al., showed that EVs from activated TH cells can induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in myofibroblast to amplify the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Cai et al., 2020</xref>). Other studies suggest TH cell derived EVs may have anti-inflammatory effects. Upon activation, TH cell derived EVs regulate the immune response by modulating cytokine production in T cells, as well as monocytes and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Hezel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Scanu et al., 2008</xref>). In 2019, Torregrosa Paredes and colleagues found that EVs from regulatory TH cells can suppress the activation and proliferation of other immune cells, potentially reducing the severity of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Torregrosa Paredes et al., 2012</xref>). Overall, the role of TH cell derived EVs in an inflammatory environment is complex and likely depends on a variety of factors, including the physiological state of the TH cell producing the EVs, contents of the EVs, and the target cells that receive the EVs. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of TH cell derived EVs in mediating pro-inflammatory responses and their potential as therapeutic agents.</p><p id="P4">Interestingly, TH cell derived exosomes are reported to contain cell adhesion molecules and kinases that can facilitate the binding of EVs to target cells and initiate downstream signaling pathways, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hong et al., 2017</xref>). Such targeting, combined with the capacity to carry cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules in their proteinaceous coronas that enhance the immune response and promote cell survival, center EVs as potent immunomodulatory agents to enhance immune responses against autoimmunity, cancer, and infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kalluri, 2024</xref>). With their anticipated therapeutic potential, it is essential to understand the biological compositions of TH cell derived EVs.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we characterized the EVs derived from activated TH cells (act-EVs) and resting TH cells (rest-EVs) through proteomic and lipidomic analyses. Size and structural features of act-EVs and rest-EVs were examined using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), NanoFCM, and direct STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (dSTORM). The functionality of act-EVs and rest-EVs in their respective donor matched recipient cells (APCs such as B-cells and monocytes) were analysed using cytokine (cytokine and chemokine array), and activation marker (flow cytometry) profiles. Additionally, we corroborated our findings through an in-vivo study which revelated the recruitment of monocytes, DCs, neutrophils, and NK cells (in spleen) along with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (in serum) upon act-EVs administration. This study provides extensive insights into the biology of EVs derived from TH cells of physiological states including their characterization, functionality and potential to modulate immune regulation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods | materials"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mice</title><p id="P6">FVB mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions in the Institute of Developmental and Regenerative Medicine or Kennedy Instiute of Rheumatology Animal Facility in accordance with local and UK Home Office regulations.

Furthermore, we expected that the polarization of APCs in the spleen would systematically induce a pro-inflammatory response.</p><p id="P38">To explore this, FVB mouse splenic TH cells were activated with CD3 beads, and subsequently the EVs were purified 48 hours post-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Additionally, it has been reported that TH cell-derived EVs with DGKK trigger apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation through the DAG/PKC/NOX4 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Tu et al., 2023</xref>). Overall, the role of TH cell derived EVs in inflammation is still not fully understood and further research is needed to determine their precise mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic applications. This study serves as a resource for understanding the essential mechanism by which TH cell-derived EVs drive pro-inflammatory responses in APCs. By incorporating scRNA seq to study host TH (resting and activated) cells transcriptomics, as well as lipidomics and proteomics to characterize the released EVs and cytokine-chemokine array to study the response of recipient cells upon EV treatment we here report an end-to-end process of cargo transfer. In the context of scRNA sequencing, activated TH cells express high levels of activation markers and effector molecules, and their gene expression profiles are significantly different from those of resting TH cells. TH cells revealed upregulation of transcripts involved in EV biogenesis and the release of a plethora of EVs upon activation.</p><p id="P40">To test this hypothesis, we purified EVs using SELC and characterised them using NTA analysis, western blotting, nanoFCM, and dSTORM imaging. It was evident the EVs released were heterogenous in both size and cargo contents, and their release increased multifold upon activation. The EVs carried more TCRs and other TH effector molecules like CD69, CD40LG and CD4 upon TH cell activation. The single-particle analysis conducted on EVs showcased clear distinctions in both biochemical and physical properties between rest-EVs and act-EVs. Further, we conducted proteomics of EVs, which revealed enrichment of transmembrane and cytosolic EV marker proteins and TH cell specific proteins. Their content seems to reflect most of the upregulated genes that was expressed in the host TH cells upon activation.</p><p id="P41">The enrichment of signaling-related proteins, including the calcium-dependent kinase ZAP70, in act-EVs suggests that act-EVs may play a role in cell-cell communication suggesting that act-EVs are primed for the interaction with APCs and modulating T cell responses. Additionally, the enrichment of proteins such as SPN (CD43) and FLNA in act-EVs, further indicates their potential involvement in T cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion dynamics.</p><p id="P42">The lipidomic analysis provided insights into differences in lipid composition and functional attributes between act-EVs and rest-EVs released by TH cells. While the overall lipid composition was largely similar between act-EVs and rest-EVs, a closer examination revealed nuanced distinctions. Interestingly, lipodomics showed that lysophosphatidylethanolamine, which is generally enriched in activated TH cells, is differentially enriched in act-EVs. Act-EV also had differential expression of lysophosphatidylcholine and apolipoproteins involved in triggering proinflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Georgila et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, the presence of ‘find me signal’ lipids, including certain Lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), in act-EVs suggests a potential role in cellular recruitment and communication. Further, enrichment of CD47 (“don’t eat me signal”) seems to ensure their surveillance and reduce the clearance at the site of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Takimoto et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P43">Further, we wanted to investigate the biochemical message that was being delivered through the EVs from activated TH cells and hence their functional efficacy. Flow cytometric analysis of the EV-treated APC populations showed that EVs isolated from activated TH cells were capable of inducing activation of syngeneic recipient cells. The flow cytometry results demonstrated distinct responses in APCs when exposed to rest-EVs and act-EVs. Act-EVs exhibited a selective induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in APCs, as evidenced by a substantial fold change in comparison to treatment with rest-EVs. These findings collectively underscore that act-EVs carry a cargo enriched in ligands capable of inducing signaling cascades leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The observed elevation of IL8, IL5, and IL2 highlights the broad pro-inflammatory potential of act-EVs in stimulating various components of the immune response.</p><p id="P44">Our in vivo investigation into the impact of act-EVs provides compelling evidence of their ability to induce a pronounced pro-inflammatory response. The observed upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in mice injected with act-EVs, compared to the control group receiving plasma-EVs, underscores the systemic and rapid effects of these vesicles. The preferential accumulation of act-EVs in the spleen and liver aligns with the known tropism of EVs in vivo. The increased presence of DCs, monocytes, NK cells and neutrophils in the spleen following the injection of act-EVs suggests a robust immune response. This heightened activity could be due to various pathways triggered by the cargo molecules within act-EVs or through activation signals to APCs. The possible pathways include CD40-CD40L interactions, RNA-binding proteins, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-12, and IL-15, all of which are known to promote immune cell recruitment and activation. Although these mechanisms appear to be driving the observed immune response, the exact pathways have not yet been fully elucidated. Similar polarisation in vivo profile is also observed with other immune stimulants such as Lactoferrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Siqueiros-Cendon et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, with the tendency of EVs to enrich in tumours upon systemic administration, act-EVs may play a key role in driving anti-tumour immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gupta et al., 2023</xref>). Overall, the observed enrichment of DCs, monocytes, NK cells and neutrophils in the spleen along with elevated levels of GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-12p70 and IL-1α levels indicates a complex interplay of immunomodulatory signals and antigen-driven responses orchestrated by act-EVs in vivo. This study not only reinforces the role of TH cell-derived EVs in shaping immune responses but also highlights their potential as modulators of inflammation in physiological settings, providing valuable insights for therapeutic interventions targeting immune-related disorders.</p><p id="P45">In conclusion, we report activated TH EVs can potentially trigger activation of pro-inflammatory response cascades in APCs. Pro-inflammatory responses are a critical element in the progression of several pathologies, including autoimmune diseases. We propose that exploring the EV signalling axis offers a novel approach for characterizing autoimmune diseases, as our findings show EVs deliver cargos to APCs, potentially initiating disease progression. Further, investigating EVs from other T cell subtypes could also improve prognosis in challenging conditions like chronic infections and cancers. The approach described here provides a guideline to perform robust exploratory studies within each cell type and holds a lot of potential in understanding the role of EVs in triggering a plethora of cellular responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary File 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS199530-supplement-Supplementary_File_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d83aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary File 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS199530-supplement-Supplementary_File_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d83aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary File 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS199530-supplement-Supplementary_File_3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d83aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary File 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS199530-supplement-Supplementary_File_4.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d83aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary File 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS199530-supplement-Supplementary_File_5.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d83aAcEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS199530-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d83aAcEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S30"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors grateful to Dr. Errin Johnson from Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, the University of Oxford, for her help with Electron Microscopy.
