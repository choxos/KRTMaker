Streptococci are common in animal microbiota and include opportunistic pathogens like Group A Streptococcus (GAS) and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (pneumococcus). While the conserved streptococcal S protein has been identified as a key factor in GAS virulence, its exact function is unclear. Here, we show that the pneumococcal S protein is crucial for resisting against host-derived antimicrobials by coordinating cell wall modification and repair. Specifically, we show that S proteins are septally localized through their transmembrane domain and contain an extracellular peptidoglycan (PG) binding LysM domain which is required for its function. Protein-protein and genetic interaction studies demonstrate that the pneumococcal S protein directly interacts with a PG synthase, class A penicillin binding protein PBP1a, and the PG deacetylase PgdA. Single-molecule experiments reveal that the fraction of circumferentially moving PBP1a molecules is reduced in the absence of S protein. Consistent with an impaired PBP1a function, streptococci lacking S protein exhibit increased susceptibility to cell wall targeting antibiotics and altered cell morphologies. PG analysis showed reduced N-deacetylation of glycans in the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> S protein mutant, indicating reduced PgdA activity. We show that pneumococci lacking the S protein cannot persist transient penicillin treatment, are more susceptible to the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 and to lysozyme, and show decreased virulence in zebrafish and mice. Our data support a model in which S proteins regulate PBP1a activity and play a key role in coordinating PG repair and modification. This cell wall ‘sentinel’ control system provides defense against host-derived and environmental antimicrobial attack.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Streptococci are Gram-positive bacteria with a spherical or ovoid shape, often found as commensals in animals and humans. Notable species include <italic>S. salivarius</italic>, part of the human salivary microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, and <italic>S. thermophilus</italic>, used in cheese production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. While typically harmless, some streptococci, such as <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> (group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, GAS) and <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> (group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, GBS), can cause serious diseases. GAS is responsible for approximately 700 million non-invasive infections each year (e.g., strep throat)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> and over 150,000 deaths from invasive conditions like necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. GBS significantly increases the chances of neonatal death by causing intra-amniotic and peripartum infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Another globally important human pathogen, <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> causes nearly 100 million cases of lower respiratory infections and over half a million deaths each year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Streptococci utilize a variety of cell wall polysaccharides to adhere to their host and evade the immune system, enabling them to thrive as both commensals and pathogens. For instance, GAS and GBS possess unique rhamnose-glucose polysaccharides covalently attached to the cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) that play important roles in virulence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Pneumococci employ PG-attached wall teichoic acids and exopolysaccharide capsules to avoid opsonization by immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In addition to these polysaccharides, species-specific surface proteins bound to PG, such as CbpA in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, which interacts with human factor H<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and the GAS M protein, which recruits specific human proteins to resist immune clearance, are key to host adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. These diverse cell surface components allow streptococci to adapt to various niches and lifestyles.</p><p id="P4">In addition to species-specific adaptations, all streptococcal genomes contain the <italic>ess</italic> gene, which encodes a highly conserved surface-exposed protein known as the S protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The S protein is a critical determinant of immune evasion in GAS and GBS, with <italic>ess</italic> mutants exhibiting various phenotypes, including reduced binding to red blood cells and attenuated virulence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. For instance, the GAS S protein is believed to use red blood cells as a form of immune camouflage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In GBS, absence of <italic>ess</italic> results in altered cell-surface properties and reduced levels of exopolysaccharides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Despite these pleiotropic phenotypes on both the bacteria and host, the precise function of the streptococcal S protein has been unclear. Here, we show that the pneumococcal S protein (also known as SPV1429, SPD1429, SPR1457, or SP1604) is a central component of a PG repair and modification complex, including PBP1a and PgdA, which is necessary for protection against host innate defenses.</p><p id="P5"><italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> PBP1a is a class A penicillin binding protein (aPBP) involved in cell elongation, cell division and PG repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. aPBPs are bifunctional enzymes that catalyze PG glycosyltransferase and transpeptidation, with PBP1a primarily localizing to the midcell region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. While PBP1a was initially found to be associated with the elongasome—a PG biosynthetic complex responsible for cell elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>—PBP1a may also play a significant role in PG repair, although the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the different roles of PBP1a in PG fortification and repair are not well understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Recent work in <italic>E. coli</italic> has similarly suggested that aPBPs are crucial for repairing the PG upon cell wall damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. PgdA is an N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase that modifies glycan strands in PG by removing acetyl residues from GlcNAc residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, thereby enhancing the bacterial cell wall’s resistance to lysozyme, an important component of the human innate immune system on mucosal surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. A <italic>pgdA</italic> mutant showed reduced virulence in a murine intraperitoneal infection model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Although the <italic>pbp1a</italic> and <italic>pgdA</italic> genes are not essential for <italic>in vitro</italic> growth, homologs of PBP1a and PgdA are found in all streptococci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>), highlighting their importance in helping these bacteria resist and evade lysozyme and other host immune defenses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Using a combination of genetic, biochemical, cell biological, single-molecule, growth, and infection experiments, we demonstrate that the pneumococcal S protein colocalizes with PBP1a and PgdA. This triad plays a key role in defending against host-derived antimicrobials such as lysozyme and the cationic human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, LL-37. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that S proteins, along with their structural and functional homologues, are present not only in streptococci but in other Gram-positive bacteria such as <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). We propose a model in which S proteins regulate the activity of PBP1a, and thereby PgdA, facilitating the repair of host-induced cell wall damage and timely deacetylation of newly synthesized PG, preventing lethal cell wall hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Conserved midcell localization of the S protein</title><p id="P7">Phylogenetic analysis of the pneumococcal S protein (encoded by <italic>spv_1429</italic>) among streptococci showed a clear separation between S proteins from the mitis group and viridans streptococci, with <italic>S. salivarius</italic> having the most divergent sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Nevertheless, the gene neighborhood of <italic>ess</italic> is highly conserved in all streptococci, flanked by the conserved genes <italic>cmk</italic> and <italic>fer</italic> encoding cytidylate kinase and ferredoxin, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). An Alphafold model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> of the pneumococcal S protein predicts a cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an extracellular lysin motif domain (LysM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). LysM domains are typically involved in PG-binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, suggesting a role of the S protein in cell wall biology. To explore this, we fused the S proteins from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>S. salivarius</italic> with green fluorescent proteins (GFP or mNeonGreen) at their N-termini. Both fusions localized to the midcell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1D, 1F</xref>), reminiscent of proteins involved in division and PG synthesis. For higher resolution S protein localization, we fabricated micropillars for vertical imaging of immobilized cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) of vertical <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> GFP-S cells in micropillars revealed ring-like structures at the cell center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Further analysis with GFP or mNeonGreen fusions to various S protein truncations showed that the LysM domain was not essential for midcell localization, but the TM domain was crucial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>). Thus, the S protein exhibits conserved midcell localization in streptococci, dependent on its TM domain.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The S protein is part of a protein complex including PBP1a and PgdA</title><p id="P8">To identify potential interaction partners of the pneumococcal S protein, we used the full-length S protein tagged at its N-terminus with GFP for immunoprecipitation using GFP nanobodies, followed by mass spectrometry. This approach revealed several proteins involved in cell wall biology, with PBP1a and PgdA being notably enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). To confirm these interactions, we constructed split-luciferase fusions of the S protein tagged with the large moiety of luciferase (LgBit) at either its N- or C-terminus. Correspondingly, several proteins, including PBP1a and PgdA, were tagged with the small moiety of luciferase (SmBit) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>. When these moieties are in close proximity, they form a functional luciferase that emits light in the presence of a substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). We then grew double-tagged strains in microtiter plates with luciferase substrate and measured growth and bioluminescence. The results showed strong and reproducible interaction signals between N-terminally tagged S protein and N-terminally tagged PBP1a and PgdA, as well as between C-terminally tagged S protein and C-terminally tagged PBP1a and PgdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The split-luc interaction signal was either absent or not as strong for other potential partners identified by the pull-down experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>), therefore in this study, we focused on the functional relationship of S protein with PBP1a and PgdA.</p><p id="P9">To further substantiate the interaction between the S protein, PBP1a, and PgdA, we constructed strains where the S protein was tagged with the red fluorescent mScarlet-I protein, and either PBP1a or PgdA was tagged with a monomeric super folder green fluorescent protein (GFP). While PBP1a midcell localization is well-established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, the localization of PgdA was previously uncharacterized. Our fluorescence microscopy analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-F</xref>) revealed clear co-localization of the S protein with PBP1a and PgdA, with all three forming midcell rings. Furthermore, a cell cycle analysis of over 1,000 cells in exponential growth showed that the timing of midcell recruitment was identical for the three proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D,F</xref>). These findings support that the S protein directly interacts with PBP1a and PgdA, sharing membrane topology and co-localizing both spatially and temporally.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The S protein is important for correct cell shape and tolerance to cell wall targeting antibiotics</title><p id="P10">Structural predictions and protein association studies show that the S protein is part of a complex minimally involving PBP1a and PgdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). This suggests that the S protein, besides being a key virulence factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, also plays a role in cell wall biology, since PBP1a is a PG synthase and PgdA a PG-modifying enzyme. To test this hypothesis, we created a Δ<italic>ess</italic> mutant in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (Δ<italic>ess<sup>Sp</sup></italic>) and examined growth, morphology and susceptibility to cell wall-targeting antibiotics. Cells were grown in microtiter plates in C+Y medium at 37°C (no added CO<sub>2</sub>), with optical density measured every 10 min. While the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> Δ<italic>ess<sup>Sp</sup></italic> mutant showed similar growth to the wild type or a complemented mutant, increased lysis was observed in the late stationary phage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Most of this lysis was caused by the major autolysin LytA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, as shown by partial rescue in a <italic>lytA</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>). Phase contrast and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that Δ<italic>ess<sup>Sp</sup></italic> cells, overall, were slightly longer than wild type or complemented cells during the mid-exponential phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-D</xref>). However, throughout different growth phases, various morphological defects such as minicells, elongated cells, and chaining were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). The Δ<italic>ess<sup>Sp</sup></italic> mutant also exhibited increased susceptibility to sub-MIC levels of beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefotaxime (CTX), piperacillin, and ceftriaxone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>), but not to the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>). Single cell analysis of CTX-treated cells showed significantly increased cell length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F-G</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Interestingly, a truncated version of <italic>ess</italic> lacking the LysM domain also showed increased susceptibility to CTX, indicating that the LysM domain is required for S protein function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The capsule is known to mask phenotypic effects of mutants involved in cell wall biology in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. To further explore this, we generated Δ<italic>ess<sup>Sp</sup></italic> mutants in a Δ<italic>cps</italic> genetic background. In this capsule-deficient context, the phenotypes of the Δ<italic>ess<sup>Sp</sup></italic> mutants were exacerbated, displaying a variety of cell morphologies, including large, elongated cells and malformed minicells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6A</xref>). These results suggest that streptococcal S proteins play a role in maintaining cell wall homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Genetic interaction analyses place the S protein as an integral partner of a cell wall repair and modification complex</title><p id="P13">To gain further insights into the function of the pneumococcal S protein, we performed a genome-wide synthetic lethal screen using CRISPRi-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> in the Δ<italic>ess<sup>Sp</sup></italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). We assessed the fitness of every gene in the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> D39V wild type genome and the Δ<italic>ess<sup>Sp</sup></italic> mutant background by growing the CRISPRi libraries with and without IPTG to induce dCas9. The resulting fitness scores for each gene/operon were compared between the wild type and Δ<italic>ess<sup>Sp</sup></italic> strains. This screen suggested that the S protein is involved in processes such as division, elongation, and cell wall biosynthesis, since genes known to be involved in these processes, such as <italic>murE</italic>, <italic>divIB</italic>, <italic>rodZ</italic>, and <italic>mreD</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> became more essential in the absence of <italic>ess<sup>Sp</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). Further investigations confirmed that an <italic>ess</italic>/<italic>rodZ</italic> double mutant could not be constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). In line with previous findings that a Δ<italic>pbp1a</italic> deletion suppresses the requirement for RodZ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of a single <italic>rodZ</italic> mutant revealed a suppressor mutation in <italic>pbp1a</italic> (Y191C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Notably, the deletion of <italic>pbp1a</italic> also alleviates the requirements of the otherwise essential muramidase MpgA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">Since the pneumococcal S protein directly interacts with PBP1a and PgdA, and MpgA and RodZ are known to demonstrate midcell localization patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, we investigated whether the S protein also interacts with RodZ and MpgA using our split-luc assay. Alphafold predictions indicated that both RodZ and MpgA share similar membrane topologies with the S protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A</xref>). Our results showed that both N-terminally tagged and C-terminally tagged S proteins interacted with likewise tagged RodZ and MpgA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The results presented so far demonstrate that the S protein is part of a midcell localized complex that includes PBP1a, PgdA, RodZ, and MpgA. To explore genetic interactions within this network, we systematically generated knockout strains and combinations of deletion mutants, followed by WGS of the resulting strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6-S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S3</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, this complex appears to be closely interconnected, as certain mutants and combinations could only be constructed when suppressor mutations arose in one of these five genes. For instance, a <italic>rodZ</italic>/<italic>pgdA</italic> double deletion mutant could not be readily obtained.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, the global PG profile of the Δ<italic>ess<sup>Sp</sup></italic> mutant was largely similar to the wild type.

In summary, these results so far suggest that the phenotypes displayed in the Δ<italic>ess<sup>Sp</sup></italic> mutant are partly due to disrupted activities of both pbp1a and PgdA, leading to increased susceptibility to autolysis, cell wall-targeting antibiotics, and lysozyme. Beside lysozyme, mammalian hosts produce antimicrobial peptides such as LL-37 (cathelicidin), a cationic peptide. Cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) are produced by epithelial cells and immune cells as part of the innate immune response to pathogens.

Here, we show that the S protein is an integral component of a cell wall repair complex comprising PBP1a, PgdA, and possibly MpgA and RodZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S12</xref>). Our data support a model in which cell envelope damage—caused by antibiotics or host-derived antimicrobials such as lysozyme—is repaired by PBP1a and modified (through deacetylation) by PgdA to prevent further damage. In this scenario, fast-diffusing PBP1a molecules pause to repair damaged PG, while circumferentially moving PBP1a complexes are involved in PG fortification and possibly repair. The serine/threonine kinase StkP and adaptor protein GpsB are likely also involved in sensing this damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. At the damaged site, the S protein activates PBP1a to produce nascent PG, which PgdA then further matures by deacetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). This coordination of PBP1a and PgdA activity ensures timely PG restoration. The exact roles of MpgA and RodZ remain unclear, but they may help in releasing the PBP1a/PgdA complex from repaired sites, allowing it to address additional damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). In the absence of the S protein, the PBP1a/PgdA complex localizes to the damaged site but is not activated, and thus remains stuck and cannot efficiently repair and modify subsequent cell wall damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>).

Future research should explore whether these S-like proteins also function together with PBP1a in non-streptococcal Gram-positive bacteria and investigate the hypothesis that the LysM domain of S proteins recognizes damaged PG, conveys this information to PBP1a, and what roles GpsB and StkP play in this regulation. It is noteworthy that the Alphafold prediction of the pneumococcal S protein shows large conformational changes when modeled in complex with PBP1a, suggesting that this flexibility might play a role in the mechanism for activating or coordinating PBP1a activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>).

The plugin HyperstackReg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup> was used to account for drift of cells during imaging, using rigid-body registration on the DIC channel. Movement pattern analysis determined the relative frequency of molecules moving diffusively, circumferentially, or static (non-moving). For each field, each cell was visualized throughout the full 180 sec of imaging, and HaloTag-PBP1a molecules were identified as having an approximate diameter of 3-6 pixels and a signal intensity greater than ≈1.2-fold above background. Only fields with &gt;80% of cells having 0 or 1 HaloTag molecules were analyzed. Partially visible cells on the edge of a field were excluded from analysis. Circumferential molecules were defined as moving in one direction for ≥6 consecutive frames, with a linear velocity ≥5 nm/s as determined by kymograph analysis (see below). Static molecules were defined as motionless for ≥6 consecutive frames, or moving with a linear velocity &lt;5 nm/s as determined by kymograph analysis. Diffusive molecules were defined as particles that moved, but not in a consistent direction for ≥6 frames (non-consecutive) within a period of 90 sec. A cell can have molecules displaying all 3 motion types, but no more than 1 molecule of each type can be scored per cell (for example, if 2 circumferential and 1 diffusive molecules are seen in a cell, only 1 circumferential and 1 diffusive molecule would be scored). Molecules were determined to be either within an area of the cell where PG synthesis occurs (midcell) or not (non-midcell).

The reaction was stopped by heating the sample for 10 min at 100°C. The sample was cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g. For reduction, 1 sample volume of 500 mM sodium borate pH 9.0 and a few crystals of NaBH<sub>4</sub> were added, followed by 30 min of incubation at 20°C.

HPLC was performed with a column temperature of 55°C using a linear 135-min gradient from 100% buffer A (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.0 and 20 μM NaN<sub>3</sub>) to 100% buffer B (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.0 and 30% methanol) (Fisher Scientific, Loμghboroμgh, UK). Muropeptide fractions were detected at 205 nm. The muropeptides were quantified by integration of their peak area using Laura 4 software (LabLogic, Sheffield, UK). The total peak area from all fractions, excluding the salt fractions (eluting before 8 min), was normalized to 100%, and the relative area of each fraction was determined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S52"><title>Lysozyme and LL-37 susceptibility assay</title><p id="P63">To test the sensibility of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains to lysozyme and LL-37, frozen cells were first grown in C+Y medium (pH = 6.8) at 37°C until mid-exponential growth phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2-0.3).

(<bold>C</bold>) Paused diffusing and circumferentially moving PBP1a/PgdA/S protein complexes repair and modify PG after host-derived cell wall damage. At the site of damage, the S protein activates PBP1a and nascent PG is produced which is then the substrate of deacetylation by PgdA, rendering the newly repaired cell wall resistant to incoming host challenges. StkP and GpsB might also play a role in this regulation, as they interact with the intracellular moiety of S protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). After repair, the complex is now competent to move to other sites requiring cell wall repair, while in absence of the S protein, the complex remains stuck.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS200007-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
