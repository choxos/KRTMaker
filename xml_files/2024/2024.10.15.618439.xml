Limitations in current experimental models have hindered our knowledge of the disease. We developed a 3D blood-brain barrier (BBB) model with enhanced barrier properties using primary brain endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes. Exposure to parasite egress products increased microvascular permeability, likely due to transcriptional downregulation of junctional and vascular development genes in endothelial cells. In addition, it increased the expression of ferroptosis markers, antigen presentation and type I interferon genes and upregulated the JAK-STAT pathway across all BBB cell types. Incubation with cytoadherent schizont-stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocytes induced a similar, but highly localized transcriptional shift, along with inter-endothelial gaps at sites of parasite egress, significantly increasing permeability. The co-administration of egress products with the JAK-STAT inhibitor Ruxolitinib prevented junctional disruption and BBB breakdown. These findings provide key insights into the parasite-mediated mechanisms driving brain microvascular pathogenesis in cerebral malaria and suggest potential avenues for adjunctive therapies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3"><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infections account for the majority of the 600,000 annual malaria deaths worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, with cerebral malaria (CM) being one of the deadliest complications. Histological examination of post-mortem brain samples from CM patients has identified the sequestration of <italic>P. falciparum-</italic>infected red blood cells (iRBC) in the brain microvasculature as a key disease hallmark, often accompanied by vascular pathology and endothelial dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that fatal brain swelling in pediatric CM patients likely results from blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, disrupting the selective transport of fluids and molecules from blood vessels to the brain parenchyma and leading to vasogenic edema<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Even with treatments that rapidly clear parasites from blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, CM still has a 15-20% mortality rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and half of the survivors suffer from long-term neurological and behavioral sequelae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. A better mechanistic understanding of how <italic>P. falciparum</italic> disrupts the BBB is crucial for developing adjunctive host-targeted treatments that could prevent deaths and long-term disabilities.</p><p id="P4">Two key parasite-induced disruptive mechanisms have been proposed. The first involves parasite binding to endothelial receptors endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and blockade of EPCR homeostatic functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. This pathogenic mechanism is exclusive to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and does not occur in other malaria species, including rodent malaria models. The second mechanism suggests that parasites egressing from iRBC release endothelial-disruptive products, such as heme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, hemozoin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, parasite histones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, or glycophosphatidyl inositol (GPI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Previous studies on these two mechanisms have been conducted using <italic>in vitro</italic> endothelial-only cultures with reduced barrier properties. Nevertheless, the BBB is a multicellular interface whose properties arise from the physical and cellular cross-talk between endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes.</p><p id="P5">Furthermore, mechanical cues from blood flow and the extracellular matrix enhance its barrier function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Here, we have developed a bioengineered microvascular model that incorporates all these components, resulting in improved barrier properties. The use of this model has revealed that parasite products released during egress are responsible for an increase in vascular permeability, likely as a consequence of downregulation of endothelial junctional and vascular development pathways. We further demonstrated that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> egress products elicit the activation of inflammatory, including JAK-STAT, and antigen presentation pathways in all the cells that compose the BBB. When experiments were performed with cytoadhesive <italic>P. falciparum-</italic>iRBC, the disruptive effects were locally confined to regions of high sequestration and parasite egress. Yet, they still led to an increase in BBB permeability. Ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of the JAK-STAT pathway, prevented <italic>P. falciparum-</italic>induced barrier leakage, highlighting a link between inflammatory and vascular disruptive pathways.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Primary brain astrocytes and pericytes improve endothelial barrier function</title><p id="P6">To determine the barrier disruptive pathways of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in the brain microvasculature, we developed a bioengineered 3D-BBB model. The microvascular model was fabricated in a type I collagen hydrogel, pre-patterned by a combination of soft lithography and injection molding that generates a microfluidic 13 x 13 grid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Commercial primary human astrocytes and brain vascular pericytes were seeded in the bulk collagen solution, and primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells were seeded under gravity-driven flow into the microfluidic network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The identity of the three cell types was confirmed by the expression of specific markers including platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1), von Willebrand factor (vWF), vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and β-catenin for endothelial cells, platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) and nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2) for pericytes and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100B and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) for astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Fig. 1a</xref>). After two days in culture, endothelial cells line the perfusable microvessels and are surrounded by a second layer of astrocytes and pericytes that sparsely contact the endothelium, resembling the 3D organization and architecture of the <italic>in vivo</italic> BBB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Generally, pericytes and astrocytes ensheath the abluminal side of microvessels, and collagen-residing astrocytes occasionally extend their end-feet towards endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Quantitative RT-PCR measurements comparing two different astrocyte-to-pericyte ratios revealed that co-culture with astrocytes and pericytes at a 7:3 ratio increased the expression of endothelial BBB-specific markers over time, including tight junction markers (<italic>OCLN, CLDN5</italic>), BBB-transporters (<italic>LRP1, SLC</italic> family) and efflux pumps (<italic>PGP, ABC</italic> family), peaking after 7 days in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Fig. 1b</xref>). Notably, the increased expression of BBB markers was associated with an improvement in microvascular barrier properties. The 3D-BBB model containing pericytes and astrocytes showed a significant decrease in permeability to 70 kDa FITC-dextran (2.15x10<sup>-6</sup> cm/s – Interquartile range (IQR) = 0.30, 6.37), compared to an endothelial-only model (8.31x10<sup>-6</sup> cm/s – IQR = 3.98, 12.40) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Fig. 1c</xref>). Thus, the enhanced permeability properties of our bioengineered 3D-BBB model provide a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms of vascular barrier disruption induced by <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title><italic>P. falciparum</italic>-iRBC products released during egress downregulate endothelial junction expression and increase microvascular permeability</title><p id="P7">The egress of <italic>P. falciparum-</italic>iRBC has long been recognized as an endothelial disruptive event<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. However, previous studies were done in models with a weaker vascular barrier and did not include astrocytes or pericytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We first explored how parasite egress products contribute to malaria pathogenesis within our newly engineered 3D-BBB model. To this end, we generated a solution containing <italic>P. falciparum</italic> products released upon the egress of 5x10<sup>7</sup> tightly synchronized iRBC/mL (hereafter referred to as iRBC-egress media)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Fig. 2a</xref>). We estimate that this concentration of products is equivalent to 5x10<sup>4</sup> parasites/μL, levels often found in CM patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. 3D-BBB microvessels were incubated with iRBC-egress media for 24 hours and subjected to a multimodal analysis. This included single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on dissociated microvessels, electron and confocal microscopy on fixed microvessels, as well as live permeability measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>). As a control, we perfused the supernatant of an uninfected erythrocyte (uRBC) control processed in the same way as the infected counterpart.</p><p id="P8">The 3D-BBB microvessels were disassembled and dissociated into a single-cell suspension, followed by sample-multiplexing using the MULTI-seq protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> to pool infected and control conditions for scRNA-seq. The 6454 quality-controlled cells in the resulting scRNA-seq dataset were visualized using a uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm, revealing 7 distinct clusters after unsupervised clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Cell type annotation showed the presence of two clusters with high expression of endothelial markers (cluster 1 and 2: <italic>CDH5, VWF</italic> and <italic>PECAM1</italic>), 4 clusters expressing pericyte markers (clusters 4 and 6: high expression of <italic>PDGFRB</italic>, and clusters 3 and 5: moderate <italic>PDGFRB</italic>) and a cluster expressing astrocytic markers (cluster 7: <italic>S100B</italic> and <italic>GFAP)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b,c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). A shift in the transcriptional profile of the three cell types was observed upon exposure to iRBC-egress media, with endothelial cells splitting into a separate cluster from the control population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis on endothelial cells revealed that iRBC-egress media caused a significant decrease in the expression of multiple genes encoding proteins that are critical for BBB integrity, including the tight junction genes <italic>CLDN5</italic> (Claudin-5) and <italic>TJP1</italic> (ZO-1) and the adherens junction transcript <italic>CDH5</italic> (VE-cadherin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information Table 1</xref>). Gene ontology term (GO-term) over-representation analysis indicated that most downregulated transcripts in endothelial cells are associated with endothelial cell junctions and adhesion, cytoskeleton organization, blood vessel development, DNA repair and chromatin organization and Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information Table 2</xref>). We employed the <italic>CellChat</italic> package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> to analyze differential ligand-receptor interactions among the three cell types present in the model after exposure to iRBC-egress media. The analysis showed a decrease in vascular signaling interactions (<italic>VWF, EDN1</italic>), as well as in important pathways for endothelial-pericyte homeostasis, including signaling of angiopoietin-1 (<italic>ANGPT1</italic>), PDGF-BB (<italic>PDGFB)</italic>, and CSPG4 (<italic>NG2</italic>). Additionally, iRBC-egress media caused a decrease in key endothelial-pericyte-astrocyte signaling molecules, including the Notch pathway (<italic>DLL4, JAG1/2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). Overall, exposure to iRBC-egress media led to the downregulation of transcripts associated with endothelial integrity and impaired major signaling pathways among all cell types present in the model.</p><p id="P9">To test whether these transcriptional changes resulted in an impairment of 3D microvascular integrity, we first quantified the number of inter-endothelial gaps, as well as the percentage of junctional length covered by electron-dense tight junctions by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Parasite egress products were visible by TEM and appeared as fuzzy aggregates containing parasite organelles and hemozoin, as well as parasitophorous and iRBC membranes with knobs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). Although we observed a significantly higher percentage of ultrastructural gaps in 3D-BBB microvessels exposed to iRBC-egress media, we did not observe any significant differences in the length of tight junctions in regions of cell-cell contact that remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>). Changes in junction morphology were also observed by confocal microscopy. Specifically, VE-cadherin labelling revealed an altered adherens junction pattern compared to the control condition, with thin junctional staining and the formation of large inter-endothelial gaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2j</xref>). The transcriptional and morphological changes observed were accompanied by functional changes in vascular barrier. Baseline microvascular permeability was measured by 70 kDa FITC-dextran perfusion on day 6 of 3D-BBB microvessel formation, followed by a second measurement in the same regions of interest 24 hours after addition of iRBC-egress or control media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2k</xref>). After 24 hours, 3D-BBB microvessels treated with iRBC-egress media presented a significant 6.5-fold increase in microvascular permeability ratio (11.07 – IQR = 2.60, 32.56) compared to controls (1.68 – IQR = 0.87, 4.28) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2l</xref>). Notably, no significant differences in microvascular permeability ratio were observed between the two HBMEC donors used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Fig. 2c</xref>), nor in 3D-BBB microvessels incubated with uRBC media control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2d</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>P. falciparum-</italic>iRBC products decrease the expression of tight and adherens junction markers, changing the morphology of inter-endothelial junctions, together with a functional impairment of vascular barrier integrity.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>P. falciparum</italic> egress products induce a global activation of inflammatory, JAK-STAT, antigen presentation and ferroptosis-associated pathways in the 3D-BBB model</title><p id="P10">Studies in <italic>P. berghei</italic> rodent CM models have shown the ability of endothelial cells to cross-present parasite antigens present in merozoites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Our analysis revealed that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> could induce a similar behavior in all the cells that compose our bioengineered BBB model. Specifically, exposure of 3D-BBB microvessels to iRBC-egress media caused the upregulation of multiple genes associated with inflammatory and antigen presentation pathways in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The same upregulated transcripts were identified in pericytes and astrocytes, suggesting that iRBC-egress media has the potential to cross the endothelial barrier. We found an upregulation of transcripts involved in type I interferon (IFN) response and anti-viral pathways, including genes of the IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) gene family (e.g. <italic>IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3)</italic>, IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (e.g. <italic>ISG15, ISG20</italic>), and other IFN-inducible genes (e.g. <italic>MX1, IFI6, IFI27, OAS1)</italic>, as well as ferroptosis genes <italic>(</italic>e.g. <italic>HMOX1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Furthermore, transcripts upregulated by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> egress products include members of the JAK-STAT family of signal transducers (<italic>STAT1, STAT2, JAK2</italic>), a signaling pathway that induces the expression of ISGs, and some of their interacting proteins (<italic>IRF1, IRF9</italic>). GO-term over-representation analysis on the significantly upregulated transcripts confirmed a global increase in expression of transcripts associated with cytokine-, viral-, and type I IFN response, as well as antigen presentation, NFκB signaling, and protein catabolism in all cell types that compose the BBB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information Table 2</xref>). Cell type-specific processes that were significantly upregulated include apoptosis and autophagy in endothelial cells and astrocytes, ER stress and Golgi/vesicle transport in endothelial cells and regulation of cell migration in pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information Table 2</xref>). <italic>CellChat</italic> analysis on upregulated transcripts revealed an increase in the expression of inflammatory ligand-receptor pairs following exposure to iRBC-egress media. Pericytes and astrocytes showed an increased expression of collagen encoding genes, suggestive of a fibrotic, scar-forming phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig 3</xref>). Additionally, all three cell types showed elevated expression of midkine (<italic>MDK</italic>), a chemoattractant for the recruitment of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">Antigen presentation appeared to be an important inflammation-related process that was strongly elevated in all cell types that compose the 3D-BBB model. Notably, we found evidence of cellular uptake of parasite material by TEM. Endothelial cells in the 3D-BBB microvessels incubated with iRBC-egress media showed signs of activation, including the formation of membrane protrusions, large vacuoles containing iRBC membranes or hemozoin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figure 4a</xref>), indicating the activation of parasite uptake. Immunofluorescent staining shows colocalization of parasite nucleic acids with lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>), suggesting the delivery of parasite material to the lysosomal compartment of endothelial cells. We therefore defined transcriptomic gene signatures for antigen presentation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>), either for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I transcripts or MHC class II transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Endothelial cells and astrocytes exhibited a robust upregulation of the MHC class I gene signature (effect size r &gt; 0.5, p&lt;0.0001), while only a modest upregulation was observed in pericytes (effect size r = 0.2, p&lt;0.0001). Interestingly, the MHC class II antigen presentation gene signature, associated with CD4 T-cell recruitment, was also strongly upregulated in endothelial cells (effect size r = 0.4, p&lt;0.0001) and modestly upregulated in astrocytes (effect size r=0.2, p&lt;0.0001), with some astrocytes presenting particularly high MHC class II signature scores.</p><p id="P12">To gain deeper insights into other signaling pathways dysregulated upon exposure to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> egress products, we utilized PROGENy (Pathway RespOnsive GENes for activity inference)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, a computational method that infers signaling pathway activities based on downstream gene expression. Consistent with the GO-term analysis, we observed an increase in NFκB and TNFα signaling in endothelial cells and pericytes upon challenge with iRBC-egress media. Notably, the JAK-STAT pathway was activated across all cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>), a result consistent with the upregulation of transcripts associated with the type I IFN response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>, b). To validate this result, we performed immunofluorescent staining of STAT1 on cell monolayers and 3D-BBB microvessels. Increased STAT1 expression was observed in the 3D-BBB model upon 24-hour exposure to parasite egress products compared to the control condition, where the signal was barely detectable. In accordance with our scRNA-seq results, this increase occurred not only in endothelial cells, but also in the supporting pericytes and astrocytes present in the collagen hydrogel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>), indicating an overall response of the model to iRBC-egress media. STAT1 translocation to the nucleus was evaluated in 2D monolayers, as a proxy for increased pathway activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.

Specifically, the presence of inter-endothelial gaps was minimal in 3D-BBB microvessel regions exposed to high <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-iRBC cytoadhesion with low egress (i.e. where iRBC looked intact and free merozoite were barely present), with 5 (IQR = 4,6) gaps per field of view, compared to 27 (IQR = 19.5, 38) gaps in microvessels with high rate of schizont rupture, largely colocalizing with egressed merozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>).

To infer if this bimodality might be related to spatial proximity to regions of high <italic>P. falciparum-</italic>iRBC egress, we defined an endothelial population that contained <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gene counts above an estimated background-level threshold (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>), indicating uptake of parasite material by the respective endothelial cells.

Furthermore, a deeper analysis of the transcriptional alterations in this <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-RNA-high cell population revealed a remarkably similar transcriptional profile to the one of endothelial cells exposed to egress products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>). This included a strong downregulation of transcripts associated with actin cytoskeleton and cell motility, focal adhesions, RAS/RAP1 GTPase pathway, along with low expression of genes encoding for junctional and vascular development pathways. Although only a minor increase in antigen presentation and inflammation pathways was observed compared to iRBC-egress media, an equally strong upregulation of ferroptosis and vesicle transport genes was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>).

Briefly, microvessels were incubated for 24 hours with either iRBC-egress media or control cell culture media, in the presence or absence of 10 µM Ruxolitinib. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that Ruxolitinib prevented the increase in STAT-1 expression induced by <italic>P. falciparum-</italic>egress media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Furthermore, the presence of the drug preserved the junctional localization of the tight junction protein ZO-1 in microvessels exposed to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> egress products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). To determine whether these changes were associated with an improvement in 3D-BBB barrier function, microvascular permeability was assessed by 70 kDa FITC-dextran perfusion before and after treatment, as previously described. While treatment with Ruxolitinib modestly improved baseline permeability in control devices (0.66 – IQR = 0.26, 1.51), its impact was far more pronounced under pathological conditions. Co-incubation with iRBC-egress media led to an almost 24-fold reduction in microvascular permeability (0.45 – IQR = 0.10, 1.94) compared to the iRBC-egress media condition alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>).

Despite the severity of the disease, our understanding of how the malaria parasite affects the BBB remains limited, primarily due to difficulties in obtaining brain samples from affected patients or the lack of accurate disease models. In this study, we developed a bioengineered microvascular 3D-BBB model that incorporates primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes. The addition of these cell types increased the vascular barrier function of the model, improving upon other bioengineered models previously used to study <italic>P. falciparum</italic> pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

Perfusion and incubation either with media containing <italic>P. falciparum-</italic>egress products or with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> schizonts led to a global increase in microvascular permeability to 70 kDa FITC-dextran. However, differences in the extent of vascular barrier opening were found between these two conditions. While large VE-cadherin inter-endothelial gaps formed after incubation with iRBC-egress media, schizont sequestration only induced smaller gaps near areas of high merozoite egress. Similar differences in the extent and ubiquity of parasite-induced transcriptional shifts were found in our scRNA-seq analysis. We observed major and widespread alterations in endothelial gene expression after exposure to iRBC-egress media, and only minimal global differential expression after 6-hour incubation with trophozoites and schizonts. This analysis is in agreement with other bulk transcriptomics studies that showed limited endothelial transcriptional changes upon incubation with <italic>P. falciparum-</italic>iRBC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and more prominent changes after incubation with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lysates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the single cell resolution of our transcriptomic analysis revealed that endothelial cells near regions of egress, identified by high <italic>P. falciparum</italic> RNA content, presented a transcriptional signature similar to that of endothelial cells exposed to iRBC-egress media.

Recent studies have reported conflicting results on the transcriptional effect of cytoadherent <italic>P. falciparum-</italic>iRBC.

Of additional relevance is the decrease in expression of vascular developmental genes, as well as in transcripts from pathways related to cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization.
