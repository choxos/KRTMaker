The replisome-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP mitigates this threat by ubiquitylating the CMG helicase in mitosis, leading to disassembly of stalled replisomes, fork cleavage, and restoration of chromosome structure by alternative end-joining. Here, we show that replisome disassembly requires TRAIP phosphorylation by the mitotic Cyclin B-CDK1 kinase, as well as TTF2, a SWI/SNF ATPase previously implicated in the eviction of RNA polymerase from mitotic chromosomes. We find that TTF2 tethers TRAIP to replisomes using an N-terminal Zinc finger that binds to phosphorylated TRAIP and an adjacent TTF2 peptide that contacts the CMG-associated leading strand DNA polymerase ε. This TRAIP-TTF2-pol ε bridge, which forms independently of the TTF2 ATPase domain, is essential to promote CMG unloading and stalled fork breakage. Conversely, RNAPII eviction from mitotic chromosomes requires the ATPase activity of TTF2. We conclude that in mitosis, replisomes undergo a CDK- and TTF2-dependent structural reorganization that underlies the cellular response to incompletely replicated DNA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Replisomes encounter many obstacles that have the potential to severely disrupt DNA replication and genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). These include transcription complexes, as well as covalent DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) and DNA inter-strand cross-links (ICLs) that are generated by agents such as endogenous aldehydes and chemotherapeutics. Cells employ various strategies to overcome these challenges. If these strategies fail, cells enter mitosis with under-replicated DNA, triggering additional defense mechanisms to prevent chromosomal instability. These include unwinding (dissolution) or controlled breakage (resolution) of the unreplicated segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The latter pathway is referred to as common fragile site (CFS) expression and involves nucleolytic cleavage of the stalled forks and joining of the resulting broken chromosomes by alternative end-joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Although CFS expression results in a deletion and sister chromatid exchange, it avoids the potentially catastrophic consequences of chromosome non-disjunction.</p><p id="P4">The E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP has been linked to DNA repair in interphase and to the response to under-replicated DNA in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). TRAIP is essential for embryonic development and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), and hypomorphic mutations in TRAIP are associated with dwarfism in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Growing evidence suggests that TRAIP plays a central role in overcoming replication obstacles in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Cells lacking TRAIP are sensitive to agents that induce DNA inter-strand crosslinks (ICLs) and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs), and to conditions that promote replication-transcription collisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Indirect evidence suggests that TRAIP binds replisomes with its catalytic RING domain directed ahead of the CMG, allowing it to ubiquitylate “<italic>in trans</italic>” any protein barrier encountered by the replisome (e.g. DPCs), while being unable to ubiquitylate “<italic>in cis</italic>” the replisome with which it travels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S1A</xref>; “hood ornament”model)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). This block to <italic>cis</italic> ubiquitylation is crucial to avoid unscheduled CMG unloading, which would disrupt S-phase DNA replication and lead to permanent fork arrest and genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>)</p><p id="P5">TRAIP’s interaction with the replisome appears to be much less constrained in mitosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S1B</xref>). In support of this idea, when replisomes stall on either side of a lac repressor (LacR) array in mitotic egg extracts, TRAIP can now ubiquitylate the stalled CMGs with which it travels, leading to p97-dependent CMG unloading, fork breakage, and DNA polymerase θ (pol θ)-mediated alternative end-joining (TMEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Furthermore, when CMG unloading in S phase is prevented in cells by neutralizing CRL2<sup>Lrr1</sup>, CMGs are unloaded in mitosis by TRAIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Finally, when the completion of DNA replication is experimentally impaired, TRAIP promotes mitotic DNA synthesis, and it suppresses the formation of anaphase bridges and micronuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Together with other results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), these observations suggest that when forks fail to fully converge in S or G2, TRAIP-mediated symmetrical fork cleavage in mitosis restores one chromosome and regenerates the other via alternative end joining, with accompanying sister chromatid exchange and production of a deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). This model accounts for key aspects of common fragile site expression and the sequence features associated with common fragile site rearrangements in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The TRAIP-dependent unloading of replisomes in mitosis appears to be a last-ditch cellular response to avert anaphase with unreplicated DNA. How TRAIP changes specificity between interphase and mitosis is unclear.</p><p id="P6">The SWI/SNF ATPase TTF2 was previously shown to promote the eviction of RNAPII from mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Here, we report an unexpected role for TTF2 in activating the mitotic function of TRAIP. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we show that an N-terminal Zinc finger domain of TTF2 interacts with threonine 325 in TRAIP that has been phosphorylated by B-CDK1. In addition, a short TTF2 peptide that resides adjacent to the TTF2 zinc finger binds to the POLE2 subunit of DNA polymerase ε. These two TTF2 contacts tether TRAIP to the replisome to allow mitotic CMG ubiquitylation and unloading, fork breakage, and alternative end-joining. Surprisingly, the C-terminal ATPase domain of TTF2 is not required to promote TRAIP function. Conversely, in mammalian cells, the TTF2 ATPase domain is sufficient to promote RNAPII eviction in mitosis. Our results indicate that TTF2 uses distinct mechanisms to remove replication and transcription complexes from mitotic chromosomes, and that TTF2 is an essential factor in the TRAIP-dependent pathway that mitigates the threat of incomplete DNA replication.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Identification of CDK sites that promote mitotic TRAIP function</title><p id="P7">We hypothesized that mitotic TRAIP activation involves its phosphorylation by Cyclin B-CDK1 (B-CDK1). To test this idea, we used frog egg extracts because they faithfully recapitulate TRAIP’s interphase role in repairing DNA lesions and its mitotic role in replisome disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). TRAIP forms a dimer via its coiled-coil and leucine zipper domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>)(predictomes.org) and contains four potential B-CDK1 sites (S/TP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>; red residues). Among these, S295, T325 (T324 in human), and S352 (S348 in human) are conserved in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S2A</xref>). To address whether TRAIP is phosphorylated in egg extracts, we added TRAIP that was expressed in a transcription-translation extract (TTE) to TRAIP-depleted frog egg extracts that were also supplemented with B-CDK1, and separated the proteins on a Phos-tag gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, TRAIP underwent a large mobility shift in the presence of B-CDK1 (compare lanes 3 and 11). Mutating serine 352 to alanine increased the mobility of all forms of TRAIP in interphase and mitotic egg extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, lanes 6 and 14), indicating that this site is constitutively phosphorylated throughout the cell division cycle. Consistent with this interpretation, S352 corresponds to an ideal CDK phosphorylation site (SPTK) that could be phosphorylated by CDK2 in both extracts. In contrast, mutating S295 dramatically reduced TRAIP mobility in mitosis but not in interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, lanes 4 and 12), and mutating T325 caused a small mobility shift in mitotic but not interphase extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, lanes 3 and 5 vs. 11 and 13). To verify that S295 and T325 were phosphorylated, we generated phospho-specific antibodies to both residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, lanes 7-9) and showed that both residues were phosphorylated only in extracts supplemented with B-CDK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, lanes 2 vs. 7). Interestingly, mutating S295 abolished phosphorylation at both sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, lane 8), whereas mutating T325 greatly reduced but did not eliminate S295 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, lane 9). These results suggest that B-CDK1 phosphorylates both sites, and that S295 phosphorylation primes T325 phosphorylation whereas S295 can be phosphorylated in the absence of T325 phosphorylation, albeit inefficiently.</p><p id="P8">We next addressed the potential function of these phosphorylation events. We showed previously that when a plasmid containing a lac repressor array (LacR plasmid) is replicated in frog egg extract containing B-CDK1, replisomes stall at the outer edges of the array, generating a “θ” structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, lane 1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). TRAIP then promotes CMG ubiquitylation, which leads to replisome disassembly by the p97 ATPase, followed by fork breakage. The broken forks undergo pol θ-mediated end-joining to generate complex, aberrant replication products (ARPs) that are retained in the well of the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, lanes 2-5). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), immunodepletion of TRAIP from the extract inhibited ARP formation and enhanced appearance of supercoiled products, and re-addition of TRAIP<sup>WT</sup> rescued these defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, lanes 6-15; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S2B</xref>). In contrast, neither TRAIP<sup>S295A</sup> nor TRAIP<sup>T325A</sup> restored ARP formation, indicating that TRAIP phosphorylation at these sites is essential for its mitotic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, lanes 16-25; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S2B</xref>). Consistent with defective ARP formation, the unloading of stalled CMGs that is normally promoted by TRAIP<sup>WT</sup> in mitotic extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, lanes 10-12)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) was not supported by TRAIP<sup>S295A</sup> or TRAIP<sup>T325A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, lanes 13-18; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S2C</xref>). Accordingly, MCM7 ubiquitylation (measured in the presence of an inhibitor of p97 to prevent CMG unloading) was also greatly diminished in the presence of the phospho-site mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, lanes 6-8; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S2C</xref>), probably below the threshold normally required for CMG unloading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Mutating both S295 and T325 did not further reduce CMG ubiquitylation compared to the single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, lanes 7-9; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S2C</xref>), indicating that the two phosphorylation events control the same pathway. In contrast, TRAIP depletion reduced CMG ubiquitylation still further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>, lane 5), suggesting that a basal level of TRAIP-dependent CMG ubiquitylation still occurred in the absence of these phosphorylation events, perhaps due to some residual TRAIP binding to the replisome. However, this residual activity was not sufficient to support efficient CMG unloading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, lanes 13-21). Importantly, like TRAIP<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), both TRAIP<sup>S295A</sup> and TRAIP<sup>T325A</sup> supported the unloading of CMGs that have converged on an ICL in interphase egg extracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S3</xref>), indicating that these mutations only abolish the mitotic function of TRAIP. Our results indicate that phosphorylation of TRAIP on at least two sites by B-CDK1 is specifically required for TRAIP function in mitotic egg extracts.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>TTF2 is essential for mitotic TRAIP function</title><p id="P9">To identify new proteins that cooperate with TRAIP in mitosis and to explain how TRAIP is activated by B-CDK1, we screened for proteins that specifically associate with mitotic stalled replisomes. To this end, we replicated LacR plasmids in egg extract containing B-CDK1 and p97 inhibitor to accumulate mitotic replisomes, isolated chromatin, and performed mass spectrometry. As controls, we recovered chromatin from reactions lacking p97-i (mitosis with replisome removal) or B-CDK1 (interphase without replisome removal). This analysis revealed a handful of proteins that were only enriched on mitotic chromatin containing replisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, red box and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S4</xref>). TTF2, which contains a C-terminal SWI/SNF ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), was particularly interesting because it removes RNA polymerase II from mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), a process that is reminiscent of mitotic CMG eviction. Indeed, TTF2 is cytoplasmic during interphase and gains access to chromosomes after mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We raised a peptide antibody against Xenopus TTF2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5A</xref>) and found that the protein’s recruitment to chromatin was enhanced in mitotic extract, in a manner that partially depended on TRAIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Moreover, like TRAIP depletion, depletion of TTF2 from egg extract greatly reduced ARP formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, lanes 1-8; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5B</xref>), CMG unloading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>, lanes 3-8; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5B</xref>), and CMG ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, lanes 3-4; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5B</xref>), and these defects were rescued with recombinant wild type TTF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5B</xref>). Therefore, TTF2 is essential for TRAIP-dependent CMG unloading in mitosis.</p><p id="P11">We next addressed which domains of TTF2 promote CMG unloading. TTF2 contains an N-terminal Zinc finger domain (ZF; residues 1-94), an internal segment predicted to be largely disordered (residues 95-527), and a C-terminal ATPase domain (residues 528-1167) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). A point mutation predicted to inactivate the ATPase activity of TTF2 (K626A) supported normal ARP formation, CMG unloading, and CMG ubiquitylation, as did deletion of the entire ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5B</xref>). In contrast, deletion of the Zn finger domain inhibited these activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5B</xref>). We also noticed a conserved stretch of amino acids (120-125) located adjacent to the Zn finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>; blue box). We therefore generated TTF2<sup>1-200</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>; red bracket), which includes the Zn finger domain and adjacent motif, and found that this construct was sufficient to restore ARP formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5C</xref>). Therefore, the TTF2 Zn finger and adjacent motif, whose importance is documented below, are sufficient for mitotic TRAIP function, whereas, unexpectedly, the ATPase domain is dispensable.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Evidence that TTF2 interacts with phosphorylated T325 in TRAIP</title><p id="P12">To understand how TTF2 promotes CMG unloading, we used AlphaFold-Multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) to address whether TTF2 and TRAIP are predicted to interact. AF-M detected no confident interaction between the full-length proteins (predictomes.org). Because performing structure prediction with segments of proteins increases the likelihood of detecting interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), we divided TRAIP into individual domains and folded each one with TTF2<sup>1-200</sup>. In this analysis, TTF2<sup>1-200</sup> was predicted to interact with the C-terminal disordered region of TRAIP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>, rows 6 and 9), suggesting that the ZF contacts T325. This prediction became highly confident when the proteins were further trimmed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>, rows 10-11). Repeating the folding with a phosphorylated peptide in AlphaFold 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) predicted that TRAIP phospho-threonine 325 interacts with residues K16 and R20 in a positively charged pocket on TTF2’s Zn finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>, rows 12-13). Consistent with this interaction being important to promote TRAIP function, TTF2(1-200)<sup>K16A</sup> did not support ARP formation, CMG unloading, or CMG ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5D</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the Zn finger domain of TTF2 docks onto phosphorylated TRAIP. Further evidence for this interaction is shown below.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>TTF2 also interacts with DNA pol ε</title><p id="P13">The results described above document a phospho-regulated interaction between TTF2 and TRAIP, but they do not explain how this complex contributes to mitotic TRAIP function. To address this, we used a high throughput pipeline using AF-M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) to fold TTF2 with ~280 genome maintenance proteins including the 70 core DNA replication factors. Among the latter group, the most confidently predicted partner was the POLE2 subunit of DNA polymerase ε (pol ε)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>, rows 14-15; predictomes.org) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). AF-M predicted that the conserved motif adjacent to the Zn finger (residues 120-125), which is positively charged, docks into a negatively charged groove on the surface of POLE2 that is accessible in the human replisome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5F</xref>). Consistent with this prediction, DNA pol ε expressed in insect cells co-immunoprecipitated TTF2<sup>WT</sup> but not TTF2<sup>Δ120-125</sup>, which lacks the POLE2-interaction motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Importantly, TTF2(1-200)<sup>Δ120-125</sup> did not support ARP formation, CMG unloading, or CMG ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5D</xref>). Interestingly, TTF2(1-200)<sup>Δ120-125</sup> did not bind efficiently to chromatin, nor did TTF2(1-200)<sup>K16A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-D</xref>). We conclude that TTF2 must bind POLE2 to support TRAIP function. Moreover, if TTF2 cannot bind TRAIP, TTF2 replisome binding itself is reduced, suggesting that TRAIP and TTF2 bind replisomes cooperatively.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>A TRAIP-TTF2 chimera bypasses the requirement for S295 and T325 phosphorylation</title><p id="P14">To further test the model that B-CDK1 phosphorylation of TRAIP promotes the interaction of TRAIP and TTF2, we generated a fusion protein in which TTF2 residues 95-205, encompassing the POLE2 interaction motif, were inserted between residues 350 and 351 in TRAIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>; FUSION<sup>WT</sup>). This chimeric construct restored ARP formation, CMG unloading, and CMG ubiquitylation in extracts depleted of TRAIP and TTF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5E</xref>). Importantly, the chimera supported ARP formation even when residues S295 and T325 were mutated to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-D</xref>; FUSION<sup>2A</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S5E</xref>). Thus, when TTF2 and TRAIP were covalently linked, these CDK phosphorylation sites in TRAIP were not essential. This strongly supports the conclusion that the main function of T325 phosphorylation is to facilitate TRAIP’s interaction with TTF2. In contrast, when we also mutated the POLE2 interaction motif, the chimera failed to restore CMG unloading or ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, C-D</xref>; FUSION2<sup>2A-ΔPOLE2</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig.

To address this question, we modified the endogenous TTF2 locus in HCT116 colon cancer cells so that it encodes a dTAG-SMASH degron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig.

Consistent with previous siRNA results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), TTF2 degradation led to a failure of RNAPII eviction from mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig.

Full length TTF2 and a mutant lacking the entire N-terminus (including the ZF and adjacent POLE2 interaction site, TTF2<sup>ΔN</sup>) both rescued RNAPII eviction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, C, and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig.

In contrast, TTF2 carrying a point mutation in the Walker A motif that is expected to disrupt ATP hydrolysis (TTF2<sup>K602A</sup>) and TTF2 lacking the entire C-terminal ATPase domain (TTF2<sup>ΔC</sup>) were both unable to support RNAPII eviction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, C, and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig.

Collectively, our data show that TTF2 evicts replisomes and transcription complexes by distinct mechanisms in mitosis. The removal of RNAPII appears to be a constitutive process that occurs in every cell cycle, whereas the removal of replisomes is only needed when unreplicated DNA persists into mitosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">How vertebrate cells respond to incomplete DNA replication remains poorly understood. Previous evidence showed that TRAIP ubiquitylates CMG helicases that remain on chromatin in mitosis, leading to replisome unloading, fork breakage, and alternative end-joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). We proposed that this pathway minimizes genome instability by generating one intact chromatid and another with a small deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), as seen during common fragile site expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">fig. S1C</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>)). In this paper, we used frog egg extracts to identify an essential role for TTF2 in supporting the mitotic function of TRAIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). We show that in mitotic extracts, TRAIP is phosphorylated on T325, and our evidence suggests that this modification mediates binding to the ZF of TTF2, although we have not shown the interaction directly. We additionally find that a short, conserved TTF2 motif adjacent to the ZF mediates TTF2 binding to the POLE2 subunit of pol ε. An N-terminal domain of TTF2 that includes the ZF and adjacent motif is sufficient to support TRAIP function, whereas TTF2’s ATPase domain is dispensable. Collectively, these results suggest that TTF2 forms a phospho-dependent bridge between TRAIP and the replisome that allows TRAIP to strip all replisomes from mitotic chromosomes. Furthermore, while TTF2 also strips transcription complexes from mitotic chromosomes, this process involves its ATPase activity.</p><p id="P17">We previously showed that TRAIP is highly constrained in interphase, being limited to ubiquitylation of protein barriers encountered by the fork <italic>in trans</italic>, whereas in mitosis it can also ubiquitylate the CMG with which it associates <italic>in cis</italic>. Importantly, TRAIP<sup>S295</sup>, TRAIP<sup>T325</sup>, and TTF2 are required for the mitotic but not the interphase functions of TRAIP. Therefore, a fundamental re-organization must take place in mitosis, whereby interactions that constrain TRAIP’s RING domain in interphase are replaced with or supplemented by a less constrained mitotic binding mode. The mitotic configuration of the replisome requires regions of TRAIP and TTF2 that are both predicted to be disordered. We therefore propose that TRAIP is flexibly associated with the replisome in mitosis, giving its RING domain freedom to ubiquitylate both the replisome and proteins that block its path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Our observations indicate that TTF2 likely does not recruit TRAIP through a simple, linear pathway. We found that TTF2 mutations predicted to disrupt TRAIP binding (K16A and Δ120-125) also prevent efficient TTF2 chromatin binding. This suggests that TRAIP and TTF2 bind replisomes cooperatively, with the two factors not only interacting with each other, but both also making independent contacts to the replisome. While TTF2 clearly contacts POLE2, a direct TRAIP-replisome contact remains to be identified. Interestingly, when we deplete TTF2, levels of chromatin-associated TRAIP are unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, lanes 2 and 5). We speculate that this is because two dimers of TRAIP are associated with the replisome in mitosis, including one that is bound in the interphase mode that is not affected by loss of the functional interaction with TTF2.</p><p id="P19">Previous biochemical experiments showed that TTF2-dependent transcript release from stalled RNAPII requires ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Consistent with this finding, we found that RNAPII eviction from mitotic chromosomes in cells is inhibited by a Walker A mutation in the TTF2 ATPase domain, suggesting ATPase activity is required. Moreover, the C-terminal ATPase domain is sufficient to support RNAPII eviction. Therefore, the segments of TTF2 required for replisome and RNAPII eviction are non-overlapping, arguing that TTF2 stimulates these two processes by distinct mechanisms. Whether there are situations, such as replisome encounter with transcription complexes in mitosis, where the two halves of TTF2 act in concert, is an interesting question for future investigation.</p><p id="P20">In conclusion, we identify TTF2 as a new component in the response to unreplicated DNA in mitosis. The specific requirement for TTF2 in mitotic TRAIP function implies that the replisome undergoes major structural changes to meet cell-cycle specific challenges to genome integrity.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="print-only"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Recombinant protein expression</title><p id="P21">To purify biotinylated LacR, a plasmid expressing avidin tagged LacR pET11a[LacR-Avi] and a plasmid expressing biotin ligase pBirAcm (Avidity, Denver, CO) were co-transformed into T7 Express cells (New England Biolabs).

To identify proteins with significant abundance changes between the four conditions, LFQ intensities were log2 transformed, and missing values were imputed with random values drawn from a normal distribution centered around the detection limit of the MS instrument (Perseus imputation; width=0.3, down shift = 1.8). Two sample Student’s t-tests with permutation-based FDR control were carried out in Perseus. For these tests, three valid values in at least one triplicate of either of the tested conditions was required. FDR was adjusted for multiple testing by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure using a significance threshold of FDR&lt;0.05 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">suppl. table 2</xref>). Data visualization was carried out in R.

TTF2-degron cell lines were created using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing with marker-free co-selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). To this end, HCT116 cells were transfected using Neon Transfection System with a mixture of three DNA vectors: (1) double Cas9-gRNA vector (containing Cas9 and gRNA against TTF2 STOP codon and ATP1A1 ouabain suppression mutation site; eSpCas9(1.1)_gATP1A1_gT2C2), (2) TTF2 degron HDR targeting template (hTTF2_CT_dTAG_SMASh2), and (3) ATP1A1 ouabain resistance HDR targeting template (ATP1A1_Q11RN129D). Transfected cells were selected for growth in ouabain (10 uM; O3125, Sigma) containing media. Resistant cells were FACS sorted to single cells in 96-well plates, and clones were screened by PCR for degron cassette integration and by immunoblotting for TTF2 depletion under degron activation. TTF2-degron depletion was induced by supplementing media with 0.5 uM dTAGV-1 (6914, Tocris)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) and 1 uM ASV (HY-14434, MedChemExpress)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>).</p><p id="P51">To complement the TTF2-degron cell lines with ectopically expressed doxycycline (DOX) inducible TTF2 versions, the human TTF2 open reading frame was cloned into a pLIX403 lentiviral vector under tetON promoter with C-terminal V5 affinity tag and RFP fluorescent protein tag. The resulting pLIX403_hTTF2-V5-RFP was mutagenized by PCR and NEBuilder HiFi assembly kit cloning to obtain TTF2 mutant constructs. pLIX403 based vectors were then used to produce lentivirus. Lentivirus-infected TTF2-degron cell lines were selected on puromycin, FACS sorted for RFP expression (under transient DOX treatment), and single-cell cloned to obtain clonal cell lines. TTF2 ectopic expression was induced by addition of 0.1-0.5 ug/mL DOX in the media for 24 hours or longer.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Immunofluorescence and Microscopy</title><p id="P52">Cells were seeded on poly-D-lysine coverslips in 12-well plates at a concentration of 50 k/mL (day 1). On day 4, the coverslips with cells were washed with PBS and fixed with simultaneous permeabilization using PTEMF solution (20 mM PIPES pH 6.8, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 4% paraformaldehyde) at RT for 15 min. Coverslips were washed thrice with PBS (5 min each wash here and after) and kept at 4 °C until staining (up to a week). For immunostaining, fixed coverslips were blocked with blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBS) for 1 hour at RT, incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 hour at RT, washed thrice with Wash buffer (0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS), and incubated for 1 hour at RT with secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. After removing secondary antibodies and three more washes with Wash buffer, the coverslips were incubated with 1:2500 dilution of Hoechst stain (H3570, Invitrogen) for 10 min at RT. Hoechst solution was removed, and coverslips were washed thrice with PBS. Coverslips were mounted in Prolong Diamond Antifade (P36965, Invitrogen) on imaging slides, cxured overnight at RT and imaged using a spinning disc confocal microscope (Nikon) with a 60X objective. Images were processed in Fiji. Z-stacks were max intensity projected. Primary antibodies: α-RNAPII-S2ph 1:400 (ab5095, rabbit, Abcam)), α-V5 1:200 (R960-25, mouse, Thermo), α-TTF2 1:100 (sc-514996, mouse, SantaCruz BioTechnology).

In Fiji, image hyperstacks were first collapsed (Image &gt; Stacks &gt; Z project &gt; MAX intensity option), and individual channels set to grays (LUT &gt; Grays). To measure signal intensity for each channel on and outside of chromatin, a nuclear (DNA) mask was first created. To this end, the DNA channel (Hoechst) image was duplicated, converted to 8-bit (Image &gt; Type &gt; 8-bit), smoothed by applying Median filter (with 3 pixels setting) and thresholded with ‘Huang’ method (Image &gt; Adjust &gt; Threshold (Huang)). Holes were filled (Process &gt; Binary &gt;Fill Holes), chromosome groups were separated using watershed (Process &gt; Binary &gt; Watershed) and obtained DNA mask was saved. Chromosome groups (interphase nuclei and mitotic chromosomes) were detected on the mask by using Analyze Particles method (with size set to 1000-Infinity). Each channel signal intensity was then measured for all chromatin groups Regions of Interest detected with the mask (ROI Manager &gt; measure). To obtain the signal intensity outside of chromatin (background), the DNA mask was first inverted (Edit &gt;Invert), total region outside of chromatin selected (Edit &gt;Selection &gt;Create Selection) and used for quantification in ROI Manager (Analyze &gt;Tools &gt;ROI Manager +Add &gt;measure). Obtained measurements were imported to Excel, where RNAPII-S2ph background intensity was subtracted from intensity on chromatin. The RNAPII-S2ph signal intensity on TTF2-positive (or negative, for no_vector control) mitotic chromatin was divided by average signal on interphase nuclei of the same field of view, and obtained values were reported on the figure graph using Prism. Prism Mann-Whitney U test was used to test for statistical significance of the difference in value distributions.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Clonogenic assay image quantification</title><p id="P55">Clonogenic assay plate images were analyzed in ImageJ and Excel. Each plate image was converted to 8-bit grayscale (Image &gt;Type &gt; 8-bit), and thresholded by limiting contrast to 0-150 (Image &gt;Adjust &gt;Threshold 0-150). To separate colonies, the watershed method was then applied (Process &gt;Binary &gt;Watershed). Wells were selected with the circle select tool of equal size per plate, and colonies were detected and measured using the Analyze Particles tool. Average colony size in percents was calculated in Excel by dividing the average colony size in each well by that of the mock-treated well and multiplication by 100.
