For example, partial restoration of vision has been achieved in a blind patient and proof-of-concept has been demonstrated for optogenetic hearing restoration in rodents. In order to prepare clinical translation of hearing restoration, efficient and safe optogenetic modification of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the mature cochlea remains to be developed. Here, we established microcatheter-based administration adeno-associated virus (AAV) to scala tympani of the cochlea of Mongolian gerbils and compared it to the previously developed AAV-injection into the spiral ganglion. We probed the potential AAV-PHP.S capsid to express channelrhodopsins (ChRs) under the control of the human synapsin promotor in mature SGNs in hearing and deafened gerbils. Using the microcatheter approach, but not with the AAV-modiolus injection, we achieved reliable ChR expression in SGN enabling optogenetic stimulation of the auditory pathway in 80% of the treated animals. Yet, the efficiency of SGN transduction was modest with only ~30% ChR-expressing SGNs. Moreover, we encountered off-target expression in hair cells in hearing gerbils in both approaches, but not ChR expression in the central nervous system using microcatheter administration. Comparing optogenetic auditory brainstem responses of gerbils with and without hair cell transduction confirmed that SGNs were the primary site of optogenetic stimulation of the pathway.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">More than 5% of the world’s population suffers from disabling hearing impairments, and the majority of them are affected from what is known as sensorineural hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">WHO, 2021</xref>). In these patients, the hair cells that transduce the sound into micromechanical amplification (outer hair cells) or release of glutamate (inner hair cells, IHC) that activates the spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) are dysfunctional or absent. Despite recent clinical advances in cell therapy for otoferlin-related deafness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Qi <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lv <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>), hearing aids and cochlear implants will remain the pillar of hearing restoration for the foreseeable future because of their one-size-fits-all nature. Hearing restoration for severely hearing-impaired patients relies on the use of electrical cochlear implants (eCI), that bypasses the lost or dysfunctional cochlear hair cells and directly stimulates the SGNs that are typically maintained for longer. By restoring hearing perception to the vast majority of its currently more than a million users, the eCI is considered to be the most successful neuroprosthesis to date (for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Lenarz, 2018</xref>)). While eCI enables the perception of speech in a quiet environment, users recognize an unmet medical need in the real-life condition where background noise competes with speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hunniford <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wolf <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). This deficiency is commonly attributed to the wide current spread from each electrode contact in the saline-filled cochlea, activating large SGN groups and limiting spectral information transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kral <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Despite engineering efforts to reduce the spread of electrical stimulation, clinical benefits have remained limited. An alternative way to achieve a spatially narrower activation of the SGNs, and thus to increase the spectral information transfer, is to switch the stimulation modality to light, since light can be better spatially confined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dieter <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Keppeler <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). In this approach, photocontrol is achieved by driving viral vector-mediated expression of channelrhodopsin (ChR) in the SGNs. This concept leads to the current development of an optical cochlear implant (oCI) consisting of a medical device on the one hand and an optogene therapy on the other (for review, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Huet <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>)).</p><p id="P4">For the oCI to be translated into a clinical approach, efficiency, reliability and safety of optogene therapy needs to be demonstrated in preclinical work. Previous work has shown that efficient optogene therapy can be achieved by injection of a viral vector carrying ChR under the control of the human synapsin promoter (hSyn) into <italic>scala tympani</italic> of early postnatal rodents (i.e. “intrascalar”, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Mager <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Keppeler <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huet <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Richardson <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Duarte <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). At this age of optogene therapy, a broad range of viral capsids was evaluated and reached similar rates of ChR expression in the SGNs: AAV2/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Mager <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bali <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huet <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wrobel <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), AAV2/9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Zerche <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>), AAV PHP.B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Keppeler <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huet <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bali <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Keppeler <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Mittring <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dieter <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Michael <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>), AAV PHP.eB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bali <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Michael <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>) and AAV.Anc80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Duarte <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Richardson <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). More recently, early postnatal optogene therapy was demonstrated to be stable for two years (the lifetime of mice) but associated with extracochlear ChR expression at different levels of the central nervous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bali <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). ChR expression in SGN adult cochleae can also be achieved by direct injection of the viral vector into the cochlear modiolus (“intramodiolar”, directly into the Rosenthal canal of the bony modiolus that houses the spiral ganglion, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wrobel <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>)). The success of the optogene therapy for enabling optogenetic SGN stimulation at this age was limited to ~40% of the treated gerbils and a low ChR expression rate (~20-30% SGNs) in the responsive cochleae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wrobel <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huet <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>)). In addition, intramodiolar pressure injection caused a loss of ~20% of the SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wrobel <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Even less efficient and reliable transduction was reported upon intrascalar AAV injection in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Richardson et al, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In this study, we aimed to develop a translatable delivery approach and to identify appropriate viral vectors that would allow ChR expression in the SGNs of all treated adult animals as relevant for future clinical work. Previous work in adult mice demonstrated the role of the cochlear aqueduct in the spread of drugs locally administered in the cochlea towards the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Talaei <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). For this purpose, we selected the capsid AAV.PHP-S for its tropism towards the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chan <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>), thus avoiding the transduction of neurons in the central nervous system in the event that the viral suspension would spread towards the brain. First, we evaluated the capsid AAV.PHP-S for its ability to mediate ChR expression in young and adult SGNs employing the Mongolian gerbil for its large cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Keppeler <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). We then tested multiple administration approaches that allow for the replacement of cochlear fluids in a standardized and controllable manner and compared them to the currently established optogene therapy for adult animals via intramodiolar injection. We found that slow delivery of AAV.PHP-S via a microcatheter inserted into the round window in combination with an evacuation vent at the oval window (RW<sub>µ-cat</sub> + vent) allowed expression of ChR in all treated cochleae and that optically evoked auditory potentials could be recorded in &gt;80% of the treated cochleae. Finally, in a pharmacological model of profound sensorineural hearing loss, we demonstrated that successful optogene therapy by AAV-mediated transduction of SGNs by RW<sub>µ-cat</sub> + vent administration does not require the presence of IHCs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>AAV.PHP-S as a viral vector for optogenetic modification of spiral ganglion neurons</title><p id="P6">Here, we evaluated AAV.PHP-S, a capsid designed to specifically transduce neurons from the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chan et al, 2017</xref>), for its ability to mediate ChR expression in the SGNs. AAV.PHP-S was first evaluated following pressure injection into the cochlea of early postnatal age gerbils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1.B</xref>), which, at this age, is associated with high SGN transduction rate in most of injected gerbils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huet <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). We expressed the blue-light activated ChR2-variant, CatCh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kleinlogel <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wrobel <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), fused to the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) under control of hSyn promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1.A</xref>). The capsid was injected at a titer of 6.42 x 10<sup>12</sup> genome copies per milliliter (gc/mL). Approximately, 8 weeks after injection, expression of CatCh-eYFP was analysed by confocal microscopy of cross-modiolar section immunolabeled for GFP, parvalbumin as a SGN marker and calretinin as an inner hair cell (IHC) marker, following functional characterization regardless of the presence or absence of optically evoked optically evoked auditory brainstem responses (oABRs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1.C-D</xref>) that reflect the optical activation of the peripherical auditory pathway, and for, both, the injected and non-injected cochlea. To observe SGNs and the IHCs they innervate, we developed the semi-thick cross-modiolar section of the cochlea (thickness = 220 µm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1.A</xref>). For efficient analysis of the large number of cells in the images, the SGNs were automatically segmented in 3 dimensions using a self-trained model in CellPose 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Pachitariu &amp; Stringer, 2022</xref>) of Arivis 4D software (see the section “<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S13">Material and methods</xref>” for details). ChR-expressing SGNs (GFP<sup>+</sup> SGNs) were semi-automatically identified based on the distribution of averaged GFP signal per 3D segmented cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huet <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Mittring <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In 5 out of the 6 injected cochleae, oABRs could be elicited and ChR-expressing SGNs were found. In the negative cochlea, no ChR-expressing SGNs were found and thus, we hypothesized that this cochlea must have been mis-injected and its data will only be displayed but not included in the following quantification. The SGN density of the injected cochleae was significantly reduced compared to the contralateral non-injected cochleae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1.C-D</xref>, injected: 8.12 ± 0.81, <italic>n</italic> = 3 and non-injected 21.73 ± 1.31 SGNs / 10<sup>5</sup> µm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>P</italic> = 0.036, Wilcoxon rank). Our previous study reported a slight decrease of SGNs, potentially induced by a transient increase of pressure into the cochlea during the injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huet <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>), but the reduction was stronger in the current study.</p><p id="P8">The density of GFP<sup>+</sup> SGNs was similar between the transduced cochleae and amounted to 6.83 ± 1.49 and 9.35 ± 2.63 SGNs / 10<sup>5</sup> µm<sup>3</sup> for injected and non-injected cochlea, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1.C,D</xref>). To take into account the difference of SGNs density between both sides, ChR-expression was also quantified as the ratio between the number of GFP<sup>+</sup> SGNs and the total number of residual SGNs (i.e., the ChR-expression rate). In this case, the transduction rate tended to be higher for the injected cochleae (82.17% ± 10.54) compared to the non-injected ones (45.3% ± 13.08, <italic>P</italic> = 0.14, Wilcoxon rank sum test).</p><p id="P9">Contrary to previous reports, IHCs were also expressing CatCh-eYFP and thus we quantified the extent of their ChR-expression. The IHC density was similar between both ears and amounted to 9.18 ± 0.18 and 9.64 ± 0.21 IHC / 100 µm for the injected (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and the contralateral non-injected (<italic>n</italic> = 6) cochleae. Nonetheless, ChR-expressing IHCs were solely limited to the injected cochlea (7.67 ± 0.15 GFP<sup>+</sup> IHC / 100 µm, i.e. ChR-expression rate = 85.47 ± 1.47%). We assume that the cross-modiolar slicing facilitates the detection of ChR-expressing IHCs, compared to the mid-modiolar sections used in the previous studies.</p><p id="P10">Next, we recorded oABRs from scalp electrodes in response to 1 ms light pulses delivered into the cochlea, at 10 Hz, by an optical fiber (⍰ = 200 µm) coupled to a 488 nm laser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1.B</xref>). At low light intensities, the oABRs were characterized by 2-3 positive waves as previously described in gerbils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wrobel <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dieter <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huet <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). At higher light intensities, the oABRs were contaminated by a large and late likely non-auditory potential, potentially reflecting facial nerve activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1.F</xref>). The oABR threshold on average amounted to 7.8 ± 1.99 mW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1.G</xref>). To take into account the large distribution of oABR thresholds, quantification of the oABR wave amplitudes and latencies was related to light levels relative to the oABR threshold using the following formula: <italic>Light level</italic> (<italic>dB<sub>oABR threshold</sub></italic>) = 10 × log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>A/A<sub>threshold</sub></italic>) where A is the radiant flux and A<sub>threshold</sub> the radiant flux at the oABR threshold in mW. The amplitude of the first oABR wave increased linearly with the light level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1.H</xref>) while the first wave latency decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1.I</xref>) up to ~4 dB. To characterize SGN responses to a wider range of light levels regardless of the absence or presence of non-auditory potentials, optically evoked compound action potentials (oCAP) were recorded using an electrode placed at the surface of the cochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1.J</xref>). The oCAPs reflect the synchronous activation of the SGNs and are recorded from a silver ball electrode implanted in the RW niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bourien <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Batrel <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). The oCAP thresholds tended to be lower than those of oABRs measured from the same animal and amounted to 3.5 ± 1.09 mW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1.K</xref>, <italic>P</italic> = 0.06, <italic>n</italic> = 5, Wilcoxon signed rank test). The extent of cochlear activation, reflected by the oCAP wave amplitude, increased with the radiant flux for up to 7 dB and seemed to saturate above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1.L</xref>). Nonetheless, the oCAP latency decreased over the whole tested range (&gt; 9 dB, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1.M</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The SGN loss combined with the IHC-transduction in the injected cochlea suggested that the titer of AAV-PHP.S-hSyn-CatCh-eYFP was too high for achieving safe and specific optogene therapy when administered at early postnatal age. The off-target expression in IHCs might not be clinically relevant given loss of hair cells in sensorineural hearing loss. Nonetheless, the data indicate that promotor choice - synapsin is not expressed at the protein level in IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Safieddine &amp; Wenthold, 1999</xref>) – does not ensure specificity provided sufficient AAV titer.

Following work with other capsids and/or ChRs injected directly into the modiolus of gerbil cochleae, lower performance was reported in terms of transduction rate (~10%) and proportion of successfully treated cochleae (~10%, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Huet <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Michael <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>)). Alternatively, attempts to deliver the viral suspension directly into the perilymph either through the round window or via the posterior semicircular canal have not proven to be a reliable alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Richardson <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Is the direct injection of the AAV.PHP-S-hSyn-CatCh into the modiolus sufficient to improve the success of the treatment? Using it, oABRs could be measured in 20% of the treated cochleae for an overall transduction rate of 25.69% of all injected cochleae. Because of methodological differences, comparisons are complicated but it is reasonable to assume that AAV.PHP-S-hSyn-CatCh performs at least similarly than in previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wrobel <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Michael <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Nevertheless, this approach remains an interesting route, perhaps for cases where AAV re-dosing is required. It is worth noting that direct modiolus injection has been shown to be feasible in human temporal bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Wrobel <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>), where clear and visible landmarks are available.</p><p id="P34">As an alternative, we investigated if microcatheter pump-controlled administration approaches via the scala tympani could offer a viable preclinical alternative to the direct modiolus injection. Here, we demonstrated a fourfold increase in the success rate of measuring oABRs (80 vs 20), as well as an 8% increase in SGN survival (~81 vs 73%) and a 1.75-fold increase in transduction rate (28 vs 16%) of the RW<sub>µ-cat</sub> + vent compared to modiolus-injected cochleae. This improvement comes at the cost of a drastic loss of IHC, most likely due to the insertion and withdrawal of the catheter used to deliver the viral suspension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Jwair <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). The field of clinical cochlear implants has developed several robotic and automated approaches for minimally invasive insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">De Seta <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). These approaches could be adapted for human catheter-based viral delivery if IHC survival is required. In a large fraction of treated cochleae with AAV.PHP-S-hSYn-CatCh, the remaining IHCs were expressing ChR. For both modiolus injection and microcatheter administration, the IHC transduction rate amounted to ~38 and 30% for modiolus and RW<sub>µ-cat</sub> + vent administration, respectively. The fact that no oABRs were measured from the modiolus-injected cochleae, where SGN transduction was close to 0%, supports that IHC optogenetic activation alone was not sufficient to drive synchronous firing in the SGNs. Moreover, the likelihood of viral particles reaching the SGNs via the IHCs seemed low, considering that pharmacologic depletion of the IHCs by intracochlear injection of kanamycin one week prior to viral vector delivery did not affect the performance of the procedure. Alternatively, co-transduction of IHCs and SGNs was found in RWµ-cat + vent treated cochleae, and their co-optical activation was associated with a slightly longer latency of the SGN compound action potential. As previously suggested, our data support that the contribution of optogenetically activated hair cells, if any, is very small compared to that of SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Michael <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Why is scala tympani administration more efficient for transducing SGNs than direct injection into the modiolus where their cell bodies are located? One answer may be found in the available volume of the scala tympani: it is about 18 times larger than the modiolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Keppeler <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>), which is already densely packed with SGN cell bodies. Although the route by which the virus finds its way to the SGN can only be speculated at this point, our data suggest that an increased number of virus particles find their way to the SGN with RW<sub>µ-cat</sub> + vent administration compared to direct modiolus injection. In the present study, a maximum volume of 5 µL was administered, corresponding to ~80% of the cumulated volume of the scala timpani, vestibuli and media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Keppeler <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). This might suggest for mammals with bigger cochlea to scale up the volume of administered viral suspension to the volume of those cumulated cavities that would translate to ~15 µL and ~71 µL for guinea pig and humans, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Lessons learned for optogenetic hearing restoration</title><p id="P36">This study indicates that AAV administration via the round window with pressure relief at the round window is a reliable approach to transduce SGNs. This approach has recently been successfully employed in clinical trials on AAV-mediated gene therapy of otoferlin-related auditory synaptopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lv <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Qi <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). There, IHCs have been the target that can be considered more accessible to virus administered to the <italic>scala tympani</italic> than SGNs that, except for their peripheral neurites innervating the organ of Corti, are thoroughly encased in the bony modiolus. Here we employed microcatheters that are smaller versions of catheters approved for clinical use and delivered volumes that relatively speaking come close to those applied to the human cochlea. Clearly, the reliability and efficacy of the optogene therapy need further optimization to provide optogenetic modification of the spiral ganglion in 100% of treated cochleae and in the majority of the SGNs. We note that 30% seems a good target of ChR<sup>+</sup> positive cells given the experience of the more advanced vision restoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chaffiol <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). In fact, this expression rate has also supported demonstration of improved coding of spectral information in prior preclinical work on the waveguide or LED-based oCI stimulation of SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dieter <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">2020</xref>). However, eventually, the benefits of oCI are predicted to be greatest with the largest possible population of ChR<sup>+</sup> SGNs. Finally, our deafness model has limitations for it primarily represents acute deafness and might not resemble aspects of chronic deafness such as organ of Corti scarring and partial or complete loss of SGNs.</p><p id="P37">Off-target expression of the therapeutic construct, opsins in the case of optogenetic therapy, can cause adverse or confounding effects. We observed that despite choosing viral vector and promotor for specifically targeting SGNs, the only neural population with somatas contained in the cochlea, expression of ChR also occurred in hair cells to different extent. While this calls for further efforts for more selective optogenetic modification, it also provided us an opportunity to compare optogenetic stimulation of the auditory pathway with and without ChR expressing IHCs. This is relevant for future optogenetic hearing restoration in cases of residual low-frequency hearing currently treated with electroacoustic or hybrid stimulation of the eCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lenarz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Our data suggest minimal impact of potential optogenetic stimulation of remaining IHCs on optically induced activity of the auditory pathway. We did not find differences in thresholds or amplitudes of the oABRs, but found a slightly delayed latency of the first oABR wave, which is consistent with optogenetically induced glutamate release from IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chakrabarti <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>) contributing to SGN firing. Therefore, if remaining hair cells were transduced and optogenetically co-stimulated along with SGN, this might affect temporal coding and would need to be considered by sound coding strategies. The scope of our current study did not cover a comprehensive study of ChR expression across the brain or analysis of viscera. We note that different from a previous study employing early postnatal AAV injection into the mouse cochlea that showed ChR expression in various brain regions, the neural ChR expression upon microcatheter based AAV administration to the mature cochlea of the present study was largely limited to SGNs. This is promising and encourages comprehensive toxicology studies in preparation of clinical trials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Animals</title><p id="P38">Optogenetic data were obtained from 61 and control histological data from 22 Mongolian gerbils of either sex.
