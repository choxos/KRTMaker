Alzheimer’s disease in which age and amyloid-β pathology interact to initiate neurofibrillary tau tangle pathology, not dependent on mutations in MAPT. Gradual progression from amyloid-β to tau pathology in NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice opens possibilities for understanding processes precipitating clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease and development of translatable therapies to prevent the onset of tau pathology.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Much criticism has arisen of mouse models for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to the limited success in translating therapies to humans, despite promising results in mice. AD is only diagnosed following the development of neurofibrillary tau tangles (NFTs), which occur decades after the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. While existing mouse models recapitulating pre-clinical disease stages, in plaque pathology, they only exhibit NFTs if mutations in microtubule-associated protein tau (<italic>MAPT</italic>) are inserted (e.g. 3xTg-AD mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>). Such mutations do not occur in AD. The lack of a mouse model that develops NFTs due to rising Aβ poses a significant challenge in studying how plaques drive NFT formation. This hinders efforts to test therapies designed to prevent AD progression to clinical stages. Hence, there is an urgent need to improve existing mouse models by addressing several key factors: <list list-type="order" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P3">Rising Aβ deposition should induce the formation of NFTs, independent of mutations not relevant to AD.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P4">A delay should occur between the onset of Aβ plaque accumulation and the development of tau pathology.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P5">Development of NFTs must be dependent on old age.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="P6">To align the lifelong timecourse of plaque development in sporadic AD, we have developed a model, starting with the <italic>App<sup>NL-F/NL-F</sup></italic> (NLF) knock-in mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, which shows a gradual plaque onset from mid-life, progressively increasing through to old age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Resistance of amyloid mouse models to forming NFTs could arise from differences between human and mouse in the tau N-terminal region and isoform expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. We therefore crossed the NLF mouse with a knock-in humanized <italic>MAPT</italic> mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, such that the <italic>App</italic> mutations were homozygous and the humanized <italic>MAPT</italic> heterozygous (NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup>). This introduces humanized tau, while minimizing potential developmental artefacts that could arise from completely removing murine tau.</p><p id="P7">Using both western blot and immunoprecipitation combined with liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (IP-MS), the relative abundance of tau peptides in 24-month-old WT, NLF, Tau<sup>m/h</sup> and NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> was compared.. As expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, adult WT and NLF mice lacked the 3 carboxyl-terminal repeat domain (3R) isoforms of tau, whereas Tau<sup>m/h</sup> and NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> exhibited all six isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Both methods confirmed that the 3R:4R isoform ratio was similar between Tau<sup>m/h</sup> and NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, D</xref>) and resembled the approximately equal levels reported in humans, both in healthy controls and AD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Other non-phosphorylated tau peptides, in regions analogous between mouse and human tau, were analyzed by IP-MS and found to be unchanged across genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) residues relevant to human fluid biomarkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> were analyzed and found to be elevated in 24-month-old NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Where mouse and human peptides are analogous, abundance of phosphorylation at relevant sites was analyzed in all four genotypes. However, as the standards used were for human tau, for phosphorylation sites within sequence sections that differ between the mouse and human peptides, only the genotypes containing human tau were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1Ei, ii</xref>). The largest difference in phosphorylation was detected in the singly phosphorylated (p1) tau peptide 212-221, being significantly more abundant in NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice than their age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1Eiii</xref>). Tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed that this phosphorylation site was mostly pT217. The pT231 residue was also significantly enriched, though dependent only on the <italic>App</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1Eiv</xref>). Notably, both these residues are typically elevated in fluid biomarkers of AD patients, compared to controls and other tauopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">Considering the increased abundance of pT217 in NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup>, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate p-tau pathology in the soma of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, which would be indicative of initial NFT formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The pT217 tau staining appeared as two distinct morphologies: bright puncta or diffuse granular staining filling the neuronal cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, upper panel). In order to account for both types of signals the pT217 staining was quantified as a percentage coverage within the CA1 neuronal soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Although some buildup of puncta and diffuse granular p-tau was evident in hippocampal neurons across all genotypes, only the 24-months NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice showed a variable, but statistically significant, increase in pT217 soma localization, compared to levels across all genotypes at 18 months, similar to the pre-tangle morphology described in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Notably, at 18 months, most mice, regardless of genotype, displayed puncta of pT217. This largely remained the case for WT and Tau<sup>m/h</sup> mice at 24 months, with few neurons in these mice displaying the combination of p-tau puncta and diffuse granular staining that was prevalent in NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Interestingly, Tau<sup>m/h</sup> mice exhibited significantly lower pT217 staining than WT mice at 18 months and a similar trend was observed at 24 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To further assess the progression of tau pathology from initial deposition in the soma to the assembly of paired helical filaments, pS396, an epitope phosphorylated within these filaments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, was analyzed in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal neuronal cell bodies in 24-month-old NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice compared to age-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, lower panels). Although changes in the C-terminal p-tau sites were not detected in bulk tissue analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1Ev-vii</xref>), spatial analysis revealed an increase in pS396 protein levels in NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice compared to other genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-E</xref>). Similar to the staining observed with pT217, a small proportion of neurons in some WT, Tau<sup>m/h</sup> and NLF mice also showed pS396 staining in the soma, although this was greatest in NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice in both regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-E</xref>). For pS396 staining, as the signal was more uniform, the analysis could rely on the signal intensity and was normalized to the intensity in the neighboring dendritic/axonal region. The presence of tangle-like pathology in a subset of neurons in NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice was further confirmed by labelling with luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs), dyes that bind to β-pleated sheets based on structural conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Having established the initiation of tangle pathology in NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice, dependent on age and the presence of Aβ plaques, we investigated whether the inclusion of human tau would also affect the deposition of plaques and p-tau levels in the immediate vicinity of these plaques, which has been consistently observed in amyloid mouse models of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Plaques can be classified according to their Aβ peptide signatures and morphology, using a combination of two LCOs, q-FTAA and h-FTAA, together with an Aβ antibody, 6E10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. q-FTAA preferentially binds to mature β-pleated amyloid fibrils, whereas h-FTAA binds to both mature and immature β-pleated sheets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Due to their unique emission spectrum profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>), we could distinguish between diffuse regions of Aβ or more structured plaques, thus categorizing three populations depending on their LCO positivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>): 1) q-FTAA+, h-FTAA+, Aβ+ (cored plaques); 2) q-FTAA-, h-FTAA+, Aβ+ (fibrillar plaques) and 3) q-FTAA-, h-FTAA-, Aβ+ (diffuse Aβ).</p><p id="P13">At 24 months old, a significantly greater hippocampal area was occupied by diffuse Aβ compared to cored and fibrillar plaques, with no differences between NLF and NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>). p-Tau (pS396 levels) increased with proximity to Aβ in all cases, with the greatest increase in the immediate vicinity of cored plaques. This increase was greater in NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice than in NLF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The strength of pS396 staining in cored plaques positively correlated with pS396 staining in the hippocampal soma of individual NLF and NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice, in both CA1 and CA3 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Together, the above observations present a novel mouse model which addresses the major failing of previously available models. Several models have combined the two pathological hallmarks of AD, but none has achieved the initiation of NFTs triggered by Aβ accumulation, without mutations in <italic>MAPT</italic>. The NLF mouse has seen limited use; with more aggressive models, with rapid plaque development, receiving more attention for reasons of convenience and cost. However, age is a vital component of sporadic AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, making the slow time course of plaque development in this model more relevant to preclinical AD disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Although these plaques are caused by familial AD mutations, the humanized Aβ sequence of the NLF mouse is identical to that found in sporadic AD and the knock-in technology used avoids the overexpression-related issues typical of transgenic technology. The presence of some p-tau pathology in a subset of aged WT and Tau<sup>m/h</sup> mice further emphasizes the importance of ageing in modelling AD. Interestingly, an age-related increase in tau pS396 in the hippocampus of WT mice has been reported previously. In this case, the pathology was related to synaptic mitochondria, which could be a factor in age-related vulnerability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Indeed it is likely that the interaction of age and Aβ pathology is vital to the unprecedented success of this model in initiating NFTs.</p><p id="P15">Moreover, in NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice, structural maturation of Aβ deposits into cored plaques is associated with increased p-tau, reported to be related to neurotoxicity and damaged synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Similarly, postmortem analysis of human brains suggests that progression to clinical dementia is associated with the prevalence of cored plaques, whereas plaques detected in cognitively normal individuals are mainly diffuse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The positive correlation, across models, of increased p-tau pathology within cored plaques and NFT formation may suggest a causal link.</p><p id="P16">It is notable that AD, unlike most tauopathies, features NFTs containing both 4R and 3R tau at a ratio of around 60:4022, and hence the appropriate ratio of these isoforms, achieved by expressing humanized tau heterozygously is also likely important. The only previous report of combining the two models crossed here was the <italic>App<sup>NL-F/NL-F</sup></italic> x <italic>MAPT</italic> mouse, with the humanized tau expressed homozygously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Although, like in other models, hyperphosphorylation of tau was reported to occur around plaques in this mouse, no reference was made to tau hyperphosphorylation in the cell soma. The 4R:3R ratio reported in this study, measured in the homozygous <italic>MAPT</italic> mouse, averaged around 40:60. This lower proportion of 4R tau may have impeded the development of NFTs. However, the <italic>App<sup>NL-F/NL-F</sup></italic> x <italic>MAPT</italic> mouse was not the primary focus of this previous study and so the appearance of NFTs could have been missed. Thus, while it is clear that heterozygous Tau<sup>m/h</sup> is sufficient to initiate NFTs, whether homozygous humanized tau would also have this effect needs further investigation.</p><p id="P17">Here, we present the first mouse model in which increasing plaque load leads to delayed initiation of NFTs in old age, independent of mutations not relevant to AD. Hence, the NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mouse fulfills the 3 requirements listed above for an improved mouse model, opening future possibilities for deciphering the molecular mechanisms linking these sequential pathologies. Moreover, site-specific hyperphosphorylation of tau has been mapped in humans to show progression from diffuse granular pre-tangles to mature tangles containing β-pleated aggregates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The similar progression in the NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mouse can now be used for testing therapies, and understanding the underlying progressive pathologies indicated by the rapid progress in availability of different plasma biomarkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">The prevalence of AD in the human population doubles with every 5 years of age from 65 years onwards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Ageing the NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mice to 30 months could reveal further disease progression. However, like humans, very old mice experience increasing mortality from different causes, necessitating large ageing colonies for reliable studies. Integrating this model with additional genetic or environmental risk factors might result in earlier-onset advanced pathologies, allowing for the study of disease progression from the beginning to end-stage. However, already the availability of a model with a clear onset of tau pathology, at an age with limited mortality rates and without mutations or overexpression of tau, is a breakthrough that opens up new possibilities for the study of AD progression. The NLFTau<sup>m/h</sup> mouse can now be used to guide the development of new treatments aimed at preventing or slowing clinical manifestations of the disease with every chance that findings in mice will translate to successful treatments in humans.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2"><title>Animals</title><p id="P19">All experiments were carried out in accordance with the UK Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986, following local ethical review.
