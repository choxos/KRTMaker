It controls water homeostasis, facilitates glymphatic function and is a drug target for brain edema following injury or stroke. Dysregulation of brain water homeostasis affects millions of people every year leading to death, disability and cognitive decline, for which no medicines are available. Two compounds, AER-270 and TGN-020, are sold as AQP4 inhibitors and a prodrug of AER-270 is currently in a phase I human trial. However, the direct effect of these compounds on AQP4 function has not been unequivocally demonstrated. Our data across multiple cellular and molecular assay systems demonstrate, unexpectedly, that AER-270 and TGN-020 do not inhibit AQP4. Although we observed an apparent inhibitory effect of AER-270 and TGN-020 in the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte assay, there was no effect in assays using reconstituted recombinant AQP4 or mammalian cells expressing exogenous or endogenous AQP4. We identify alternative mechanisms of action for both molecules that may explain previously reported <italic>in vivo</italic> results that were interpreted in the context of AQP4 inhibition. Overall, we conclude that AER-270 and TGN-020 should not be used to investigate the AQP4-dependence of biological processes in the brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aquaporin</kwd><kwd>AQP</kwd><kwd>AQP4</kwd><kwd>AQP inhibitor</kwd><kwd>AQP4 blocker</kwd><kwd>TGN-020</kwd><kwd>AER-270</kwd><kwd>AER-271</kwd><kwd>IMD-0354</kwd><kwd>water transport</kwd><kwd>glymphatic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The human body consists of 60% water. Strict regulation of its water content is required across volume-scales, from the tiny amounts in mitochondrial volume adaption to the multiple liters per day in renal blood filtration. The family of aquaporins (AQPs) are transmembrane proteins found in all kingdoms of life that facilitate passive bidirectional water transport across biological membranes in response to osmotic or hydrostatic pressure gradients. A subset of AQPs additionally transports small polar solutes, including urea, glycerol, hydrogen peroxide, and a small number of AQP proteins also conduct ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Login and Nejsum, 2023</xref>). There are 13 human AQP proteins expressed throughout the body. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) regulates central nervous system (CNS) water homeostasis and has been identified as a key contributor to dysregulated water homeostasis after traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI) and stroke, which all lead to cytotoxic CNS edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Manley et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Each year, millions of people suffer from CNS edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Jha et al., 2019</xref>). It has been estimated that 12 million people per year worldwide suffer a stroke and about 75 million experience TBI or SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dewan et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Feigin et al., 2021</xref>), with approximately 30% and 60% of these, respectively, developing CNS edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Jha et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Current treatment options are limited, relying on symptom management, such as osmotherapy (which has limited efficacy), and invasive neurosurgery to reduce intracranial pressure once brain edema has developed. The established role of AQP4 in edema development at the molecular level means it is a validated drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Tradtrantip et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P4">AQP4 has also been identified as an important component of the glymphatic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>), which consists of fluid flow through a CNS-wide network of perivascular spaces to facilitate waste clearance from the CNS parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hablitz and Nedergaard, 2021</xref>). Exactly how a water channel in the astrocyte endfoot could contribute to the paracellular fluid transport of the glymphatic system is still an open question, but data on <italic>AQP4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice from several laboratories consistently show that AQP4 knockout reduces glymphatic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Mestre et al., 2018</xref>). An AQP4-specific inhibitor would therefore be of great value and allow researchers to begin to investigate how astrocyte endfoot-localized AQP4 could contribute to paracellular glymphatic flow.</p><p id="P5">Over the last decades, various small molecules were proposed as AQP4 blockers, including antiepileptic agents, such as phenytoin, lamotrigine, and topiramate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Huber et al., 2009a</xref>), arylsulfonamides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Huber et al., 2007</xref>), loop diuretics such as bumetanide and furosemide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Migliati et al., 2009</xref>), and a selection of other chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Huber et al., 2009b</xref>). Most of these candidates have been identified using <italic>in silico</italic> methods and showed inhibition of AQP4 expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the high micromolar range. However, upon testing in mammalian cell culture these compounds failed to show an effect (Yang et al., 2008, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Tradtrantip et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P6">TGN-020 and AER-270 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>) are commercially available as AQP4 inhibitors. TGN-020 (N-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl-3-pyridinecarboxamide) was initially discovered following a virtual screening approach based on structural similarities to previously reported carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and anti-epileptics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Huber et al., 2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Huber et al., 2009a</xref>), although such compounds were found ineffective upon re-testing in mammalian cell culture assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Tradtrantip et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Esteva-Font et al., 2016</xref>). TGN-020 inhibited osmotic water flux in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes expressing human AQP4-M23 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 3.1 μM. A similar study conducted in a different laboratory reported selectivity for AQP4 over other human AQPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Toft-Bertelsen et al., 2021</xref>). Pretreatment with TGN-020 in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse stroke model reduced ischemia-induced brain swelling 2-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Igarashi et al., 2011</xref>) and also improved motor scores and glial scarring in rats 7 days after the inflicted brain damage when administrated post-injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Pirici et al., 2017</xref>). Discrepancies between experiments with TGN-020 and those using <italic>Aqp4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> animals highlight a further need for a more comprehensive validation of the inhibitor. For example, TGN-020 had no effect on stimulus-induced extracellular space (ECS) volume dynamics in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> CA1 stratum radiatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Toft-Bertelsen et al., 2021</xref>), whereas the volume change was augmented in <italic>Aqp4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Haj-Yasein et al., 2012</xref>). AQP4 knockout was also reported to increase perihematomal edema following intracerebral haemorrhage in mice by approximately 10-fold, whereas TGN-020 had only a minor effect on edema volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Jeon et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P7">AER-270 (N-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzamide) was discovered by screening 500 compounds, leading to identification of the class of phenylbenzamides as having potential AQP4 inhibiting properties using a CHO cell endpoint bursting assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Farr et al., 2019</xref>). IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.42 μM, 0.21 μM and 0.39 μM were reported for human, rat and mouse AQP4, respectively, but maximal inhibition varied significantly between species from only approximately 20% (mouse, human) to approximately 70% (rat). Inhibition of AQP1 and AQP5 was also reported. In a water intoxication model, AER-270-treated mice showed a 3.3-fold improved survival rate and injection of the pro-drug AER-271 reduced brain swelling after MCAO by 33% in mice and 62% in rats. A second study reported the prevention of increased brain water content after cardiac arrest in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Wallisch et al., 2019</xref>). The compound AER-271 was the subject of a phase I clinical trial in the USA to investigate safety and tolerability in 80 healthy volunteers (NCT03804476) but since the trial completion in 2019 no data have been reported. An almost identical trial started in China in 2021 (NCT05200728), which similarly completed in 2023 but has yet to report any data. AER-270 is chemically identical to IMD-0354, a compound used for several decades as a research tool to interfere with NF-κB signaling by inhibition of IKKβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Onai et al., 2004</xref>), blockage of which has been demonstrated to reduce CNS water content after MCAO in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Li et al., 2016</xref>). This highlights the importance of considering off-target effects for these molecules.</p><p id="P8">Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the inhibitory effects of TGN-020 and AER-270 in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, mammalian cells overexpressing AQP4, primary human and rat astrocytes, and recombinant human AQP4 reconstituted into proteoliposomes. We investigate direct binding of both molecules to purified AQP4 protein solubilized in both detergent and styrene maleic acid and use several approaches to identify potential off-target effects.</p><p id="P9">Overall, our data suggest that whilst both TGN-020 and AER-270 appear to inhibit AQP4 in the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte assay, they have no effect on the plasma membrane water permeability of MDCK or HeLa cells overexpressing AQP4, primary human or rat astrocytes, or proteoliposomes containing recombinant human AQP4. Furthermore, we use both hypothesis-based approaches and unbiased target identification to identify several potential off-target effects of both compounds which may explain their <italic>in vivo</italic> effects.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>AER-270 and TGN-020 inhibit AQP4 when assayed using</italic> Xenopus laevis <italic>oocytes</italic></title><p id="P10">The <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte assay has been used as the gold standard for determining aquaporin water permeabilities for over 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Preston et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Agre et al., 1993</xref>). Swelling of oocytes in hypotonic saline solution was therefore recorded using microscopic time-lapse imaging and changes in their cross-sectional area were quantified using ImageJ (representative swelling traces are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1a</xref>). The swelling of each oocyte was measured without compound treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>), and after recovery in isotonic saline, the assay was repeated in the presence of the compound or vehicle control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>), providing a matched pre-inhibition control for each oocyte. An S2/S1 ratio &lt;1 indicates inhibition of water transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Oocytes expressing rat AQP4 exhibited functional water channel expression as demonstrated by a 4-fold higher swelling rate compared to non-AQP4-expressing (uninjected) control oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Incubation with 100 μM TGN-020 or AER-270 for 1 hour significantly reduced swelling rates, with 44±7 and 52±9% inhibition, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b,d,f</xref>). A shorter incubation of 15 minutes had no effect on inhibition by TGN-020, but interestingly AER-270 was more effective at 15 minutes (70±7% inhibition) than at 1 hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c,e,f</xref>), possibly suggesting poor stability of the compound in the assay buffer, rapid metabolism of the drug by <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, desensitization of the target of action, or progressive loss of the compound due to partitioning into in an intracellular compartment such as yolk.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>AER-270 and TGN-020 do not inhibit AQP4 in mammalian cells</title><p id="P11">Although the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte assay is regarded as the gold standard for determining AQP water permeabilities, it is widely acknowledged to suffer from limitations such as inter-laboratory variability and a lack of consistency with other assays of AQP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Salman et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Tradtrantip et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Choi et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, the lipid composition of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte membranes is significantly different from that of most mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hill et al., 2005</xref>). To study the inhibitory effect of AER-270 and TGN-020 in mammalian cells, calcein fluorescence quenching was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Kitchen et al., 2020</xref>) to measure both cell shrinking and swelling in response to hypertonic and hypotonic stimuli, respectively. MDCK and HeLa cells were stably transfected with pDEST47-hAQP4-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Kitchen and Conner, 2015</xref>), which increased membrane water permeability by 6-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to the parental control lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a,b,g,h</xref>; representative raw data shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1e–h</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Neither AER-270 nor TGN-020 altered cell shrinkage rates at concentrations up to 100 or 300 μM, respectively. AER-270 appeared to decrease the cell swelling rate of AQP4-MDCK cells at 50 and 100 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), but we observed significant cytotoxicity at these concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>), making interpretation of this result challenging.</p><p id="P13">The full-length AQP4 transcript has two translation initiation sites, leading to two protein isoforms, the 323 residue M1 isoform and the 301 residue M23 isoform. The relative abundance of these isoforms varies between cell types, likely due to differences in expression or activity of RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Pisani et al., 2021</xref>). Western blotting indicated only the full-length AQP4-M1 isoform was expressed in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1b-d</xref>) stably transfected with full-length AQP4 cDNA, whereas both M1 and M23 were expressed in HeLa cells. To check for isoform-dependent effects, MDCK cells were stably transfected with pDEST47-hAQP4-M23-GFP and the calcein fluorescence quenching assays were repeated. Neither TGN-020 nor AER-270 inhibited AQP4-M23 in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a,b,g,h</xref>). We also found no difference in single channel permeability between M1 and M23 after normalising shrinking rates to cell surface abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1j,k</xref>).</p><p id="P14">As the endogenous AQP4 in astrocytes is the desired pharmacological target for both molecules, we tested the agents on both primary human and rat astrocytes. Neither AER-270 nor TGN-020 inhibited water transport in primary human or rat astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c,d,i,k</xref>; representative raw data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1i</xref>).

As the protein undergoes thermal denaturation, buried cysteine residues become solvent-accessible leading to an increase in the fluorescence intensity of the dye, and small molecule binding is characterized by a shift in the melting profile of the protein, although it has also been suggested that the CPM signal may originate from binding to hydrophobic patches rather than free cysteine residues upon protein unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).

Taken together with the finding that AER-270 reduced AQP4 gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>), our identification of novel targets for AER-270 suggests that there are a variety of plausible alternative mechanisms-of-action that may explain published <italic>in vivo</italic> findings independent of direct AQP4 pore-blocking.</p><p id="P35">Having been identified by the virtual screening of molecules with structural similarities to carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and anti-epileptics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Huber et al., 2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Huber et al., 2009a</xref>), TGN-020 was shown to inhibit water flux in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes expressing human AQP4-M23 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 3.1 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Huber et al., 2009b</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref> confirms the effect of TGN-020 in oocytes.

Comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of the brains of <italic>Aqp4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are currently lacking, so it is not possible to compare our list of TGN-020 PISA hits to proteins that are differentially expressed in <italic>Aqp4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> brains. <italic>Aqp4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have also been reported to have increased blood-brain barrier permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), but reduced glymphatic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Mestre et al., 2018</xref>). These confounding factors are difficult to control for in PET studies, so differences in the PET labelling intensity may also reflect differences in TGN-020 penetration into and clearance from the brain in <italic>Aqp4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Here, we identified adenosine receptors as targets of TGN-020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f,g,h</xref>). In rats, caffeine consumption was reported to acutely decrease CSF production, but chronically increase production due to overexpression of the adenosine A1 receptor in the choroid plexus epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Han et al., 2009</xref>). Adenosine has also been reported to increase cerebral blood flow in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">O'Regan, 2005</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Soricelli et al., 1995</xref>), and this effect could be reduced by selective antagonism of the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor. Given that cerebral blood flow and CSF production both contribute to the magnitude of glymphatic flux, our <italic>in vitro</italic> data on the effect of TGN-020 on the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor and <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of effects on the other three adenosine receptor sub-types suggest a plausible alternative mechanism-of-action by which TGN-020 might exert <italic>in vivo</italic> effects on the glymphatic system.</p><p id="P36">Based on our data for AER-270 and TGN-020 and the existing literature on a variety of other proposed AQP4 inhibitors, it appears that the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte assay system is susceptible to false positive hits.

The quantified abundance of each protein in each technical replicate was normalized to the total intensity of the vehicle control to identify proteins with changed thermal stability (solubility) in the presence of the compound. A two-tailed t-test was employed to calculate the p-value. The target candidates for each compound were identified among the proteins with simultaneously large log10 p-values in all PISA data.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Radioligand binding assay</title><p id="P57">Membrane samples for radioligand binding were prepared to a concentration of 2 mg/mL wet weight of membrane in binding buffer (100 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4)).

The radioligand [<sup>3</sup>H]ZM241385 (American Radiolabelled Chemicals (Royston, UK), specific activity, 80 Ci/mmol) was diluted in binding buffer to yield a final in assay concentration of 80,000 cpm/mL.</p><p id="P59">For all reactions, 5 μL of [<sup>3</sup>H]ZM-241385 and 500 μL of membrane was added to a tube along with 5 μL of either DMSO, unlabelled ZM-241385 or TGN-020. Membranes were incubated with the ligands for 30 minutes at room temperature then centrifuged at 14,000g for 5 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellets washed twice with water to remove any unbound ligand. The pellets were then air dried for 1 hour. 100 μL of soluene was added to each pellet and incubated at room temperature overnight. Samples were mixed well pre and post addition of 1 mL scintillant before liquid scintillation counting.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P60">Prism version 10 (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for all analyses.

Externally applied 100 μM AER-270 or TGN-020 did not affect hyperosmotic shrinking of AQP4 reconstituted proteoliposomes (n=3). (b, c) Binding to recombinant AQP4 in DDM or SMALPs was evaluated by measuring changes of the protein intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Ex 280 nm/Em 336 nm) in the presence of (b) AER-270 (DDM n=3, SMA n=4) or (c) TGN-020 (n=3). Binding affinities (K<sub>d</sub>) were calculated from the compound dose response curve after subtraction of non-specific quenching of free tryptophan (N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide). (d,e) Representative CPM thermal stability fluorescence traces for (d) DDM-AQP4 and (e) SMA-AQP4 in the presence of AER-270. (f) First derivative of fluorescence intensity with respect to temperature was calculated at the melting temperature (Tm) of the vehicle control (DDM n=5, SMA n=4). (g) SMA-solubilized AQP4 shows an increased thermal stability in comparison to DDM-solubilized AQP4 (DDM n=9, SMA n=7). Melting profiles of (h) DDM-AQP4 (n=3) and (i) SMA-AQP4 (n=4) were measured in the presence of TGN-020 and (j) the change in Tm calculated. (a-c, f, g, j).
