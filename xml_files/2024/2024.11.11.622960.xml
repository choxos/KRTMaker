chemicals. Growth of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> on formate was recently achieved by introducing the reductive glycine pathway (rGlyP) into its genome, which is theoretically the most energy- efficient aerobic formate assimilation pathway. While adaptive laboratory evolution was used to enhance the growth rate and biomass yield significantly, still the best performing formatotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strain did not approach the theoretical optimal biomass yield of the rGlyP. In this study, we investigated these previously engineered formatotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains to find out why the biomass yield was sub-optimal and how it may be improved. Through a combination of metabolic modelling, genomic and proteomic analysis, we identified several potential metabolic bottlenecks and future targets for optimization. This study also reveals further insights in the evolutionary mutations and related changes in proteome allocation that supported the already substantially improved growth of formatotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. This systems-level analysis provides key insights to realize high-yield, fast growing formatotrophic strains for future bioproduction.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Escherichia coli</italic></kwd><kwd>metabolic modelling</kwd><kwd>C1-assimilation</kwd><kwd>formate</kwd><kwd>Reductive Glycine Pathway</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> originating from fossil resources are a global problem leading to a climate crisis with potentially disastrous consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. A promising alternative to fossil-based production methods is microbial bioproduction of value-added chemicals and fuels. However, current microbial bioproduction processes often rely on agriculture-intensive feedstocks like glucose, which compete for arable land and resources with food production, and thus cannot be scaled to the extend required to replace fossil resources. Therefore, one-carbon compounds such as formate, methanol, methane, and carbon monoxide are being explored as sustainable feedstocks for microbial bioproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Formate and methanol are particularly of interest due to their high solubility in water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. These compounds can be produced directly (formate) or in two steps (methanol) by electrochemical reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> using electricity derived from renewable resources. In this work we focus on formate as a feedstock.</p><p id="P3">Some natural formate-utilizing microbes have been identified, but few have been well-characterized, and they generally lack effective and robust genetic engineering tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Consequently, optimization of metabolic pathways in most natural formatotrophs is difficult and engineering of novel (production) pathways is often not feasible. In order to explore beyond the limited product spectrum offered by natural formatotrophs, formate assimilation pathways can instead be introduced in model hosts like <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Several natural and synthetic formate assimilation pathways have been described, such as the Calvin Benson Bassham (CBB) cycle, the Serine Cycle, the Wood-Ljungdahl Pathway, the Serine-Threonine Cycle, and the reductive Glycine Pathway (rGlyP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. The rGlyP is the most energy efficient aerobic formate assimilation pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] and was first designed by Bar-Even et al. in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] and later discovered in the natural formatotroph and autotroph <italic>Desulfovibrio desulfuricans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Soon after design of the pathway, efforts to engineer the rGlyP in <italic>E. coli</italic> started through a step-wise, modular engineering approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p><p id="P4">The rGlyP in <italic>E. coli</italic> consists of an energy generation reaction and a formate assimilation route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The energy generation reaction is catalyzed by a heterologously expressed formate dehydrogenase from <italic>Pseudomonas sp</italic>. strain 101 (PsFDH), which oxidizes formate to CO<sub>2</sub> to regenerate NADH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. The formate assimilation route was subdivided into three modules to facilitate stepwise integration and confirmation of individual modules in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In the first (C1) module, formate is ligated to tetrahydrofolate (THF) at the expense of ATP and reduced to 5,10-methylene-THF by three heterologously expressed enzymes originating from <italic>Methylorubrum extorquens</italic> (formerly <italic>Methylobacterium extorquens)</italic>. Next, in the C2 module the C1 moiety of 5,10-methylene-THF is condensed with CO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> resulting in the two-carbon amino acid glycine. This reaction is catalyzed by the (overexpressed) native glycine cleavage system (Gcv) of <italic>E. coli</italic>, operating in the reverse (reductive) direction, driven in this direction by elevated CO<sub>2</sub>concentrations.</p><p id="P5">Finally, in the C3 module, glycine is ligated with another C1 moiety from 5,10-methylene-THF and converted to the C3 amino acid serine and then into pyruvate, by the native serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GlyA) and serine deaminase (SdaA), respectively. Pyruvate can then be converted to various biomass components via native metabolic pathways and possibly also into various bioproducts.</p><p id="P6">In 2020, Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], achieved full formatotrophic growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> by introducing the complete rGlyP into its genome and overexpressing the native enzymes involved in the rGlyP. This initial strain was named K4 and had a doubling time (DT) of 65-80 h on 28 mM of formate. K4 served as a base strain for further engineering to investigate and improve formatotrophic growth. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref> gives an overview of growth rates of the various formatotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains derived from K4.</p><p id="P7">Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) was applied to the K4 strain by Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], resulting in the K4e strain, which grew at a DT of 7.7 h on 153 mM formate. Thus, ALE achieved here not only an increased growth rate but also increased formate tolerance as the parental strain K4 did not grow at formate concentrations above ~60 mM. Two key mutations were further investigated for involvement in this vast growth improvement. These mutations appeared to increase expression of the NADH-regenerating PsFDH, and the native membrane bound transhydrogenase complex (PntAB), which regenerates NADPH by oxidizing NADH. These two mutations were reverse engineered in the naive K4 strain, which did improve growth rate and formate tolerance substantially, but not completely to the extent of the K4e. Unlike K4e, the reconstructed strain (K4 g-FDH* g-PntAB*) did not grow on 153 mM formate. On 109 mM formate the reconstructed strain had a DT of 9.7 h, which is slightly slower than the 7.9 h DT of K4e at the same formate concentration.</p><p id="P8">After further ALE on K4e, Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] isolated four variants of an even further evolved strain (K4e2), which had a DT of only 6 h on 150 mM formate and a further improved formate tolerance, as well as an increased biomass yield compared to K4e from 2.3 to 3.3 g<sub>CDW</sub> mol<sup>-1</sup> formate. The growth improvement of K4e2 was in part attributed to decreased acetate production due to a mobile genetic element integration interrupting the promotor region of the gene encoding acetate kinase (<italic>ackA</italic>).</p><p id="P9">Acetate kinase and phosphate acetyltransferase (Pta) together catalyze the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetate. During fast growth on glucose, this conversion is used as part of overflow metabolism to allow faster growth by investing less resources into respiratory chain enzymes while still yielding some energy. However, acetate production during growth on formate via the rGlyP is unfavorable as it has a net energy cost and does not contribute to biomass formation. Furthermore, the potential re-uptake of acetate costs additional ATP. Hence, Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], subsequently deleted the full <italic>ackA-pta</italic> operon in K4e2 as a more stable and rational approach to decrease acetate production, which resulted in slightly better growth than K4e2 with the interrupted <italic>ackA</italic> promoter. This <italic>ackA-pta</italic> deletion was also reconstructed in the predecessor strain K4e. However, while the reconstructed strain K4e Î<italic>ackA-pta</italic> had a decreased DT (from 8.5 to 7.2 h on 150 mM formate), it did not grow as fast as the fully evolved K4e2 Î<italic>ackA-pta</italic> (6.4 h). Thus, it appears that blocking acetate production through the AckA-Pta route does not explain the full extent of the K4e2 improvement over K4e. Other mutations in all four isolates of K4e2 were found in genes encoding the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex regulator (PdhR) and RNA polymerase subunit Î²â (RpoC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p><p id="P10">In a parallel effort, full formatotrophic growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> via the rGlyP was also demonstrated in another study, however, the best strain resulting from this study (FC8) had a maximum growth rate of only ~65 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P11">To summarize, while some mutations have been demonstrated to contribute to the growth improvement of the evolved strains K4e and K4e2 over their parental strain K4, there should be other mutations also contributing to the improved growth phenotypes of the evolved strains. In this study we further investigated the <italic>E. coli</italic> K4, K4e, and K4e2 strains at a genomic and proteomic level to further identify mutations and their effects on protein levels, aiming to further understand how <italic>E. coli</italic> evolved towards more optimal formatotrophic growth.</p><p id="P12">The K4e and K4e2 strains have recently also been used as proof-of-principle studies to make relevant bioproducts lactate and polyhydrobutyrate from formate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. However, the resulting production levels and rates are much too low for economically and sustainable bioproduction from formate. Furthermore, while the formatotrophic growth of K4e2 is much improved over the parental K4 strain, the growth rate and biomass yield are still relatively low compared to natural formatotrophs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. This is indicates that the formatotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains still have inefficiencies, such as bottlenecks or sub optimal fluxes in their metabolism, that limit biomass yields and productivities. Therefore, we combined in this work the omics-based approaches with metabolic modelling of the <italic>E. coli</italic> rGlyP metabolism to discover bottlenecks and potential targets for further optimization of these strains for improved growth on formate.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Strains and culture conditions</title><p id="P13">The formatotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains used in this study are listed in Table 1.

In addition, pathway efficiency was computed by setting maintenance requirements to zero. When calculating the cost of individual metabolites, we confirmed that the given metabolite had a net cost of ATP, NADH, and NADPH. While growth on formate virtually always resulted in a net cost of these energy carriers, growth on glucose for instance could for some metabolites result in a net yield of one energy carrier and a net cost of another, leading to conversions of energy carriers that would not be necessary (to the same degree) in full biomass production.</p><p id="P28">To estimate the potential to generate ATP, NADH or NADPH conversion reactions were introduced converting each of them to their low energy form (ADP, NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup>, respectively).

The most efficient and direct way to derive energy from formate is through its oxidation by heterologously introduced formate dehydrogenase (PsFDH), which regenerates NADH. In turn, NADH powers the regeneration of other energy carriers. Alternatively, NADH could be regenerated in the TCA cycle, which costs more than twice as much formate per NADH regenerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A</xref>). The costs of regenerating these energy carriers includes the cost of importing formate into the cytoplasm. The mechanism and energetics of formate import into the cytoplasm are not completely understood, though previous studies have suggested that an additional proton is needed to import formate (CHOO<sup>-</sup>) as neutral formic acid (CHOOH), either through diffusion through the membrane or through the hydrophobic center of the FocA transporter located in the inner membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Recently, Vanyan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] showed that in <italic>E. coli</italic>, import of exogenously added formate into the cytoplasm dissipated the proton motive force (PMF), further supporting the notion that formate is likely symported with one (or more) protons. Therefore, the formate import reaction in the model also imports one proton per imported formate. This is why for instance NADH regeneration by PsFDH costs 1.14 formate per NADH, the 0.14 additional costs reflects the energy costs for transport.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><label>3.2</label><title>NADPH regeneration by membrane-bound transhydrogenase is optimal</title><p id="P34">The first part of the rGlyP oxidizes one NADPH to NADP<sup>+</sup> for each assimilated formate, leading to a high demand for NADPH regeneration.

For instance, the NAD<sup>+</sup>-specific PsFDH enzyme was previously engineered to achieve high kinetic efficiency and specificity for NADPH regeneration. While the strains analyzed in this study do not possess an NADPH-regenerating FDH and thus are unable to perform this route, introducing such an enzyme in would be a promising avenue for future optimization of formatotrophic growth.</p><p id="P36">The most efficient route currently possible in the formatotrophic strains utilizes membrane bound transhydrogenase (PntAB) to trans hydrogenate NADH into NADPH at the cost of one proton translocated into the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 B</xref>). Kim et al. (2020) found mutations in the promotor of the <italic>pntAB</italic> operon, as well as the 5âUTR of the gene encoding PsFDH in the K4e strain, which appeared to increase transcript levels for both. Our proteomics findings also show that the abundance of both these proteins increased, PntAB appeared to be ~11-13 fold higher in the K4e2 strain on formate than in the glucose reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P37">The second most efficient route for NADPH regeneration predicted by the model is a cycle that converts NADH to NADPH via acetaldehyde (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 C</xref>). This cycle starts by first reducing acetyl-CoA with NADH to acetaldehyde and subsequent oxidation to acetate by regeneration of NADPH, catalyzed by two acetaldehyde dehydrogenases (AdhE and AldB respectively). Next, acetate is converted back to acetyl-CoA (costing the equivalent of 2 ATP), by acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acs). This route costs an additional 0.42 mol formate per mol NADPH regenerated compared to the PntAB route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A</xref>). We observed increased proteomic abundance of AdhE and Acs on formate compared to glucose, but decreased levels of AldB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Since AldB is the NADPH regenerating reaction, it appears that this route is not being used for NADPH regeneration. According to the model prediction, AdhE should carry no flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), thus may be a suitable target for knock-out.</p><p id="P38">The next two routes for NADPH regeneration use glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf) in the (oxidative) Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) to produce gluconate-6-phospate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 D</xref>). Gluconate-6P can either be oxidized to ribulose-5- phospate to regenerate a second NADPH by 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Gnd) or it can be dehydrated to 2-dehydro-3- deoxy-D-gluconate-6-phosphate by phosphogluconate dehydratase (Edd). The Zwf-Gnd route and Zwf-Edd route (known as the Entner Doudoroff pathway) respectively use 0.57 mol and 1.57 mol more formate than the PntAB route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A</xref>). Hence the model predicts no flux should go through these routes during growth on formate. However, during growth on glucose Zwf-Gnd is one of the key NADPH regeneration routes as also observed in the model simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P39">Interestingly, proteomics indicated a higher abundance of Zwf on formate than on glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Notably, the gene encoding Zwf is also known as one of the most consistently flux-coupled genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Zwf is regulated by the SoxRS regulon and this regulatory mechanism is controlled by NADPH levels. Low NADPH levels during rGlyP on formate may be a possible explanation for the upregulation of Zwf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. Thus, Zwf appears to be a suitable candidate for downregulation or even knock-out, as this upregulation may lead to less efficient NADPH regeneration than via PntAB.</p><p id="P40">The final NADPH regeneration pathway discussed here is a pyruvate-malate cycle that uses malic enzyme B (MaeB) to decarboxylate malate to pyruvate. Pyruvate is then converted back to malate via phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) and oxaloacetate, catalyzed by PEP synthase (Pps), PEP carboxylase (Ppc), and malate dehydrogenase (Mdh) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 E</xref>). This cycle costs one formate more for NADPH regeneration than the PntAB route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A</xref>), and requires MaeB to catalyze in its malate-decarboxy lati ng direction. However, it is uncertain which direction MaeB operates <italic>in vivo</italic> during growth on formate, since the conditions during formatotrophic growth (including elevated CO<sub>2</sub>) may push this reversible reaction more towards carboxylation. MaeB levels appear to be higher on formate than on glucose, which could mean that this enzyme is regenerating NADPH, if it does operate in the decarboxylating direction. Alternatively, if MaeB is operating in the carboxylating direction, it may be used for biomass formation, which is further discussed below.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><label>3.3</label><title>ATP production by NADH dehydrogenase II and cytochrome bo<sub>3</sub> is optimal</title><p id="P41">There are various routes for generating the proton motive force (PMF) required for the production of ATP and for other PMF-driven reactions (e.g. NADPH regeneration by membrane-bound transhydrogenase, formate import, etc.). The efficiency of these routes was compared in terms of formate cost per ATP regenerated. By far the stoichiometrically most efficient route for ATP regeneration on formate uses NADH dehydrogenase I (Nuo complex) combined with cytochrome bo<sub>3</sub> (Cyo complex) to oxidize NADH and pump protons out of the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A</xref>). Some of the other, less efficient options use combinations with other dehydrogenases and oxidases, namely: NADH dehydrogenase II (Ndh), cytochrome <italic>bd-I / bd-II</italic> (Cyd complex / App complex), and formate dehydrogenase N / O (Fdn complex / Fdo complex). Formate dehydrogenase N and O are native membrane proteins that reduce menaquinone, not to be confused with the heterologous NAD<sup>+</sup> -reducing PsFDH.</p><p id="P42">The model predicted that flux through the Nuo and Cyo complexes should be 1.9 and 1.6-fold higher on formate than on glucose respectively, and that the other routes for PMF generation should carry no flux for optimal biomass yield on formate. The difference in ATP requirement is because during the breakdown of glucose to major biomass precursors there is net ATP production unlike for formate assimilation, which consumes ATP. In addition, the model predicts that ubiquinol is produced in the TCA cycle during growth on glucose but not on formate, which further contributes to the increased flux on formate vs. glucose. However, proteomics showed that NuoBCEFGI had on average 4 fold higher levels in <italic>E. coli</italic> on glucose than in K4e2 of formate, while the other subunits (NuoAHJKLMN) were not detected in the proteomic analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). CyoA was approximately 14-fold higher in the glucose condition than on formate, but CyoBCD were not detected either. The seemingly lower abundances of Nuo and Cyo on formate contradicts what the model predicts as optimal, and may thus be suitable targets for upregulation. However, it may also be that in this case protein abundance does not reflect flux, due to for instance differences in substrate or product concentrations (e.g. NADH:NAD ratio) or post translational modifications. Furthermore, too high activity of these respiratory chain enzymes may lower the NADH:NAD ratio too much, which would likely be unfavorable for the thermodynamic feasibility of glycine production by the glycine cleavage system in the rGlyP. Thus, fine-tuning the expression of the Nuo and Cyo subunits may be needed.</p><p id="P43">Many of the enzymes involved in the less efficient routes for ATP regeneration were not detected or showed contradicting trends for their different subunits.

However, energy generation during growth on formate is most efficiently done directly by PsFDH, while operation of the full TCA cycle is relatively inefficient as mentioned previously. During growth on formate, the TCA cycle is therefore only needed to produce biomass precursors.</p><p id="P45">The model thus predicts lower flux through almost all TCA cycle enzymes on formate compared to glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The TCA cycle section between oxaloacetate and alpha-ketoglutarate still carries flux to fulfil the demand of the precursor alpha-ketoglutarate, which requires about 10 times less flux than for growth on glucose. The section between alpha-ketoglutarate and fumarate is predicted to carry no flux in the oxidative direction during growth on formate. Succinyl-CoA is the remaining (minor) biomass precursor in the TCA cycle. A small amount is needed as a CoA donor for the biosynthesis of the amino acids lysine and methionine. This amino acid synthesis releases succinate again, which can be recycled back to succinyl-CoA in the TCA cycle via succinyl-CoA synthetase (SucCD). Hence, only very low fluxes towards succinate or succinyl-CoA are needed for biosynthesis and to sustain the succinate/succinyl-CoA pool in the cells. The model suggests this flux could come from the reductive direction via fumarate, through fumarate reductase. However, in <italic>E. coli</italic>, fumarate reductase is usually only active under anaerobic conditions.</p><p id="P46">In the last section of the TCA cycle, malate dehydrogenase (Mdh) carries substantial flux. This is related to its involvement in the stoichiometrically most efficient route to produce oxaloacetate and PEP, as will be explained below.</p><p id="P47">Contrary to the expectations based on optimal flux distribution for formatotrophic growth, proteomics indicate that several TCA cycle enzymes have higher abundances during growth on formate than during growth on glucose (e.g. citrate synthase: GltA, aconitase: AcnA, and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase: SucAB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P48">Though it is unknown whether these increased levels of GltA, AcnA, and SucAB also lead to increased flux, SucA has been identified as a flux-coupled gene (meaning the qualitative change in abundance was closely linked to the qualitative change in flux) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Since SucAB should carry no flux according to our model prediction, the genes encoding this enzyme complex (sucA-sucB) could be a suitable target for knock-out (or knock-down to allow some succinyl-CoA biosynthesis) to decrease wasteful TCA cycle flux and improve formatotrophic growth efficiency.</p><p id="P49">Citrate synthase (GltA) is known to be subject to catabolite repression during growth on glucose, which may explain why its expression is higher on formate than on glucose. Since flux through GltA should be approximately 10-fold lower on formate than glucose according to the model, the gene encoding GltA is a potential target for down regulation. Expression tuning of AcnA may be less important if GltA-tuning can limit the flux into the TCA cycle.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><label>3.5</label><title>Carboxylating malic enzyme most efficient route to oxaloacetate and PEP for growth on formate</title><p id="P50">Oxaloacetate and alpha-ketoglutarate are two major precursors for the production of amino acids and nucleotides, and respectively support roughly ~17% and ~12% of biomass production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>].

However, the model predicts that oxaloacetate would be generated through a more efficient route, via NADPH-dependent reduction and carboxylation of pyruvate into malate via malic enzyme MaeB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 B</xref>). This reaction is in the typical <italic>E. coli</italic> model assumed to proceed in the reverse oxidative direction.

Hence, the model predicts for growth on formate that all flux towards PEP proceeds from oxaloacetate through PEP carboxykinase (PckA). Relatedly, the model predicts no flux to go via PEP synthetase (PpsA) and PEP carboxylase (Ppc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). However, analysis of the proteome showed that there was an increased level of the latter two enzymes in the <italic>E. coli</italic> strains during growth on formate, whereas the NADPH-dependent enzyme MaeB is also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, possibly downregulation of PpsA and Ppc and/or further upregulation of MaeB could potentially increase the yield on formate. For the latter we assume that the reaction through MaeB can indeed proceed fast enough in the carboxylating direction and that the metabolic flux is not yet fully going through that enzyme in the evolved strains.

However, somewhat surprisingly, proteomics indicate that AceB has a 13-fold higher level in K4e2 on formate than in the glucose reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Hence, AceB may be a suitable knock-out or downregulation target, to prevent unnecessary proteome allocation to this likely unused enzyme.

The mutation in <italic>gspL</italic> is a silent mutation (G138G C-&gt;T). This gene is part of an operon that is transcriptionally repressed under standard laboratory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] and this protein was not detected in any of the proteomes we analyzed. The mutations in <italic>metF</italic> (A280V) and <italic>fabR</italic> (G42V) are amino acid substitutions.</p><p id="P64">MetF catalyzes the NADH-dependent reduction of 5,10-methylene-THF to 5-methyl-THF, which is part of a native <italic>E. coli</italic> route for methionine synthesis. However, since 5,10-methylene-THF is also an intermediate metabolite in the rGlyP and hence maybe be present in higher concentrations during growth on formate via the rGlyP, MetF expression/activity may need to be downregulated. Proteomics analysis indicates that MetF is indeed somewhat less abundant in K4e than in K4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 A</xref>), in addition the amino acid substitution may potentially alter activity further as the substituted amino acid is directly next to an active site residue involved in substrate binding.</p><p id="P65">FabR is a transcriptional repressor for the two type II fatty acid synthase enzymes (FabA and FabB), thereby impacting membrane lipid homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Proteomics analysis indicates that FabR is less abundant in K4e than in K4, and that FabA and FabB are slightly upregulated in K4e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 A</xref>). However, it is unclear if this upregulation is beneficial for growth on formate and what the mechanistic explanation would be.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><label>3.10</label><title>Further improved growth of K4e2 due to reduced acetate production, potentially increased Gcv capacity and further proteomic changes</title><p id="P66">The further growth improvement of K4e2 over K4e was attributed in part to a mutation in the 5âUTR of the <italic>Î±ckA-ptÎ±</italic> operon, leading to decreased acetate production, as observed by Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Proteomics indeed showed a strong downregulation of AckA and Pta in K4e2 compared to K4e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 B</xref>). In addition, acetate reuptake using Acs also appears to be downregulated in K4e2 compared to K4e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8 C</xref>), though it is not as low as for growth on glucose at the same growth rate (at this growth rate glucose metabolism does not lead to acetate overflow and hence no uptake is required). However, the level of pyruvate oxidase (PoxB) is up in all rGlyP strains compared to glucose. PoxB is a membrane protein coupled to the electron transport chain and converts pyruvate to acetate, which may explain why there is still some production of acetate, even in the <italic>kAeÎÎ±ckA-ptÎ±</italic> as Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] reported. Thus, the gene encoding PoxB is likely also a good target for knock-out.</p><p id="P67">Additionally, Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] also identified an amino acid substitution in PdhR and RpoC in K4e2, which likely explains the remainder of the growth differences between K4e2 and K4e.</p><p id="P68">Since RpoC is a subunit of RNA polymerase involved in DNA binding, it can act as a global regulator of gene expression and is often found mutated in ALE experiments on <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 for a range of experimental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. While proteomics indicates abundance of RpoC is barely changed in K4e2 compared to K4e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 B</xref>), the amino acid substitution likely influences RpoC activity. The exact RpoC mutation in K4e2 (A919V) has been reported previously by Szalewska-Palasz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>] to bypass requirement of the alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) for transcription from sigma-54 promoters. This signaling molecule is involved in the stringent response which is activated during nutrient starvation. ppGpp has many targets, and is for instance involved in decreasing DNA replication and changes in transcriptional profile, inhibiting ribosome maturation and protein translation activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. Possibly, the RpoC mutation could impact transcription levels from starvation sigma-54 promoters compared to the (maintenance associated) sigma-70 promoters. Proteomics showed an increase of proteins expressed from confirmed sigma-54 promoters in K4e2 compared to K4 and K4e, though this could be (partially) caused by differences in growth rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). It is known that some sigma-54 genes are associated with nitrogen fixation, though many are not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. However, even if the RpoC mutation influences transcription from sigma-54 promoters, it is unclear which (if any) of the impacted genes are contributing to the improved growth of K4e2.</p><p id="P69">PdhR regulates expression of an operon which encodes the components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex (Pdh), namely pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component (AceE), pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 subunit (AceF), and lipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd). We found that levels of PdhR, AceEF, and Lpd are higher in K4e2 compared to K4, K4e, and WT <italic>E. coli</italic> grown on glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8 B</xref>), possibly as a result of the PdhR mutation in K4e2. Increased expression of Pdh may not be advantageous since the flux through Pdh should be about three times lower during growth on formate than on glucose, according to the predicted fluxes for optimal yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). However, Lpd is also a component of the glycine cleavage system enzyme complex (Gcv), together with aminomethyltransferase (GcvT), glycine cleavage system H protein (GcvH), and glycine decarboxylase (GcvP). The GcvTHP operon was overexpressed by Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] in K4 to allow growth on formate as the Gcv catalyzes a key reaction in the rGlyP. They did not overexpress Lpd as it was not essential. As expected, proteomics showed increased levels of GcvTHP in the K4 strains on formate compared to WT <italic>E. coli</italic> on glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8 A</xref>). We observe that Lpd levels are similar in K4 and K4e on formate, and slightly higher in those strains compared to WT <italic>E. coli</italic> on glucose, but approximately 2-fold higher in K4e2. The upregulation of Lpd in K4e2 may contribute to the strains improved growth on formate by increasing Gcv levels. If this is the case, it may be even better to specifically upregulate Lpd, but not AceEF.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><label>3.11</label><title>rGlyP strains show trend towards larger proteome fraction of central carbon metabolism</title><p id="P70">The large differences in growth rates between the K4, K4e, and K4e2 strains on formate likely both result from and cause differences in their overall proteome allocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9 A</xref>). A notable difference is that the rGlyP fraction of the proteome increased after ALE from approximately 10% in K4, to 13% in K4e, and 16% in K4e2, mainly due to changes in PsFDH and the GCV system. PsFDH abundance largely increased between the K4 and K4e from 0.3% to 3.7% and is even slightly more abundant in K4e2 (4.3%). This increase likely explains a large part of the improved growth between K4 and K4e, as this relatively slow enzyme (k<sub>cat</sub> ~10s<sup>-1</sup>) is responsible for all energy supply in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. A further increase of the PsFDH level may boost growth even more, but maybe also burden a large part of the proteome. An alternative may be the use of faster metal-cofactor dependent FDH enzymes, such as the molybdenum-dependent formate dehydrogenase from the natural formatotroph C. <italic>necator</italic>. In another study, the rGlyP was implemented in C. necator and in this study it was determined that the CnFdh occupied only ~1.6% of the proteome to reach doubling times of ~10 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. This FDH may also be functionally implemented in formatotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. Recently, Schulz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>] demonstrated the functional expression of the CnFdh in an <italic>E. coli</italic> NADH sensor strain, which was able to generate all NADH required for <italic>E. coli</italic>. Incorporation of a faster Fdh like CnFDH in K4e2 may be a promising approach to improve growth rate on formate, and an alternative to further increasing overexpression of PsFDH.</p><p id="P71">The assimilation modules of the rGlyP (C1, C2 and C3) form a relatively stable part of the proteome throughout the different strains. Only between K4e and K4e2, the relative fraction of the C2 module substantially increased from 4.5 to 5.9 %. This is mostly related to the earlier discussed increase in the Lpd enzyme, as well as the GcvT and GcvH proteins that take part in the GCV system. While the kinetics of the GCV system are poorly characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>], considering the turnover numbers and the small thermodynamic driving force of this reaction, it is likely that GCV also serves as a bottleneck in the rGlyP pathway. Relatedly, its increased abundance may have contributed to the faster growth rate of K4e2 over K4e.</p><p id="P72">In total the rGlyP forms a high proportion of the proteome (up to 16%), but during growth on glucose at a similar growth rate to K4e2, the main pathways for carbon assembly and energy generation (glycolysis and TCA cycle) also occupy 13% of the proteome. In addition, several enzymes in the rGlyP have relatively slow kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. Furthermore, the rGlyP reactions have to carry higher fluxes of the single-carbon substrate formate, than the fluxes required during the growth on six-carbon substrate glucose in glycolysis and TCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, an open question remains whether improving the abundance of rGlyP enzymes in the pathway could further boost the growth rate, and which are the bottleneck enzymes in this pathway that would be most essential to further increase.</p><p id="P73">In the formatotrophic strains, especially in K4e, a large part of the proteome is still taken up by the TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt (6.1 and 5.5% respectively in K4e), which according to the optimal flux distribution should carry very low or no flux during optimal formatotrophic growth. In K4e2, the fraction of the TCA cycle is already reduced further (to 4.1%) and the glyoxylate shunt occupies a much lower fraction (1.3%), partly because the gene encoding AceA is not present in K4e2.</p><p id="P74">While the full oxidative TCA cycle does not provide a net biomass yield since it oxidizes the carbon that is fed into it to CO<sub>2</sub>, its activity can be inferred by analyzing the biomass produced from TCA cycle intermediates. Hereto, Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] performed labelling experiments using formate and/or CO<sub>2</sub> made from the <sup>13</sup>C isotope of carbon and measured the abundance of <sup>13</sup>C in several amino acids produced by K4e. In their experiments, threonine (which is produced from oxaloacetate) would be differently labelled depending on whether oxaloacetate was produced through the anapleurotic reactions from pyruvate, or through the TCA cycle via acetyl-CoA. They found that while most threonine was produced through anapleurotic routes, approximately 23% still appeared to come from acetyl-CoA, indicating that the oxidative TCA cycle was still active to some extent. In contrast, Claassens et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] performed similar <sup>13</sup>C-labeling experiments with the rGlyP in C. <italic>necator</italic>, showing only 12% of threonine came via acetyl-CoA, which may contribute to higher biomass yield of their engineered C. <italic>necator</italic> strain (2.6 g<sub>CDW</sub> mol<sup>-1</sup> formate) compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> K4e (2.3 g<sub>CDW</sub> mol<sup>-1</sup> formate).</p><p id="P75">For further optimization of both the protein allocation, and potentially also to reduce wasteful acetyl-CoA oxidation through the TCA cycle, a further reduction of TCA cycle abundance could potentially increase the formatotrophic growth of <italic>E. coli</italic>. Residual TCA cycle flux on the K4e2 may be one of the key wasteful processes that explain the yield gap between the observed and theoretical maximum yield for formatotrophic growth.</p><p id="P76">In addition to rGlyP proteins, we observed a high abundance of outer membrane porins OmpC and OmpA in the formatotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">figure 9 B</xref>). Both proteins are known to mediate permeability of the outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. They were found <italic>in vitro</italic> to form nonspecific diffusion channels through which various small molecules can passively diffuse, including some sugars and antibiotics, and in the case of OmpC also ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>]. Thus, these proteins may also facilitate diffusion of formic acid (and perhaps formate) through the outer membrane. However, since all three formatotrophic strains showed this high abundance of OmpC and OmpA compared to the glucose reference, it is unclear whether their expression is upregulated response to growth conditions, or whether this is caused by a genetic difference between the reference and the formatotrophic strains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S27" sec-type="conclusions"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P77">We investigated the metabolism and proteome of the engineered formatotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains K4, K4e, and K4e2 grown on formate, and compared the latter to <italic>E. coli</italic> grown on glucose. We aimed to gain a better understanding of the metabolic differences between these strains and to identify avenues for further improvement of formatotrophic growth by rational engineering. We identified several potential metabolic bottlenecks and inefficient routes in the formatotrophic metabolism of K4e2.</p><p id="P78">We found that, despite high expression of the heterologous PsFDH that efficiently regenerates NADH, the K4e2 strain may still be using the full TCA cycle for energy generation on formate as well, which is highly inefficient. Thus, improved yield during growth on formate may be achieved by downregulating expression of genes encoding key enzymes in this cycle, such as GltA and SucAB. Furthermore, while the optimal route for NADPH regeneration through PntAB is overexpressed, there may still be a bottleneck for NADPH, possibly contributing to utilization of less efficient NADPH regeneration routes, such as those using Zwf. Thus, knockout of Zwf and stronger overexpression of PntAB may also help improve the metabolic efficiency and biomass yield.</p><p id="P79">While malate decarboxylation by MaeB is part of another highly inefficient NADPH regeneration cycle, we suggest that MaeB could operate in reverse (pyruvate carboxylating) direction under formatotrophic growth conditions. This carboxylating activity would allow production of biomass precursors (such as oxaloacetate and PEP) through a more efficient route than the alternative via Pps and Ppc. If this is the case, upregulation of MaeB combined with downregulation or knock-out of Pps and Ppc could help promote this more efficient biomass production route.</p><p id="P80">When comparing the genomes and proteomes of the three formatotrophic strains, we identified some mutations that may contribute to their differences in growth on formate. For instance, we found a mutation in strain K4e in a branching point of the rGlyP with native metabolism (MetF) which may contribute to its improved formatotrophic growth compared to its ancestor K4.</p><p id="P81">To conclude, our investigation provides insight into the metabolic landscape of engineered and evolved formatotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, thereby elucidating critical areas for improvement in efficiently utilizing formate as a renewable feedstock for bioproduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Our findings offer a roadmap for future rational engineering endeavors aimed at maximizing the efficiency of synthetic formatotrophy. Addressing the identified metabolic bottlenecks and fine-tuning expression targets could pave the way towards industrial applications of formate-based bioproduction systems as sustainable alternative to traditional petrochemical production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Data 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS200103-supplement-Supplementary_Data_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d50aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figures and Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS200103-supplement-Supplementary_Figures_and_Tables.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d50aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S28"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Seohyoung Kim, Steffen Lindner, and Arren Bar-Even, for creating and donating the strains used in this study and for their advice and support.
