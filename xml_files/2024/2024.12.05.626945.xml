Subjective dimensions of stress perception, such as perceived control, are especially potent in shaping stress responses. While the impact of reduced or no control over stress is well understood, much less is known about whether heightened feelings of control buffer against the negative impact of later stress. We designed a novel paradigm with excellent psychometric properties to sensitively capture and induce different states of subjective control. Across two studies with a non-clinical sample of 768 adults, we show a robust association between sense of control and stress as well as symptoms of mental ill-health. More importantly, in a subsample of 295 participants we show that compared to a neutral control group, inducing a heightened state of subjective control buffers against the impact of later stress. These findings demonstrate a causal role for a heightened sense of control in mitigating the negative impact of stressful experiences and spell out important directions for future preventative interventions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Individuals have control when their actions are causally involved in achieving beneficial outcomes or avoiding undesired ones. Having control allows engaging in a suite of proactive goal-directed behaviours and offers rewards for exploration, which the absence of control does not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Decades of work have demonstrated the motivational significance of experiences of control over one’s environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] and their fundamental role in psychological well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] and resilience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The power of control to organise behaviour has been argued to originate from a fundamental need of humans (and many other species) to be effective in their interactions with the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. A wealth of cross-species work has also identified having control as a crucial moderator of how potentially stressful events are processed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Despite the significant risk stress poses to mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], the relationship between the experience of stress and control remains poorly understood.</p><p id="P3">Two core questions remain poorly understood. First, a wealth of evidence suggests that subjective aspects of a range of phenomena, including maltreatment, social hierarchy, loneliness and pain appear to be highly predictive of outcomes, such as well-being and mental health, and often more so than objective classifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Indeed, it has long been noted that the impact of objective control will only be relevant if it is perceived and recognised as such [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Thus, perceived or subjective dimensions of control play a crucial role in functioning across social, academic and mental health domains throughout the lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. However, to date, the affective properties of experiences of control remain poorly understood [though see here for studies on perceptions of control and positive affect 19, 20-23]. In particular, it is unclear how momentary subjective sense of control relates to subjective reports of stress.</p><p id="P4">The second question is about the effect of increased control. Converging lines of evidence have shown that subjective control has a critical role in shaping the impact of stressors on a host of different outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Systematic experimental work in animals over the last 50 years has also causally demonstrated the critical role of control over stress in determining later outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. In classic empirical assays, caged rodents are exposed to shocks that terminate irrespective of any action taken. As a result of such operationalised non-contingency between actions and outcomes, or uncontrollability of a stressor, rodents fail to learn to escape from subsequent stressors, more so than rodents previously not exposed to stress. Thus, an absence of control leads to learned helplessness in novel contexts. Additional effects of such uncontrollable stress include reduced aggression, social dominance, and extinction learning as well as increased fear conditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>], a cascade of negative outcomes that has been interpreted as indexing a behavioural phenotype of internalising disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Intriguingly, much less is known about the effects conferred by heightened control. Animal work found that exposure to controllable stress (compared to no stress at all) effectively inoculates against the negative impact of a subsequent stressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. Similar, empirical approaches in humans have shown that stressor controllability modulates fear extinction learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. To date, however, it is unclear whether heightened control can actually buffer against the effect of a subsequent stressor in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>].</p><p id="P5">To address these questions, we designed a novel task (the “Wheel Stopping” task or WS task) requiring carefully timed actions to achieve a reward or avoid reward losses that allows inducing and measuring different states of subjective control. We first show that the task has excellent psychometric properties with high internal consistency and external validity. We then show strong and consistent associations between sense of control and stress in a non-clinical adult sample (N = 473, Study 1; N = 295, Study 2). Manipulating control has often presented challenges given potential confounds of task difficulty, predictability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] and the probability of action and reward outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Existing tasks manipulate the degree of control rather coarsely through entirely present or absent control affordances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Here, we verify that the relationship between subjective control and stress are apparent above and beyond the variance accounted for by perceived task difficulty. We then use the task to examine the effect of <italic>heightened control</italic> on the response to future stressors. By manipulating subjective control during the task, we show that heightened sense of control buffers against the effects of a subsequent stressor (N = 295; Study 2). Given the pervasive occurrence of stress and its wide-reaching negative impact, these findings have considerable translational potential.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Design</title><p id="P6">The core task (Wheel Stopping or WS task) to manipulate subjective feelings of control in both Studies 1 and 2, required participants to stop a spinning wheel in the correct place using a keypress. All WS task variants were objectively controllable, but their difficulty varied such that some were more difficult to control. Study 1 investigated the within-task coupling of subjective stress and control, while Study 2 investigated whether experiencing a highly controllable WS task in comparison to rating affectively neutral videos (therefore termed a neutral control condition) moderated responses to a subsequent stressor of high or low intensity.</p><p id="P7">Study 1 employed a 2 × 2 factorial design, with two levels of control (high or low) and two levels of stressor intensity (high or low). To increase subjective stress levels during the WS task in Study 2, an additional experimental condition was added such that participants would lose the entirety of a monetary bonus if a randomly selected trial was unsuccessful (named the ‘loss’ domain), given the aversiveness of potential losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. An overview of the study conditions is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. As a result, for Study 2, there were six conditions made up from two levels of control (high and neutral), two levels of stressor intensity (high or low) and two levels of domain (win or loss) for the high control conditions (WS task).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Ethics</title><p id="P8">This study was approved by UCL research ethics committee (12271/003). Electronic informed consent was obtained from all participants. Participants received an average base payment of £7.42/hr plus the opportunity to win bonus money depending on their performance. The bonus was 1p per correct trial in the ‘win’ domain conditions. In the ‘loss’ domain conditions, participants were assigned a £3 bonus at the start of the study and a randomly selected trial determined whether they lost (if the trial was incorrect) or kept (if the trial was correct) the entirety of the bonus. In the video condition (Study 2, neutral control) all participants received an additional £1 bonus. Using existing Prolific screening criteria, all participants agreed they had a webcam, audio and microphone, agreed to their video to be recorded, and agreed that they were comfortable to be deceived. This was to increase the believability of the stressor, but no webcam or audio data were recorded, and participants were debriefed that the stressor task would not happen during the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P9">The final sample for both studies included 768 participants located in the UK (50.8% female, mean age = 29.6 years, SD = 7.12) and was recruited online via Prolific (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.prolific.com">www.prolific.com</ext-link>) between August 2021 and November 2022.

While all variants were technically controllable, the variations differed in difficulty making wheels subjectively easier or harder to control. In the WS task a yellow segment spins within a blue circle, and the participants’ goal is to stop the yellow segment over a red “break zone” by pressing the ‘b’ key. In the single-press version, one press of the brake causes the segment to stop. How quickly the wheel stops after a keypress is determined by a stopping angle. For example, a stopping angle of π/2 means the segment stops a quarter of a rotation after the brake is pressed (since a whole rotation of the circle is 2<italic>π</italic> radians). The deceleration increment for a given trial in the single-press condition was calculated as <inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>speed</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mtext>stopping</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mtext>Angle</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. For the multi-press version, pressing the brake increases the brake <italic>strength</italic> in an incremental way. The greater strength of the brake (here, how many times the ‘b’ key is pressed) the sooner it stops. The stopping parameter in the multi-press is the deceleration increment. The speed and segment width of the wheel were also manipulated. Variations of difficulty were implemented by modifying a combination of segment speed, width and deceleration (within-subjects manipulation). As well as a different braking procedure, the low control version also had higher speeds, but the segment sizes were the same for both high and low control versions. The order in which the parameter combinations (speed, segment width, deceleration increment) were presented was randomised across participants, except in Study 2 in which the parameters became increasingly easier to elicit increasing feelings of control (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref> for task parameters). Note that Study 1 included high and low control versions of the WS task, whereas Study 2 only included high control version of the WS task. After each trial, participants were shown written feedback on screen as to whether the segment had successfully stopped on the red zone (or not), and the associated reward (or lack of). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref> for details.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Stressor</title><sec id="S10"><title>High intensity</title><p id="P13">To induce increased levels of stress (between-subjects manipulation), we ran a modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test [TSST; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Participants were instructed they had 10 minutes to mentally prepare a five-minute speech describing why they would be a good candidate for their ideal job. Participants were told the speech would be video recorded and reviewed by a panel of judges trained in public speaking to evaluate its clarity, style, and how persuasive the presentation was, and performance would be ranked relative to other participants. Participants did not actually perform the speech, so we refer to the high intensity stressor as an anticipatory TSST. Prior research has found TSST anticipation to elicit both psychological and physiological stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>], suggesting that the task anticipation would be a valid stress induction despite participants not performing the speech task. Moreover, prior research has validated the use of remote TSST in online settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>], including evidence that the speech preparation phase (online) was related to increased heart rate and blood pressure compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Low intensity</title><p id="P14">To induce comparably low(er) levels of stress, participants read a recipe of how to bake a loaf of bread and were asked to remember as much information as possible for 10 minutes before completing a short quiz about the recipe.

This contained 12 videos, each 1 minute 15 seconds in length showing a montage of landscape scenes. After every video, participants completed the Self-Assessment Manikin [SAM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] to measure valence, arousal and dominance. Participants also answered attention check questions about the videos (e.g. “In the video, what is the weather like in the first scene? a) rainy, b) sunny, c) cloudy”). There were three blocks, each containing four videos and two attention checks. This was chosen as a control condition to avoid control affordances typical of active tasks. The chosen videos were affectively neutral but engaging. Given the task itself is designed to be relaxing, it is a strong control for investigating effects on stress.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Slider rating measures</title><p id="P18">During the WS task we asked how participants were feeling using three different slider rating scales. One to measure control: “How in control do you feel right now?” from “very out of control” to “very in control”; one to assess their levels of stress: “How much stress are you currently experiencing?” from “very little stress” to “a lot of stress”; and one to measure perceived task difficulty: “How difficult are you finding the task right now?” from “not difficult at all” to “very difficult”. All responses corresponded to values 0-100, although no numerals or points along the line were visible to participants.

After reading the information sheet and signing the electronic consent form, participants completed the questionnaires, stressor task, WS task (or video task for Study 2 neutral control condition), and answered additional stress ratings and STAI-S throughout the experiment. The stressor task was run <italic>before</italic> the WS task in Study 1, and <italic>after</italic> the WS task for Study 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Given that we were interested in the experience of control on stress <italic>buffering</italic>, the stressor task is therefore only analysed for Study 2. A subset of Study 1 (n=175, 37%) did not have all questionnaires collected (included STAI, but not LOC, PHQ, SPIN), and due to a technical error, control ratings were provided every 4 blocks and difficulty sliders after all other blocks, while control and difficulty ratings alternated to be provided every 2 blocks in the remaining sample of Study 1 and for Study 2. The precise order of tasks and detailed information for the two studies is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Data Analysis</title><p id="P23">Statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.2.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], including packages from “tidyverse” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>] for data wrangling and plots, “rstatix” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>] for simple statistical models, “sjPlot” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>] for making tables of model estimates, and “ggpubr” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>] for arranging plots. Linear mixed effects models were fit by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) with <italic>t</italic>-tests using Satterthwaite's method using the R package “lme4” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. Estimates reported from linear models are unstandardised. For post-hoc analyses, estimated marginal means were investigated using the “emmeans” package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>], using Kenward-Roger degrees-of-freedom method. We corrected for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg (False Discovery Rate) procedure. When manually adjusting <italic>p</italic> values (outside of inbuilt function options), we input <italic>p</italic> values to be corrected into the “p.adjust” R function. In the instance that initial unadjusted <italic>p</italic> values were non-exact (e.g. &lt;0.0001), we used the upper limit as the estimate (e.g. 0.0001) for adjustment. Internal consistency for the slider scale ratings used the R package “irr” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Questionnaire scoring was completed using custom functions in MATLAB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>]. The linear model predicting control ratings based on Wheel Stopping task parameters was coded and run in MATLAB, and used the function “fminunc” from the Optimization Toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>] for optimisation. We tested seven different models with different number and combinations of regressors and calculated the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to choose the model with the lowest BIC (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). To note, the segment size value from the trial-by-trial WS task data determines the size of the blue space around the yellow segment, and thus a greater value represents a smaller segment. Deceleration increments were log transformed to better fit a linear model. Regressors were standardised and we found parameters that maximised the posterior probability. The final model predicted control responses at each timepoint (every WS trial) from an intercept, a gamma term that discounted the previous control rating’s influence on the current timepoint, and three beta coefficients for the trial’s speed, segment size and deceleration increment (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">equations 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD3">3</xref>). <disp-formula id="FD1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> <disp-formula id="FD2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="M3"><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>pred</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munder><mml:mi>∑</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:munder><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mtext>deceleration</mml:mtext><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext>segment</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mtext>size</mml:mtext><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext>speed</mml:mtext><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula> <disp-formula id="FD3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="M4"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mi>∑</mml:mi></mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ratings</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>pred</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:munder><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mi>∑</mml:mi></mml:mstyle><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:munder><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.2em"/><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula> where <italic>i</italic> indicates parameter (deceleration, segment size and speed), <italic>t</italic> indicates trial and <inline-formula><mml:math id="M5"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the Z-scored value of task parameter <italic>i</italic> on trial <italic>t</italic>. <inline-formula><mml:math id="M6"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> is an exponentially smoothed average of the task parameter values. β<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the weight given to the task parameter value in the regression. <italic>μ</italic> and <italic>ν</italic> are prior parameters to mildly regularise estimation of betas.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P24">We first investigate the internal consistency and external validity of the task.

The best model (lowest BIC, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>) predicted control ratings from all three Wheel Stopping task parameters (deceleration increment, segment size, and speed of rotation), although all models performed similarly. The winning model contained an intercept term, a gamma term to discount previous control ratings at the current time point, and the beta weights for the three regressors. A histogram of the parameter estimates across all participants is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>.

On average, the beta coefficients for Segment Size (mean = -2.25, SD = 2.83) and Speed (mean = -3.09, SD = 3.86) were negative, showing that a faster speed and a smaller segment size (a larger fraction parameter) resulted in lower ratings of control. On the other hand, on average the beta weight for deceleration increment was positive (mean = 2.33, SD = 3.53) showing that the wheel stopping faster predicted higher feelings of control. The median correlation between actual and fitted control responses across the whole sample was 0.60 (Study 1 = 0.54, Study 2 = 0.69, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). The actual and predicted control responses over the course of the experiment can be seen for six randomly selected participants (three per study iteration) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>.

We also assessed subjective control and perceived difficulty during the WS task, assessed every 2 blocks (10 trials) in both studies. To investigate how subjective control related to feelings of stress during the WS task while accounting for perceived task difficulty, we took the mean control ratings and mean difficulty ratings preceding each stress rating, enabling us to have a value of control and difficulty corresponding to each stress timepoint. For Study 1 (n = 473) there were four subjective stress ratings (timepoints) during the WS task. A linear mixed effects model including random intercepts of participant and timepoint showed that lower feelings of control (β= -0.13, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001) and higher perceived task difficulty (β= 0.38, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001) were both uniquely associated with higher subjective stress during the WS task (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).

We next examined in Study 2 whether this effect of heightened control generalised beyond the WS task in response to a subsequent stressor. To do so, we added a causal manipulation whereby one group of participants received a version of the WS task inducing high levels of control ratings. While high control is often contrasted to low control conditions, we were here interested in a stronger test to ask whether the experience of control itself might have a protective effect in comparison to an intervention that might similarly reduce stress by itself. We hence compared the high control task to a simple video watching condition. During the video task, the mean of individual’s valence ratings was 6.60 (SD = 1.53), where 1 represents unpleasantness and 9 represents pleasantness. A one-sided one-sampled t-test revealed this was significantly greater than the scale’s midpoint (<italic>t</italic>(93)=10.17, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001). The mean of individual’s arousal ratings was 3.94 (SD = 1.74), where 1 represents calmness and 9 represents excitement. A one-sided one-sampled t-test revealed this was significantly less than the scale’s midpoint (<italic>t</italic>(93)=-5.91, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001). These suggest that participants indeed found the videos relaxing (pleasant and calm). These tasks were followed by a stressor of high or low intensity (the anticipatory Trier Social Stress Test or recipe comprehension task, respectively). The analyses in this section therefore focus on stress ratings from three timepoints: after the WS/video task, after the stressor, and after the stressor debrief, coded as timepoints 1, 2, 3, respectively.

There was no significant three-way interaction of timepoint by control by stressor intensity (β= -7.19, SE=5.27, <italic>p</italic>=.173), suggesting that the control by timepoint interaction was not dependent on the stressor intensity.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Sensitivity and Exploratory Analyses</title><p id="P42">We conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to ensure our findings were robust. Although there were no significant differences between control groups in subjective stress immediately after the WS/video task (<italic>t</italic>(175.6)=1.17, <italic>p</italic>=.244), we included participants’ stress level after the WS/video task as a covariate in the stress relief analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S12</xref>). The results revealed a main effect of initial stress (β= 0.643, SE=0.040, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S12</xref>) on the stress relief after the stressor debrief. Compared to excluding initial stress as in the original analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>), there was now no longer a main effect of domain (β= 0.236, SE=2.60, <italic>p</italic>=.093, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S12</xref>), but the inference of all other effects remained the same. Importantly, there was still a significant time by control interaction (β= 9.65, SE=3.74, <italic>p</italic>=.010, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S12</xref>) showing that the decrease in stress after the debrief was greater in the highly controllable WS condition than the neutral control video condition, even when accounting for the initial stress level.</p><p id="P43">Our second sensitivity analyses was conducted because the experiment took longer to complete for the video condition (mean = 54.3 minutes, SD = 12.4 minutes) than the WS task condition (mean = 39.7 minutes, SD = 12.8 minutes, <italic>t</italic>(186.19)=-9.32, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001). We therefore included the total time (in ms) as a covariate in the stress induction and stress relief analyses for Study 2. This showed that accounting for total time did not change the results of interest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S13</xref>), further highlighting that the time by control interactions were robust.</p><p id="P44">Third, we included the interaction of domain with stressor intensity and with time, to test whether the win or loss domain in the WS task significantly impacted stress induction or stress relief differently depending on stressor intensity. There were no significant effects or interactions of domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S14</xref>) for stress induction or stress relief, and the main effect of interest (the interaction between time and control) still held for the stress induction (β= 10.20, SE=4.99 <italic>p</italic>=.041, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S14</xref>), though was no longer significant for the stress relief (β= 6.72, SE=4.28, <italic>p</italic>=.117, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S14</xref>). This more complex model did not significantly improve model fit (χ<sup>2</sup>(3)= 1.46, <italic>p</italic>=.691) compared to our original specification (with domain as a covariate rather than an interaction) and had slightly worse fit (higher AIC and BIC) than the original model (AIC = 5477.2 versus 5472.7, BIC = 5538.5 versus 5520.8).</p><p id="P45">Finally, to test whether the loss domain was more valuable at mitigating experiences of stress than the win condition, we ran additional analyses with just the high control condition (WS task) for the stress induction and stress relief to test for an interaction of domain and time. For the stress induction, there was no significant two-way interaction of domain and time (β= -1.45, SE=4.80, <italic>p</italic>=.763), nor a significant three-way interaction of domain by time by stressor intensity (β= -3.96, SE=6.74, <italic>p</italic>=.557, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S15</xref>), suggesting that there were no differences in the stress induction dependent on domain. Similarly for the stress relief, there was no significant two-way interaction of domain and time (β= -5.92, SE=4.42, <italic>p</italic>=.182), nor a significant three-way interaction of domain by time by stressor intensity interaction (β= 8.86, SE=6.21, <italic>p</italic>=.154, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S15</xref>), suggesting that there were no differences in the stress relief dependent on the WS Task domain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S31" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P46">We designed a novel Wheel Stopping task to assess subjective sense of control and its relationship with subjective stress in a large sample of adult participants across two separate studies. Across both studies we could show that task features designed to manipulate subjective control, namely wheel speed, segment size and deceleration increment were highly effective at doing so. Further, the task possessed excellent psychometric properties including high internal consistency as well as high external validity as demonstrated by relationships with state anxiety, locus of control and mental health measures. We also showed that subjective sense of control as elicited by task parameters, and experienced stress were tightly coupled throughout the task for our participants. In a final step we sought to causally manipulate and heighten subjective sense of control and to test its impact on subjective stress in response to a subsequent stressor. We could show that experimentally increased sense of control buffered subjectively experienced stress to a psychosocial stressor and also led to greater stress relief compared to a neutral video task.</p><p id="P47">Given the different parameter combinations of our task we were able to elicit a considerable range in the subjective experience of control. Notably, there was a tight coupling between subjectively experienced control and subjectively experienced stress during the task. While our WS task was in and of itself not designed to elicit feelings of stress, these results are striking as clearly the variable sense of control as elicited through changes in the achievability of obtaining instrumental rewards was highly predictive of subjective stress levels. Importantly, during the task we also obtained ratings of perceived task difficulty. While subjective stress was partly accounted for by task difficulty, there was also a unique relationship with perceived control. These findings demonstrate how closely subjective control tracks subjective stress independently of any stressful task properties, which in the present case were minimal and reinforces that perceived control presumably not only moderates subjective stress but impacts it directly. Mean levels of subjective sense of control during the task also correlated with a cluster of self-reports and questionnaires such as state anxiety, locus of control, trait anxiety, depression and social phobia, replicating prior work on perceived control and mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P48">In a crucial set of experiments (Study 2) we tested whether causally manipulating and increasing participants’ sense of control through our task, impacts not just presently but also subsequently experienced stress. To elicit stress we used a well-known psychosocial stressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], which presently also lead to a clear increase in subjective stress and subsequent relief after being debriefed. Thus, compared to participants in a neutral control condition (watching videos), participants who had been exposed to the WS task designed to give them an increased sense of control showed a reduced subjective stress response following the stressor and greater relief after the debrief. These findings demonstrate that heightened control impacts subsequent stress levels. Whereas prior work in humans has shown that experimentally induced increases in experiences of control lead to greater fear extinction, a core regulatory process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], the present findings provides direct evidence that heightened control buffers against later stress.</p><p id="P49">Stress is causally implicated in the emergence and maintenance of multiple mental health conditions across the lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], however the nature of stressors and how we respond to them significantly impacts mental health symptomatology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. Stressors are most potent when uncontrollable, as demonstrated through decades of research on learned helplessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. By implication, there has been a growing interest in how <italic>heightened</italic> control over stressful events may mitigate their impact, and lead to resilient outcomes even in response to future stressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. While some cross-species work has been able to provide some initial support for this idea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>], clear causal evidence in humans has so far been lacking. Here we were able to show that experimentally increasing experiences of control through our WS task and thereby heightening participants’ subjective sense of control led to reductions in stress following a subsequent stressor. While we were presently unable to differentiate whether this is driven by objective or subjective dimensions of control, we speculate that similar to other domains of mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]<sup>,</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]<sup>,</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] subjective elements of control are more impactful. This raises the possibility of targeting subjective control beliefs to reduce the likely possible impact of stress. Previously, similar interventions have been designed to target other types of beliefs implicated in mental health symptomatology (i.e. optimism, causal attribution) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. Given the high degree of comorbidity among many mental health disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>] and the crucial role of subjective sense of control across a host of mental health disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>] the present work implicates a highly relevant target for possible intervention.</p><p id="P50">Our set of studies is not without its limitations. As stated above, we operationalised variations in task controllability through task difficulty while technically each of our WS iterations was controllable. Our intention was to selectively target subjective control, which we were able to achieve, while simultaneously statistically controlling for perceived task difficulty. Future work will need to find ways of operationalising controllability in a graded fashion while accounting for other confounds such as predictability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Further, similar to other task-designs comparing control conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], these conditions were not matched for associated rewards. Previous research typically accounts for different outcomes (e.g. punishment) by yoking controllable and uncontrollable conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] though other work has manipulated the controllability of rewards by changing the reward rate [for example 30] where a decoy stimulus is rewarded 50% of the time in the low control condition but 80% in the high control condition). While our task design does not separate control from obtained reward, we are able to do so in the statistical analyses. Like with perceived difficulty, we statistically accounted for reward rate and showed that the relationship between subjective control and stress was not accounted for by reward rate, for example. Similarly, participants received feedback after every trial, and thus feedback valence may contribute to stress perception. However, given that overall win rate (which captures the feedback received during the task) did not predict stress over and above perceived difficulty or subjective control, it suggests that feedback is unlikely to relate to stress over and above difficulty. Future work will need to disentangle this further to rule out such potential confounds. Another avenue for future research would be to test how control buffers against stress when compared to a neutral control scenario of higher stress levels, akin to the loss domain in the WS Task, given that participants found the video condition generally relaxing. However, given that we found no differences dependent on domain for the stress induction in the WS Task conditions, it is possible that different versions of a neutral control condition would not impact the stress induction.</p><p id="P51">We designed a novel experimental task to track and induce subjective sense of control in a highly graded fashion. While this task possessed excellent psychometric properties, we were also able to show that momentary sense of control was tightly coupled with subjective stress levels as well as state anxiety and symptoms of mental ill-health. Crucially, compared to a relaxation control condition, an experimental and task-induced increase in sense of control led to reduced subjective stress in response to a subsequent stressor, as well as greater stress relief after participants were debriefed. Our findings demonstrate a causal role of subjective control in mitigating the negative impact of stress and identify a highly valuable and potentially modifiable target for interventions aimed at reducing the detrimental consequences of stressors in everyday life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS201769-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d50aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="S32" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p id="P52">All data and analysis code are publicly available on the Open Science Framework at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/39jsc/">https://osf.io/39jsc/</ext-link> (DOI <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/39JSC">10.17605/OSF.IO/39JSC</ext-link>).</p></sec><fn-group><fn fn-type="con" id="FN1"><p id="P53"><bold>Author Contributions</bold></p><p id="P54">Conceptualization: JCF, NS, QJMH; Methodology: JS, NS, QJMH; Formal analysis: JCF, JS, QJMH; Investigation: JCF, JS; Writing – original draft preparation: JCF, NS, QJMH; Writing – review &amp; editing: DM, JCF, JS, NS, QJMH; Visualisation: JCF; Supervision: NS, QJMH; Funding acquisition: NS</p></fn><fn id="FN2"><p id="P55"><bold>Financial Disclosure</bold></p><p id="P56">QJMH acknowledges support by the NIHR UCLH BRC.
