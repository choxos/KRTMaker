Accordingly, the perceived value of a reward varies depending on an animal’s current needs. Updating the specific value of rewards predicted by external cues depends on the basolateral amygdala (BLA). However, neurophysiological investigations have centered around the assumption of stimulus-invariant value representations and have not been able to account for behavioral findings that support the BLA’s ability to represent stimulus-specific value of distinct appetitive or aversive outcomes. To address how the BLA encodes and updates stimulus-specific value representations, we exposed head-fixed mice to distinct sets of gustatory rewards while tracking perceived value using lick microstructural analysis. Two-photon calcium imaging of BLA principal neurons revealed that the magnitude of the BLA population response scaled with perceived reward value and that the values of different rewards were encoded by distinct neuronal subpopulations. Moreover, reward representations rapidly re-scaled when mice were exposed to a reward that was larger than all previous rewards. Finally, value representations depended on an animal’s internal state as thirst selectively increased the responses to water rewards whereas aversive experiences strongly attenuated responses to sucrose. Our findings demonstrate that value representations in the BLA are stimulus-specific and highly adaptive to account for changes in relative reward value and to reflect an animal’s current affective and homeostatic state. This mechanism enables sensory-specific value updates necessary for state-adapted decision making and learning.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">A major challenge for animals is to rapidly adjust their behavior to accommodate variable environmental conditions and need states. One of the main mechanisms to structure this interaction is associative learning in which actions or neutral sensory cues become predictive of appetitive or aversive outcomes. During associative learning, the value of the expected outcome is defined by its valence, which can be appetitive or aversive, and by its subjective importance or value.</p><p id="P3">One of the key brain areas for the acquisition, retrieval, and updating of associations of cues or actions with the current value of specific outcomes is the basolateral amygdala (BLA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Impairing BLA function prevents the formation and retrieval of both appetitive and aversive stimulus-specific associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, the BLA was found to be necessary to adapt behavioral responses whenever the perceived value of the expected outcome changed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. However, the BLA is not implicated in general motivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and contrary to other brain regions, optogenetic activation doesn’t cause excessive food consumption or strong place avoidance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that behavioral adaptations are driven by dynamic changes in the representation of specific outcomes in the BLA. However, previous neurophysiological investigations of outcome representations in the BLA have so far suggested, sensory-invariant value representations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, which would not allow for flexibly updating value associations in a stimulus-specific manner and can’t account for behavioral evidence of sensory-specific value updating and learning. As stimulus specificity and dynamic value updating of outcome representations can only be characterized by exposing animals to a diverse set of rewarding outcomes, we performed two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed mice consuming a range of appetitive gustatory stimuli. By measuring lick bout size, an established read-out for perceived value in experimental psychology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, we were able to quantify the relative values of these stimuli as a function of the rewards available and an animal’s internal state.</p><p id="P4">Our study reconciles previous findings at the behavioral and the neurophysiological level by demonstrating that the BLA represents the value of distinct appetitive outcomes in largely separate neuronal populations. Furthermore, we extend the concept of stimulus-specific reward value by showing that these representations are dynamically updated according to reward context, homeostatic and affective states, while population-level responses could be integrated to achieve a stimulus-invariant representation.</p><sec id="S2"><title>BLA reward responses are locked to consumption onset</title><p id="P5">To study BLA activity during value assignment to innately valuable stimuli, we developed a head-fixed task in which food-restricted mice were presented with sets of unsignaled liquid rewards, delivered in a random sequence at random intervals, while recording general motor activity (running wheel motion), arousal (pupil dilation, whisker pad motion), and licking behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To minimize predictability and potential interactions between successive stimuli, we chose long inter-trial intervals of on average 20 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Quantification of licking behavior upon presentation with water or 20% sucrose demonstrated that animals continued to lick the reward spout long after the reward had been consumed, which takes about 3 licks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). Sucrose rewards resulted in significantly more licks per reward compared to water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-e</xref>). The number of licks per reward was defined as the number of uninterrupted licks (inter lick interval &lt; 500 ms) after reward delivery, also referred to as lick bout size. The difference in lick bout size was predominantly driven by a change in lick duration rather than frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. To assess whether reward history influenced subsequent reward consumptions, we compared pupil dilation in trials with no change in reward and in trials in which there was a shift from water to 20% sucrose. We found no significant difference within the range of mean reward size fluctuations and therefore considered reward responses in subsequent trials to be independent from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1c-e</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To address whether licking behavior is reward-specific, we analyzed tongue movements at higher temporal resolution using video tracking at 194 Hz (Supplementary Video 1). Tongue motion was stereotypical, with probing tongue movements to check for reward availability and a transition to a lapping motion after reward detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Comparing lick trajectories revealed that licks in response to water were more similar to each other than licks in response to 20% sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), while 20% sucrose licks were as similar to each other as to water. To test whether such lick pattern differences could systematically bias our neuronal recordings, we quantified if differences in lick pattern scale with sucrose concentrations differences and found that they did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1f-h</xref>). To further assess at which point consumption behavior started to differ, we compared the first principal component of the combined behavioral metrics (whisking pad motion, running speed, and pupil dilation) for water and sucrose consumption lick bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1h</xref> - left).</p><p id="P7">We found that the behavior started to significantly deviate 1.28 s after consumption bout onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref> - right), indicating that during this time window neural activity is likely related to the sensory content or value of the stimulus, rather than to differences in motor patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">To characterize the neuronal representation of reward value, we expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6f in principal neurons in the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>) and imaged neurons through a gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens during the task using a two-photon microscope. Aligning the neuronal responses to the onset of reward consumption indicated that BLA principal neurons showed calcium responses time-locked to consumption onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 i-l</xref>). Rather than spanning the entire time of a given lick bout, reward responses were primarily onset responses. The probability of calcium transient onset was elevated above baseline during the first 1.5 s after consumption onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1M</xref>). This timing makes it unlikely that the motor pattern differences described above contribute to the measured differences in neuronal activity. To further control for a possible contribution of lick-related motor signals, we sub-selected trials with similar lick bout sizes for both rewards and found that reward response differences were maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a-c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>BLA population activity reflects perceived reward value</title><p id="P9">To address how the BLA represents the value of rewards across a range of gustatory stimuli, we exposed mice to three different reward sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, f, k</xref>). Lick bout sizes were normalized to the average lick bout size in response to 10 µl 20 % sucrose reward (normalized licking), which was present in all reward sets. This analysis showed that normalized licking scaled with the animals’ preference for higher sucrose concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) and larger volumes at a given concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). We also observed differential licking for distinct rewards in a set composed of rewards containing different nutrients (milk, flavored milk, and sucrose; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2l</xref>), where value assignment was unclear a <italic>priori</italic>. As previous work used lick bout size as a proxy for relative value assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, we conclude that licking behavior can also be used to measure the perceived value of unpredicted gustatory rewards in our head-fixed task.</p><p id="P10">For each reward set, we observed an increase in mean BLA activity across session averaged single neuron responses for preferred rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c-e, h-j, m-o</xref>). Due to the biophysical properties of the calcium sensor, full differentiation of the sources for this increased activity is not possible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. It is however likely that it reflects a combination of the recruitment of more neurons, an increase in single-neuron response amplitude and/or response probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3e-g</xref>). A positive correlation of the mean neuronal response magnitude with normalized licking was also observed when subdividing responses based on lick bout size alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3h</xref>) and when subdividing for individual rewards and lick bout size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3i</xref>). Thus, consistent with previous studies concluding that BLA reward representations are stimulus-invariant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, our results demonstrate that mean BLA activity correlates with lick bout size independent of the currently consumed reward, and that perceived reward values are represented in a stimulus-invariant manner at the population level.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Neuronal subpopulations encode stimulus-specific reward value</title><p id="P11">The monotonically increasing relationship of perceived value and population response could be a result of stimulus-invariant value neurons that each have a monotonically increasing relationship with reward value or arise through the combination of subpopulations of neurons specifically responding to distinct rewards.</p><p id="P12">To distinguish between these two possibilities, we performed a regressor analysis to test whether neurons had stimulus-invariant responses by correlating mean responses with a regressor containing all stimuli and comparing it to the best correlating individual stimulus regressor (<italic>see</italic> <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In the sessions in which mice were exposed to sucrose solutions of different concentrations and volumes and in which stimulus features were very similar, correlations for the best maximum individual regressor were slightly better than the complete stimulus regressor. This difference was increased during the session in which mice were exposed to distinct stimuli containing different nutrients, where we found a strong bias towards neurons correlating better with the maximum individual stimulus regressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, c</xref>). This finding indicates that individual neurons had stimulus-specific responses. To test this further, we compared the number of neurons that were significantly responding to only one reward and found that most neurons were responding exclusively to a single reward, with higher overlap during sessions with higher reward similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d-f</xref>). To understand whether the observed findings were only true for session averages or also observable at the individual trial level, we calculated population vector (PV) correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Comparing the across vs. within PV-stimulus correlations revealed that even at the single trial level the population response was significantly different for sessions in which different rewards were consumed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Taken together the presented data demonstrate that the BLA maintains stimulus-specific value representations at the single neuron level, while the mean population response represents the relative reward value indiscriminate of stimulus identity.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>BLA neurons dynamically encode value</title><p id="P14">To address how BLA reward value representations change upon exposure to a preferred reward and to expand on previous work focusing on individual neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, we first performed a cross-session comparison of the neural response to the same stimulus (10 µl of 20% sucrose) in the presence and absence of a better, preferred reward. This comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) revealed that animals licked less for the same reward when they experienced a larger 16 µl reward of the same concentration in the same session, while responses for water were not affected (session II; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Similarly, we found that BLA responses were reduced for the 10 µl reward (session II) and that the 16 µl reward, at the time the most valuable available reward (session II), evoked a similar response as the 10 µl reward in sessions where mice were presented with 10 µl as the highest reward (session I; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c, d</xref>). To test whether reward response re-scaling also occurs within the same experimental session, we performed an additional experiment where we alternated two different reward scales between blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>), an experimental design known as simultaneous contrast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Consistent with the previous findings, we observed larger lick bout sizes (Extended Data Fig. 6e) and a larger BLA population response to the same 20% sucrose reward within a reward block that did not contain 40% sucrose compared to blocks with 40% sucrose rewards available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Analyzing block transitions showed that BLA population responses adapted within a single session. 20% sucrose responses rapidly adapted within the blocks (5-10 min.) and recovered to baseline levels after termination of the 40% block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g, h</xref>). This effect was mediated by a group of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>) with stimulus-specific responses, consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). Within-session adaptation suggests an integration of local reward history, which we didn’t observe in previous experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1c-e</xref>). This discrepancy is likely explained by the higher mean reward fluctuations in the simultaneous contrast session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4c-d</xref>), an interpretation supported by control experiments in which we introduced an equal number of 20% sucrose trials instead of 40% sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4f</xref>), where we did not observe an adaptation between the different blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4g-j</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Value representations reflect homeostatic and affective states</title><p id="P15">To examine whether the BLA response scaling does not only take the distribution of all available rewards into account but also incorporates changes in an animal’s internal state, we first measured reward responses in acutely water-restricted animals. At the behavioral level, we observed a strong and specific increase in the lick response to water, indicating a shift in the relative value of water in comparison to sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-c</xref>). Accordingly, the BLA population response to water was specifically increased in water-restricted animals, resulting in an equal BLA population response magnitude to water and sucrose rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d-f</xref>). This increased water response was predominantly driven by an increase in the number of neurons showing a water-specific response that we did not observe in non-water-restricted animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e, f</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Finally, we examined how a negative affective state would influence reward value representations by exposing mice to unpredicted aversive stimuli randomly interspersed throughout the session (random ITI 45 – 60s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>). We further modified the paradigm to trigger reward delivery upon spout licking, allowing us to dissociate motivational drive from assigned value<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, which could both be influenced by repeated aversive exposures. Aversive experiences led to a marked decrease in the lick bout size after consumption but did not result in a strong reduction of reward seeking behavior, as quantified by lick-triggered reward deliveries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h-j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5a-d</xref>). While reward-seeking behavior was only partially affected and the BLA strongly responded to aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5e, f</xref>), we observed a strong attenuation of neuronal sucrose responses despite continued consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5k, l</xref>). Reward-responsive neurons were not overlapping with aversive-responsive neurons in this experiment, suggesting that the investigated appetitive value representation is likely valence specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5m</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Here we show that the BLA represents the perceived value of stimuli and that this effect is not a mere reflection of general arousal or systematic differences in licking microstructure. Furthermore, we find that this stimulus-invariant value response emerges from largely separate neuronal subpopulations specifically activated by distinct gustatory stimuli. Exposing mice to larger rewards within the same stimulus set resulted in re-scaling of reward representations, demonstrating that value representations are relative and maintained through rapid adaptation of neural response magnitudes. Finally, we show that changes in the internal state can bi-directionally modulate the magnitude of value responses in the BLA. These data thus support a pivotal role for the BLA at the interface between stimulus-specific sensory processing and stimulus-invariant value computation.</p><p id="P18">Our finding of consumption onset locked responses is in agreement with previous reports of BLA activity in response to reward exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. However, we did not observe a reduction of consumption-onset locked responses across time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, potentially due to the lack of predictability of reward availability in our paradigm. Interestingly and contrary to reports in other brain areas, we find that single neurons in the BLA show stimulus-specific responses and are not dominated by orofacial movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>).</p><p id="P19">Previous studies have reported the existence of a stimulus-invariant value code in BLA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> which we find only at the population level. We extend these findings by demonstrating that even though the total population does indeed encode stimulus-invariant reward value, this representation arises from stimulus-specific value representations that vary in number of neurons, magnitude and response probability according to the perceived value of a given specific stimulus. The high stimulus specificity even for very similar rewards like different sucrose concentrations cannot be sustained with increasing stimulus set size and would lead to suboptimal coding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Due to the overlap of neurons coding for sugar and fat-based rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) it is likely that, at least in the gustatory domain, the BLA projects stimulus features onto relevant axes, such as carbohydrate, protein, fat, and mineral content.</p><p id="P20">Our discovery of stimulus-specific response properties of BLA neurons allows to resolve a longstanding disconnect between behavioral studies, showing the necessity of BLA function when the value of specific rewards needs to be updated, for example during outcome devaluation, revaluation, reinstatement, conditioned taste aversion or sensory specific associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and neurophysiological reports of stimulus-invariant valence responses in the BLA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Our findings are well aligned with recent work from our lab, describing the transfer of specific stimulus value to instrumental actions and the necessity for this representation for actions execution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and are supported by holographic stimulation of BLA neurons responsive to sucrose, leading to an increase in the perceived value of sucrose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">Our findings are also complementary to the characterization of learned responses to predicting neutral stimuli (such as tones) that are paired with appetitive or aversive stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> and suggest a potential mechanism for the rapid update of sensory-specific associations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.

Before anesthesia, buprenorphine (Temgesic, Indivior UK Limited; 0.1 mg/kg body weight (BW)) was injected subcutaneously 30 min before the surgery. Anesthesia of mice was induced with 5% and maintained with 1-2% isoflurane (Attane, Provet) in oxygen enriched air (Oxymat 3, Weinmann), animals heads shaved and placed in a stereotactic frame (Model 1900, Kopf Instruments). Mice were kept on a heating pad controlled by a feedback-based DC temperature control system (FHC) and received an ocular gel to prevent drying of the eye’s surface (Viscotears, Novartis). Before the first incision was made the skin above the skull was injected subcutaneously with a local anesthetic (1:1 mixture of Lidocaine: 10mg/kg, Bichsel and Ropivacaine: 3mg/kg; Naropin, AstraZeneca). A hole of 1.3 mm diameter was drilled using a surgical drill (Kopf Instruments) at the following coordinates: AP −1.6 mm (from bregma), ML −3.35/+3.35 mm (from bregma) and an adeno-associated virus (AAV2/5.CaMK2.GCaMP6f - 500 nl, University of Pennsylvania Vector Core, UPenn) unilaterally injected into the BLA using a precision micropositioner (Model 2650, Kopf Instruments) and pulled volume-calibrated glass capillaries (Drummond Scientific, Cat.-No. 2-000-001, tip diameter about 30 μm) connected to a Picospritzer III microinjection system (Parker Hannifin Corporation) at the following depth: DV -4.2 mm (from pia). Following the retraction of the pulled glass capillary, a hollow injection needle with 1.1 mm diameter was lowered to -4.3 mm (from pia) and immediately retracted before we lowered a 1 mm gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens into the skull (Inscopix, part ID: 1050-002177) using the micropositioner and fixed at -4.2 mm (from pia) using a UV-curing glue (Henkel, Loctite 4305). The surface of the exposed skull was scratched, covered with Vetbond (3M) and a custom-built titanium head-bar fixed using dental acrylic (Paladur, Heraeus). To protect the surface of the GRIN lens before the experiment it was covered with a rapid-curing silicone elastomer (KauPo).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p id="P27">Following the completion of behavioral paradigms, the brains of the mice were post-processed for histological analyses. Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of an anesthetic mixture (250 mg/kg ketamine and 2.5 mg/kg medetomidine) to achieve deep anesthesia. The mice were then perfused transcardially with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 2 min followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 40 min. Then, the brains were removed from the skull and cut into 80 or 100 μm coronal slices using a vibratome (VT1000S). Perfusion-fixed sections containing the amygdala were subsequently washed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4) and Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4) and blocked in a solution of 1% human serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1% Triton-X (Sigma-Aldrich) in TBS and then incubated in a mixture of primary antibodies containing 0.1% Triton-X for 48-72 h. This was followed by extensive washes in TBS, and incubation in the mixture of appropriate secondary antibodies overnight. Following this, sections were subsequently washed in TBS and PB, dried on slides and covered with Aquamount (PolySciences). Sections were scanned with a Zeiss Axio Scan Z1 Slide scanner equipped with a Zeiss objective (Fluor 5×/0.25) to confirm the expression of the different viruses and GRIN lens implantation sites.

Rewards were delivered using up to five NE-1000 syringe pumps (NewEra Pumpsystems Inc, Milan) controlled by an analog signal output from the two-photon microscope (Ultima Investigator, Bruker). The output pattern was generated using a custom Matlab 2017 (Mathworks) script that randomized deliveries and inter-trial intervals (ITI’s) and generated individual .txt files used by the system to control the voltage supplied to pumps that control the deliveries through a RS232 to BNC cable. Following habituation, mice underwent several sessions of each type (up to 4, separated by 24h, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4 a-f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) in which the rewards were changed (order: concentrations, volumes, different nutrients, aversive, water restriction). All sucrose rewards were mixed according to the specified concentration of sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich) and delivered with different volumes. Milk (whole-milk, COOP Switzerland) and flavored milk (Emmy Energy Milk Vanilla, COOP Switzerland). Experiments pertaining to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4e-f</xref> were performed on an additional set of mice that followed a slightly altered protocol (s. <italic>below</italic>). In each session rewards were delivered through a single custom-built spout that had five independent openings, one connected to each pump. Spout licks were detected when the mouse closed a circuit between its metal head-bar and the spout (P. Buchmann, P. Argast, J. Hinz - custom built). Conductance from the headbar to the mouse was facilitated by an ultrasound gel bridge to the neck skin. Additionally we monitored the running speed of the animals on the saucer wheel using a rotary encoder (Yumo rotary encoder E6B2-CWZ3E: 1024 pulses per rotation) and the pupil dilation with a single monochrome camera at 60 Hz (The Imaging Source, part ID: DMK 22BUC03) through ICcapture (The Imaging Source) or lick trajectories and pupil dilation with multiple monochrome cameras (FLIR, part ID: BFS-U3-16S2M-CS) at 194.1 Hz through Bonsai (version 2.3.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and Python (version 3.8.8, based on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://t.ly/FHXfO">https://t.ly/FHXfO</ext-link>) for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-h</xref>. To allow for a good dynamic range in pupil size, we installed a custom build 415 nm UV back light (ILS ILH-XC01-S410-SC211WIR200 filtered through a 445/45nm bandpass) and adjusted the light power to result in a medium sized pupil at the beginning of each experimental session.</p><p id="P31">During the appetitive open-loop sessions, rewards were delivered at random intervals (ITI 15 - 25 s, equal probability) and no structure imposed on the distribution of rewards. During experiments pertaining to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e-h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>, rewards were organized in blocks of 25/35 (either including or excluding additional reward), where each block contained the same number of rewards, randomized within the block, and delivered at random ITIs (15 - 25 s, equal probability).</p><p id="P32">During the aversive sessions, reward delivery was contingent on the animals licking and therefore licking was additionally processed by a RP2.1 real-time processor (Tucker Davis).

The running speed was determined from the rotary encoder signal by normalizing to the running saucer wheel circumference at the mouse position. Video camera frames were timestamped by recording the frame trigger signal. Pupil dilation, whisking power, and lick trajectories were extracted from the video camera recordings via DeepLabCut (DLC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, using a network trained on manually labeled sample frames (8 points around the pupil, 4 points around the whisker pad, 3 points on the tongue, 3 points on the lick spout).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Data Analysis</title><p id="P34">To ensure that we only included actual licks and not spout contacts by other body parts, like hand digits, were detected, we used the length of contact to exclude other events. Tongue contacts were the most common spout interaction and had a stereotypic duration. We therefore fitted a normal distribution to the duration of all detected spout contacts and excluded events that were longer or shorter than 3*std of the mean contact duration. Given the delivery speed of the syringe pumps, we defined the first rewarded lick to be the first lick 100 ms after pump onset. This definition comes with some level of uncertainty so that, given the average lick frequency of 6.8 Hz, the first rewarded lick can in some cases be 150 ms earlier or later than the one we defined. To calculate the lick bout size, we counted the number of consecutive licks that were not interrupted for more than 500 ms. We normalized these lick bout sizes to the average within animal, 10 µl, 20% sucrose lick bout size. To exclude an impact of reward prediction error on the observed neuronal signals we checked whether pupil dilation was impacted by positive or negative reward difference. To this end we fit the distribution of pupil dilations and checked whether there was a significant deviation from the mean of the corresponding distributions for positive and negative reward shifts (<italic>see</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1c-e</xref>). To investigate the motor patterns during consumption we analyzed running speed and pupil dilation (<italic>as described above</italic>), as well as whisking power and lick trajectories. Whisking power was defined as the average pixel value change within the whisker pad area. To compensate for potential lick speed differences, lick trajectories were interpolated to the same number of coordinates per lick using a modified Akima cubic Hermite interpolation (Matlab, interp1, option makima, upscale factor 10) from the DLC tracked tongue tip trajectory around the electrically detected licks times. Lick trajectory similarity was defined as the mean Procrustes distance (Matlab, procrustes, no reflection) between all compared lick trajectories.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Two-photon Imaging</title><p id="P35">Imaging was conducted using a two-photon microscope (Ultima Investigator, Bruker) during all behavioral sessions on three planes separated by 70 - 80 μm using a 400 μm mechanical piezo (Bruker) with bi-directional scanning at a volume rate of 8.5 Hz and a spatial resolution of 256 by 256 pixels through a water immersion objective (16x, 0.8 numerical aperture (NA), Nikon). Ultrasound gel (G008, FIAB spA) was used to interface the objective and the GRIN lens. Excitation light was provided with a mode-locked laser system operating at 920 nm, 80-MHz pulse rate, 120 fs pulse width (Insight X3, Spectra Physics). We used standard Bruker PMT (photomultipliers, Hamamatsu Photonics) for light detection. For the same mice, imaging parameters were kept the same across repeated behavioral sessions and recorded using Prairie View (versions 5.2 - 5.6, Bruker).</p><sec id="S18"><title>Data extraction</title><p id="P36">We extracted the images using custom software written in Matlab 2017 (Mathworks Inc.) available on GitHub<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.

Therefore, we used the timestamp of acquisition for each image and found the closest image recorded to the first rewarded lick and extracted a window of -3 s to +5 s around this timestamp for further processing. As pointed out previously there are some uncertainties about the first rewarded lick and given the volume imaging rate of the two-photon system of 8.5 Hz and the associated confounds we estimate that the actual onset of neuronal activity associated with the reward consumption is in the range of a max./min. of 250 ms of what we state as the time of consumption. This means that there is a jitter around zero of about ± 2 frames most likely explaining imperfect alignment of the activity to time point 0 s.</p><p id="P39">To present peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTH) across the paper we computed local z-scores by normalizing each individual trial. To this end we subtracted the mean activity of each baseline before consummatory onset from the whole extracted period and divided it by the variance of the whole neuronal trace. Through this process we avoided the issue of division by zero, which often happens when using deconvolved traces and corrected for the overall activity level of the neuron. The mean activity for neurons displayed in the paper is the mean of the normalized individual presentations. To calculate the <italic>p</italic>(Ca2+-transients) we used the estimated spike variable, binarized it and calculated the mean and SEM around the time of consumption of the different rewards for each neuron. Displayed is the mean across neurons and the threshold derived by calculating the mean and 3 standard deviations of the baseline preceding the consumption onset. To quantify matched lick bout trials, we identified sessions that had at least 3 repetitions for each of the stimuli within the normalized lick range of 0.25 - 0.65 of the mean 20% sucrose response. These trials were then pooled across animals and used for quantification and visual display. We calculated the PV-correlation by extracting the mean response (s. above for definition), for individual trials across all recorded neurons resulting in a <italic>1d</italic> vector, which we used to calculate the Pearson correlation between each single reward presentation. We subsequently sorted these correlations by reward identity. To calculate the correlation of single neurons with all stimuli or the individual stimulus regressors, we correlated the average activity of significantly active neurons during each trial with either a regressor containing all ones or ones for one stimulus and zeros for the rest. To quantify the mean activity for specific lick bouts, we calculated the mean response of active neurons in the specific lick bout, either split according to stimulus identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3i</xref>) or summed over all stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3h</xref>). During simultaneous contrast experiments we calculated the change of the 10 µl 20% sucrose response between the different blocks by subtracting the mean response of neurons with at least 3 measured events and calculating whether these differences were deviating from 0. Concurrently we also calculated the relative BLA response in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref> (between different rewards) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, where we subtracted the mean BLA response from the indicated rewards (e.g., 10 µl Sucrose response during Session II - mean BLA population response of 10 µl Sucrose during Session I).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Antibodies</title><p id="P40">We used DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# D1306), Goat-anti-Calretinin (Dilution 1:5000, Swant, CG1), Chicken-anti-GFP (Dilution 1:2000, Lifetech, A10262), Rabbit-anti-vAchT (Dilution 1:3000, Synaptic Systems, 139103) and Mouse-anti-FoxP2 (Dilution 1:3000, Millipore, MABE415) as primary Antibodies in the identification of lens positions.
