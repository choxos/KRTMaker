Despite their shared origin, there has been relatively little comparison between the downstream gene regulatory networks and how they may differently pattern and shape these appendages. In the pre-tarsal region of the developing leg and antennae of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a combination of the transcription factors C15, Lim1 homeobox 1 (Lim1), and Al (Aristaless) are required for the development of the leg tarsal claws and antennal aristae. However, the roles and interactions of these factors in genital development, and their relationship with other leg-patterning genes, remained unexplored. Here, we investigated the expression and function of C15, Lim1, and Al in the development of male and female terminalia (genitalia and analia). We found that C15 plays distinct roles in the different sexes, repressing male clasper bristle formation while promoting bristle development in the female epiproct. Notably, unlike in the antennal and leg discs, C15, Lim1, and Al are not all co-expressed in any anal or genital structures in either sex, indicating that the interactions among these factors have diverged across serially homologous appendages. Nevertheless, we inferred regulatory interactions between C15 and other factors, including <italic>bric a brac 2</italic> and <italic>Distal-less</italic>, reflecting similarities between leg and genital development consistent with their homology. Finally, we identified a male-specific enhancer of <italic>C15</italic>, likely regulated by the Hox gene <italic>Abdominal-B</italic> (<italic>Abd-B</italic>), which is active in male claspers but not in the female terminalia, legs or antennae. This <italic>C15</italic> enhancer modularity may underpin tissue-specific regulatory logic, presumably programmed by distinct Hox inputs such as Abd-B in the genitalia, and could contribute to the diversification of serially homologous ventral appendages.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>genitalia</kwd><kwd><italic>C15</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The diversification of serially homologous structures has been a major theme during animal evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. This is exemplified by the elaboration of ventral appendages in arthropods that have evolved into a ‘toolkit’ of functionally distinct structures, from walking legs and swimming appendages to sensory antennae, respiratory organs, spinnerets, and genitalia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. It is thought that appendage diversity is regulated by distinct Hox gene inputs as well as other differences in the underlying developmental gene regulatory networks (GRNs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Understanding the regulation and diversification of these mechanisms is a key question in evolutionary developmental biology.</p><p id="P4">In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the legs are patterned by overlapping expression domains of the transcription factors, including <italic>homothorax</italic> (<italic>hth), dachshund</italic> (<italic>dac</italic>), and <italic>Distal-less</italic> (<italic>Dll</italic>), along the proximo-distal axis, with expression of the latter two genes overlapping in the distal tibia and tarsal segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The distal part of the leg includes the tarsus composed of five tarsal segments followed by a pre-tarsal region bearing a pair of claws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Development of the tarsus and pretarsal region is also regulated by a proximo-distal gradient of increasing Epidermal growth factor receptor activity, which results in the activation of specific transcription factor-encoding genes, including <italic>Bar</italic> (<italic>B</italic>) and <italic>bric a brac 2</italic> (<italic>bab2</italic>), in the distal tarsal segments and <italic>C15</italic> (also called <italic>clawless</italic>) in the pretarsal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. C15, in turn, activates <italic>aristaless</italic> (<italic>al</italic>) and <italic>LIM homeobox 1</italic> (<italic>Lim1</italic>), which feeds back to promote <italic>C15</italic> expression in the pretarsal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Together, C15, Lim1, and Al combine to repress <italic>B</italic> and <italic>bab2</italic> in the pretarsal region, with C15 and Al cooperatively binding to directly repress <italic>B</italic> expression and C15 competing with the activator Dll to regulate <italic>bab2</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Loss of C15, Lim1, or Al expression in the leg results in the loss of the pre-tarsal region, including the claws [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. This trio of transcription factors are also co-expressed and required for the development of part of another ventral appendage, the aristae of the antennae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. However, in developing eyes, only C15 and Lim1 are expressed in the ocellar region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Therefore, although the combinatorial expression of C15, Lim1, and Al can differ according to the developmental context, these three transcription factors are important for appendage patterning.</p><p id="P5">Classic experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> indicated that the ‘ground state’ state of ventral appendages was a leg-like proximal segment and distal tarsus, and suggested Hox and <italic>hth</italic> inputs pattern this basic structure to give rise to specific appendages, for example <italic>Antennapedia</italic> in the legs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. In the genitalia, it is thought that the posterior Hox gene <italic>Abdominal-B</italic> (<italic>Abd-B</italic>) represses leg fate and promotes genital fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Indeed, loss of <italic>Abd-B</italic> results in development of tarsal-like structures from the genitalia in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other insects, further supporting the appendage ‘ground state’ model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. While excellent progress has been made in understanding how Hox genes and downstream mechanisms regulate the identity and fine-scale morphology of appendages, especially legs, wings, and halteres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], much remains to be learned about the development and evolution of genital structures.</p><p id="P6">The terminalia of <italic>Drosophila</italic> are composed of the analia and genitalia, which develop from the genital imaginal disc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. This disc is composed of cells from abdominal segments A8, A9 and A10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The analia of both sexes derive from A10 and give rise to the anal plates in males (cerci) and females (the epiproct and hypoproct) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. In males, the genitalia, encompassing the claspers (surstyli), epandrium and internal organs including the phallus and associated structures, develop from A9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In females, the genitalia, including the oviprovector, develop from A8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. A8 and A9 form the repressed female primordium and repressed male primordium in males and females, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The primordia of adult terminal structures are marked by the expression of specific genes in the genital imaginal disc. <italic>caudal</italic> (<italic>cad</italic>) and <italic>Abd-B</italic> mark and regulate the development of the analia and genitalia, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Regulation of the development of the analia and genitalia also integrates sex-specific signals to specify and pattern male and female structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. During the late third larval instar (L3) and pupal stages, the cells of the anal and genital primordia divide, differentiate and undergo metamorphosis, causing these tissues to be remodelled and develop into the adult structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Comparisons of the expression of genes encoding transcription factors between genital and leg discs have revealed similarities consistent with the concept that the terminal structures are derived walking appendages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. For example, <italic>Dll</italic> expression in the four distal tarsal segments in the leg is reflected in the proximal domain of the clasper and throughout the cerci in the male genitalia, while overlap of <italic>dac</italic> and <italic>Dll</italic> in the first tarsal segment and part of the tibia, is similar to their expression in the distal clasper domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that <italic>C15</italic> is expressed in the developing pupal claspers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>] and downstream target genes, including <italic>bab2</italic>, have also previously been shown to be expressed in the claspers during at least one developmental stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. However, the relative expression, functions, and interactions of key genes that regulate distal leg development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have not previously been systematically studied in the serially homologous male and female terminalia. This information is crucial to not only understanding the development of these structures but also how they have been remodelled from the ventral appendage ‘ground state’ during evolution.</p><p id="P8">Here, we investigated the expression, function, and interactions of <italic>C15</italic> and upstream and downstream genes in the pre-tarsal GRN during the development of male and female <italic>Drosophila</italic> terminalia. Our results show differences in the deployment and interactions of these genes between the development of leg and terminal structures as well as between male and female terminalia development. Our data indicate that there has been extensive rewiring of the distal leg GRN during the evolution of male and female terminal structures, and although this re-programming involves Hox gene inputs, we present evidence that it has also potentially been underpinned by enhancer modularity.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Drosophila lines and manipulation of gene expression</title><p id="P9"><italic>UAS-RNAi</italic> lines were provided by the Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Resource Centre (VDRC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] or the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Centre (BDSC) (NIH P40OD018537).

Dissected adult structures were mounted in Hoyer’s solution on slides containing eight individual 6 mm diameter wells. To account for body size, the T2 legs of each fly were also dissected and mounted. A Zeiss Axioplan light microscope with a Jenoptik ProgRes C3 camera was used to image each dissected structure, where 250X magnification was used for the terminal structures and 160X magnification for the T2 legs. The area of the posterior lobe, cercus, lateral plate, hypoproct, epiproct and length of T2 tibia leg were measured manually using ImageJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. When measuring the hypoproct and epiproct area, an outline was drawn and enclosed with an artificial baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. The bristles were counted under a light microscope using a tap counter. The area, bristle count, and length were recorded for both structures of each pair per individual, and the average was then used for the statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P11">All statistical analyses were carried out using R version 4.2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>].

Normally distributed data were analysed using Dunnett’s test and ANOVA, whereas the Kruskal Wallis test was used for non-normally distributed data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. RNAi knockdown progeny were compared to both parental controls. If this test was statistically significant, the Tukey’s Test / Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test (BH p-adjusted method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]) was used to identify whether the effect was significantly different to both parental controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>).

Where the T2 tibia length of the RNAi knockdown was significantly different to both parental controls following the tests described above, Pearson/Spearman correlation analysis was performed on the cercus, epiproct and hypoproct area dependent on Shapiro Wilk test results. If statistically significant, the area of the structure was divided by the tibia length squared, and statistical tests were carried out on the normalised measurements.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Scanning electron microscopy</title><p id="P12">Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on <italic>NP6333-GAL4</italic> and <italic>C15</italic> RNAi knockdown male and female terminalia.

Other possible candidate transcription factors that may directly activate this enhancer inferred from ATAC-seq footprinting include Da and Cad, which could activate and repress <italic>C15</italic> in the male genitalia and analia respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. However, some of the most highly sites significant sites identified by JASPER and CIS-BP were for predicted homeobox binding targets and given these transcription factors can bind very similar motifs, further work is needed to identify which transcription factors directly regulate <italic>C15</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Tables 4 and 5</xref>). The <italic>C15</italic> genital enhancer we have identified also drives expression consistent with endogenous <italic>C15</italic> expression in the ocelli primordia of the eye-antennal disc and notum of the wing disc, but again, additional analysis is needed to identify the transcription factor binding sites responsible for the regulation of this element in these tissues and whether some of the same motifs are used in the genitalia or not.</p><p id="P50">Our results suggest that <italic>C15</italic> employs a different enhancer in developing female terminalia since the enhancer we identified does not drive expression of a <italic>C15</italic> pattern in the epiproct. It is also clear from our results that the previously characterised 650 bp embryonic <italic>C15</italic> enhancer (within the intron 2 enhancer 2 region), which is directly regulated by Zen and Smad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>], does not drive expression in either male or female terminalia, although this region may be active in the wing notum.</p><p id="P51">None of the putative <italic>C15</italic> enhancer fragments we tested, including the identified genital enhancer, recapitulated endogenous <italic>C15</italic> expression in the leg disc, although the intron 1 enhancer was active in a few cells in the centre of the disc suggesting it may contain binding sites that contribute to C15 expression in the pre-tarsal region. These results imply that even though <italic>C15</italic> is expressed in these serial homologues it is regulated by distinct enhancer elements. This modularity may underpin tissue-specific regulatory logic, presumably programmed by different Hox inputs such as Abd-B in the genitalia, and that could have contributed to the diversification of these serially homologous structures from the ‘ground state’ ventral appendage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. It would be very interesting to identify the <italic>C15</italic> pre-tarsal and arista enhancers to compare to the genital enhancer that we have identified to understand the differences in <italic>C15</italic> regulation and the GRNs in these developing tissues better. Interestingly, a previous study of bristle number evolution between <italic>D. yakuba</italic> and <italic>D. santomea</italic>, found that the same cis-regulatory change in one enhancer of the <italic>scute</italic> gene affected both sex comb teeth number and hypandrial bristle number in male forelegs and genitalia, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. Therefore, changes in a single pleiotropic enhancer can also contribute to changes in the morphology of different secondary sexual structures.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Divergence in male genitalia among Drosophila species</title><p id="P52">Male terminal structures show great diversity in shape, size and bristle composition, but there are also differences among female structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>]. Given the role of <italic>C15</italic> in bristle patterning in male and female terminalia, this gene represents an excellent candidate for differences in the terminal bristle patterns among species.</p><p id="P53">It has been shown that the male clasper bristles intercalate with the bristles of the female oviscapt during copulation and therefore it is likely that the correct pattern of bristles regulated by <italic>C15</italic> is important for mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>]. <italic>D. mauritiana</italic> has more clasper bristles than its sibling species <italic>D. simulans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and we previously showed that <italic>trn</italic> contributes to this difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>]. Given that C15 may regulate <italic>trn</italic> expression in the developing claspers and that <italic>C15</italic> is also located in a mapped region shown to contribute to the clasper bristle number difference between <italic>D. simulans</italic> and <italic>D. mauritiana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>], this gene, and in particular the enhancer we have identified that is active in the developing claspers, represents an excellent candidate for contributing to this evolutionary difference in genital morphology. Furthermore, <italic>D. teissieri</italic> claspers are covered in bristles, including much of the proximal clasper domain that is naked in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> subgroup and marked by C15 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>]. It would therefore be very interesting to explore <italic>C15</italic> expression and function in <italic>D. teissieri</italic> to see whether the bristles in the proximal clasper domain result from the loss of <italic>C15</italic> expression and if this reflects any changes in the activity of the <italic>C15</italic> clasper enhancer we have identified.</p></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P54">We have shown that <italic>C15</italic> is required for the patterning of the bristles in male and female terminal structures. This involves similarities and differences to the regulatory interactions of this transcription factor in other serially homologous appendages, and in particular, the C15-Lim1-Al trio is not used in either male or female terminal, unlike the antennal aristae and leg pre-tarsal region. Furthermore, <italic>C15</italic> expression appears to be regulated by a different enhancer in the developing male genitalia compared to legs and antennae, which likely unpins the different regulatory logic used in these serially homologues and this modularity may even have facilitated a role for <italic>C15</italic> in the rapid diversification of male genitalia.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Tables 1-5</label><media xlink:href="EMS199612-supplement-Supplementary_Tables_1_5.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d32aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS199612-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d32aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded in part by a BBSRC (BB/X006689/1) grant to A.P.M. and M.D.S.N., a BBSRC DTP studentship (BB/ M011224/1) to A.M.R.
