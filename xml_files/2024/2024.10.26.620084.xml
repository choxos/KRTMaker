The popularity of this technique stems from its simplicity. Patch-clamp recording is used to observe spontaneous transmission occurring at synapses throughout a neuron’s dendritic tree. These events are analysed in an attempt to determine quantal synaptic parameters and changes during experimental manipulation. For decades, changes in the amplitude or frequency of mPSCs have been interpreted as evidence for specific synaptic modifications, including changes in presynaptic release sites, postsynaptic receptor abundance or even nanoscale changes in the alignment of synaptic machinery. However, at the majority of brain synapses, these events are small, with many undetectable due to recording noise. Here, using both simulated and experimental data, we demonstrate that interpreting synaptic changes from mPSC datasets is fundamentally fallible. Due to incomplete detection of event distributions, seemingly specific changes in mPSC amplitude or frequency falsely report actual synaptic changes. In addition, probabilistic detection of small events gives false confidence in the completeness of detection and inaccurate determination of quantal size. We not only demonstrate the dense pitfalls of mini analysis, but also establish a method for experimental detection of the detection limit, allowing more robust data analysis and scientific interpretation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The brain is an immensely complex organ. Its cells are connected by trillions of synapses, each with unique properties, determined by countless reactions and protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Raghavachari and Lisman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Yasuda, 2017</xref>). As these connections are potential sites for information storage in the brain, decades of research has been performed to determine the functional properties and molecular mechanisms of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Nicoll, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P3">However, determining and quantifying the properties of individual synaptic connections is surprisingly difficult. Since first observations of ‘quantal synaptic properties’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">del Castillo and Katz, 1954</xref>), the biophysical parameters of transmission have been studied intensively. One extensively employed method for this involves recording ‘miniature postsynaptic currents’ (‘minis’/mPSCs: excitatory – mEPSCs, inhibitory – mIPSCs) or spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs), using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Isaacson and Walmsley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Malgaroli and Tsien, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Zhang and Trussell, 1994</xref>). Spontaneous events (sPSCs) are the result of action potential-dependent neurotransmitter release from any cell connected to the recorded neuron. Miniature events, recorded during action potential blockade (typically through tetrodotoxin (TTX) application), are the result of spontaneous vesicle fusion at any synapse on the recorded neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kavalali, 2015</xref>). Both events occur anywhere across a target neuron’s dendritic tree, and allow ensemble sampling of synaptic input properties for a cell of interest. Given the ease of patch-clamp recording from individual neurons, m/sPSC analysis is routinely employed by labs worldwide to determine synaptic properties or synapse-level effects of experimental manipulations (e.g. gene knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Matt et al., 2018</xref>), synaptic protein manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Watson et al., 2017</xref>), or neuromodulatory action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Choy et al., 2018</xref>)).</p><p id="P4">Multiple parameters will determine the distribution of recorded synaptic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Jonas and Spruston, 1994</xref>). It is often incorrectly assumed that changes in mPSC frequency reflect purely presynaptic changes (i.e. changes in number of release events), while mPSC amplitude differences are due to postsynaptic alterations (i.e. changes in response strength), and is still quoted as such in papers to date. This oversimplification will almost certainly drive incorrect biological conclusions. Multiple pre- and postsynaptic factors can influence both the amplitude and frequency of mPSCs. However, the pitfalls with mPSC interpretation only begin here. Not only can the biological interpretation of mPSC data be easily mistaken, but empirical interpretation of event distribution changes can be similarly misunderstood.</p><p id="P5">At the majority of brain synapses, synaptic strengths (and therefore mPSC amplitudes) are small (0-50 pA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Edwards, 1991</xref>). They (mostly) approximate a right-skewed lognormal distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Sahara and Takahashi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Zhang and Trussell, 1994</xref>), while patch clamp noise levels are comparatively large (typically 2–10 pA max to min values/ 1–5 pA standard deviation when low pass filtered to 10 kHz). This results in many synaptic events lying beneath the noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Malgaroli and Tsien, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Isaac et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mennerick and Zorumski, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Wang et al., 2024</xref>). Here, using <italic>in silico</italic> mPSC simulations, we demonstrate that calculating and considering the detection limit for mPSC events is essential for correct interpretation of these recordings. First, we demonstrate that events below the detection limit are probabilistically detected dependent on their amplitude, giving rise to a ‘false’ distribution that misrepresents quantal size. Second, we show that average event amplitude and frequency are not discrete parameters. Changes in event amplitude are predominantly represented as a selective change in mPSC frequency. Finally, we demonstrate a method for estimating the detection limit, allowing more reliable interpretation of recorded data. Together, this study demonstrates the major risk of mPSC misinterpretation, facilitating more accurate future investigation and re-examination of historic datasets.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P6">In order to determine the effects of the detection limit on recorded mPSC distributions, we established a pipeline for simulating mPSC recordings with realistic patch-clamp noise. Using simulated data allows full control of both mPSC properties and recording noise levels. We first sought to determine the effect of event amplitude on detection around the detection limit. mPSC events were simulated with varying rise time constants, decay time constants, and peak amplitudes following a lognormal distribution, approximating real-world data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bekkers and Stevens, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Zhang and Trussell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Sahara and Takahashi, 2001</xref>; Pernía-Andrade et al., 2012). These events were randomly positioned across a simulated recording (1 Hz event rate) and embedded in coloured noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). We next detected events in these simulated recordings using a standard, template-fit algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Clements and Bekkers, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Jonas et al., 1993</xref>). The amplitude of detected events also followed a lognormal-like distribution, however a large fraction of events were not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Unsurprisingly, undetected events were of small amplitude, hidden in recording noise. As logically expected due to loss of small events, the mean mPSC amplitude was overestimated by detection through recording noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, actual mean event amplitude: 7.6 ± 0.1 pA; detected mean amplitude: 10.0 ± 0.1 pA), while mPSC frequencies were underestimated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, actual frequency: 1 Hz; detected frequency: 0.64 Hz). By calculating which simulated events were missed, we determined the association between mPSC amplitude and its likelihood of detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Event detection falls away probabilistically with decreasing amplitude, following a sigmoidal relationship. This probabilistic detection of small events shapes the rising phase of the detected event histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Despite missing over a third of events, the resulting detected events had a lognormal-like distribution, reminiscent of a complete distribution. To demonstrate that this curve shape is independent of the input distribution, we detected events from a uniform distribution of simulated mPSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), which also demonstrated a gradual loss of mPSCs as their amplitude approached 0 pA. Due to the overabundance of small events, errors in measured event amplitude and frequency were much stronger for a lognormal than a uniform input distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, the nature of synaptic properties unfortunately lends itself to more noise affected analysis. With complete detection, the mode (peak) of mPSC distributions would represent synaptic quantal size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Sahara and Takahashi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gordleeva et al., 2023</xref>). However, in our example, this value was overestimated by at least factor of two (actual mode: 2.65 pA, detected mode: 5.92 pA). Therefore, incomplete detection produces mPSC datasets that do not accurately represent the underlying physiology, and give false confidence in their biological relevance.</p><p id="P7">We next modulated the detection limit by increasing the standard deviation of simulated noise. This caused a curve shift in the distribution of detected mPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-F</xref>), and increased the misrepresentation of both mean mPSC amplitude and frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Strikingly, just a 0.6 pA increase in the standard deviation of recording noise caused a 21 % increase in the measured mean amplitude (9.9 to 12.0 pA mean amplitude), and an 30 % decrease in recorded frequency (0.57 to 0.40 Hz frequency) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). The level of noise therefore has a dramatic effect on the observed synaptic parameters. In real world recordings, noise is not just a result of recording setup. Noise levels vary depending the cell type, cell state, or even within and between individual recordings due to cell health, seal integrity and recording quality. Therefore, when comparing mPSC data between experimental groups, it is essential to compare recording noise of all cells across datasets.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Detecting changes in synaptic properties</title><p id="P8">We next sought to determine how <italic>changes</italic> in mPSC properties are observed through the lens of recording and detection. Theoretically, a pure effect on event amplitude would produce a shift or scaling of the amplitude distribution along the <italic>x</italic>-axis, while frequency changes would induce a scaling of the distribution in <italic>y</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, in theory, visualising recorded event distributions should allow simple understanding of underlying synaptic changes. Indeed this is certainly the case when all events are detected, for example large events which occur well beyond the detection limit (e.g. action potential-dependent EPSCs at cochlear nuclei or Calyx of Held, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Sahara and Takahashi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Zhang and Trussell, 1994</xref>)). However, at the majority of synapses, and for almost all single-vesicle induced mPSCs, this is not the case.</p><p id="P9">We repeated our mPSC simulations, but modified the event template to increase the peak amplitude of every event by either 2 pA or 4 pA before noise embedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). This manipulation simulates a specific scaling in mPSC amplitude, independent of original synaptic weight. As expected, distribution histograms for the simulated events shift in <italic>x</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Histograms of <italic>detected</italic> events however, do not. We instead observe a stretching of the event distribution in the <italic>y</italic>-axis, which is reminiscent of a pure increase in mPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Despite simulating a pure increase in mPSC amplitude, the frequency of detected events increased, while mean amplitude was comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Due to incomplete detection, small events emerge from the noise to both increase the detected frequency, and counteract the amplitude increase of previously detected events. Our data demonstrate that mPSC frequency and amplitude are not independent variables when working close to the detection limit. As a result, specific effects on either mPSC frequency or amplitude are unreliably reported, and definitive conclusions can only be made from datasets with complete event detection or through detailed analysis of recorded distributions.</p><p id="P10">We sought to corroborate these findings using a more biologically realistic scaling model. Events were scaled by a factor inversely proportional to their initial amplitude, simulating saturating potentiation and maximal effects on small synapses, as observed in biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kaneko et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E-F</xref>). With weaker scaling, specific changes to detected event frequency occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G-H</xref>). Only with more robust scaling was a shift in the detected event distribution towards higher amplitudes observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>), yet this was accompanied by a &gt;2-fold increase in mPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). These results further confirm the interdependence of mPSC frequency and amplitude for noise-embedded events, and the strong sensitivity of mPSC frequency measurements to underlying changes in amplitude.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Detecting changes in event frequency</title><p id="P11">To complete this analysis, we applied controlled changes in mPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). We simulated mPSC recordings with frequencies of 1, 2 and 3 Hz. Despite the limits of detection detailed previously, both event distributions and mean frequencies reflected these changes, albeit strongly underestimating true frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Mean mPSC amplitudes showed little change. While this data confirms that pure mPSC frequency changes can be reliably followed, such effects cannot be concluded from ‘real-world’ data, as observed changes in mPSC frequency could occur through biological changes in either amplitude or frequency.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Real-world mPSC data contains hidden distributions</title><p id="P12">While simulated data are valuable for testing mPSC analysis in a controlled system, we sought to assess the unreliability of mPSC detection with experimentally recorded mPSCs. Many pharmacological manipulations are known to enhance synaptic transmission, but due to the complexity of synaptic transmission, it is difficult to confidently change transmission amplitude without frequency effects. However, this can be achieved electronically. Recording mPSC datasets from the same neuron at two holding potentials allows specific and calculable modification of mPSC amplitude, without influencing mPSC frequency, by increasing the driving force for ion flow across the membrane. This approach has been previously employed as such for an experimental control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Malgaroli and Tsien, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Manabe et al., 1992</xref>), and to dissect synaptic parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). We performed mEPSC recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in mouse organotypic slice cultures at both -60 mV and -80 mV holding potentials (in the presence of 1 μM tetrodotoxin to block action potential generation, 10 μM SR-95531 to isolate mEPSCs, and 100 μM D-APV to isolate the AMPAR current) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Given the variability of real world synaptic data, we sampled equal length recordings of mEPSCs at both holding potentials from every included cell, and proceeded with mEPSC detection and analysis. The difference in holding potential should cause a specific 1.33-fold scaling in mEPSC amplitude. However, we observed no change in mean mEPSC amplitude and instead observed an increase of mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Event distributions show y-axis scaling as expected from a frequency change, directly replicating our theoretical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Recorded cells showed no difference in noise levels between conditions, ensuring our conclusions were not affected by detection variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). These observations corroborate our simulations, demonstrating that real-world mPSC analysis is confounded by the detection limit, and that a significant portion of mPSC events occur below the detection limit at hippocampal CA1 synapses.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Experimental detection of the detection limit</title><p id="P13">We have demonstrated the dramatic fallibility of mPSC analysis for understanding and interpreting biological effects. Using holding potential scaling, we were able to ‘visualise’ mPSC events that exist, but were hidden beneath the detection limit when recording at -60 mV. We next sought to determine a means to improve the reliability of mPSC analysis, through determination of the event detection limit. mEPSCs recorded and detected using a -60 mV holding potential were scaled to their expected amplitude at -80 mV (x1.33), and plotted alongside our ‘ground truth’ -80 mV mEPSC dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). While these distributions overlay almost perfectly at high event amplitudes (away from the detection limit), the -60 mV dataset showed lower frequency of small amplitude events. Our -80 mV dataset was also likely be incomplete at small amplitudes, yet contains a more complete representation than that recorded at -60 mV. Therefore, the point at which these two curves diverge is the amplitude at which mPSCs begin to become undetected, i.e. the detection limit. A sliding bin histogram of mPSC events was plotted for -80 mV, and scaled -60 mV datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Calculating the difference between these curves (subtraction of -60 mV<sub>scaled</sub> from -80 mV) produces a biphasic curve, where high amplitudes can be fit with a y=0 curve (no difference in event detection), yet low amplitudes approximate a linear relationship with negative gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). This graph can be approximated with a ‘broken stick’ curve, where the break point represents the lowest amplitude at which zero false negatives are recorded, or the ‘detection limit’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). In our dataset, the detection limit was estimated at 5.9 pA, or 4.1 times the standard deviation of recording noise (1.43 pA, σ denotes standard deviation).</p><p id="P14">Finally, we used this knowledge of the detection limit to re-examine recorded event distributions. We applied the recorded detection limit as a cut off for included events, and replotted recorded datasets with the minimum bin value beginning at this cut-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). We were unable to fit a peak to our real-world mEPSC dataset, demonstrating that the modal event remains below the detection limit. Estimates of quantal size or in depth interpretation of distribution changes would not be possible from such data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">The properties of chemical synapses are highly diverse, both across the brain and at the level of individual neurons. For this reason, understanding the changes in synaptic physiology underlying brain function requires robust methods for their study. Analysis of mPSCs has the potential to provide information about heterogeneous synaptic efficacies across the neuronal dendritic tree. This approach is powerful and technically simple, but the pitfalls of data analysis and interpretation are deep, hidden, and not widely appreciated. We have demonstrated these issues using both simulated and experimental datasets, suggesting analyses for careful interpretation of recorded data. While this manuscript focuses on mini analysis (mPSCs), these concepts are directly applicable to sPSC recordings, or analysis of any detected event that has close proximity to noise levels.</p><sec id="S8"><title>Empirical interpretation of mPSC datasets</title><p id="P16">It would be logical to assume that measured changes in mean event frequency represent underlying changes in mean event frequency, and similarly event amplitudes. However, our data demonstrates that this is a false assumption. When events are embedded in recording noise, changes in mPSC amplitude are more robustly detected as changes in frequency than mean event amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Therefore, even specific observed changes in mPSC frequency could be caused by underlying changes in either frequency or amplitude. This interdependence was well appreciated in the early years of mini analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Diamond and Jahr, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Manabe et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mennerick and Zorumski, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Yamada et al., 1993</xref>), yet now appear widely forgotten. Not only are changes in mPSC frequency an unreliable indicator of biological changes, but changes in mean amplitude are more sensitive to the level of recording noise than to actual underlying synaptic changes. Without careful analysis of recorded noise levels between conditions, these effects have the potential to cause regular misinterpretation of synaptic changes from mini analysis.</p><p id="P17">While our results demonstrate the importance of interpreting event distributions rather than averages values, distributions can be similarly misleading. If complete distributions are seen above the noise level, interpreting mPSC changes is not an issue, and even mean values will reliably report underlying biological changes. For the majority of brain synapses, this is not the case, including the most intensively studied excitatory connections across the hippocampus and cortex. We show here that the modal mEPSC of CA1 pyramidal neurons lies beneath recording noise in our hands (&lt;5.9 pA).</p><p id="P18">Unfortunately, the detection limit is not simply a sharp cut-off. Small events are lost with increasing likelihood the smaller they are, creating a false ‘peak’ to event amplitude distributions. The resulting distributions strongly resemble an expected lognormal-like profile of synaptic events, giving false confidence that measured data fully represent the underlying biology. Quantal analysis from mPSC data is also therefore problematic, unless either clear evidence of quantal properties are observed e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Paulsen and Heggelund, 1994</xref>), or the peak of the event distribution can be unequivocally observed above the detection limit. Even then, the level of variability observable at neuronal synapses will often preclude simple interpretation of such results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Clements, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Malinow, 1991</xref>).</p><p id="P19">To facilitate data analysis, we present a means to estimate the detection limit. Using different voltage clamp holding potentials, electronically scaled mPSCs can be compared to determine the amplitude at which events reliably emerge from noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). By using this approach, the amplitude at which mPSC analysis becomes unreliable can be determined for a certain recording setup/system. Event distributions can then be attenuated so as to analyse only those falling above this point, preventing false peaks in amplitude distributions. Our detection limit estimation from real world data (4.1σ) is directly in line with previous estimates. Clements and Bekkers predicted that 4 × σ would eliminate false negative detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Clements and Bekkers, 1997</xref>). Therefore, where empirical detection limit measurement is not possible, 4σ may be an appropriate cut off for mPSC analysis. It is important to note that when binning data attenuated at a calculated detection limit (e.g. histogram presentation), lower bin limits must start precisely at the event cut-off, therefore most likely requiring non-integer edge values.</p><p id="P20">Recording noise is dependent not just on setups, but also individual cells. The quality of sealing and membrane integrity during whole-cell recordings will influence the standard deviation of noise, and event detection will be dependent in turn on these parameters. It is therefore important that analysed mPSC recordings not only have as low noise as possible, but also that experimental groups have equivalent noise levels between cells, and that lower quality recordings are discarded. When experimental groups have different levels of noise, analysis can be reliably performed by applying the detection threshold from the highest noise dataset to all conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Biological interpretation of mPSC changes</title><p id="P21">Interpretation of ‘mini data’ extends further than only numbers and distributions. As we understand more about the plasticity of synapses, it becomes clear that the historic doctrine of ‘mPSC amplitude changes = postsynaptic’ and ‘mPSC frequency changes = presynaptic’ is a gross oversimplification. Multiple factors of both pre and postsynapse could biologically alter mPSC frequency and amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Changes in mPSC amplitude could be caused postsynaptically, by changes in neurotransmitter receptor abundance or conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kessels and Malinow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Malenka and Nicoll, 1999</xref>), but also presynaptically or transsynaptically, through vesicle properties or alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Scheefhals and MacGillavry, 2018</xref>). Similarly, changes in the number of active release sites could change mPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Malgaroli and Tsien, 1992</xref>), but postsynaptic unsilencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Isaac et al., 1996</xref>) could also enact a postsynaptic change in event frequency. Neuronal properties such as dendritic event location and cable properties will also influence mPSC properties. Each of these factors can add significant complexity to the distribution of synaptic events recorded from across a neuron’s dendritic tree. Therefore, interpreting specific effects, such as changes in synaptic nanoarchitecture, would need both low noise recordings and particularly careful data analysis.</p><p id="P22">‘Mini analysis’ has become widespread due to the ease of single-cell recording to acquire synaptic insights.

The resulting noise has a comparable frequency spectrum to ‘real world’ patch clamp recording noise.

Detected events were extracted from recordings or simulations and fit with a biexponential function consisting of a rising and decaying phase, and peak amplitude was taken as the minimum of the curve fit. This approach prevents error in peak measurement caused by recording noise, which is large for small events close to the noise level (e.g. mPSCs).
