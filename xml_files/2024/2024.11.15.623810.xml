These signals are mediated by the Rheb and Rag small GTPases, respectively, which activate mTORC1 on the cytosolic face of the lysosome membrane. We biochemically reconstituted the activation of mTORC1 on membranes by physiological submicromolar concentrations of Rheb, Rags, and Ragulator. We determined the cryo-EM structure and found that Raptor and mTOR directly interact with the membrane at anchor points separated by up to 230 Å across the membrane surface. Full engagement of the membrane anchors is required for maximal activation, which is brought about by alignment of the catalytic residues in the mTOR kinase active site. The observations show at the molecular and atomic scale how converging signals from growth factors and nutrients drive mTORC1 recruitment to and activation on the lysosomal membrane in a three-step process, consisting of (1) Rag-Ragulator-driven recruitment to within ~100 Å of the lysosomal membrane, (2) Rheb-driven recruitment to within ~40 Å, and finally (3) direct engagement of mTOR and Raptor with the membrane. The combination of Rheb and membrane engagement leads to full catalytic activation, providing a structural explanation for growth factor and nutrient signal integration at the lysosome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates upstream growth factor and nutrient signals to stimulate anabolic processes connected to cell growth and inhibit catabolic processes such as autophagy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.

Rheb is present in cells at an estimated 650 nM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, yet &gt; 100 μM soluble Rheb-GTP is needed for half-maximal mTORC1 activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, there is a greater than two orders of magnitude discrepancy between the physiological levels and the <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemistry of Rheb, the most fundamental activator of mTORC1.</p><p id="P3">Rheb is farnesylated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, which is essential for mTORC1 activation and is responsible for targeting Rheb to lysosomes. Despite that the receptor-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway originates at the PM, Rheb signaling to mTORC1 occurs exclusively on the cytosolic face of lysosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. mTORC1 is recruited to lysosomes by the Ras-related GTP binding (Rag) GTPases RagA-D under amino acid replete conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The Rags function as heterodimers, with RagA or RagB paired with RagC or RagD. Active Rag dimers consisting of RagA/B-GTP and RagC/D-GDP recruit mTORC1 to the lysosome by binding to its Raptor subunit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The Rags, in turn, are recruited to the lysosome membrane by the pentameric Ragulator complex, specifically, by its myristoylated and palmitoylated Lamtor1 subunit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Amino acid-dependent mTORC1 recruitment to lysosomes by the Rags and Ragulator brings mTORC1 into proximity to the lysosome-bound pool of Rheb-GTP. This serves as a physiological “AND” gate for a GF signal and an ample pool of biosynthetic precursors prior to protein synthesis and cell growth. How this physiologically critical AND gate might be organized and implemented at the structural level is unknown.</p><p id="P4">We hypothesized that the lysosome membrane itself might be the missing link that orchestrates the AND gate and contributes the missing &gt; 2 orders of magnitude needed for Rheb-GTP activation of mTORC1. The feasibility of atomistic single-particle cryo-EM reconstructions of liposome-bound peripheral protein assemblies has recently been demonstrated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. This prompted us to reconstitute the concerted activation of mTORC1 on liposomes by Rheb and RagA/C-Ragulator, and elucidate its structural basis.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Reconstitution of mTORC1 activation on membranes</title><p id="P5">We employed Large Unilamellar Vesicles (LUVs) with a lipid composition of 72.8% DOPC, 7% POPS, 10% Cholesterol, 5% DGS-NTA, 5% PE-MCC, and 0.2% DiR, as the membrane platform to investigate the role of Rag-Ragulator and Rheb in mTORC1 activation. The active RagA-GTP-RagC-GDP-Ragulator complex was recruited to LUVs containing the lipid DGS-NTA(Ni) via a 6xHis-tag fused to the N-terminus of the Lamtor1 subunit of Ragulator in place of the physiological myristoyl and palmitoyl modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Rheb was tethered to the LUVs via a thiol-maleimide reaction between the functionalized lipid PE-MCC and its only cysteine residue, C181, which is the farnesylation site of endogenous Rheb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Rheb and RagA/C-Ragulator were used at essentially physiological concentrations of 250 and 300 nM, respectively. We monitored mTORC1 kinase activity as a function of LUVs, Rheb, and Rag-Ragulator by detecting the phosphorylation of Thr37 and Thr46 of full-length 4EBP1. mTORC1 kinase activity increased over 35-fold in the presence of LUVs, Rag-Ragulator, and Rheb-GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), but not with Rheb-GDP. As expected, no activity was observed in the presence of the mTOR inhibitor Torin1 or the absence of mTORC1. LUVs and Rheb-GTP increased mTORC1 activity by ~ 3-fold, whereas other combinations did not affect its activity. No increase in mTORC1 activity was observed when 250 nM Rheb-GTP was present but LUVs were not, consistent with the past report that &gt; 100 μM soluble Rheb-GTP is required for activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, the combination of liposomes and liposome-tethered Rheb and RagA/C-Ragulator synergistically and potently activates mTORC1 phosphorylation of 4EBP1.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Cryo-EM structure of mTORC1-Rheb-Rag-Ragulator-4EBP1 assembled on a membrane</title><p id="P6">We reconstituted the mTORC1-Rheb-Rag-Ragulator with the full-length substrate 4EBP1 complex on liposomes, and acquired cryo-EM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). 2D class averages suggested that the complex was rigidly oriented with respect to the phospholipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). We determined the cryo-EM structure of the entire assembly to an overall resolution of 3.23 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). The overall structure of mTORC1 and its interactions with Rheb and Rag-Ragulator are consistent with previous structures determined in the absence of membranes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, including the large conformational change induced by Rheb binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. However, when superimposing the membrane-bound mTORC1-Rheb structure with the soluble mTORC1-Rheb structure based on the mTOR subunit, we observed a conformational change in the Raptor subunit, showing a rotation of about 7 degrees toward the HEAT domain of mTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). This rotational movement of Raptor in the membrane-bound mTORC1-Rheb aligns with the transition from apo mTORC1 to soluble mTORC1-Rheb, suggesting that the membrane plays a role in further constricting mTORC1 when bound to Rheb. Local refinement of the mTOR-Rheb-mLST8 and Raptor-Rag-Ragulator subcomplexes yielded cryo-EM density maps at resolutions of 3.12 Å and 2.98 Å, respectively, allowing us to build atomically detailed models of the entire assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). The high-resolution cryo-EM density of nucleotides confirmed the active states of Rag GTPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3a,b</xref>). The density of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) was observed, surrounded by the lysine/Arginine cluster in the FAT domain of mTOR as previously reported in the structures of mTORC2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and the TFEB-containing megacomplex of mTORC1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Despite the inclusion of full-length 4EBP1, only the TOR signaling (TOS) motif was visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>), bound to the same location on the Raptor subunit as previously identified <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">We noticed two 3D classes with extra Rag-Ragulator densities bound to the mLST8 subunit of mTORC1, and refined to overall resolutions of 3.47 Å and 3.81 Å for classes with the one and two extra copies of Rag-Ragulator, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). We pooled these classes together and carried out a focused refinement of the mLST8-Rag-Ragulator subcomplex, yielding a cryo-EM map with a resolution of 4 Å. The structure revealed direct interactions between mLST8 and RagA-GTP. Residues His49 and Arg51 of the interswitch region of RagA maintained electrostatic interactions with an acidic patch on mLST8, involving residues Asp181, Asp213, and Glu300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5a,b</xref>). The ordered interswitch region of RagA in the GTP-bound state ensures that only RagA-GTP can interact with mLST8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). This novel Rag-Ragulator site partially overlaps the mSIN subunit of mTORC2, consistent with the absence of interaction between Rag-Ragulator and mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>). This site is near the binding site of the mTORC1 inhibitory protein PRAS40 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>mTOR and Raptor are membrane-interacting proteins</title><p id="P8">The cryo-EM reconstruction revealed that mTOR and Raptor subunits directly interact with the membrane, in addition to the expected membrane attachment by lipidated Lamtor1 and Rheb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). In line with previous publications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, the N-terminal membrane anchoring segment of Lamtor1 was not visualized. The last ordered residue Ala173 of Rheb is in the middle of the hypervariable domain (HVR), indicating a partially folded HVR and a flexible 8-residue loop attached to membrane through Cys181, which places Rheb about 13 Å above the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The hydrophobic side-chains Phe1296 and Met1297 in the WD40 domain of Raptor, which we denote as the “FM finger”, manifested membrane interactions in the cryo-EM density map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Specific residues in the N-HEAT domain of mTOR, namely Lys471, Arg472, and Lys474, form a basic loop that is also in close contact with the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The entire active mTORC1 assembly showed a large membrane-covering footprint, due to the membrane contact sites of mTOR and Raptor subunits, as well as the small membrane-Rheb gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The two Raptor-membrane contact sites in the dimeric structure are separated by 230 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e</xref>). To accommodate both contact sites simultaneously, the liposome diameter must be large enough to provide a relatively flat platform within the potential flexibility range of the complex. Accordingly, we reasoned that liposomes with smaller diameters would result in reduced mTORC1 activation. Liposomes with diameters of 30 or 50 nm showed about a 65% reduction in mTORC1 kinase activity compared to those with a 400 nm diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>), bearing out the structural prediction.</p><p id="P10">To validate the biochemical role of the membrane-interacting residues of Raptor and mTOR, we mutated Raptor residues Phe1296 and Met1297, as well as mTOR residues Lys471, Arg472, and Lys474, to acidic residues in order to maximally disrupt membrane anchoring. We then purified mTORC1 with either the Raptor mutations, the mTOR mutations, or a combination of both, and tested them using an in vitro kinase assay. Mutations in mTORC1 containing Raptor<sup>F1296E/M1297E</sup> alone, mTOR<sup>K471D/R472D/K474D</sup> alone, or the combination of both reduced the kinase activity of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>), consistent with the membrane-docked structure. To validate the functional role of the Raptor-membrane interaction, we tested the constructs of Raptor<sup>F1296E</sup> and Raptor<sup>F1296E/M1297E</sup> in the inducible Raptor knockout (iRapKO) Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>). After the treatment of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT), we confirmed the knockout of Raptor. We observed a significant reduction in 4EBP1 and S6K phosphorylation in both Raptor mutants compared to the wild type, upon the replenishment of amino acids. These results collectively show that the full activation of mTORC1 requires the interactions between membrane and mTOR and Raptor subunits.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conformational pathway for Rheb activation of mTORC1 on the membrane</title><p id="P11">Using symmetry expansion and particle subtraction to remove Raptor-Rag-Ragulator, we performed 3D classification on the subpopulation that does not contain extra Rag-Ragulator and identified two distinct conformations of the mTOR-Rheb-mLST8 subcomplex. We designate these states as “intermediate” and “active” for reasons described below. The final resolutions of the intermediate and active states were 3.61 Å and 3.16 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">By aligning these states based on the Rheb structure, we revealed the conformational changes between the intermediate and active states. The M-heat domain of the active state moved more toward the N-heat domain than in the intermediate state, with an average distance of about 5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). The FAT and kinase domains of the active state moved about 5-7 Å more toward the Rheb than in the intermediate state. As a result, the mLST8 subunit moved more than 10 Å toward the Rheb in the active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7a</xref>). The soluble mTORC1-Rheb structure is between the conformational pathway of the intermediate and the active states, when superimposed on the Rheb subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7b</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The mTOR-Rheb interaction is largely maintained in both intermediate and active states, however, the residues Met1255 and Lys1256 of the FAT domain of mTOR are disordered in the intermediate state but engaged with Rheb in the active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Notably, in the mTOR intermediate state, the residue Tyr35 in the switch I region of Rheb flips to the opposite side and disengaged with the nucleotide, while in the mTOR active state, the switch I region of Rheb adopts the canonical conformation of the Rheb GTP-bound state. In addition, we observed an ordered loop in the active state, located in the opposite site of ATP-binding pocket, while the loop is disordered in the intermediate state and in the soluble mTORC1-Rheb structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Fig. 7c</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To reveal local conformational differences in the kinase domain and in the ATP-binding pocket, we superimposed the intermediate and active states of mTOR based on the C-lobe of the kinase domain. The FAT domain of mTOR is more engaged with the C-lobe in the active state than in the intermediate state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>). The established electrostatic interactions between residues Glu1581 and Gln1355 in the FAT domain, as well as between the residues Arg1585 of the FAT domain and Glu2311 of the C-lobe in the active state, indicate direct communication between the FAT domain and the kinase domain for promoting the active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). In the ATP-binding pocket, the intermediate state showed similar conformation as the apo state in the ATP-binding pocket, despite the drastic movement of the M-heat domain upon Rheb binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). In the active state, the ATP molecule was positioned 1.5 Å closer to the catalytic residues in the C-lobe compared to the soluble mTORC1-Rheb structure, aligning more closely with other atypical serine/threonine kinases in the PIKK family in their active states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Fig. 8b</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To characterize the relationships between different mTORC1 states and the membrane engagement, we performed three-dimensional variability analysis (3DVA) using the same symmetry-expanded and Raptor-Rag-Ragulator subtracted particles that were used for 3D classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). We identified one component that does not involve protein stretching into the membrane. We then extracted particles that are at the two ends of this variability component for further local refinement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>). The two cryo-EM maps resembled the intermediate and active states identified in the 3D classification, as the absence or presence of the corresponding loop 904-920 is confirmed, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9c</xref>). The active state from 3DVA showed clear density for the basic loop of Lys471, Arg472, and Lys474 and an extended helix, indicating stronger membrane engagement, while the basic loop and the helix are not observed in the intermediate state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9d</xref>). However, the Raptor-membrane interaction is present in both intermediate and active states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Fig. 9e</xref>). This implies that direct Raptor-membrane interaction is a general requirement for mTORC1 membrane engagement, while the mTOR-membrane interaction promotes the activation of the mTOR kinase.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">Among the questions we set out to address was why Rheb-GTP, which is critical for GF-dependent activation of mTORC1 in cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, is such a low-affinity activator in solution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. We found that the physiological concentrations of lipidated Rheb-GTP, in the presence of liposomes, membrane-tethered Ragulator, and an active Rag dimer, could potently activate mTORC1 in a biochemical reconstitution. This could be explained, at least in part, simply by the increased local concentration of Rheb-GTP in the vicinity of mTORC1. Reduction of dimensionality, which limits the search space accessible by diffusion to two dimensions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, could be a contributing factor, but the limitations of this mechanism in biology have been noted <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We probed the mechanism more deeply, however, using cryo-EM structure determination of the reconstituted system on the membrane. We found that precise structural responses to the membrane context are also important.</p><p id="P17">By carrying out an atomically detailed analysis of more and less active conformations in the membrane context, we were able to map an activation pathway mediated by the membrane itself. We found that both the mTOR and Raptor subunits of mTORC1 directly engage with the membrane. Full membrane engagement by Raptor and mTOR contacts separated by over 230 Å promotes large-scale conformational rearrangements of the N- and M-HEAT, FAT, and kinase domains of mTOR. These large-scale changes in turn re-orient the N- and C-lobes of the kinase domain to fine-tune the kinase active site in a catalytically optimal geometry. The contributions of membrane anchoring and membrane shape to catalytic activation were verified by reconstitution of membrane binding site mutants of Raptor and mTOR and analyzing the shape dependence of liposome activation. Lysosomes undergo tubulation and swelling in the course of their normal function and under stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, which raises the possibility that membrane shape changes could influence mTORC1 activation.</p><p id="P18">Transduction of the activating membrane engagement signal from the plane of the membrane involves pivoting of the side-chain of Rheb Tyr35. In the intermediate state, the side-chain of Tyr35 is in an unexpected conformation, which points towards mTOR instead of the Rheb GTP binding site. This serves to restrict the close approach of mTOR to Rheb and so to the membrane. The Tyr35 side-chain rotates away from mTOR upon activation, relieving this steric barrier to close engagement. The mutation <italic>RHEB</italic> Y35N was discovered in endometrial and kidney clear cell tumors in the course of a large-scale genetic analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.

Our observations of two activity states of membrane-bound mTORC1 suggest that Rheb Y35N acts by promoting the fully membrane-engaged active conformation of mTORC1.</p><p id="P19">mTOR is a member of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-related kinase (PIKK) superfamily. While the role of membrane anchors with large spatial separations in kinase activation is unique, similar local rearrangements of the N- and C-lobes of other PIKK family members, ATM, Mec1<sup>ATR</sup>, and DNA-PK, have been reported in response to ROS-dependent activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, constitutive activating mutation (F2244L) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, and DNA-activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, respectively.

The mLST8 subunit is common to both mTORC1 and mTORC2, but the additional presence of SIN1 in mTORC2 blocks the novel Rag-Ragulator site, consistent with the known lack of interaction of mTORC2 with Rags. The novel Rag-Ragulator site overlaps with the binding site for proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kilodaltons (PRAS40) on mLST8 in mTORC1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.

It remains to be determined, however, whether the novel Rag-Ragulator site has a physiological activating role, whether via antagonizing PRAS40 inhibition, or simply augmenting lysosomal recruitment. Another open question concerns the role of membrane contacts in mTORC1 phosphorylation of TFEB and other non-canonical substrates, which requires Rag-Ragulator but not Rheb <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">mTORC1 is activated on lysosomes in response to GF signaling, despite that only a small fraction of the key mediator of GF signaling, Rheb, is transiently localized on lysosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Physiologically, this serves to AND-gate the signal to proliferate with the availability of amino acids needed as building blocks for growth. Yet it has been unclear how signal integration is executed at the structural levels. The Rag GTPase dimer is tethered to the lysosome by the Ragulator complex. Ragulator is anchored by lipidation of its Lamtor1 subunit, and the lipid anchor is connected to the folded core of Ragulator by a 45-residue N-terminal disordered region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, with an estimated end-to-end length of ~47 Å on average and an extended length of ~100 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10a</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. The distance is potentially longer because of the volume-exclusion effects due to its tethering to the membrane surface <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Augmented to the dimensions of the Rag-Ragulator complex leads us to estimate that the membrane-docking site of mTOR would be tethered within ~40 Å of the membrane surface upon Rag-Ragulator engagement. This is close enough to dramatically increase the probability of encountering membrane-tethered Rheb, which itself is tethered at a mean distance of ~15 Å and an extended distance of ~40 Å from the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Fig. 10b</xref>). Even Rheb is still not close enough to drive full membrane engagement and activation on its own. Thus, lysosomal membrane engagement is a three-step process, in which initial localization to within a ~10 nm vicinity of the membrane is driven by Rag-Ragulator. This allows capture by Rheb at a distance of ~1.5-4 nm from the membrane. The final docking to the membrane is driven by the Raptor and mTOR membrane docking sites, leading to full activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). This model provides a satisfying structural explanation for how mTORC1 integrates growth factor and nutrient signals in the context of the lysosomal membrane.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p id="P22">The full-length, codon-optimized genes of human RagC with the S75N mutation and human RagA with the Q66L mutation were synthesized (Twist Bioscience) and individually cloned into a pCAG vector.
