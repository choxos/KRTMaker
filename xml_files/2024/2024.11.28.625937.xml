Affected patients can experience severe pain: mobility can be severely impaired, significantly impacting people’s life quality. Progressive degeneration of the articular cartilage, remodelling of the subchondral bone and synovial inflammation are all considered hallmarks of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>).</p><p id="P6">OA pathogenesis is complex as the disease can be caused by a multiplicity of factors, such as genetic predisposition, history of trauma, obesity, which can contribute to the development of the disease, often in combination, making patient stratification difficult and resulting in a high variability of response to treatment both in pre-clinical and clinical settings.</p><p id="P7">No disease modifying drug is currently approved for the treatment of OA and surgical joint replacement is offered to patients most severely affected.</p><p id="P8">Deregulation of several signalling cascades has been associated with the onset and progression of OA. Deregulation of the Wnt-signalling has been linked to several pathological features of OA, cartilage degradation in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Wnts are a family of lipid modified and glycosylated ligands capable of activating several signalling cascades, upon interaction with the Frizzled (FZDs) family of receptors and a variety of co-receptors such as low-density Lipoprotein-related protein receptors (LRPs) and Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). The most investigated branch of the Wnt-signalling in the context of cartilage biology and OA is the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Overactivation of this pathway has been linked to cartilage degeneration in OA both in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) and in experimental animal models. Targeting of the Wnt signalling for therapeutic purposes has anyway remained a hurdle for the still incomplete understanding of the mechanisms regulating its activation as well as reciprocal modulation of β-catenin dependent and independent arms of the signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We have recently discovered that Wnt3a can simultaneously mediate the activation of both the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the Wnt/Calcium Calmodulin pathway in the articular chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). The two pathways are in a steady state equilibrium in physiological conditions and disruption of this homeostasis can lead to cartilage degeneration and OA development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Nonetheless, different transcriptional targets were downstream the activation of the two branches of the signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Here, by further analysing our previous data, we discovered that microRNA-544a (miR-544a) is an important modulator of the Wnt-signalling in chondrocytes, whose activity is upregulated in the articular cartilage in OA, and targeting of this microRNA could represent a new strategy to halt tissue degeneration during the progression of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Human articular cartilage samples and chondrocytes isolation</title><p id="P11">Preserved (Mankin Score ≤4) and damaged (Mankin Score &gt;4) human articular cartilage (AC) was collected from patients (male and female, age range 50-90) undergone total hip or knee replacement because of OA, following collection of informed consent.

To understand the specific transcriptional targets downstream the activation of the individual pathways, we performed a microarray analysis on human articular chondrocytes (HACs) stimulated with Wnt3a with or without the CaMKII inhibitor KN93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Our analysis showed that the gene mostly upregulated in response to Wnt3a stimulation in a CaMKII independent manner was Axin2, a very well characterised modulator of the Wnt-β-catenin dependent pathway(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). The most downregulated gene was instead the precursor of miR-544a, a microRNA which had been shown to activate the Wnt-β catenin pathway in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), but whose role has not been previously characterised in the articular cartilage (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). These data were further validated by qPCR (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). We then tested whether Wnt3a stimulation of HACs could affect the expression of the mature form of the microRNA. Wnt3a stimulation promoted the upregulation of the mature form of miR-544a (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). This might suggest that the biogenesis of this microRNA could be either regulated through a negative feedback loop mechanism or that the pre-miRNA degradation occurs faster than the degradation of the mature form, as previously described in a different biological context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>miR-544a modulates the activation of both β-catenin and CaMKII-dependent branches of the Wnt-signalling network</title><p id="P27">To define the molecular targets of miR-544a in articular chondrocytes, we performed a TargetScan analysis. Upon cross-referencing with previous literature, we focussed our attention on the 3p arm of miR-544a, as previous studies suggest this as an active form of this microRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). The TargetScan analysis returned over 5154 putative target genes for miR-544a-3p. We then performed an over-representation analysis with ConsensusPath database software to understand the KEGG-annotated pathways potentially modulated by miR-544a. The analysis returned 69 pathways. Confirming previous literature, the Wnt pathway was among the pathways modulated by miR-544a. Putative targets of the pathway are listed in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>. Both components of the Wnt-β-catenin dependent and CaMKII-dependent branches of the Wnt signalling are included within this list. To validate the modulation of some of the components of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway in articular chondrocytes (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>), we cloned the 3’-UTR of Axin2, Cadherin 1 (CDH1), β-catenin, catenin beta interacting protein 1 (CTNNBIP1) and Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) or a scrambly rearranged sequence of their nucleotides as control upstream the luciferase expressing gene in pMirGlo-vectors. These were then transfected in the chondrocyte cell line C28/I2 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Stimulation of the cells with a miR-544a mimic significantly decreased the relative luminescence emitted by the cells transfected with the original 3’-UTR sequences but not the one emitted by cells transfected with the mutated forms (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Modulation of the target genes was confirmed at mRNA level in HACs in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>. Interestingly, while the transcription of GSK3β seems to be downregulated by miR-544a in the reporter assay, the actual mRNA expression was upregulated by the microRNA in primary cells. This suggests the presence of additional molecular mechanisms controlling the expression of this key component of the Wnt-signalling in articular chondrocytes at the transcriptional level.</p><p id="P28">To confirm the modulation of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway in response to miR-544a, we measured the expression of β-catenin in HACs stimulated with the miR-544a mimic. Indeed, β-catenin expression was upregulated by miR-544a and its transmigration to the nucleus was enhanced in comparison to cells stimulated with the negative control (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>). Furthermore, miR-544a enhanced the activation of a TCF/LEF reporter assay induced by recombinant Wnt3a, both in bovine primary chondrocytes and in HEK293 cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f and g</xref>). Finally, as some isoforms of CaMKII were also among the putative target genes for miR-544a, we tested whether stimulation of primary cells with miR-544a mimic could affect the activation of CaMKII. Phosphorylation of CaMKII was increased by stimulation of HACs with miR-544a, suggesting a role for miR-544a in the simultaneous modulation of separate branches of the Wnt-signalling (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e and h</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>miR-544a expression is upregulated in OA and by pro-catabolic cytokines</title><p id="P29">To investigate the biological role of miR-544a on cartilage homeostasis, we measured its expression levels in chondrocytes removed from preserved (Mankin score ≤4) and damaged (Mankin score &gt;4) areas of articular cartilage removed from patients undergone total hip or knee replacement because of OA. miR-544a expression was significantly higher in cells isolated from damaged areas of the cartilage (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Interestingly, we noted that upregulation of the expression of the microRNA was not homogeneous within the tissue, but was higher in the deep layer, where the proteoglycan content was higher (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), -6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines known to promote degeneration of joint tissues in the articular cartilage during the development of OA, increased the abundance of miR-544a in HACs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>miR-544a promotes catabolism in articular chondrocytes</title><p id="P30">We then investigated the effect of miR-544a on chondrocyte metabolism. Firstly, we measured proteoglycan content in micromass cultures of primary chondrocytes stimulated with Wnt3a in presence or absence of miR-544a. The microRNA promoted the downregulation of proteoglycans alone and enhanced the downregulation induced by the recombinant Wnt3a (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a and b</xref>).</p><p id="P31">We then tested the effect of the microRNA on the expression of cartilage phenotypic markers and enzymes involved in the modulation of cartilage remodelling in OA. Stimulation of HACs with miR-544a mimic induced modulation of chondrocyte phenotypic markers, downregulation of the joint lubricant lubricin and of the metalloproteinase inhibitor Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP-3), whilst upregulating the expression of the hypertrophic marker MMP-13 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). miR-544a overexpression also promoted upregulation of Heme-Oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), a marker of cell oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) which we have previously shown to be a specific marker of the activation of the Wnt/CaMKII axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). We confirmed upregulation of MMP-13 at protein level by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). Supporting a pro-catabolic role of miR-544a in the articular cartilage, we also showed that its overexpression can promote upregulation of Aggrecan neoepitope generated by Aggrecanase-mediated proteolytic cut (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>miR-544a promotes catabolism through the activation of both the β-catenin and the CaMKII mediated branches of the Wnt signalling</title><p id="P32">As miR-544a could promote both the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin and of the Wnt/CaMKII mediated pathways, we investigated whether its catabolic activity was specifically mediated by one of the two branches. To this end, we stimulated HACs with the miR-544a mimic alone or in combination with inhibitors of the activation of CaMKII (KN93) or β-catenin (XAV939). Co-stimulation with both inhibitors rescued the upregulation of MMP-13 expression as well as the expression of Aggrecanase-cut aggrecan (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a and b</xref>). This seems to confirm an important modulatory role for miR-544a in the maintenance of the homeostatic balance between different branches of the Wnt signalling and that overactivation of both branches can lead to increased catabolism and pro-degenerative effects in the articular cartilage, as summarized in the schematic representation in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P33">Our previous work showed that Wnt ligands have the potential to simultaneously activate multiple signalling pathways with different biological outcomes. More specifically, we showed that Wnt3a could both activate the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway and the Wnt/CaMKII pathway driving both anabolic and catabolic changes in chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P34">Here we investigated further microarray data previously generated, obtained by the stimulation of human articular chondrocytes with Wnt3a, to dissect specific transcriptional targets of the Wnt/β-catenin dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Our data showed that the precursor of miR-544a was the transcriptional target mostly downregulated in a Wnt/β-catenin dependent manner by Wnt3a.</p><p id="P35">Interestingly here we showed that stimulation of chondrocytes also resulted in the upregulation of the mature form of miR-544a, suggesting that the biogenesis of this microRNA is regulated through a negative feedback loop mechanism or that the pre-miRNA degradation occurs faster than the degradation of the mature form, as previously described in a different biological context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>).</p><p id="P36">MiR-544a sits on the chromosome 14q32.31 region (Gene ID: 664613). Interestingly this chromosomic region has been associated with a susceptibility gene for OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and cluster with other 19 micro-RNAs (mIR-134, -300, -323b, -376c, 376a-1 and 376a-2, -381, -382, -485, 487a and b, -539, -654, -655, -668, -889, -1185-1 and 2). Of these, 8 have already been associated with cartilage biology and/or the development of OA, albeit through interaction with different signalling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>).</p><p id="P37">The role of this micro-RNA has mostly been described in cancer biology: experimental work pointed to miR-554a as a modulator of tumour growth and spreading of metastasis in different types of neoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>).</p><p id="P38">The role of this microRNA in the articular cartilage and in OA has never been described before. Its modulation does not appear in previous transcriptomic studies aimed to identify biomarkers of disease. Nonetheless, we detected a higher abundance of the mature form of the microRNA in chondrocytes isolated from damaged areas of the articular cartilage of patients affected by OA. Within the damaged tissue, the expression of the microRNA localised in the areas where proteoglycan content was still abundant. These observations can lead to the speculation that the expression of this microRNA, and potentially many others, might be regulated in time and space during disease progression, and these factors should be taken more in consideration in the investigation of disease pathogenesis and to decrease data variability across donors.</p><p id="P39">Our findings confirm a role for miR-544a as an activator of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling. Yanaka and colleagues showed that miR-544a could induce the downregulation of CDH1 and Axin2, while favouring migration of β-catenin to the nucleus, and favouring epithelial-mesenchymal transition, thereby contributing to disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Similarly, miR-544a was reported to downregulate the expression of GSK3β and promote the one of β-catenin sustaining the self-renewal ability of lung-cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Our data confirmed the important role of miR-544a in the modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling in a non-cancer system, while adding complexity to its story, as we also demonstrated that this microRNA can also modulate the expression and the activity of components of the Wnt/CaMKII pathway in articular chondrocytes.</p><p id="P40">We have previously shown that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the Wnt/CaMKII pathways are in a steady-state equilibrium in the articular chondrocytes and their activation is reciprocally inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P41">We showed that a single Wnt-ligand could activate the two branches of the signalling in a concentration-dependent fashion. The data presented in this manuscript further highlight the strong connection between different arms of the signalling. As previously suggested by Amerongen and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), we should start referring to the Wnt-signalling as a network and take a more holistic approach when taking in consideration its targeting for therapeutic purposes.</p><p id="P42">The importance and the complexity of investigating signalling pathways as part of cell networks rather than unidirectional mechanisms has been reviewed in a few previously published works. Jordan and colleagues suggested that signalling pathways share “junctions”, which act as integrators of signals, and “nodes”, in charge of splitting the signals and direct them to multiple outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). While some of these key molecules have been identified, such as Protein Kinase A or Cdc42, the issue stands in how the signal within the network can be evaluated such as the appropriate response is then enabled. A physiological response is normally triggered when a signal comes through with the right intensity and for a specific but sustained duration. While this is easy to get through manipulation on in vitro conditions, it is not necessarily a reflection of real-life situations, where extracellular signals are mostly pulsatile and sub saturating in nature. In this context microRNAs such as miR-544a could really be crucial in stabilising signals and modulating their intensity to make them reach the right threshold, by acting on multiple components of the same network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>).</p><p id="P43">Integration of the Wnt signalling has been observed in different biological contexts, from development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), where a concerted activation of different receptors and downstream targets lead to a precise spatiotemporal control of the neuroectoderm patterning, to cancer cells, where the Wnt/β-catenin dependent and the Wnt/Ca2+/CaMKII signalling have been proposed to be interdependent, as increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels promoted translocation of β-catenin in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>).</p><p id="P44">In conclusion, the results of this study add further layers of complexity in the modulation of the Wtn signalling in the articular cartilage, which however might help explaining the struggle in targeting this pathway for pharmacological purposes. A better understanding of the molecular switches responsible for the enhancement or lessening of the Wnt response in the cell could open new therapeutic opportunities for its pharmacological re-tuning to physiological level in pathological conditions such as OA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material

Confirming binding of miR-544a to these genes, reduced luminescence was recorded in C28/I2 cells transfected with miR-544a mimic (100 nM) and the vectors expressing the seed sequences 48h after transfection. No reduction in luminescence was reported in cells transfected with vectors expressing the mutated forms of the seed sequences. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM of Relative Luminescence units of Firefly luciferase normalized to Renilla luciferase (n=3).
