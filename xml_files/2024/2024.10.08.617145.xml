Previous work has shown that retrieving (“testing”) memories from LTM can benefit their future LTM recall. Here, we examined the extent to which a benefit for subsequent LTM may also occur after retrieval from WM, depending on whether the WM contents were retrieved from a prioritized or deprioritized state. In three experiments, we combined variants of a novel visual WM paradigm with a subsequent surprise LTM recall test. We found a LTM benefit of WM testing both for prioritized and deprioritized WM contents, which, interestingly, was stronger for the deprioritized information. This pattern showed similarly across experiments with different priority manipulations. Subsequent LTM benefits generally occurred after WM testing with a recall-like test format (continuous report), but not after simple WM comparisons against a probe. The surprisingly larger LTM benefit for deprioritized WM contents may reflect enhanced encoding of the participants’ own subjective WM report − as opposed to the originally presented sample information − into LTM.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Of the myriads of information we experience in our daily lives, only a small fraction can later still be remembered. It is commonly assumed that momentary experiences are processed in Working Memory (WM), a strictly capacity-limited system that maintains information only as long as is needed for immediately upcoming tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">D’Esposito, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">D’Esposito &amp; Postle, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hitch &amp; Baddeley, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Miller, 1956</xref>). While the contents of WM typically persist only for seconds or less, some of the information may be committed to storage in long-term memory (LTM) and potentially persist for a lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Atkinson &amp; Shiffrin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baddeley, 2012</xref>). But which factors determine whether WM contents become durable in LTM or are eventually forgotten? Previous research has shown that LTM formation is facilitated, for instance, by “deep” semantic encoding of the stimulus materials (<italic>Levels of Processing</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Craik &amp; Lockhart, 1972</xref>), by their emotional salience (e.g., <italic>flashbulb memories</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Brown &amp; Kulik, 1977</xref>), and by directing top-down attention to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Khader et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Sundby et al., 2019</xref>). Other work has established that LTM storage is furthermore consolidated by “testing”, that is, by attempting to remember (“retrieval practice”) the information again at a later point in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Roediger &amp; Butler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Rowland, 2014</xref>). From a WM perspective, these factors pertain to how information is encoded into WM, and whether the information is encoded from the environment or is generated internally (the latter typically benefits subsequent LTM; for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bertsch et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Beyond encoding, WM function is thought to include purposeful maintenance, updating, and retrieval processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Ranganath et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cowan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">McElree, 2006</xref>; for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bledowski et al., 2010</xref>). Whether and how specific (sub)processes within WM affect subsequent LTM is subject to ongoing research. Focusing on maintenance, several studies with verbal materials found that longer WM retention periods were associated with improved subsequent LTM recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Jarjat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Madigan &amp; McCabe, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Souza &amp; Oberauer, 2017</xref>; for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hartshorne &amp; Makovski, 2019</xref>). These findings suggest an LTM benefit of subvocal rehearsal in WM, although similar results have been reported for non-verbal (e.g., visual) materials as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hartshorne &amp; Makovski, 2019</xref>). A number of studies have also investigated how subsequent LTM is affected by attentional (de-)prioritization of WM contents during maintenance, e.g., via retrospective cueing (retro-cues; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Griffin &amp; Nobre, 2003</xref>). While many of these studies found that prioritization improved subsequent LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fan &amp; Turk-Browne, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Jeanneret et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">LaRocque et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Reaves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Strunk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Wang &amp; Van Ede, 2024</xref>), others found no such effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bartsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Mao Chao et al., 2023</xref>) or even found superior LTM when attention was diverted from the WM information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Rose et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the latter result appears consistent with a body of work by McCabe and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Loaiza &amp; McCabe, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McCabe, 2008</xref>), which showed that intermittent distraction during word list learning (“complex span” task) impaired the words’ immediate WM recall, but paradoxically improved their subsequent LTM recall. This counterintuitive finding has been explained in terms of ‘covert retrieval’ of the WM items back into the focus of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Loaiza &amp; McCabe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McCabe, 2008</xref>), based on the idea that during distraction, WM information was temporarily maintained in ‘activated long-term memory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cowan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Oberauer, 2002</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Beukers et al., 2021</xref>). A possible corollary of this view is that retrieval processes in WM might foster subsequent LTM in quite similar ways as the well-established testing effects in the LTM literature, i.e., through retrieval from an LTM-like storage format, especially when the WM information was unattended.</p><p id="P4">However, unlike LTM effects attributed to covert WM processing (i.e., during retention), the role of overt WM retrieval during WM testing has thus far received only relatively little attention (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Tozios &amp; Fukuda, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Xie &amp; Reuter-Lorenz, 2024</xref>). One reason for this might be that WM testing typically involves some form of reexposure to the WM information when it is presented as a recognition probe (e.g., in delayed-match-to-sample tasks) or when it is reproduced by the participant themselves (e.g., in WM recall). An overall LTM benefit of WM testing might thus be trivially expected if the WM test provides an additional learning opportunity for subsequent LTM. Studies of the well-known testing effect in the LTM literature typically control for reexposure by including matched “restudy” conditions, in which no retrieval is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Rowland, 2014</xref>). Creating similar conditions in a WM-task context is difficult because without the expectation of a WM test, there would be no reason for participants to engage in WM maintenance at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baddeley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Postle &amp; Oberauer, 2022</xref>). Perhaps unsurprisingly, thus far only few WM studies have examined how the LTM consequences of overt WM testing are affected by task factors such as distraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Loaiza et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McCabe, 2008</xref>) or cueing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">LaRocque et al., 2015</xref>), mostly with negative results. In other words, while the idea that LTM benefits from presumed ‘covert’ WM retrieval processes has been increasingly established, less is known about whether and how LTM is affected by overt WM retrieval during explicit WM testing.</p><p id="P5">Here, we used a novel approach to investigate how tOur results showed clear subsequent LTM benefitsaive retrieval from WM (“WM testing”) affects the transfer of information to LTM, depending on whether the information was retrieved from a prioritized or a deprioritized WM state. Unlike previous studies which reported no differential LTM benefit of word-list recall after distraction in a ‘complex span’ WM task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Loaiza et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McCabe, 2008</xref>), our WM tasks required participants to maintain visual information, specifically, the orientations of one or two rotated objects. Further, whereas previous studies of the long-term consequences of attentional (de-)prioritization typically used recognition tests to probe WM, we asked participants to provide continuous orientation reports, both as WM tests (Experiments 1 &amp; 2) and when probing participants’ subsequent LTM in a later surprise test. Not only did we hypothesize that continuous reporting promotes active WM retrieval (and hence a sizable WM-testing effect), it also allowed us to examine the extent to which subsequent LTM reports reflected the participant’s own (subjective) WM-test reports (instead of the WM samples’ original orientation), and whether such “testing bias” varied with the WM information’s attentional state (prioritized vs. deprioritized). Lastly, in Experiment 3, we asked whether the LTM consequences of WM retrieval indeed hinged on the format of WM testing (continuous reports vs. delayed comparison).</p><p id="P6">Our results showed clear subsequent LTM benefits of WM testing with continuous reports and further revealed that participants’ LTM reporting was biased towards their WM reports. Interestingly, these effects were more pronounced when the WM information was retrieved from a deprioritized state, both when we manipulated priority via testing order (Experiment 1) and using retro-cues (Experiment 2). Thus, although deprioritization expectedly reduced immediate WM test accuracy, it paradoxically improved subsequent LTM accuracy, in line with a stronger WM-testing effect for unattended WM contents. Across the WM and LTM tests in both experiments, we further observed a pattern of within-trial ‘primacy’ effects to suggest that the role of episodic factors in accessing the memoranda increased from prioritized over deprioritized to long-term storage. Lastly, when using a delayed comparison WM-test format (binary choice) instead of continuous reports (Experiment 3), we obtained starkly different results, with no effects of priority in neither WM nor LTM tests, and substantially lower LTM performance overall. Together, our findings highlight a critical and multi-faceted role of explicit WM testing in understanding the link(s) between short-and long-term storage in human memory.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P7">We report the results of three experiments in which randomly oriented pictures of real-world objects were used as sample stimuli in a WM task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).

When probed after the delay, the sample object reappeared in a random orientation and participants were asked to re-rotate it to its previous orientation (continuous report). In half of the two-sample trials (randomly varied), only one of the two samples (randomly selected) was probed. On the remaining two-sample trials, after the first WM test (Test 1), also the orientation of the other, previously unprobed sample was probed (Test 2). Thus, participants had to maintain the orientation of both WM samples until Test 1, during which the unprobed sample can be assumed to be deprioritized for the remainder of the trial.

As expected, WM accuracy was significantly higher (i.e. smaller errors) on one-sample trials (M = 10.05°, SE = 0.49°) compared to two-sample trials [Test 1 and 2 combined; M = 17.42°, SE = 0.73°; t(186) = -14.53, p &lt; 0.001]. Further, in the two-sample trials, performance on Test 2 (M = 20.36°, SE = 0.96°) was significantly reduced compared to Test 1 [M = 15.95°, SE = 0.71°; t(186) = 6.50, p &lt; 0.001], as was expected by deprioritization of the second tested sample during and after Test 1.</p><p id="P10">In the two-sample trials, we also examined the extent to which WM accuracy was modulated by sample position. A 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA with the factors Sample Position (1/2) and WM Test (1/2) showed a main effect of Sample Position [F(1,186) = 4.836, p = 0.029, η2 = 0.003], indicating that first-presented samples were remembered better (“primacy” effect), and a main effect of WM Test [F(1,186) = 39.358, p &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.026], reflecting the lower performance on Test 2 (see above). There also was a significant interaction between the two factors [F(1,186) = 11.369, p &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.007], indicating that the primacy effect was stronger on Test 2 than on Test 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Post-hoc tests confirmed a significant primacy effect on Test 2 [M = 18.40°, SE = 1.05° vs. M = 22.15°, SE = 1.187°; t(186) = -3.239, p = 0.001], but not on Test 1 [M = 16.347, SE = 0.776 vs. M = 15.523, SE = 0.786; t(186) = 1.208, p = 0.229]. Together, the results from two-sample trials are in line with earlier findings of reduced WM recall after deprioritization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Emrich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Rerko &amp; Oberauer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Souza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Souza &amp; Oberauer, 2016</xref>). In addition, the results showed a WM “primacy” effect (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gorgoraptis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hurlstone et al., 2014</xref>), which occurred only for the second-tested (deprioritized) samples.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>LTM performance</title><p id="P11">In the subsequent surprise LTM test, the participants were asked to report the orientations of all sample objects that had been presented in the WM task, including those that were not probed in a WM test. Focusing on the probed samples, as expected, participants’ LTM reports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) were considerably less accurate (M = 51.23°, SE = 0.79°) than their previous reports in the WM task [t(186) = 37.28, p &lt; 0.001]. LTM performance for samples from one-sample WM trials appeared descriptively better (M = 50.73°, SE = 1.37°) than for samples from two-sample trials (Test 1 and 2 combined; M = 52.31°, SE = 1.20°) but the difference was not significant [t(186) = -1.544, p = 0.124]. Interestingly, focusing on the samples from two-sample trials, LTM accuracy was significantly higher for samples that had been probed second (i.e. after deprioritization) in the WM task (WM Test 2, M = 49.00°, SE = 1.48°), compared to samples that had been probed first [WM Test 1; M = 54.18°°, SE = 1.20°, t(186) = -4.319, p &lt; 0.001]. Thus, whereas the WM accuracy for deprioritized samples was expectedly reduced (see WM results above), their subsequent LTM recall was surprisingly improved compared to samples from WM Test 1, and was on par with the LTM recall of samples from one-sample WM trials [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>; t(186) = -1.374, p = 0.171]<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">A 2 x 2 ANOVA (specified analogously as above) of the LTM performance for the samples from two-sample WM trials showed a main effect of Sample Position [1/2;F(1,186) = 35.805, p &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.026], indicating better LTM recall of samples that had been presented first in the WM trial (i.e., primacy), and a main effect of Test [1/2; F(1,186) = 20.253, p &lt; 0.001, η2 = 0.015], reflecting the improved LTM recall of deprioritized samples that had been probed on WM Test 2 (see above). There was no interaction between the two factors [F(1,186) = 0.619, p &lt; 0.433, η2 = 0.004], and post-hoc tests showed the primacy effect on LTM performance to be significant both for samples probed first [WM Test 1; t(186) = -5.909, p &lt; 0.001] and second [WM Test 2; t(186) = -3.488, p &lt; 0.001].</p><p id="P13">We next examined for comparison the LTM performance for samples that had been presented but not probed (NP) during the WM trials. NP samples occurred on 50% of the two-sample trials and can be assumed to have been deprioritized after the first WM probe (WM Test 1), like those samples that had been probed on WM Test 2. The NP samples thus provided a baseline to quantify the LTM benefit of WM retrieval on Test 2. We indeed found that the LTM recall of the NP orientations was significantly less accurate (M = 62.16°, SE = 1.42°) compared to those probed on WM Test 2 [t(186) = 9.745, p &lt; 0.001], and also compared to those probed on the other WM Tests [WM Test 1: t(186) = 6.908, p &lt; 0.001; one-sample: t(186) = 8.594, p &lt; 0.001]. Thus, WM probing and/or -retrieval appeared to generally benefit subsequent LTM recall. Interestingly, the NP samples also showed a primacy effect in LTM: those presented first in the WM trial were subsequently recalled better than those presented second [M = 58.700, SE = 1.721 vs. M = 64.80°, SE = 1.67°; t(186) = -3.31, p = 0.001], just as was the case for the other (probed) samples (see above). In other words, the primacy effect on LTM performance occurred independent of WM retrieval and was more likely attributable to differences in encoding (or maintaining) the first vs. second WM sample.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Comparing WM vs. LTM performance</title><p id="P14">To compare the WM and LTM results directly, we additionally performed a 2 x 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA with the factors Task (WM/LTM), WM Sample Position (1/2), and WM Test (1/2).

Furthermore, the Task x WM Test interaction was significant [F(1,186) =69.396 p &lt; 0.001, η2 =0.018], reflecting the opposite effects of WM priority on WM vs. LTM recall performance (see above). We also found a significant three-way interaction [Task x Sample Position x WM Test; F(1,186) = 7.589 p = 0.006, η2 =0.002)], which likely reflects the absence of primacy (or alternatively, a recency benefit for Sample 2, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Discussion</xref>) on WM Test 1, whereas all other tests (WM and LTM) showed primacy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>).

To account for these differences, we pruned the data post-hoc such that the average WM performance in the one-sample, Test 1, and Test 2 conditions were equalized: for each participant and condition, we successively removed trials with extreme (high or low) WM reporting error until the differences in WM accuracy between the conditions were minimized (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Methods</xref>, <italic>Pruning</italic>). We then repeated the subsequent LTM analysis using only the remaining WM samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>; note that a subset of participants (n = 14) whose data were incomplete after pruning were excluded from this analysis). Pruning increased the LTM benefit of WM testing after deprioritization: we now found significantly better LTM performance for the deprioritized WM samples [Test 2; M = 45.13°, SE = 1.54°] compared even to the one-sample condition [M = 51.28°, SE = 1.68°; t(172) = -3.82, p &lt; 0.001].

To examine this possibility, in the unpruned data, we inspected the similarity (in terms of absolute angular difference in °) of the LTM reports to the WM reports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In fact, the LTM reports were overall more similar to the WM reports than to the original WM sample orientations [M = 48.50°, SE = 0.812° vs. M = 51.20°, SE = 0.79°; t(186) = -10.770, p &lt; 0.001)].

That the bias was strongest for WM Test 2 suggests a particularly strong long-term memory of the WM-<italic>testing</italic> episode (i.e., of the participant’s own response) after the sample information had been deprioritized. It may seem counterintuitive that in the Test 2 condition, the bias towards recalling the subjective WM reports (which include WM error) was increased in tandem with objective LTM accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), given that this condition showed the largest WM reporting error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). However, the result can be explained when considering that the WM errors were generally much smaller than the LTM errors (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a and b</xref>). A relatively stronger bias towards the subjective WM report may thus reduce the objective LTM error to be smaller, even if the WM error was relatively larger than in other conditions.</p><p id="P17">For completeness, we also inspected whether the LTM reports were additionally biased by the (random) orientations in which the WM-test probes first appeared on screen (i.e., before the participants re-rotated them). However, the LTM reports’ similarity to these probe orientations did not differ from chance level (90°), in none of the conditions [One-sample: t(186) = -0.485, p = 1.000; Test 1: t(186) = 2.010, p = 0.138; Test 2: t(186) = 0.420, p = 1.000].</p><p id="P18">To summarize, while our deprioritization manipulation in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">Exp. 1</xref> expectedly reduced WM-task performance, it increased the accuracy of subsequent LTM reports. The results appear consistent with a pronounced WM-”testing” effect for deprioritized materials, where participants formed a particularly strong long-term memory of the orientations they had reported at the WM test. An alternative explanation could be that the LTM performance for Test 2 items benefitted, regardless of their deprioritization, from having been maintained in WM for a longer period of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Souza &amp; Oberauer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Jarjat et al., 2018</xref>).

In addition, the LTM results in all experiments showed a ‘primacy’ pattern, such that items that had occurred at the beginning of a WM-trial episode were later recalled better. A similar primacy effect was also evident in WM recall, but only for deprioritized information. Together, our findings highlight various aspects in which WM retrieval of deprioritized information—as opposed to prioritized information—resembles retrieval from episodic LTM.</p><p id="P32">It is well-established that temporary deprioritization of WM content reduces its accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bae &amp; Luck, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Emrich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Oberauer, 2002</xref>), a finding we also replicated here (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">Exp. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">2</xref>). By intuition, one might assume that if information is deprioritized in WM, it is also less likely to be encoded into a durable long-term memory. Indeed, several recent studies, mostly using recognition tests, found that unprioritized WM contents were later remembered less well than prioritized ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Fan &amp; Turk-Browne, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Jeanneret et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">LaRocque et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Reaves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Strunk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Wang &amp; Van Ede, 2024</xref>). Here, using a more recall-like WM testing format (continuous reports), we found the opposite: deprioritization in WM paradoxically improved subsequent LTM recall. At face value, this counterintuitive result is reminiscent of previous work on the “McCabe effect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Loaiza et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Loaiza &amp; McCabe, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McCabe, 2008</xref>), where an intermittent distractor task during word-list learning impaired the words’ immediate (WM-like) recall, but improved their later (LTM-like) recall after a longer delay. The McCabe effect has been explained in terms of ‘covert’ retrieval of the WM information back into the focus of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Loaiza &amp; Halse, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McCabe, 2008</xref>) after it had temporarily been stored in ‘activated LTM’ (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cowan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Oberauer, 2002</xref>). Our present experiments and materials differed in important ways from the word-span tasks used by McCabe and colleagues. A possibility exists that covert retrieval processes (i.e. after temporary deprioritization) may have contributed to the LTM results in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">Exp. 1</xref>, where the added WM delay (Delay 2) could have provided additional opportunity for covert retrieval. However, as outlined below, the entirety of our results across experiments indicates that the LTM benefits for deprioritized WM contents arose largely from <italic>overt</italic> WM testing, specifically with continuous reports.</p><p id="P33">We found subsequent LTM benefits after WM deprioritization not only when priority was manipulated through WM-testing order (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">Exp. 1</xref>), but also when using retrospective cues in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Exp. 2</xref>. With the latter experiment design, the effect showed directly as a stronger WM-testing <italic>benefit</italic> (relative to untested/NP samples) for deprioritized information. This result can not be easily explained by differences in covert retrieval and/or WM delay length, but can be attributed to the (overt) WM testing proper. In line with this interpretation, using continuous reports in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">Exp. 1</xref> (and 2), participants’ LTM reports were more similar to their own previous WM reports than to the original WM sample information, and this ‘bias’ was increased after WM deprioritization. In other words, after WM deprioritization, the participants appeared to show a stronger (overt) “generation effect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jacoby, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Slamecka &amp; Graf, 1978</xref>; for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bertsch et al., 2007</xref>), which further underscores the role of overt testing/reporting in explaining our results. Notably, although LTM bias towards the (imperfect) WM reports in principle reflects a source of error, the WM errors were small enough (relative to the LTM error) for such bias to still go along with an objective LTM benefit for the deprioritized WM materials. An alternative explanation in terms of cardinal orientation biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bae, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Linde-Domingo &amp; Spitzer, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Taylor &amp; Bays, 2018</xref>) was not supported by our present data (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).

In a similar vein, the present WM-testing effects were strongest for those materials that were hardest to remember in the WM task (i.e., the deprioritized materials). Further in line with a “retrieval-effort” account, LTM-testing effects are typically larger with cued/free recall than with recognition testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bjork, Robert A., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Pyc &amp; Rawson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Roediger &amp; Karpicke, 2006</xref>), and we likewise observed greater benefits with a recall-like WM test (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">Exp. 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">2</xref>) than with simple (binary) sample-probe judgments (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Exp. 3</xref>). Lastly, LTM-testing effects are typically shown relative to a “restudy” baseline where the memory material is presented again without retrieval requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Roediger &amp; Karpicke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Rowland, 2014</xref>).

Taken together, the long-term consequences of WM testing in our tasks showed many of the hallmarks of classic (episodic) retrieval-practice and align well with existing accounts of LTM-testing effects (e.g., retrieval effort theories; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Rowland, 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Another potential parallel between WM retrieval of deprioritized information and LTM retrieval in our tasks appeared evident in the extent to which the first or the second sample in a WM trial was remembered better. In the final LTM tests, in all our experiments, we observed a clear ‘primacy’ benefit for the first-presented WM sample. As a possible explanation, the first sample marked the beginning of a new (WM-)task episode, which may have promoted its contextual encoding into episodic LTM. Of note, such within-trial primacy effects were clearly evident also for samples that were not probed (NP) in the WM task. This supports a view that the primacy effects reflected episodic/contextual encoding factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Sederberg et al., 2006</xref>), unlike the retrieval-induced phenomena discussed in the previous paragraphs. Interestingly, in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">Exp. 1</xref>, a moderate primacy effect was evident also in WM recall, but only after deprioritization (WM Test 2). The WM recall of prioritized information (WM Test 1) in contrast showed, if anything, a (non-significant) recency effect, i.e., better recall of the last-presented sample. A similar but non-significant difference in primacy/recency was also seen in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Exp. 2</xref> which had a smaller participant sample. Albeit speculative, these observations may suggest that the role of episodic context factors, in terms of within-trial primacy, increased from prioritized WM over deprioritized WM to LTM recall, which adds to the apparent similarities between the latter two.</p><p id="P36">There exists a range of views on how unattended WM storage is implemented mechanistically in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Beukers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Stokes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Van Loon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Wan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Yu et al., 2020</xref>) and the extent to which the underlying processes are distinguished (or not) from episodic LTM remains debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Beukers et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Oberauer &amp; Awh, 2022</xref>). A previous study found no evidence that unattended WM maintenance would improve subsequent LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">LaRocque et al., 2015</xref>), and we likewise observed no LTM-benefits for deprioritized materials (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Exp. 2</xref>, NP items) unless the material was explicitly tested. We thus found no evidence that unattended WM contents would make stronger contact with LTM through unattended storage per se. Instead, the LTM benefits manifested only when the material was actively retrieved (i.e., tested) from its deprioritized state. The observed similarities to LTM retrieval are consistent in principle with a view that the deprioritized WM information may have been retrieved from a LTM-like storage state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Beukers et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">2023</xref>). Alternatively, our results may indicate that retrieval from dedicated “unattended” storage formats within WM (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Stokes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Yu et al., 2020</xref>) benefits LTM, through yet unknown mechanisms. Future work using neural recordings will be needed to differentiate between these possibilities.</p><p id="P37">To conclude, factors that promote (or hinder) subsequent remembering are of central concern in basic memory research, but also in applied contexts such as the educational sector. Here, we showed that recalling information from WM can promote its long-term retention, particularly if the WM information was temporarily not in the focus of attention. Beyond resembling classic LTM-“testing” effects, our results join other findings that some memory operations (e.g., ‘replay’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jafarpour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Schapiro et al., 2018</xref>) seem to favor weaker, or more distant memories (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Antony et al., 2024</xref>) despite them potentially being less accurate. An intriguing question for future work is how WM retrieval of deprioritized information intersects with processes thought to underlie long-term memory and learning on the neural level.</p></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S17"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="S18" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P38">Participants (n = 199, 58 female, 130 male, mean age = 26.99; missing demographic information for n = 11) were recruited online via Prolific Academic (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.prolific.ac/">https://www.prolific.ac/</ext-link>), with informed consent obtained via the Qualtrics platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.qualtrics.com">https://www.qualtrics.com</ext-link>). The eligibility criteria were that participants had to be between 18 and 35 years old, fluent in English, have a normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and have a minimum approval rate of 95% on Prolific. The experiment lasted approximately 40 minutes. Participants were reimbursed with £6.75 for completing the experiment. Partial payments were made if the experiment was not completed due to technical issues (n = 4), failed attention checks (n = 5), or early termination by the participant (n = 2). One participant (n = 1) was excluded post-experimentally for failing to perform significantly above chance in the WM task (p &lt; 0.05, t-test against 90° angular error, one-tailed). Thus, n = 187 participants remained for analysis (55 female, 121 male; mean age 27.2 years; missing demographic information for n = 11). The experiment was approved by the Internal Review Board (IRB) of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Stimuli</title><p id="P39">The experimental stimuli consisted of 110 pictures of animate and inanimate objects. For each participant, 100 pictures were randomly selected for the experiment, while 10 were designated for practice trials. An additional 3 pictures, identical across all participants, were used for instruction. All pictures were selected from the Bank of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Brodeur et al., 2010</xref>). The stimuli were presented rotated in the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The WM-sample orientations were selected randomly and independently from a set of 16 equidistant angles from 11.25° to 348.75° in steps of 22.5°, which excluded the cardinal axes (0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Task(s)</title><p id="P40">The experiment consisted of 3 phases: a WM task (60 trials), a distractor task (approx. 1 minute), and a surprise LTM test (100 trials). In the WM task, participants were asked to briefly remember the orientation of one or two WM samples. Each trial started with a fixation cross (2 s), at the screen center. In one-sample trials, the WM sample was presented for 1.5 s followed by a delay period (empty screen of 4.5 s, after which the participants were asked to remember the WM sample’s orientation (see below). In two-sample trials, two WM samples were sequentially presented (with a 1 s inter-stimulus interval during which the fixation cross was shown). After a WM delay of 2 s, the orientation of one of the two objects (randomly selected) was probed (Test 1). After Test 1, in 50% of the two-sample trials (randomly varied), the experiment continued with the next trial. On the remaining two-sample trials, Test 1 was followed by another delay period (1.5s) and participants were probed to also remember the orientation of the other, previously unprobed sample (Test 2). The assignment of sample stimuli to the one-sample, Test 1, and Test 2 conditions was counterbalanced across participants using a Latin square approach, such that on average, the exact same sample stimuli were used in each of these conditions. In all WM tests, the sample orientation in question was probed by the WM object reappearing in a new orientation (random, but at least 22.5° different from the original orientation). Participants were asked to re-rotate the probe to the remembered orientation using the left and right arrow keys (continuous report; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and to submit the result by pressing the space key. Trials in which participants failed to submit a response within a generously allotted time window (15 s) were excluded from the analysis (2.01% of trials on average; min = 0.00%, max = 7.93%).</p><p id="P41">After the WM task, participants performed a short distractor task (approximately one minute) in which they were asked to solve a series of simple math problems (e.g., 100 - 7 =?) using mental arithmetic and entering the solutions via the computer keyboard.</p><p id="P42">In the subsequent surprise LTM test, participants were asked to recall the orientations of each of the previously encountered WM samples again. Each test trial started with a fixation cross (1.5 s) after which one of the previous WM sample objects appeared in a new orientation (fully random) as LTM probe. Participants were asked to reproduce the objects’ original orientation (i.e., the orientation it had as a WM sample), using the same response procedure as in the WM tests (continuous reporting; see above). Each WM sample was probed once (in random serial order) across the LTM test trials.</p></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title><p id="P43">Participants were given written instructions about the WM task and could practice the continuous reporting procedure (i.e., re-rotating stimuli via arrow keys) prior to the experiment. They were free to repeat the instructions until they felt confident to perform the task. Participants first performed six practice trials of the WM task (two per trial type: one-sample trials, and two-sample trials with and without Test 2). Thereafter, each participant performed a total of 60 WM trials (20 one-sample trials and 40 two-sample trials, in random serial order). After 14 WM trials, a brief attention check task was performed (6 trials). For this, a number word (e.g., “three”) was presented at the screen center, surrounded by 4 different number symbols. Participants were asked to pick the correct number symbol (e.g., “3”) via arrow keys. When a participant failed this check on more than 2 of 6 trials, the experiment was aborted (see <italic>Participants)</italic>. After completing the WM task, participants performed the distractor task (mental arithmetic, approx,1 minute). After this, they were informed about the surprise LTM test and received short instructions about its procedure. Participants then performed 100 LTM test trials in which they were asked to recall all of the sample orientations they had encountered in the WM task (including those WM samples that had not been probed in the WM task, i.e., on two-sample trials with a single WM test). Participants could take a break (self-paced for up to 2 minutes) after 34 trials of the WM task.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Experiment 2</title><sec id="S23" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P44">For <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Exp. 2</xref>, we recruited another sample of n = 101 participants online (46 female, 42 male, and 1 diverse, mean age 25.3 years; missing demographic information for 12 participants), with the same modalities of recruitment, informed consent, ethics approval, reimbursement, and experiment duration as in the previous experiments.

For each participant and condition (e.g., one-sample, Test 1, and Test 2 in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S3">Exp. 1</xref>), we successively removed individual trials with extreme (high or low) WM reporting error until the WM accuracy in all conditions was maximally similar to the participant’s overall mean WM accuracy (averaged over all conditions).
