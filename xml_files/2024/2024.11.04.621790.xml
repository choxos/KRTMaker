It is a chemokine scavenger that indirectly influences responses by restricting the availability of CXCL12, an agonist shared with the canonical receptor CXCR4. ACKR3 is upregulated in numerous disorders. Due to limited insights in chemokine-activated ACKR3 signaling, it is unclear how ACKR3 contributes to pathological phenotypes. One explanation may be that high constitutive activity of ACKR3 drives non-canonical signaling through a basal receptor state. Here we characterize the constitutive action of ACKR3 using novel inverse agonistic nanobodies to suppress basal activity. These new tools promote an inactive receptor conformation which decreased arrestin engagement and inhibited constitutive internalization. Basal, non-chemotactic, breast cancer cell motility was also suppressed, suggesting a role for ACKR3 in this process. The basal receptor activity in pathophysiology may provide a new therapeutic approach for targeting ACKR3.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Atypical Chemokine Receptor 3 (ACKR3, formerly CXCR7) is a β-arrestin-biased chemokine receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> that lacks detectable G protein activation in most cell types (with the exception of primary rodent astrocytes and human glioma cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Activation of the receptor leads to phosphorylation of C-terminal serine and threonine residues by GPCR kinases (GRKs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. These modifications are critical for coordinating arrestin coupling. ACKR3 is best described as a scavenger, where its primary function is to regulate the extracellular concentrations of ligands and restrict the ligand availability for canonical receptor activation. The receptor shares chemokine ligands with both CXCR4 (CXCL12) and CXCR3 (CXCL11), both of which drive cell migration along chemokine gradients. Scavenging by ACKR3 therefore indirectly supports chemotaxis by generating directional information and preventing overstimulation and desensitization of CXCR4 or CXCR3. This regulatory activity is dependent on GRK phosphorylation, but not arrestin engagement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, suggesting the receptor might better be regarded as a GRK-biased receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Besides chemokines, ACKR3 is activated by opioid peptides (BAM22, enkephalins, and dynorphins)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and pro-adrenomedullin derivatives (adrenomedullin and PAMP-12)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The wide range of natural ligands binding ACKR3 suggests a flexible binding pocket and a promiscuous receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. ACKR3 is involved in many physiological functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> as well as in a plethora of pathophysiological processes, including inflammatory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, autoimmune<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, and neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> in addition to different types of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. ACKR3 overexpression is associated with neurodegeneration in the central nervous system and poor cancer prognosis, while it provides a cardioprotective role in cardiovascular diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">GPCR signaling plays an important role in controlling various cancer hallmarks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. The CXCL12-CXCR4-ACKR3 axis contributors are key to cancer cell migration, survival, and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Enhanced ACKR3 expression in numerous cancer types (e.g. glioma, lung, breast, colorectal, lymphoma), has been associated with the shaping of CXCL12 gradients, by internalizing with the chemokine and recycling the receptor back to the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Through this mechanism, ACKR3 appears pivotal for tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and tumor growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Despite ACKR3’s evident role in cancer development, the specific downstream signaling pathways modulated by this receptor are still unclear. Numerous studies have suggested that CXCL12-stimulated ACKR3 signals via β-arrestin-dependent pathways activating ERK and AKT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. However, recent reports indicate that these may be ascribed to background CXCR4 signaling by G proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">In addition to chemokine-induced responses, ACKR3 displays considerable constitutive activity in the apo (empty) receptor state. The receptor readily interacts with arrestin in the absence of stimulation, both in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and detergent purified form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Without a ligand bound, ACKR3 flexibly interconverts between active and inactive conformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, which leads to basal phosphorylation by GRKs that coordinates arrestin binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Additionally, the receptor constitutively internalizes by mechanisms independent of C-terminal phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. This internalization contributes to scavenging, but is unable to dynamically respond to large fluxes in chemokine concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. This high level of constitutive activity may explain difficulties in antagonizing the receptor, as only a handful of inhibitors have been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. It is unknown whether the constitutive activity of ACKR3 contributes to other cellular processes and if these deviate from chemokine-induced responses. Different signaling states for constitutive and agonist-stimulated activation have been observed for a virally-encoded chemokine receptor, US28<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Uncharacterized signaling by the apo-receptor may play an unappreciated role in ACKR3 physiology and pathophysiology.</p><p id="P5">In order to resolve the constitutive mechanisms of ACKR3 function, we developed new nanobody-based inhibitors to suppress basal activation of the atypical receptor. Nanobodies, also known as single-domain antibodies or VHHs, are the variable domains from heavy chain-only antibodies found in the Camelidae family. Nanobodies display high affinity and specificity for their target and tend to interact with non-linear, 3-dimensional epitopes. These features make them ideal molecules for targeting and stabilizing GPCRs in specific conformational states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, which may be particularly important for a promiscuous protein like ACKR3. Using advanced structural dynamics methods, we showed that the nanobodies stabilize inactive receptor conformations that correlate with inhibited basal engagement with arrestins and constitutive internalization. Inhibition of receptor constitutive activity led to slower cell motility. These data highlight the potential consequences of ACKR3 basal activity.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Basal ACKR3 engagement with arrestins is suppressed by inverse agonistic nanobodies</title><p id="P6">An antagonistic nanobody targeting ACKR3, VUN701, was recently characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Here, we present two additional nanobodies, VUN700 and VUN702, which were not previously characterized pharmacologically. All three nanobodies bind the receptor extracellularly and compete with CXCL12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Due to the bulky and relatively large binding interface of nanobodies and chemokines, nanobodies sterically prevent co-binding. As a consequence, nanobodies binding to extracellular domains of chemokine receptors generally act as antagonists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, though some are agonists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> or have been engineered to activate receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. To resolve the pharmacological effects of these molecules, ACKR3 engagement with arrestin was tracked by BRET between the receptor with a C-terminal nanoluciferase (ACKR3-Nluc) and β-arrestin2 C-terminally tagged with mVenus (β-arr2-mV), following addition of CXCL12 agonist or the nanobodies. Activation by the agonist CXCL12 led to a robust increase in BRET ratio, indicating a recruitment of arrestin to the receptor in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). When the cells are treated with neutral antagonist VUN701, no change in association of ACKR3 with β-arrestin was detected, consistent with its previous pharmacological classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Interestingly, VUN700 and VUN702 both decreased the BRET ratio between ACKR3 and β-arrestin2 below the measured basal interaction. This suggests that these nanobodies are acting as inverse agonists and suppressing the previously reported constitutive ACKR3 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Similar results were observed with β-arrestin1 recruitment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P7">ACKR3 requires phosphorylation by GRKs to engage β-arrestins in response to CXCL12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, while constitutively active arrestin can interact with unmodified apo-ACKR3 in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. To ascertain the role of GRK phosphorylation in basal association in cells, arrestin recruitment was also tested in CRISPR-knockout cells of the four ubiquitously expressed GRKs, GRK2, 3, 5, and 6 (GRK2/3/5/6 KO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In these cells, the response to CXCL12 was completely abolished, consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C, D</xref>). Additionally, the inverse agonistic effects of VUN700 and VUN702 disappeared in the absence of GRKs. Together, these data suggest that the basal arrestin association to ACKR3 is GRK-dependent and likely reflects the phosphorylation of constitutively active receptors by these kinases.</p><p id="P8">To further resolve differences between agonist-induced and basal arrestin engagement with ACKR3, the conformational changes within the arrestins were monitored using Nluc/FlAsH arrestin intramolecular BRET biosensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. These sensors report subtle differences in arrestin conformations, corresponding to the active conformations arrestin adopts due to its interaction with GPCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). As reported by the FlAsH 5 (F5 sensor), activation by CXCL12 promoted a robust decrease in BRET, indicating the adoption of an active arrestin state. None of the nanobodies produced a change in the signal from this sensor. Similar responses were observed for two other arrestin conformational sensors with different FlAsH positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). This implies that either the basal interaction of ACKR3 and β-arrestin2 does not induce a conformational change in arrestin or the reversion is not detectable by these sensors.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Distinct ACKR3 conformational states are stabilized by antagonist and inverse agonist nanobodies</title><p id="P9">The inhibition of basal arrestin interactions of ACKR3 by VUN700 and VUN702 suggests that these nanobodies act as inverse agonists, possibly by inducing a more inactive-like receptor conformation. Two structural dynamics methods were used to determine how the nanobodies were specifically altering the conformation of ACKR3; nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS).</p><p id="P10">First, <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>3</sub>-e-Met labelled ACKR3 was purified and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. As previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, two of ACKR3’s eight native methionines (M212<sup>5x39</sup> and M138<sup>3x46</sup>, GPCRdb nomenclature in superscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>) can be used to track receptor conformational dynamics at the ligand binding site and in the intracellular region, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). At first glance, the NMR analysis of ACKR3 bound to VUN700 or VUN702 results in similar spectra to that of ACKR3 bound to the neutral antagonist VUN701 (Fig, 2B). However, overlaying the spectra from the different ACKR3-nanobody complexes does reveal subtle shifts in the peaks for M212<sup>5x39</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) and M138<sup>3x46</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Upon CXCL12 binding, the M212<sup>5x39</sup> position was previously shown to be in a gauche rotameric state with a peak at 16.25 ppm. This shifted downfield to 17.0 ppm with the neutral antagonist VUN701<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Binding of VUN700 or VUN702 further altered the M212<sup>5x39</sup> peak as compared to the ACKR3-VUN701 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In all three complexes, the <sup>13</sup>C position of ~17.0 ppm is consistent with rotamer averaging and the absence of stabilizing interactions at the M212<sup>5x39</sup> position. In contrast, the M138<sup>3x46</sup> position showed a slight downfield shift in the <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>1</sup>H dimensions for VUN701, compared to the inverse agonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Given the previous evidence that M138<sup>3x46</sup> exists as a mixture of active and inactive states, the shift along this line suggests that VUN700 and VUN702 binding shift the ACKR3 conformational equilibrium relative to VUN701, potentially indicating a more “OFF” state of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To further structurally substantiate the subtle conformational changes observed by NMR, induced by the inverse agonist and antagonist nanobodies, HDX-MS was performed to track changes in the rate of isotopic exchange between amide hydrogens on ACKR3 and deuterium in the solvent. The exchange rate depends on solvent accessibility and hydrogen bonding networks, and comparing these rates provides insights into changes to the protein conformational state and protein-binding interfaces. This technique has recently been optimized for ACKR3 to monitor conformational changes due to small molecule ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">Using differential HDX (ΔHDX) analyses, we compared the unbound (apo) and nanobody-bound states of ACKR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). Binding of the nanobodies protected the extracellular face from deuteration, confirming the nanobody binding interface proposed from CXCL12 competition assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Differences in deuteration were localized to peptides corresponding to the orthosteric (CXCL12) binding pocket at the N-terminus (N-term, residues 27-33) and TM5 (residues 204-211) which displayed large protection (respective ΔHDX of up to 15% and 30% for each nanobody) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>). The nanobodies significantly protected peptides in the N-terminus and extracellular loops (ECLs) of ACKR3 that correspond to the CXCL12 binding interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, suggesting that the nanobodies bind similarly to these receptor regions in agreement with our previous model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">While the overlapping interacting sites between CXCL12 and the nanobodies with ACKR3 explain their competitive binding mode, nanobody binding also induced conformational changes to the intracellular side of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). It is known that the position of the cytoplasmic ends of TM6 and TM7 reflect the active state of GPCRs including ACKR3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Only slight differences were observed for these regions with the neutral antagonist VUN701 bound. In contrast, both inverse agonists VUN700 and VUN702 showed robust protection at the intracellular face of TM6, residues 248<sup>6x31</sup> to 257<sup>6x40</sup>. Likewise, the inverse agonists induced protection at the linker region connecting TM7 to H8, residues 315<sup>7x53</sup> to 320<sup>8x48</sup>, whilst VUN701 did not. These differences in HDX protection suggest that the inverse agonism observed for VUN700 and VUN702 is due to the promotion of an inactive ACKR3 conformation, while the neutral antagonist VUN701 does not impact the basal state of the receptor. Both results are consistent with the biological responses observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. Together with the NMR-based analysis, this HDX analysis suggests a unique conformational state for the inverse agonist-bound ACKR3 compared to when bound to an antagonist.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Inverse agonistic nanobodies trap ACKR3 at the plasma membrane</title><p id="P14">Constitutive internalization of ACKR3 contributes to chemokine scavenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> and is independent of receptor phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Therefore, we examined whether the inverse agonism displayed by these nanobodies had functional consequences on receptor trafficking from the plasma membrane (PM) to early endosomes. First, we examined how the different nanobodies modulate ACKR3 internalization by monitoring the presence of ACKR3 at the plasma membrane with flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). CXCL12 internalized 25% of ACKR3 after 15 min exposure of cells, and after 45 min ACKR3 returned back to basal surface levels. In contrast, all nanobodies induced an increased level of ACKR3 on the membrane over time. The inverse agonists VUN700 and VUN702 increased the receptor level on the membrane by up to ~70% after 60 min of incubation. Interestingly, the neutral antagonist VUN701 also increased membrane presence of ACKR3, but to a lesser extent (~50%) and with a delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). We then investigated the subcellular trafficking of ACKR3 upon nanobody binding by employing BRET between ACKR3 and two different localization markers, mVenus-CAAX (mV-CAAX) for the plasma membrane and Rab5a-mVenus (Rab5a-mV) for the early endosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B, C</xref>). Upon CXCL12 binding, ACKR3 rapidly internalized away from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) and appeared in early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). All three nanobodies inhibited constitutive internalization, causing the receptor to be retained at the membrane, consistent with the flow cytometry results. This was more prominent for the inverse agonists VUN700 and VUN702 than for neutral antagonist VUN701 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Similarly, VUN700 and VUN702 impaired the basal trafficking of ACKR3 to the early endosomes, while VUN701 had little effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Taken together, nanobody binding blocks receptor intracellular trafficking by retaining the receptor on the membrane and this is more efficient for the inverse agonists than for the neutral antagonist VUN701.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>All nanobodies inhibit GRK-independent internalization of ACKR3</title><p id="P15">CXCL12-mediated internalization of ACKR3 is β-arrestin-independent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> but GRK-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, while constitutive internalization is independent of both effectors. To determine if the nanobodies also impacted phosphorylation-independent internalization, the membrane presence of ACKR3 was observed by BRET in GRK2/3/5/6 KO HEK293 cells. In the parental cells, containing all GRKs, CXCL12 and the nanobodies showed the same order of effectiveness as shown in the HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B, 5A</xref>), with the inverse agonists VUN700 and VUN702 inducing greater retention on the membrane than the antagonist VUN701 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A, B</xref>).

Instead, we hypothesize that ACKR3’s constitutive activity might play a role in cell migration. To resolve the influence of ACKR3 on non-chemokine driven migration, the basal or random movement of metastatic breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231, was tracked by live-single cell microscopy. MDA-MB-231 cells express relatively high levels of both ACKR3 and CXCR4 endogenously, which suggests an invasive phenotype and is associated with aggressive behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. This allows for examination of potential roles for ACKR3 in a relevant cellular context and in the presence of CXCR4. The cells showed considerable motility even without chemotactic stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). This basal motility was reduced when treated with either VUN700 or VUN701 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). The degree of motility attenuation was quantified by comparing both the accumulated distance (total distance travelled) and Euclidean distance (straight line distance from cell starting point to end point). Both metrics decreased on average by ~30% with inverse agonist VUN700 treatment. In the case of the neutral antagonist VUN701, only the accumulated distance was significantly impaired, while the change in overall position was only slightly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). VUN400, a CXCR4 targeting nanobody that inhibits CXCL12 binding and CXCL12-induced chemotaxis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, had no effect on basal cell motility.

Although the receptor is implicated in many other physiological responses, they have not been explicitly tied to chemokine-mediated receptor activation or ligand scavenging. Here we present facets of ACKR3 constitutive activity with downstream responses using antagonistic and inverse agonistic ACKR3 nanobodies. The nanobodies had profound effects on the basal receptor events. While only the inverse agonistic nanobodies lead to a disruption of the arrestin-apo-ACKR3 complex, both inverse agonists and antagonists, albeit to a lower extent, suppressed constitutive internalization and trapped the receptor on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). These effects appear to be due to subtle changes in the receptor’s conformational state and may manifest into attenuation of basal, or random, cellular migration. These data provide insight into hidden functions of the atypical receptor that are independent of chemokine receptor activation.</p><p id="P18">Outward movement of TM6 is a common hallmark of GPCR activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> and ACKR3 is no different<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. The atypical receptor also displays extensive constitutive activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and readily adopts an active conformation in the absence of stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. This constitutive activity drives basal GRK phosphorylation and subsequent arrestin engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). VUN700 and VUN702 act as inverse agonists to suppress basal β-arrestin engagement, while the previously characterized VUN701<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> only blocked CXCL12-induced interactions. This suggests that different conformations are being stabilized by the nanobodies, leading to different effects on ACKR3 phosphorylation and arrestin interactions. Indeed, both HDX and NMR studies show slightly different conformations being promoted by the inverse agonists compared to VUN701. The protection observed at the cytoplasmic ends of TM6 and TM7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>) as well as the chemical shifts of M138<sup>3x46</sup> and M212<sup>5x39</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>) are consistent with inactive receptor states. The inverse agonists VUN700 and VUN702 appear to stabilize an even more inactive conformation than VUN701 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These structural observations are in line with the more profound effects observed for the inverse agonistic nanobodies on ACKR3 arrestinengagement and membrane localization compared to the antagonist. In addition to scavenging ligands to regulate canonical receptor function, ACKR3 outcompetes CXCR4 for arrestins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. This is thought to protect CXCR4 from downregulation and desensitization due to overstimulation by CXCL12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. By freeing arrestins basally engaged with ACKR3, while also blocking activation by CXCL12, the inverse agonists could act as tools to indirectly target CXCR4 or CXCR3 for downregulation.</p><p id="P19">All three nanobodies had profound inhibitory effects on the constitutive internalization of ACRK3. The atypical receptor undergoes both agonist-promoted internalization which is dependent on GRK phosphorylation as well as a ‘passive’ GRK-independent cycling between the plasma membrane and endosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. This second mechanism of receptor turnover is observed in other chemokine receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup> and contributes to chemokine scavenging, but is insufficient to fully replace the active internalization response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. All three nanobodies retain the receptor at the plasma membrane, with the inverse agonists exhibiting significantly greater effects than the neutral antagonist in WT HEK293 cells. The nanobodies also retained ACKR3 at the plasma membrane in GRK2/3/5/6 KO cells, suggesting that even the neutral antagonist impacts the previously described passive internalization. These results clearly show that ACKR3 constitutive internalization occurs through both a GRK-dependent pathway, which requires receptor constitutive activation, and a GRK-independent pathway, operating via a heretofore undescribed mechanism. ACKR3 internalization does not require arrestins, which suggests a clathrin-independent mechanism, potentially through coordination via adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factors (ARFs), which regulate internalization and recycling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. Alternatively, local membrane domains with specific lipid composition or curvature could sort GPCRs and mediate endocytosis during the natural turnover of the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Thus, stabilization of ACKR3 by nanobody binding may segregate the receptor away from membrane regions primed to internalize, thereby leading to the trapping effect we observe.</p><p id="P20">The effects of VUN700 and VUN701 on basal cancer cell motility suggest that the constitutive activity of ACKR3 is implicated in migratory signaling. The degree of inhibition was greater for VUN700 than VUN701 in agreement with the efficacy of the inactivating responses to the two nanobodies. The cells tested also express CXCR4 and an attractive explanation for the inhibition might be that the cells secrete CXCL12 and the balance of chemokine scavenging by ACKR3 is needed for CXCR4-mediated migration. However, blocking CXCR4 with VUN400<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> had no impact on the basal migration of these cells, indicating the motility observed is not due to CXCL12 stimulation of CXCR4. This therefore implies that inhibition of CXCL12 scavenging is not the mechanism for the impaired migration with ACKR3 nanobodies. We propose a chemokine-independent role for ACKR3 in basal motility of cancer cells. However, further studies are required to unravel how exactly and by which signaling pathways ACKR3 affects cell motility.</p><p id="P21">Biologics, including nanobodies, constitute an increasing proportion of FDA-approved therapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup> The inverse agonist nanobodies developed in this study may possess several features with therapeutic potential. Besides their antagonistic properties, the ability of these nanobodies to shift the receptor into an inactive conformation may also prevent crosstalk between ACKR3 and interacting proteins and receptors (like CXCR4, EGFR, Cx43<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>). As noted above, ACKR3 protects CXCR4 from desensitization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Such a mechanism could have important implications for targeting this axis in cancer therapeutics. A dual-targeted approach could on one hand antagonize CXCR4 while also downregulate the canonical receptor via ACKR3 inverse agonism, as CXCL12 and arrestins would further desensitize CXCR4 and complement the direct inhibition. ACKR3 complexes with the gap junction protein Cx43 upon CXCL12 activation in astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. The atypical receptor coordinates the internalization of Cx43 in a β-arrestin-dependent manner, which inhibits gap intercellular communication. The inverse agonistic nanobodies could therefore preserve Cx43 on the plasma membrane and protect these structures. Knowing the capabilities of the current inverse agonists, expanding their modulatory activity through structural engineering would be interesting. Antibody engineering also generated a universal platform to support nanobody structural determination of membrane proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>.

Inhibition of basal ACKR3 activity attenuated basal cell motility, which reveals a new role for ACKR3 in cell biology and cancer in particular.

The final percentage of deuterium in the deuterated buffer was 95%. Deuteration was performed at 20 °C for 0.5, 2, 5, 30 and 120 mins. Next, 50 μL of reaction sample are quenched in 50 μL of quench buffer (50 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 50 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 200 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) pH 2.3) at 0 °C. 80 μL of quenched sample are loaded onto a 50 μL loop and injected on a Nepenthesin-2 column (Affipro) maintained at 15 °C, with 0.2% formic acid at a flowrate of 100 μL/min. The peptides are then trapped at 0 °C on a Vanguard column (ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 VanGuard Pre-column, 130Å, 1.7 μm, 2.1 mm X 5 mm, Waters) for 3 min, before being loaded at 40 μL/min onto an Acquity UPLC column (ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 Column, 1.7 μm, 1 mm X 100 mm, Waters) kept at 0 °C. Peptides are subsequently eluted with a linear gradient (0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile solvent at 5% up to 35% during the first 6 min, then up to 40% and 95% over 1 min each) and ionized directly by electrospray on a Synapt G2-Si mass spectrometer (Waters). Maldi Imaging High Definition MSE (HDMSE) data were obtained by 20-30 V trap collision energy ramp. Lock mass accuracy correction was made using a mixture of leucine enkephalin and GFP. For every tested condition we analyzed two to three biological replicates, and deuteration timepoints were performed in triplicates for each condition.</p><p id="P34">Peptide identification was performed from undeuterated data using ProteinLynx global Server (PLGS, version 3.0.3, Waters). Peptides are filtered by DynamX (version 3.0, Waters) using the following parameters: minimum intensity of 1000, minimum product per amino acid of 0.2, maximum error for threshold of 10 ppm. All peptides were manually checked, and data was curated using DynamX. Back exchange was not corrected since we are measuring differential HDX and not absolute one. Statistical analysis of all ΔHDX data was performed using Deuteros 2.048 and only peptides with a 99% confidence interval were considered.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>pFastBac constructs and mutant generation (NMR)</title><p id="P35">Human ACKR3 WT pFastBac1 plasmid was generously provided by Dr. Tracy Handel (UC San Diego).

Stimulation with an agonist like CXCL12 fully activates ACKR3 and drives robust phosphorylation, arrestin complexing, and endocytosis. Inverse agonistic nanobodies suppress the constitutive activity of ACKR3, trapping the receptors at the cell surface and reducing interactions with arrestins or GRKs, thereby allowing GRKs and arrestins to be available for other GPCRs. These nanobodies also slow basal cell migration, suggesting a role for ACKR3 constitutive activity in cell motility.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199906-f007"/></fig></floats-group></article>
