These 3D stem cell-derived models exist in a newer space at the intersection of <italic>in vivo</italic> and 2D <italic>in vitro</italic> models. Functional benchmarking has so far remained largely uncharacterised however, leaving the extent to which these models may accurately portray <italic>in vivo</italic> processes still yet to be fully realised. Here we present a standardised unguided protocol to generate brain organoids from mice, the most commonly-used <italic>in vivo</italic> mammalian model; and in parallel establish a guided protocol for generating region-specific choroid plexus mouse organoids. Both unguided and guided mouse organoids progress through neurodevelopmental stages with an <italic>in vivo</italic>-like tempo and recapitulate species-specific characteristics of neural and choroid plexus development, respectively. Neuroepithelial cells generate neural progenitors that give rise to different neural subtypes including deep-layer neurons, upper-layer neurons, and glial cells. We further adapted protocols to prolong mouse cerebral organoid (CO) cultures as slices at the air-liquid interface (ALI), enhancing accessibility for long-term studies and functional investigations. In mature mouse ALI-COs, we observed mature glia, as well as synaptic structures and long-range axon tracts projecting to distant regions, suggesting an establishment and maturation of neural circuitry. Indeed, functional analyses with high-density multi-electrode arrays (HD-MEAs) indicate comparable activity to <italic>ex vivo</italic> organotypic mouse brain slices. Having established protocols for both region-specific and unpatterned mouse brain organoids, we demonstrate that their neurodevelopmental trajectories, and resultant mature features, closely mimic the <italic>in vivo</italic> models to which they are benchmarked across multiple biochemical, morphological, and functional read-outs. We propose that mouse brain organoids are a valuable model for functional studies, and provide insight into how closely brain organoids of other species, such as human, may recapitulate their own respective <italic>in vivo</italic> development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cerebral organoid</kwd><kwd><italic>Mus musculus</italic></kwd><kwd>unguided differentiation</kwd><kwd>forebrain</kwd><kwd>neurodevelopment</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>air-liquid interface culture</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Biochemical and medical research utilises a plethora of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> model systems to study biology from the molecular to the organismal scale. However, technical differences between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> systems, and the biological differences between humans and model species frequently frustrate the pipeline of fundamental research to its application in pharmaceutical industry and technology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The study of human brain development is especially difficult to model due to the marked differences in size and complexity of primate brains compared to other mammals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, plus the limited availability and intervention possible with human-derived tissue, among other obstacles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">In the last decade, the use of stem cell-derived 3-dimensional neural organoid models has accelerated <italic>in vitro</italic> research of human neurodevelopment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. A variety of protocols for organoid generation allows for the study of endogenous developmental programs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, or the production of specific neural cell types and brain regions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> from human cell lines. Moreover, the use of gene-editing and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has enabled the modelling of diseases whose phenotypes are poorly or only partially replicated in animal models, such as microcephaly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, Alzheimer’s disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and neuronal heterotopia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.

To ensure their applicability as a model, benchmarking studies have sought to characterise the fidelity of organoid culture to <italic>in vivo</italic> development. Many studies have compared molecular signatures to establish that diverse cell identities, their developmental dynamics, and cytoarchitecture are reproduced in organoids, with minor differences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, via epigenomics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, transcriptomics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, proteomics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, and immunostaining of cell type specific markers.

Thus, benchmarking efforts are limited when comparing cell maturity, behaviour, and network activity due to the same challenges that motivate the use of <italic>in vitro</italic> models to study human fetal brain development. To achieve robust functional benchmarking of neural organoids, alternative approaches integrating <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> comparisons are required, allowing for more detailed analysis using diverse methodologies.</p><p id="P4">The mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) is the most widely used mammalian <italic>in vivo</italic> model, underpinning seminal neurodevelopmental findings and near ubiquitous in early-stage pharmaceutical trials. As such, there is a wealth of <italic>in vivo</italic> data, from molecular signatures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> to neurophysiology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, and established protocols to derive such information. This enables effective benchmarking of new and more complex <italic>in vitro</italic> systems, such as neural organoids, to discern what artefacts, insufficiencies or deficiencies are present in these models compared to the <italic>in vivo</italic> biology they model. Furthermore, the combination of human and mouse <italic>in vitro</italic> organoid models may bridge between <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse experiments and human clinical trials which so often result in costly failure, particularly for neurological treatments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. As such, there has been a surge of interest in establishing methods to generate mouse brain organoids, with protocols now available for mouse cerebellar organoids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, mouse hippocampus organoids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, as well as mouse epiblast stem cell-derived forebrain organoids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we report mouse cerebral organoids generated from murine embryonic stem cells using the same reagents and unguided differentiation approach as employed in generating human and non-human primate organoids. We also adapted a patterned approach previously used to generate human choroid plexus organoids, to develop region-specific mouse choroid plexus organoids. We then focus on cerebral organoids and show that mouse organoids enter neurogenesis sooner than human organoids and generate diverse neuronal and glial cell types with a faster developmental tempo. We detail their later-stage development in air-liquid interface culture and observe the maturation of synaptic structures, the formation of long-range axon tract bundles, and activity of functional neuronal units which emulate those of <italic>ex vivo</italic> mouse brain slices. This work demonstrates that unguided organoids recapitulate the tempo and hallmarks of <italic>in vivo</italic> neuronal maturation and physiology in a complex tissue context <italic>in vitro</italic>. The rapid development of mouse organoids can facilitate high-throughput studies of later neurodevelopmental stages with promising fidelity. They may also hasten the development of new organoid protocols or analyses and provide an outgroup for multispecies evolutionary studies in organoids. Overall, mouse cerebral and choroid plexus organoids complement findings <italic>in vivo</italic> from mice, and human organoid models, improving the generalisation and translation potential of neurodevelopmental research to human biology and health.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Generation of unguided mouse cerebral organoids</title><p id="P6">We sought to generate mouse cerebral organoids to discern whether discordant findings from human organoids and <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse models can be attributed to species-specific differences or artefacts of <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. We successfully generated unguided mouse cerebral organoids by modifying the timing of our previously established protocol for human cerebral organoid culture while keeping all other aspects, including media formulations, identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In prior studies, we had observed that human and non-human ape organoids mature at species-specific rates reflective of differences in the timing of their <italic>in vivo</italic> development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Consistent with the rapid neural development of mice <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, mouse cerebral organoids established large rosette structures within 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). This was notably faster than current human organoid protocols under the same conditions. By monitoring size, morphology, the presence of non-neural lineages, and attainment of differentiated cell types, we empirically determined protocol timings for the robust generation of mouse forebrain tissue.</p><p id="P7">On day 6 of our mouse-specific protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), rosette structures showed N-cadherin expression at their apical surface, a marker of neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, the organoids were negative for the expression of Brachyury, Sox17, and Sox10 which indicate mesoderm, endoderm, and neural crest, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref>). Immunostaining for E-cadherin, a marker of non-neural ectoderm, was positive for a small number of cells toward the centre of a few organoids. Overall, the cells of the developing organoids were highly restricted to a neural ectoderm lineage as desired. Day 6 organoids were also positive for forebrain markers Foxg1 and Otx2 but negative for the hindbrain marker Pax2, and cerebellar marker En2 by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) (other than for weak signal seen in extra-organoid debris and Matrigel autofluorescence which is lost at later timepoints after Matrigel removal). By day 6 of our protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), we have robustly generated early forebrain cell identities to the exclusion of other germ layers and brain regions.</p><p id="P8">The onset of neurogenesis was first observed in mouse cerebral organoids on day 6. Neural rosettes predominantly consisted of Sox2-positive radial glia/neuroepithelia, however a small number of immature neurons were identified by Doublecortin and Tuj1 immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). The number of Doublecortin and Tuj1 positive neurons increased dramatically between day 6 and day 11, whilst a distinct progenitor zone of Sox2-positive cells was maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). By day 14, we observed Satb2 expression indicating the presence of mature neuronal subtypes and the onset of upper-layer neurogenesis in the patterning of a cortical plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). From the timing and expression patterns of these early-stage mouse organoids we could estimate the corresponding <italic>in vivo</italic> developmental time as reported in the literature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Further reflective of species-specific differences seen <italic>in vivo</italic>, we observed that the faster-developing mouse cerebral organoids grew smaller than their human organoid counterparts at comparatively benchmarked stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Generation of region-specific, patterned choroid plexus mouse organoids</title><p id="P9">Functional benchmarking of brain organoids across species requires complementary models that allow direct comparison with <italic>in vivo</italic> data. To generate brain region-specific mouse organoids we focused on the choroid plexus (ChP): a secretory tissue located in each ventricle of the brain. The ChP is composed of a single layer of epithelial cells surrounding a core of connective tissue, stromal and immune cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. This tissue is responsible for the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and formation of the blood-CSF-barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Previously, we generated human ChP organoids that secrete CSF and form a barrier <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> using patterning factors that drive ChP differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. To generate mouse ChP organoids, we adapted the same approach and patterning factors used for human ChP organoids.</p><p id="P10">The protocol to generate mouse ChP organoids follows the same initial steps as the unguided cerebral organoid protocol. After neuroepithelium generation and expansion at day 7, EBs were patterned with BMP4 and CHIR to promote ChP differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). After one day of treatment, it was possible to observe the elongated shape of the neuroepithelial buds, a hallmark of ChP morphogenesis, and development of a polarised epithelial monolayer expressing early ChP markers such as Msx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). After 14 days, mouse organoids treated with BMP4 and CHIR appeared completely enriched in ChP epithelium compared to untreated, unguided cerebral organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P11">In mice, the ChP begins to develop around embryonic day 10 (E10) with the emergence of the telencephalic ChP, followed by hindbrain and third ventricle ChP by E12 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. By E14, these structures are morphologically distinct and actively produce CSF. In humans, the ChP appears around gestational week 6-7, with a similar sequence of formation in the lateral, third and fourth ventricles. By the end of the first trimester (12 weeks), the human ChP is well-formed and contributing to CSF secretion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Compared to mice, and similarly to other brain regions, the human ChP development is also prolonged and leads to a more complex and expanded structure. Consistently, mouse ChP organoids appear to already produce the characteristic CSF-producing compartments around day 14, whereas human ChP organoids start producing CSF only around day 20-25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To validate the presence of specific ChP markers we performed histological analysis of day 30 mouse ChP organoids, which revealed expression of the ChP marker Ttr and amino acid transporter Lat1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). These organoids also developed distinct cellular populations, including multiciliated epithelial cells expressing Foxj1, a transcription factor required for formation of multiciliated epithelium, and with cilia positive for Arl13b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). We also observed that mouse ChP organoids reached a maximum size around day 30 and appeared much smaller, forming less expanded fluid-filled cysts, compared to the human ChP organoids, reflecting species-specific differences in ChP structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Importantly, this provides a proof-of-principle model for generating region-specific brain organoids that align with <italic>in vivo</italic> developmental timelines, offering a valuable tool for future functional studies.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Neuronal maturation in unpatterned mouse ALI-COs</title><p id="P13">To investigate maturation stages of mouse cerebral organoids, we adopted a protocol allowing for their long-term maintenance by preparing 300 μm organoid sections, thus several cell layers thick, that were kept at the air-liquid interface. This method is classically employed for prolonged <italic>ex vivo</italic> mouse brain cultures, which are similarly maintained as organotypic slice cultures at the air-liquid interface, enabling not only their long-term maintenance but also the accessibility of various brain structures for live imaging and electrophysiological analysis. More recently, this protocol was adapted and modified for long-term maintenance of human brain organoids, enabling prolonged and improved survival for several months <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We extended this technique to mouse brain organoids to model later maturation stages. Slice cultures prepared from mouse brain organoids between days 8 and 13 were maintained for weeks to months, with the possibility for further extending durations if required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The slice cultures revealed distinct neuronal subtype populations, marked by the presence of Ctip2-positive deep layer neurons and Cux2-positive upper layer neurons, which in various areas of the organoids were organised in spatially distinct regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). To assess the progression of gliogenesis, a hallmark of late neurodevelopment, we assessed the appearance of GFAP-positive cells with a stellate morphology typical for astrocytes over time. In organoids sliced at day 8, glial cells first appeared 11 days after slicing (8+11) and their abundance progressively increased in subsequent weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). At these later stages, GFAP-positive glial cells, like MAP2-positive neurons, were abundantly present across the brain organoid, displaying mature cellular morphologies as indicated by extended processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p id="P15">During the process of neuronal maturation, newborn neurons go through a series of substantial morphological changes, including the formation of long axons and arborized dendrites, and assemble specialised subcellular structures, such as synaptic connections, to ultimately establish functional neuronal networks. We next sought to explore the establishment of these mature neuronal morphologies and structures in more detail. Using a live imaging and sparse viral labelling approach, we observed abundant axonal outgrowth in mouse organoids about a week after slicing (day 8+8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>), marking one of the first steps of postmitotic neuronal development. Examining individual neuronal morphologies further showed that neurons exhibited axons extending to local and distal regions, and developed complex and arborized dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Around day 8+14, axons formed self-organised bundles projecting to different regions within the brain organoid slice culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>), as well as external projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>), as also previously reported in human brain organoid slice cultures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Of note, to successfully obtain these self-organising axon tracts, it was key to obtain complete Matrigel removal at earlier stages of the protocol, thereby avoiding axonal outgrowth into the Matrigel and away from the organoid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A,B</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To determine the subsequent establishment of synaptic connections, we examined the co-appearance of Bassoon, a presynaptic scaffold protein, and PSD95, a postsynaptic scaffold protein of excitatory synapses, using immunostaining. In mouse organoids ~6 weeks after slicing (day8+43) we observed an abundance of synaptic structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>), indicating the presence of neural networks.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Functional neuronal activity with <italic>in vivo</italic>-like action potentials in unguided mouse ALI-COs</title><p id="P17">Mouse organoids exhibited various hallmarks of electrical activity with calcium transients evident in maturing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Video 1</bold>), and c-fos staining, a common proxy for neuronal activity, demonstrating metabolically active neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). We therefore examined the electrical activity of these cultures using multielectrode arrays. High spatial resolution of high-density multielectrode arrays (HD-MEAs) enabled construction of heat maps of voltage changes during firing activity, across mouse ALI-CO cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Single-cell and subcellular spatial resolution of firing activity recordings facilitated computational clustering of detected action potentials across the HD-MEA and thus reconstruction of the electrical footprint of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Being able to reconstruct the electrical footprint of a neuron from locations where action potential voltage changes can be detected is a powerful technique as in this manner we can conduct electrical imaging of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>) in ALI-COs in a non-invasive way without the need for fixation or processing.</p><p id="P18">Furthermore, after clustering and assignment of recorded voltage changes to individual neurons, analysis of action potential latency against serial paired data of incremental distances from the point of action potential origin could be performed leading to calculation of a gradient for the conduction velocity of action potentials as they propagate through axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). We found the mean and variation in neuronal conduction velocities were comparable to that of E12.5 mouse brain slices which we had cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI-Cortices) in the same manner as ALI-COs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F,I</xref>). These data also correlated with published conduction velocities of 0.46m/s for primary E18 rat neurons dissociated and plated on HD-MEAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, demonstrating that the conduction velocities recorded from organoids are comparable to neurons generated <italic>in vivo</italic> and are not simply artefacts of air-liquid interface culture or the organoid method. Mouse ALI-COs exhibited comparable gross structural appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>) compared to the primary brain tissue cultured in the same way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>), demonstrating the ability of brain organoid cultures to recapitulate the real developing brain tissue in many ways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">Cerebral organoids and ALI-COs provide a powerful model for neurodevelopment and neuronal maturation due to their 3D nature and recapitulation of a tissue environment. These models offer a more comprehensive platform for modelling neurodevelopmental processes, placing them at the interface of <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> systems. The presence of different pools of neural progenitors and neural subtypes demonstrates the capacity to generate complex cell diversity, a hallmark of <italic>in vivo</italic> brain development. This spontaneous neurodevelopment ultimately results in mature ALI-COs that exhibit more complex wiring of axon tracts, as shown by the self-organised formation of long-range axon bundles projecting to other regions in the organoid, a phenomenon not observed in 2D cultures. The architecture of axon tracts is further supported by electrophysiological recordings with high spatiotemporal resolution to map axon morphologies, demonstrating functional connectivity. We also show that neurons from unpatterned mouse organoids were able to recapitulate aspects of neuronal physiology, as assessed via comparison to primary mouse embryonic brain slices which had been cultured in the same way.

Our data demonstrates mouse organoids and ALI-COs are able to differentiate and generate brain organoid tissue in much the same way as human cerebral organoids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> – likely in large part due to the intrinsic nature of differentiation facilitated by an unguided protocol. Indeed, the same media formulations and procedures support neurodevelopmental progression in organoids of each species. Benchmarking these mouse brain organoids against embryonic-derived mouse tissue not only validates their fidelity but also highlights the potential of human brain organoids to accurately model aspects of human brain development and neural circuit establishment. Moreover, the generation of mouse choroid plexus organoids using a guided, region-specific protocol extends the utility of mouse organoid models by offering a complementary system for studying CSF production and early development of the blood-CSF-barrier.

Prior to recordings, HD-MEAs were incubated for one hour in 70% ethanol, before being washed three times with sterile water, and a further three times with BrainPhys Medium. ALICOs were prepared for recordings as follows: cell culture inserts where ALICOs were being cultured were gently flooded with BrainPhys Medium such that ALICO slices floated up from the inserts. ALICOs were collected in a P1000 pipette with a cut tip, or where too large for this were gently lifted using a small spatula, and transferred into HD-MEA wells filled with BrainPhys Medium. Media was completely removed from the well such that ALICOs rested on the HD-MEA surface, and were incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes without media, to facilitate attachment of the ALICO to the surface. A small volume of BrainPhys Medium (10-30ml) was then gently pipetted into the well – sufficient to keep the ALICO moist but not so much to cause the slice to float off the surface. A lid was placed on the HD-MEA well to prevent media evaporation, and HD-MEAs were allowed to reach a stable temperature and CO2 in the incubator before recordings were commenced. BrainPhys Medium used for transfer of ALICOs to HD-MEA, and during recordings, was that which the ALICOs were being cultured on immediately prior (rather than fresh media).</p><p id="P31">Recordings were performed in the incubator via wired connection and were operated and processed remotely using the MaxLab Live Server (MaxWell Biosystems AG, Version 22.1.4 e6d15224) via the MaxLab Live Scope graphical user interface.
