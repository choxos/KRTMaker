In the chick brainstem auditory circuit, the pattern of nodal spacing varies regionally along single axons, enabling precise binaural integration for sound localization. Using this model, we investigated the potential factors underlying the biased nodal spacing pattern. 3D morphometry revealed that these axons were almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes exhibiting distinct morphologies and cell densities across regions after hearing onset. The structure of axons did not affect internodal length. Inhibiting vesicular release from the axons did not affect internodal length or oligodendrocyte morphology, but caused unmyelinated segments on the axons by suppressing oligodendrogenesis near the presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes is a prominent determinant of the biased nodal spacing pattern in the sound localization circuit, while activity-dependent signaling supports the pattern by ensuring adequate oligodendrocyte density.

The distance between adjacent nodes (internodal length) affects the speed of saltatory conduction, with longer internodes leading to faster conduction, and hence has a significant impact on neural circuit function by influencing the timing of input arrival at target neurons. The pattern of nodal spacing along axons is not necessarily uniform. Recent studies have shown that the internodal length varies not only among axonal types and brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chong et al., 2012</xref>), but also along individual axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Tomassy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Ford et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bonetto et al., 2021</xref>). Despite its potential importance in neural information processing, the mechanisms regulating nodal spacing patterns are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Normand and Rasband, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Various factors could contribute to the emergence of nodal spacing patterns along axons. In the central nervous system (CNS), each Ranvier node is formed through the following processes. Immature oligodendrocytes contact axons with their processes, initiating myelin formation that extends along the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Snaidero et al., 2014</xref>). At the ends of the extending myelin, the paranodal domain, at which the myelin tip contacts the axon, acts as a diffusion barrier and facilitates the clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) and the scaffolding protein ankyrinG (AnkG) to form a heminode. Subsequent restriction of the gap between two neighboring heminodes forms a mature Ranvier node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Vabnick et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Susuki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Rasband and Peles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">2021</xref>). Thus, the patterning of nodal spacing along axons is based on multicellular interactions among oligodendrocytes and axons and could be influenced by multiple factors associated with these cells, the factors related to oligodendrocytes include their morphological characteristics (e.g., the number and length of myelin sheaths) and cell density relative to axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chong et al., 2012</xref>), while those related to axons include their branching (Stedehouder et al., 2019), diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bechler et al., 2015</xref>), and neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Fields, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bechler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bonetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Osanai et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, the contributions of these factors would vary significantly due to the diversity of both cell types and developmental stages, which obscures our understanding of the mechanisms of determining the nodal spacing patterns.</p><p id="P4">To understand the regulatory mechanisms of nodal spacing, the chicken brainstem auditory circuit is an excellent model, because the nodal spacing is biased in a region-dependent manner along the same projecting axons, minimizing the effects of neuronal diversity. In addition, this regional difference in internodal length is also important in the computation of neural circuits for sound localization. Sound localization is the ability to identify the direction of sound source and involves detecting the time difference in sound arrivals between the ears (interaural time difference, ITD) in the order of microseconds. The ITD detection is mediated by an array of coincidence detector neurons in the nucleus laminaris (NL) that receive excitatory synaptic inputs from both sides of the nucleus magnocellularis (NM), a homologue of mammalian anteroventral cochlear nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Carr and Konishi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hyson 2005</xref>). In this circuit, the spacing of nodes along the axon of NM neurons differs among regions; the internodal length is longer at the tract region across the midline than at other regions including the NL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Seidl et al., 2010</xref>). The long internodes reduce the conduction time from the contralateral side and compensate for the difference in axonal pathlengths between the two sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Seidl et al., 2014</xref>), while the short internodes expand the dynamic range for detectable ITD within the NL. Therefore, this model will be an important stepping stone for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of nodal spacing and their impact on neural circuit function.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we tested the potential factors contributing to the regional differences in the nodal spacing along NM axons using high-resolution 3D morphometry of the optically-cleared brainstem auditory circuit. The results showed that NM axons are almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes with distinct morphological features after hearing onset. This morphological difference was not due to axonal structure. Inhibition of vesicular release from NM axons did not affect the internodal length and oligodendrocyte morphology but caused unmyelinated segments on NM axons via a suppression of oligodendrogenesis at the NL region. These results identified that the major factor contributing to the biased nodal spacing pattern in the ITD circuit is the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes. Activity-dependent signaling also contributed to this circuit by ensuring the density of oligodendrocytes through enhanced oligodendrogenesis. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of regulating nodal spacing along single axons and also into the significance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in neural circuit function.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ranvier nodes developed in a similar time course along NM axons after hearing onset</title><p id="P6">NM neurons in chick embryos form axonal projections to the NL at embryonic day 10 (E10), begin to receive auditory input from around E12, and are functionally mature by the time around hatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Akter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), allowing the animals to localize sounds immediately after hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Grier et al., 1967</xref>). To clarify how node formation progresses along development and whether there are regional differences in the timing of node formation, we examined the development of nodes at the tract and NL regions by double staining with AnkG and pan Nav antibodies or AnkG and Caspr antibodies, a marker for the paranodal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D–F</xref>).</p><p id="P7">At E12, we did not find these molecules at each region. At E15, Nav-positive clusters appeared and they were localized specifically at one end of the fibrous AnkG signals. The remaining Nav-negative part of AnkG signals would correspond to the paranodal domain, as myelin sheath at the domain shows transient expression of AnkG during the immature period of CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chang et al., 2014</xref>), and these structures were defined as ‘heminode’. At E18, Caspr signals became detectable at the paranodal domain of heminode. In addition, some Caspr signals appeared on both sides of the fibrous AnkG signals, sandwiching the Nav cluster. These structures would be formed through the fusion of adjacent heminodes and were defined as ‘immature node’. At E21, many nodes showed mature patterns, with complete colocalization of Nav and AnkG at a short nodal domain, which was flanked by Caspr-positive paranodal domains (‘mature node’). Triple staining of these molecules confirmed the three stages of nodal development along the axon of NM neurons. Quantification of their abundance revealed that their maturation progressed gradually after hearing onset and was almost completed around hatch. 90 % of the node types were heminodes at E15. This decreased to about 50% by E18 and to about 10% by E21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G, H</xref>), suggesting that NM axons are almost fully myelinated by E21. Although the increase in the proportion of immature nodes was slightly preceded at the tract region, the overall tendency did not differ greatly between the regions. These data indicate that the formation of Ranvier nodes progress in a similar time course along the axon.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Development of myelin sheath along NM axons</title><p id="P8">Formation of Ranvier nodes requires maturation of myelin sheaths. To clarify their relationship on NM axons, we also examined the development of myelin with an antibody against myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) during the period of node formation.</p><p id="P9">The immunosignals for MAG appeared around the midline of the brainstem at E12 and extended along the axons of NM neurons at E15, becoming more intense at later ages for both tract and NL regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). These are consistent with the time course of node formation. Importantly, many oligodendrocytes were situated along the axon, as identified by immunopositivity of Olig2, a marker in the nucleus of oligodendrocyte lineage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, the MAG signals overlapped with the heminodes at E15. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that myelin sheaths already exist around the paranodal domains at the very early stage of node formation, in agreement with the idea that the early nodes can shift their position dynamically with myelin maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). These raised the questions as to when the biased nodal spacing pattern emerges during development and whether and how oligodendrocytes contribute to the process.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Internodal length was determined roughly during node formation</title><p id="P10">To answer these questions, we first evaluated the internodal length between mature/immature nodes at E18 and P9 at the tract and NL regions. These two time points correspond to the periods during and after node formation, respectively. We labeled axons with a tracer, rhodamine dextran, visualized nodes with the Caspr antibody, and measured the internodal length at each region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P11">The internodal length was about 3 times longer in the tract region compared with the NL region at P9 (tract: 211.1±9.6 μm; NL: 63.9±3.0 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>), as observed in posthatch animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Seidl et al., 2010</xref>). The difference in internodal length in these two regions of the axons was already evident at E18, although the internodal length was shorter by 20% at E18 in both tract and NL regions (tract: 171.0±7.0 μm; NL: 53.4±3.8 μm). The slightly shorter internodal length at E18 would reflect an elongation of internode during development in accordance with maturation of the brain size. Thus, the nodal spacing pattern was already determined at the early period of node formation, implying that reorganization of internodes would not contribute to the biased internodal length.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Morphology of oligodendrocytes differed between tract and NL regions</title><p id="P12">We next explored the contributions of oligodendrocytes to the regional difference in internodal length by evaluating the morphology of individual oligodendrocytes at E21. We sparsely labeled mature oligodendrocytes by expressing tdTomato with a palmitoylation signal (paltdTomato) under MBP promoter using <italic>in ovo</italic> electroporation and the iOn switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kumamoto et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, B</xref>), while labeling bilateral NM axons with GFP by transfection of avian adeno-associated virus (A3V) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). The 3D morphology of oligodendrocytes was then observed in 200 μm-thick brainstem slices optically cleared with SlowFade Glass mountant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">2</xref>). We focused our analyses on oligodendrocytes ensheathing the main trunk of NM axons.</p><p id="P13">As presumed, length of myelin sheaths differed significantly between the tract and NL regions (tract: 174.1±5.0 μm; NL: 59.7±2.4 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>), which was consistent with the difference in internodal length between the regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Importantly, the diameter of myelin sheath including the axon did not differ between the regions and did not show any correlation with the myelin length (tract: 1.69±0.05 μm; NL: 1.64±0.07 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F, G</xref>). In each oligodendrocyte, the average myelin length was shorter by 3 times (tract: 181.1±7.3 μm NL: 63.6±4.7 μm), the number of myelin sheaths was larger by 2 times (tract: 3.0±0.2; NL: 6.6±0.6), and the total myelin length was shorter by 1.3 times (tract: 527.9±27.2 μm; NL: 394.6±29.7 μm) at the NL region compared to the tract region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H–J</xref>). In addition, the cell body size was 30% smaller in cross-sectional area at the NL region (tract: 78.2±2.7 μm<sup>2</sup>; NL: 52.5±1.9 μm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3K</xref>). Thus, oligodendrocyte morphology was heterogeneous, with distinct differences in several aspects between the tract and NL regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3L, M</xref>), even though they were myelinating the same axons.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Axon structure did not contribute to the regional difference in nodal spacing</title><p id="P14">The distinct oligodendrocyte morphologies imply differences in their intrinsic properties (e.g., the ability to produce and extend myelin sheaths), but the involvement of other external constraints cannot yet be ruled out. The structure of axons, such as branch points and diameter, is one of these external constraints, and can affect myelin extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Murray &amp; Blakemore, 1980</xref>; Hildebrand et al., 1983; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Ibrahim et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bechler et al., 2015</xref>; Stedehouder et al., 2019). We therefore investigated the relationship between the structural features of NM axons and the nodal spacing at E21. To accomplish this, we labeled the axon of NM neurons by expressing GFP with a palmitoylation signal (palGFP) using <italic>in ovo</italic> electroporation and examined the nodal spacing three-dimensionally along the main trunk of NM axon in 200 μm-thick brainstem slices, which were optically cleared after staining with a Caspr antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A–D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Video 3</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The results showed that on the main trunk of the axons, most of the Caspr signals showed mature/immature node patterns, confirming that the axons were almost fully myelinated. These axons formed multiple collateral branches innervating the ventral dendritic layer at the NL region, and triads of paranodal domains were frequently observed at the branch points. The internodal length (73.1±2.1 μm) was about 40% shorter compared to the branch point interval (122.5±6.7 μm) at the NL region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E, F</xref>). Correspondingly, the number of internodes between adjacent branch points averaged 1.6 and was correlated with the length of branch point interval (‘0’: 27.5±3.9 μm; ‘1’: 79.3±5.1 μm; ‘2’: 156.3±7.1 μm; ‘3≦’: 232.0±10.0 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H, I</xref>). In areas with very short branch point intervals (bottom 10%: &lt;40 μm), the axon lacked Caspr signals frequently (61.5%), implying that these areas are less likely to be myelinated (internode=0 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). On the other hand, even in areas with long branch point intervals (top 10%: &gt;220 μm), the internodal length did not increase and it was 2 times shorter than that at the tract region (&lt;220 μm: 71.4±2.4 μm; &gt;220 μm: 79.9±3.9 μm; tract: 164.3±4.2 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J</xref>). These observations suggest that the branch point interval is not a critical determinant of the short internodes at the NL region, although it can be a limiting factor in areas with the shorter branch point interval.</p><p id="P16">The diameter of axon main trunk did not differ between the tract and NL regions (tract: 1.40±0.03 μm; NL: 1.47±0.04 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4K</xref>), corresponding to the diameter of myelin sheaths including axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). This was consistent with the previous report showing that the axon diameter did not differ between the tract and the distal portion of ventral NL, at which the axon main trunk is situated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Seidl et al., 2010</xref>), confirming that the diameter of NM axons is not a factor determining the regional differences in nodal spacing.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Oligodendrogenesis was augmented at NL region</title><p id="P17">Given that NM axons were fully myelinated, oligodendrocyte density could also be a constraint of individual oligodendrocyte morphology; if the density is high, it may limit the extension of myelin sheath due to mutual competition for territory on the axon. Therefore, we examined the density of oligodendrocyte lineage cells during development by labeling the cells with the Olig2 antibody and quantifying their density at the tract and NL regions between E9 and E21(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A top, B</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The results showed that the density of Olig2-positive cells increased with development, peaked at E15, and decreased slightly afterwards. Importantly, the extent of this increase was more robust and about 1.3-fold higher at the NL region than at the tract region. The differences in oligodendrocyte density could result from several factors, including the density of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which mature into oligodendrocytes through several steps of maturation, as well as the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of these cells. We measured the density of OPCs by labeling the cells with Nkx2.2 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A bottom, C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Xu et al., 2000</xref>). The density of Nkx2.2-positive cells increased sharply and reached a plateau by E12 at both regions, while the extent of this increase was also higher at the NL region. These cells were restricted to the ventral and dorsal fiber layers and almost absent in the somatic and dendritic layers of NL. These results suggest that the density of OPCs increases around the period of hearing onset to a larger extent at the NL region, contributing to the higher density of oligodendrocyte lineage cells at this region. We evaluated the level of proliferation of OPCs with BrdU labeling and found that the density of BrdU-positive cells was significantly higher at the NL region during E12–16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D, E</xref>). BrdU-positive cells were immunopositive for both Olig2 and Nkx2.2, confirming that they were OPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F, G</xref>). These results suggest that the higher densities of OPCs and oligodendrocyte lineage cells at the NL region occur through a region-specific facilitation of oligodendrogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Inhibition of vesicular release did not affect internodal length but caused unmyelinated segments at NL region</title><p id="P19">Myelination could be modulated adaptively by neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Fields, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bechler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bonetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Osanai et al., 2022</xref>).

Interestingly, eTeNT expression did not affect the internodal length at both tract and NL regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>). The internodal lengths at the NL region did not differ between those with (65.4±2.6 μm) and without (71.7±2.3 μm) heminodes, while the length of unmyelinated segments was only less than half of them (30.7±2.4 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I</xref>).

In the eTeNT group, on the other hand, this enhancement was suppressed, which abolished the difference in the density of these cells between the regions. These data indicate that vesicular release from NM axons promotes oligodendrogenesis specifically at the NL region without altering oligodendrocyte morphology, suggesting that adaptive oligodendrogenesis is important in covering the entire length of the axon with short myelin sheaths at the region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A–C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">This study identified several factors responsible for biased nodal spacing patterns along axons, including heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology, regional differences in proliferation of OPCs, and activity-dependent signaling from axons through vesicular release.</p><p id="P25">Using the chick brainstem auditory circuit known for its characteristic nodal spacing as a model, we found that NM axons were almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes with distinct morphologies between the two regions having markedly different internodal lengths. This regional heterogeneity reflected differences in the intrinsic property of oligodendrocytes in these two regions rather than the extrinsic constraints. Expression of eTeNT in most of the NM axons caused unmyelinated segments by region-specific suppression of oligodendrogenesis without affecting internodal length or oligodendrocyte morphology, suggesting that primary role of neural activity is to ensure the oligodendrocyte density necessary for full myelination of axons.</p><sec id="S12"><title>Biased nodal spacing pattern reflects regional heterogeneity of oligodendrocyte</title><p id="P26">The major factor contributing to regional differences in internodal length along NM axons was regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology. The morphological differences were observed not only in the length of myelin sheaths, but also in the number of myelin sheaths and the size of cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Considering the morphological classification of oligodendrocytes by Pío <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">del Río-Hortega (1928)</xref>, oligodendrocytes at the tract and NL regions could be classified into type III and type II, respectively. Such morphological heterogeneity could be related to the variation of gene profiles among oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Butt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Marques et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Osanai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Valihrach et al., 2022</xref>). Differences in the origin and/or the pericellular microenvironment of OPCs during development may contribute to the diverse gene profiles of oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Crawford et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Foerster et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Boshans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Sherafat et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with the idea, OPCs in the brainstem have two developmental origins, derived from the ventral and dorsal sides of the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Vallstedt et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, pericellular concentration of some ligands may differ between the tract and NL regions according to the distance from synapses or postsynaptic cells. Whether the gene profiles of oligodendrocytes and OPCs differ between the tract and NL regions and what causes the differences are important issues to be examined in the future.</p><p id="P27">The regional differences in the morphology of oligodendrocytes would primarily reflect their intrinsic properties specific to each region; the ability of myelin production is higher, while that of myelin extension is lower at the NL region than at the tract region. Supportively, the axonal factors, such as structure and vesicular release, did not affect the regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6H</xref>). Oligodendrocyte density did not affect the morphology, either; the number and length of myelin sheaths did not increase even when unmyelinated segments appeared after A3V-eTeNT transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6J–K</xref>). Another potential factor influencing the regional differences in internodal length could be pre-nodal clusters which are formed by cell-autonomous accumulation of nodal components on the axons of certain types of neurons before myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kaplan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Freeman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Vagionitis et al., 2022</xref>). However, our immunostaining results failed to detect such clusters on the NM axons. This may be due to limited detection sensitivity or the unavailability of neurofascin antibodies in chickens. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that fixed pre-nodal clusters pre-determine internodal length prior to myelination, given the facts that the length of unmyelinated segments was far shorter than the internodal length at the NL region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I</xref>). Thus, we consider that the morphology of oligodendrocyte, and hence the length of myelin sheaths, are determined according to the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes at each region, which underlies the regional differentiation of nodal spacing along NM axons. Variations in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes are also reported in other brain regions. Oligodendrocytes in white matter are morphologically distinct from those in gray matter, and their original features did not change even when OPCs were cross-transplanted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Viganò et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, OPCs collected from different brain regions show their original morphological features when cultured on artificial fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bechler et al., 2015</xref>). In summary, our findings provide the perspective that oligodendrocytes with different intrinsic properties work together to fine-tune the neural circuit function involved in ITD detection.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Adaptive oligodendrogenesis ensures full myelination of axons at NL region</title><p id="P28">Neuronal activity can affect the proliferation, maturation and morphology of oligodendrocytes, but the effects are not uniform across different neuronal subtypes and brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gibson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bonetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Osanai et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, the inhibition of vesicular release had different effects on myelination depending on neuronal subtype; myelination is impaired in some axons, but remains unaffected in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Mensch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Koudelka et al., 2016</xref>). In NM axons, activity-dependent signaling did not affect myelin formation in mature oligodendrocytes but instead facilitated proliferation and differentiation of OPCs. Given that this enhancement of oligodendrogenesis occurred specifically at the NL region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6I</xref>) and that unmyelinated segments were increased only when eTeNT was expressed in a large fraction of the axons via A3V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>—<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">figure supplement 1</xref>), exocytosis from the presynaptic terminals of NM axons would cause the effects by altering the perisynaptic microenvironment. Glutamate and several trophic factors such as BDNF, which are released from the terminals of NM axons, may act on the OPC directly via spillover from the synapse and/or indirectly via activation of NL neurons or astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Du et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Pease-Raissi &amp; Chan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Fekete &amp; Nishiyama, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Pivoňková et al., 2024</xref>). Supportively, mRNA of NR1, a major subunit of NMDA receptor, is strongly expressed in glial cells, presumably oligodendrocyte lineage cells, at the ventral and dorsal dendritic layers of NL after E10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Tang and Carr, 2007</xref>). Future studies are needed to determine what ligands mediate the differentiation and proliferation of OPCs as the activity-dependent signaling at the NL region and whether there are regional differences in the sensitivity of these OPCs to the ligands along the NM axon.</p><p id="P29">Adaptive oligodendrogenesis would support the function of brainstem auditory circuits by ensuring the full myelination of NM axons. Full myelination of the auditory pathway enables rapid membrane responses and high metabolic support during high-frequency firing, which are critical for precise and reliable processing of sound information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Moore et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the full myelination at the NL region, which is mediated by the adaptive enhancement of oligodendrogenesis, would be particularly important for ITD detection. The contralateral projections of NM neurons have a sequential branching structure called a “delay line” at the ventral area of NL in chickens. This delay line produces an output delay of up to 180 μs for contralateral NL neurons along the medial to lateral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Overholt et al., 1992</xref>). This delay covers the physiological ITD range for the chicken, allowing the ITDs to be encoded in a “place map” within the NL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Jeffress, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Köppl &amp; Carr, 2008</xref>). This should provide the neural basis for the ability of excellent sound localization in chickens, which can discriminate ITDs of about 20 μs (8.9° minimum audible angle) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Krumm et al., 2022</xref>). Reliable myelination of the delay line ensures constant conduction velocity and output delay and hence is critical for precise ITD calculation. Thus, the adaptive oligodendrogenesis at the NL region would be a mechanism that secures the accuracy of ITD calculation in the avian auditory circuit. Interestingly, ITD representation within the NL exhibits plasticity around the period of hearing onset in the barn owl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Carr et al., 2024</xref>), which coincides with the period of adaptive oligodendrogenesis, speculating its contribution to the plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Commonalities and differences with the sound localization circuit in mammals</title><p id="P30">Regional regulation of conduction velocity has also been reported in mammals. In a brainstem auditory circuit of gerbils, which is involved in the processing of ITDs, several regional differentiations have been observed in the nodal spacing along the axon. In the axon of spherical bushy cells, a mammalian homologue of NM neurons, the internodal length is longer for contralateral side than for ipsilateral side, presumably compensating for the different axonal pathlength between the two sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Seidl &amp; Rubel, 2016</xref>). On the other hand, in the axon of globular bushy cells that project to medial nucleus of trapezoid body, the internodal length is longer for those innervating more medial location (i.e. more distal location), ensuring simultaneous inputs within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Ford et al., 2015</xref>). These regional differentiations of nodal spacing would be acquired independently in mammals and birds through evolutionary convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Lipovsek &amp; Wingate, 2018</xref>), emphasizing their importance in securing ITD computation in the microsecond order. Notably, in globular bushy cells, neural activity did not alter the nodal spacing, but instead regulated the conduction velocity by adaptively changing the axon diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Nabel et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that the mechanism of action of activity-dependent signaling is different among neurons and species. It will be interesting to examine whether regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes is a prominent determinant in the biased nodal spacing pattern in mammalian ITD circuits as well. Such comparisons will help to understand the fundamental logic and mechanisms of determining nodal spacing patterns along the axons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P31">This study identified the factors mediating the regional differentiation of nodal spacing along single axons in the auditory pathway of chicken; the differentiation of nodal spacing reflects regional heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte morphology, and the activity-dependent signaling from axons via vesicular release contributes to the full myelination of axons through region-specific enhancement of oligodendrogenesis.

These types were determined according to the length of AnkG signals; the signals longer than 3 μm were defined as heminode or immature node according to the number of Nav-negative paranodal domains, and those shorter than 3 μm were defined as mature node. Note that some immature nodes had long nodal domains that exceeded 5 μm. This may correspond to a gap between the two heminodes.
