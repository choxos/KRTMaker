We expand the repertoire of speed-optimized DNA sequences for DNA-PAINT imaging to drive visualization of ten targets in a sequential manner with molecular resolution. We demonstrate this by visualizing diverse nuclear targets and characterizing their relative spatial distribution. We outline major reorganization in the chromatin landscape upon transcription inhibition.

DNA-PAINT, a variant of Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy, achieves diffraction unlimited resolution through stochastic, transient hybridization of short complementary single-stranded DNAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> Additionally, DNA-PAINT enables multiplexed imaging by encoding the target identity into DNA docking strand. However, the acquisition times are enormous, requiring up to several hours for each imaging round,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> because of the rather slow binding kinetics of initial DNA sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Recent studies have improved imaging speed by cleverly designing imager strands with non-complementary nucleotides arranged in repetitive blocks forming concatenated sequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup></p><p id="P3">Currently, only six speed-optimized sequences are available, limiting multiplexing to six targets. Although recent studies using secondary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> or adapter DNA probes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> allow near-unlimited multiplexing, they require complex strand hybridization and dissociation schemes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> Thus, expanding the sequence space to enable faster imaging with greater multiplexing-ability remains a key challenge.</p><p id="P4">To address this, we systematically searched for all possible imager-docking strand pairs that support faster imaging. Two design rules that were followed in this search are that (1) the imager strand must not comprise nucleotides that are complementary, and (2) they must form units that can be concatenated to form overlapped docking strands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a, b</xref>). This yielded two di-, four tri-, and six tetra-nucleotide blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1c</xref>). We reserved cytosines (C) containing blocks for docking strands, and guanines (G) containing blocks for imagers. These sequences preclude secondary structures, promoting rapid and efficient binding. Concatenation of such blocks further improve binding rates by increasing the number potential binding sites. Using this strategy, we propose as many as 12 sequences of which six sequences were reported earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Increasing the block length to five nucleotides compromises orthogonality and was hence excluded from further consideration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 1d</xref>).</p><p id="P5">We tested the multiplexing capability of all speed-optimized sequences utilizing unique DNA nanostructures carrying docking strands for each of the imager sequences. For visual identification and testing the resolution, we designed origami nanostructures carrying docking strands in a 4×3 grid pattern where each strand is separated from its neighbor by 20 nm. We immobilized these in a single microfluidic channel and imaged them in 12 rounds using Exchange-PAINT modality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). As expected, all 12 species of origami nanostructures were clearly visible in the merged data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). While majority of the imagers showed clear specific binding on their target docking strands, two sets of imagers (R1 and R9, R2 and R10) displayed unexpected non-specific binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>), emphasizing the tolerance for certain DNA mismatches to form detectable duplexes. Because of this cross-binding, only one imager from each of these pairs can be used for multiplexed imaging. Together, Exchange-PAINT imaging of “12-color” data shows that we can achieve multiplexing capabilities of as many as ten targets at high-speed and high-resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d, 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We next performed kinetic analysis of all twelve imager-docking strands by utilizing DNA nanostructures with patterns carrying a unique docking strand in the center (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3a</xref>). We performed two-color DNA-PAINT imaging to obtain the pattern of the nanostructure and kinetics of the docking strand (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3b</xref>). Our analysis shows that these imagers display a range of binding times from few hundred milli-seconds to over a second (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3c</xref>). This versatile imager pool with varying binding times enables us to utilize imager strands based on the required properties for a given imaging application. For instance, imagers with wide range of kinetics can enhance the multiplexing capabilities of DNA-PAINT via kinetic barcoding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">We tested their applicability for studying nuclear targets by imaging Lamin B1 in cellular settings and found that all the imagers showed the expected signals, except R3, which additionally marked the nucleolar structure non-specifically (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4 and 5</xref>). These data reveal that nine-color imaging of nuclear targets with an Exchange-PAINT based approach is readily possible at enhanced speeds.</p><p id="P8">We then strategized to exploit these sequences to delineate the spatial distribution of various nuclear features. We targeted nine different nuclear marks encompassing features known to delineate euchromatin (RNA pol II Serine 2 Phosphorylation (S2P), RNA pol II Serine 5 Phosphorylation (S5P), splicing factor SC35, H3K4me3 and H3K37ac); heterochromatin (H3K27me3, H3K9me3, Lamin B1); and CTCF, a transcription factor involved in dictating genome architecture. For achieving multiplexed imaging with the same species primary antibodies, we preincubated them with secondary nanobodies, each conjugated to a distinct DNA docking strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> This strategy avoids cross-reactivity and enabled us to visualize multiple nuclear targets using DNA-PAINT. The differential distribution of all targets relative to each other showcases the complexity of nuclear organization in a single cell captured through multiplexed imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6 (top)</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To further benchmark our approach, we imaged transcriptionally impaired cells treated with Actinomycin D, which profoundly altered spatial nuclear organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6 (bottom) and 7</xref>). To further benchmark our approach, we imaged transcriptionally impaired cells treated with Actinomycin D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, which profoundly altered spatial nuclear organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6 (bottom) and 7</xref>). Surprisingly, Lamin B1 delocalized from the nuclear periphery to the interiors of the nucleus. This is accompanied by loss of distinct nuclear speckle bodies demarcated by SC35 enrichment, as observed in mock cells. These results exemplify the robustness of multiplexed imaging in capturing these redistributions in a single cell.</p><p id="P10">To quantitatively interpret our data, we employed a coarse-grained correlation analysis between target pairs (see Methods). We observe expected associations among these targets in the DMSO-treated (mock) cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> For instance, RNApolII-S2P and RNApolII-S5P show positive correlation with the splicing factor SC35, indicating their physical proximity. Similarly, heterochromatin marks correlate with nuclear lamin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>–below diagonal). We also observed expected mutual exclusion of euchromatin and heterochromatin marks. Upon transcription inhibition, we observed a complete reorganization of all the factors with increased positive correlation amongst them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>–above diagonal). Interestingly, SC35 displayed a negative correlation with all nuclear components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Leveraging on our high-resolution data, we next performed spatial correlation viewpoint analysis between each pair of targets. This analyses once again embodies the correlation amongst heterochromatin and euchromatin regions. Heterochromatin marks show a clear mutual interaction. Additionally, SC35 shows a distinct preference to euchromatin, emphasized by the larger fractions showing high-positive correlation (&lt;0.7) and low fractions showing high-negative correlation (&lt;-0.7) with euchromatin marks. Under ActD treatment, we observe a marked loss in fractions showing high positive correlation of SC35 with euchromatin marks and a corresponding gain in negative correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8 and 9</xref>). This indicates a likely loss of contacts between SC35 and chromatin regions. In contrast, a gain in all fractions showing high positive correlation between all other interactions indicate chromatin collapse, corroborating earlier reported observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.In contrast, a gain in all fractions showing high positive correlation between all other interactions indicate chromatin collapse, corroborating earlier reported observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">Given the high density of nuclear content, it is apparent to observe palpable correlations between nuclear features due to their proximity. However, spatial correlation maps enable us to discern regions where interactions are significantly higher and correlate better with the target of interest. To investigate this further, we chose two viewpoints: Lamin B1 to represent heterochromatic organization and SC35 to represent euchromatic organization. In untreated cells, both heterochromatic marks (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) and actively transcribing RNA pol II (RNApolII-S2P and -S5P) show high positive enrichment near their respective viewpoints of lamin and nuclear speckle, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref> top, Full nucleus view). Zoomed-in regions further emphasize this observation where all other targets show diminishing enrichments near the lamin, with actively transcribing RNA pol II marks (RNApolII-S2P and - S5P) showing the least enrichment of high-correlation at 6.16% and 5.40% respectively. From the SC35 viewpoint, similar diminishing trends are observed, with H3K9me3 and Lamin B1 showing the least enrichment of 8.14%. and 3.92% respectively.</p><p id="P13">Upon transcription inhibition, highly correlating regions of both heterochromatic marks show discernable delocalization from the nuclear periphery, indicating a loss of peripheral enrichment of these marks alongside Lamin B1 internalization. Nuclear speckles, though lower in number, no longer show distinct enrichment of actively transcribing RNApolII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref> bottom, Full nucleus view). Zoom-in views reveal a distinct pattern of higher correlating regions–most targets are enriched with lamin B1 in small pockets distributed within the nucleus, rather than at the nuclear periphery. Conversely, we clearly observe a loss in correlation of almost all targets near the nuclear speckles further highlighting the changes in spatial organization of chromatin due to transcription inhibition and chromatin collapse.</p><p id="P14">The expansion of speed-optimized imager-docking strand sequences will unlock the full potential of DNA-PAINT imaging’s multiplexing capabilities. Additionally, the adapter-strand-based “unlimited” multiplexing can be done in batches of ten instead of six targets per labeling round which would drastically reduce the time required for multiplexing. The increased repertoire of speed-optimized imager-docking strand sequences will also facilitate multi-color sub-nanometer resolution imaging with RESI which requires multiple rounds of imaging for each target identification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> Simultaneous imaging of histone modifications, transcriptional machinery, and nuclear bodies at high resolution, signify the application of new sequences in the field of spatial proteomics and interactome building, in addition to other allied fields including biomedical sciences.</p><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS205801-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d77aAcNbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge Vinay Bhardwaj for helping with purifying anti-rabbit IgG secondary nanobody.
