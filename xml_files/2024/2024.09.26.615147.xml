This process has been extensively studied with the help of reconstituted in vitro systems, but the dynamics in living cells have not been characterized. In this study, we performed single-molecule tracking of the bacterial initiation factors IF2, IF3, as well as the initiator fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> directly in growing <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells. Our results reveal the kinetics of factor association with the ribosome and, among other things, highlight the respective antagonistic roles of IF2 and IF3 in the process. Importantly, our comparisons of in vivo binding kinetics of the two naturally occurring isoforms of IF2 reveal that the longer IF2α isoform directly interacts with the transcriptional factor NusA, a finding further corroborated by pull-down and cross-linking experiments. We further show that cells with compromised binding between IF2α and NusA display slow adaptation to new growth conditions. Taken together, these results suggest a novel coupling mechanism between transcription and translation initiation, important for the rewiring of the transcriptome during a shift of growth media.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Rapid and accurate initiation of mRNA translation is crucial for any living cell as it defines the reading frame of the mRNA and the production output for each protein. Canonical translation initiation can be divided into a number of steps, i.e., the small ribosomal subunit (30S) finding the correct initiation site on mRNA, correct positioning on the start codon where initiator tRNA (fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>) base-pairs with mRNA, docking of the large ribosomal subunit (50S), and finally maturation of the complex (70S) into an elongation competent state. Base-pairing between the 3’-end of 16S rRNA, known as anti-Shine-Dalgarno, and a corresponding mRNA motif, called the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, were thought to provide the primary mechanism with which ribosomes locate the initiation sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. However, recent studies show that other mRNA features collectively play a larger role in this process <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, among which the thermodynamic stability of secondary structures surrounding the start codon might be the dominant factor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. To define the reading frame by correct positioning of fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> on the AUG start codon, ribosomes further rely on the coordinated action of three initiation factors (IFs), IF1, IF2, and IF3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Translation initiation factor 1 (IF1), encoded by the <italic>infA</italic> gene, is the smallest of the IFs. It consists of 71 aa (8.2 kDa) and binds to the A site of the 30S subunit. IF1 provides additional binding points for IF2 and IF3 and has been shown to stabilize their interaction and enhance their activities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The gene <italic>infB</italic> encodes IF2, a large GTPase which recruits fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> via its C-terminal domain and facilitates 50S subunit joining to the 30S initiation complex. In <italic>E. coli,</italic> IF2 exists in three isoforms, IF2α (97.3 kDa), IF2β (79.9 kDa), and IF2γ (78.8 kDa) due to the presence of alternative in-frame initiation codons in the gene <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Both the large (IF2α) and the smaller isoforms (IF2β and IF2γ) are required for optimal growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and they are present in similar concentrations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, suggesting that the isoforms might have overlapping but not identical functions. The functional difference between the three isoforms is poorly understood, though reports are indicating that the IF2α isoform might play a role in maintaining genome integrity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and in protein folding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Finally, the gene <italic>infC</italic> encodes the two-domain protein IF3 which prevents premature 50S subunit association and ensures fidelity of fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> selection by monitoring the codon:anticodon interaction with mRNA and destabilizing interactions with incorrect elongator tRNAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Single-molecule in vitro studies and stopped-flow techniques in bulk have previously been employed to study the timing and the order of factor association during assembly of the canonical 30S initiation complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. These studies, however, yielded contradictory results. One study suggests that complex formation may proceed via multiple pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, while the other advocates for the existence of a single kinetically favored route <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. That is, IF3 and IF2 are the first to bind the 30S. Thereafter, the arrival of IF1 leads to the formation of a stable complex which recruits fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>.</p><p id="P5">Upon correct base pairing between the fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> anticodon and the start codon, the 50S subunit joins which triggers hydrolysis of IF2 bound GTP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, with subsequent dissociation of all IFs 21 and the final maturation of the 70S initiation complex into an elongation competent state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Decades of studies on IFs have shown how they mediate the key steps of translation initiation, and novel techniques continue to reveal their structural dynamics and the overall underlying complexity of the process <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, the majority of these studies rely on reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> systems with short model mRNAs, and it is, still, difficult to predict how IFs and ribosomes behave in the complex environment of the cell. For example, there is growing evidence that the IFs, especially IF2, might be involved in other processes such as ribosome maturation, protein folding, stress adaptation, DNA repair, and transcription-translation coupling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">In this study, we developed an approach for in vivo single-molecule tracking of IF2 and IF3 directly in live <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. By measuring the respective steady-state fraction and dwell time of each factor bound to ribosomes, we show that on average, fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> is the last to arrive at the 30S. IF2 samples the ribosomes multiple time during initiation, and binds only transiently without prompt arrival of the fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>. Interestingly, we observed significant differences in the diffusional behavior of the IF2α and IF2γ isoforms, suggesting that the longer IF2α isoform has an additional major interaction partner besides the ribosomes in the cells. With additional experiments, we demonstrate that Domain I of IF2α, which is absent in the other two isoforms, is responsible for frequent and distinct binding to the transcription machinery via the C-terminal domain of the transcription factor NusA. Hence, our results suggest a hitherto unknown mechanism for transcription-translation coupling during translation initiation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Labeling of IFs and fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup></title><p id="P8">To fluorescence label the IFs for live-cell single-molecule tracking, we explored if the addition of a HaloTag compromises IF activity in supporting cell growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary information</xref>). For IF2, we included both the largest isoform, IF2α, and the smallest, IF2γ. We observed that expression of only IF2α isoform can support growth rate similar to the wild-type (WT) strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>), while cells expressing only IF2γ isoform grow slower even at higher expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). For neither of the IF2 isoforms, the addition of HaloTag at the N-terminus altered their functionality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>). The addition of HaloTag has no or only a slight negative effect on IF3 function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>), whereas HaloTag addition noticeably affects the functionality of IF1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). In agreement with these results, it has been previously shown that a dCasRx-IF3 fusion was functional in targeting the ribosomes to specific mRNAs, while a dCasRx-IF1 fusion showed only limited capacity in ribosome targeting <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">We next prepared modified plasmids for single-molecule tracking in a WT genetic background. That is, by introducing a weak SD sequence, we achieved fluorescence labeling of only a few molecules per cell, in a close to unperturbed background. For single-molecule tracking experiments, we employed an approach that we have previously used to track fluorescently labeled 30S and 50S subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Briefly, cells expressing one of the fusion proteins were grown to exponential phase, and then mixed with a chloroalkane-activated JFX549 dye which forms a covalent bond with HaloTag <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. The cells were then extensively washed to remove unbound dye, and finally sparsely placed on agarose pads and grown to mini-colonies at 37 °C. This procedure results in an even distribution of labeled molecules in growing and dividing cells. For each fusion protein, more than 200 mini-colonies were imaged using stroboscopic laser illumination (3 ms) at 5 ms camera exposure times. The microscopy movies were analyzed using a previously developed semi-automatic pipeline that segments cells in the mini-colonies based on phase-contrast images, detects fluorescent dots in each frame, and builds trajectories of diffusing fluorescent molecules from frame to frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In the microscopy experiments we observed on average less than 10 fluorescent molecules per mini-colony. Since HaloTag labeling is very efficient (≥80%) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and there are thousands of non-labeled IFs per cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, we conclude that the total number of each IF does not change significantly due to the labeling approach with leakage-level expression from a plasmid, and hence, that the binding kinetics observed should represent that of an unperturbed <italic>E. coli</italic> cell.</p><p id="P10">In addition to IF tracking, we also performed tracking of fMet-[Cy5]tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. To deliver Cy5-labeled fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> into bacteria we employed our previously established procedure for electroporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. After electroporation, we followed the same protocol for imaging as for the HaloTag-labeled molecules, but with Sytox Blue in the agarose pad. Sytox blue is a dye that selectively stains dead cells, and was included so that cells that did not recover after electroporation could be discarded in the analysis. Imaging was performed on growing mini-colonies with more than 4 cells per colony as an additional precaution to ensure that cells had recovered from electroporation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. The efficiency of the delivery during electroporation varied greatly between mini-colonies, but after dilution by growth, the cells contained only a small fraction of labeled molecules compared with the endogenous levels. Hence, as with the HaloTag-labeled factors, the addition of Cy5-labeled fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> should not significantly affect its total concentration and therefore not perturb the overall translation initiation kinetics.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>HMM analysis of single-molecule trajectories</title><p id="P11">Concentrations of IFs and fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells are linked to the growth rate and the number of ribosomes. Fast-growing bacteria contain roughly equimolar amounts of each factor at ~25 % of the concentration of total ribosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The IFs and fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> are at the same time present in significant excess (2x-3x) over the fraction of ribosomal subunits that are currently involved in translation initiation, i.e., the 10% of total ribosomes that are not actively translating <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Hence, we expected to detect IFs in two main diffusional states: a larger fraction of free molecules diffusing quickly and a smaller ribosome-bound fraction diffusing slower. For all the factors fluorescently labeled using either of the two approaches, we observed the expected diffusional behavior, i.e., random fast diffusion throughout the complete cell cytoplasm, interrupted by slow diffusion events, consistent with usage in translation initiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">5</xref>). In addition to tracking of IFs and fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>, we also included our previously developed HaloTag labeled 30S <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> in the study for comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 6</xref>). To quantify the steady-state molecular distribution between diffusional states and the frequency of transitions between these states, we used a Hidden-Markov-Modelling (HMM) approach that we have previously applied to study binding kinetics of tRNAs, SRP, as well as ribosomal subunits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. In the algorithm, all trajectories are fitted using global maximum-likelihood estimation, to a model with a pre-defined number of hidden diffusional states, where diffusion coefficients and transition frequencies between the diffusional states are used as fitting parameters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In addition, the algorithm accounts for motion blur, localization uncertainty, and potential missing positions in trajectories.</p><p id="P12">The diffusion trajectories of labeled IFs, fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>, as well as 30S subunits, were fitted to models with 1-9 diffusional states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">6</xref>). Tracking of the 30S subunits shows that the ribosomal subunits display a wide range of diffusional rates spanning from ~0.01 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (polysomes) to ~1.3 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (free diffusion), dependent on the translational status of the ribosomes (as shown previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 6</xref>). With an increasing number of HMM-fitted states, we observed a common cluster of diffusional states for each of the IFs and for fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> similar to that of the ribosomes, i.e., between 0.01 and 1.3 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">5</xref>). In addition to this cluster, we also found states with significantly faster diffusion (2-14 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) which were factor-specific and showed a negative correlation with the molecular size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">5</xref>). Based on the assumption that the main function of the IFs in the cell is to mediate translation initiation, we concluded that the first cluster of diffusional states most likely corresponds to factors associated with the ribosomes, while the faster diffusional states correspond to freely diffusing factors. As a control, we also tracked the HaloTag protein itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 7</xref>). Although a fraction of the unfused Halotag proteins showed slow diffusion as well, the occupancy of those states was much lower (&lt;4%) and with no apparent wide distribution of diffusion coefficients consistent with ribosome binding. We hence conclude that HaloTag itself does bind to something slowly diffusing in the cell, giving rise to a small background in our data of HaloTag-labeled components.</p><p id="P13">To investigate ribosome binding kinetics of the factors as model-independent as possible, we coarse-grained the large-state models down to a two-state model (using a threshold of 1.3 μm<sup>2</sup>/s to differentiate ribosome-bound from free factors), and then calculated weighted averages from the models with 6-9 states, as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 8</xref>). With this analysis, we first find that HaloTag-IF1 showed a significantly lower proportion in the presumably ribosome-bound state (~8 %) than other labeled IFs, only marginally higher than what is observed for only HaloTag (~4 % in the slow diffusional state) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">8</xref>). Considering also that HaloTag-IF1 could not completely compensate for the lack of IF1 in our growth assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>), we concluded that HaloTag-IF1 is not sufficiently functional, and we have, therefore, omitted it from further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ribosome binding kinetics of IFs and fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup></title><p id="P14">From the coarse-grained results, we find that the steady-state occupancy of IFs in the presumed ribosome-bound state varies between 22% and 59%, whereas the steady-state fraction of fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> bound to ribosomes is only 6% (in line with previous results <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 8</xref>). Furthermore, based on the frequency of transitions between the slow and the fast diffusion states, we calculated the average dwell-times in the respective states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 8</xref>). We note, however, that the observed bindings might not necessarily correspond only to initiation events, but can be a combination of productive and unproductive bindings. In an attempt to evaluate if a factor binds to the ribosome more than one time per translation cycle, we calculated an average factor cycling time as the sum of the dwell times in the slow and the fast states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, combined duration in the slow and fast diffusion states). The theoretical average time required for one translation cycle for a ribosome can be derived from the average length of all proteins, the average elongation rate, as well as the average time to recycle the ribosomal subunits between translation events. With this calculation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary note</xref>), we estimate that the average translation cycle, from the perspective of the ribosomal subunits, is 10 – 17 s. Further, the average productive cycling time for the ribosomes and factors respectively should be proportional to their relative concentrations. While the tRNA/ribosome ratio can be measured with high precision, around one tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> per four ribosomes under fast growth conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, precise measurement of absolute protein concentrations in the cell is much more challenging and depends on the extraction protocol and quantification method. The metadata on protein abundance levels suggests that the concentrations of IF2 and IF3 are ≈20% and ≈37%, respectively, of that of the ribosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. With these assumptions, we can thus conclude that a cycle time of &lt;2.0 s for IF2, &lt;2.5 s for fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>, and &lt;3.7 s for IF3 would indicate more than one ribosome binding event per translation cycle.</p><p id="P15">We observe that fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> shows the lowest occupancy in the slow state, ~6% (4-9 times lower than for the IFs), as well as the shortest dwell time in the slow state, 180 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">8</xref>). Since fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> dissociates from the ribosome after one elongation cycle, and hence leaves last, these numbers strongly suggest that fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> also arrives at the ribosome last, in agreement with biochemical studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Further, the average cycle time for fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> is ~2.9 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>) which indicates that the majority of the detected binding events are productive.</p><p id="P16">We see that labeled IF2 and IF3 are efficiently and dynamically used by the translation machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">8</xref>).

For HaloTag-IF2, we observe that both isoforms show larger occupancy in the slow state compared to IF3, but interestingly different from each other (46% +/- 1% and 59% +/- 1% for IF2γ and IF2α, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">8</xref>). Despite the fact that both IF2 isoforms show significantly higher occupancy in the slow-diffusion state in comparison with fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>, they display only moderately longer dwell times in the slow state (250 ms and 320 ms, for IF2α and IF2γ, respectively, compared to 180 ms for fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The average cycle time for IF2α and IF2γ is 0.4 s and 0.7 s, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). These numbers are significantly lower than the calculated threshold of 2.0 s above. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that the complex between IF2 and the ribosome is labile, and that IF2 binds to ribosomes more frequently than once per translation event, ≈65% of the detected IF2 bindings are not associated with productive initiation events. For IF3 we observe the longest dwell time in slow diffusion state, 450 ms, with an average cycle time at 2.6 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This indicates that IF3 forms a more stable complex with the ribosome comparing to IF2, with unproductive binding comprising only ≈30%. Hence, our results suggest that IF2 and IF3 have different binding behavior to the ribosome.

On the contrary, for IF2γ, we find that the decrease of fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> concentration caused a 40% decrease in the average dwell time in the ribosome-bound state, suggesting that the complex between IF2γ and the ribosome is not stable without fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">12</xref>).

Similar to the experiments in the <italic>ΔmetZWV</italic> strain, we observed a significant decrease in the slow-diffusion state dwell-time for HaloTag-IF2γ-ΔC2 and a minor decrease for HaloTag-IF2α-ΔC2 in comparison with the non-mutated isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">15</xref>). These results support our finding that fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> binding is essential to stabilize IF2 on the 30S ribosome.</p><p id="P21">Our results from IF2 tracking are in agreement with ensemble kinetics studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> and single-molecule FRET experiments, which suggest that IF2’s interaction with GTP and fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> promotes activation of IF2 and stabilizes its high-affinity conformation on the 30S subunit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Hence, without fast arrival of fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>, IF2 is not able to adopt this active conformation and dissociates from the complex. Quite remarkably, a single mutation, S753Y, renders IF2 to preferentially adopt the active conformation independent of fMet-tRNAfMet <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Single-molecule tracking of both IF2 isoforms containing the S753Y substitution also reveals dramatically altered ribosome binding kinetics, with dwell times in the slow-diffusion state of 1.0 s and 1.4 s for IF2α and IF2γ, respectively, compared to 0.25 s and 0.32 s for the WT factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">17</xref>). We speculate that for these mutants, the dwell time in the bound state likely corresponds to the average time for complete, productive initiation events. We cannot rule out, however, that the mutation also affects the departure of IF2 during 70S complex maturation.</p><p id="P22">To summarize, we find that WT IF2 does not form a stable complex with the ribosome without prompt arrival of fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>. Interestingly, the S753Y mutation, which dramatically extends the ribosome-bound time of IF2, has previously been shown to increase the rate of erroneous translation initiation with elongator tRNA, and is also associated with a reduced fitness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Hence, taken together, these results suggest that stable binding of IF2 to the ribosome serves as an important checkpoint – all involved components must be present and in correct conformation for IF2 to stably bind and allow the process to continue. The extension of the ribosome-bound dwell-time of IF3 at lower fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> concentration, on the other hand, suggests a completely different role of this factor in the regulation of translation initiation fidelity. That is, IF3 maintains 30S in an initiation-competent state, prohibiting 50S joining, until the correct aminoacylated tRNA has arrived. Finally, we observed a noticeable difference in diffusional behavior between the two isoforms of IF2: IF2α showed a larger steady-state fraction in the slow-diffusion state compared to IF2γ, but with a shorter slow-diffusion-state dwell time. The two isoforms also responded differently to the functional mutations. These kinetic discrepancies between the isoforms motivated us to further investigate possible functional differences between the two.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The N-terminal Domain I of IF2α has an alternative binding partner in the cell</title><p id="P23">Compared to IF2γ, the IF2α isoform contains an additional 50 amino-acid long N-terminal compact sub-domain N1, and a flexible linker connecting it to the C-terminal domains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).

Previous studies have suggested that Domain I does not noticeably interact with ribosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Thus, the observed slow-diffusion state might represent binding to an alternative partner with slow diffusion in the cell environment. Analysis of the spatial distribution of Domain I shows different profiles for the fast and slow diffusion states – the fast diffusion state is distributed rather homogeneously throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) whereas the slow state distribution appears to be similar to that of nucleoid-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), such as RNA Polymerase (RNAP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. The slow-state distribution is, hence, also anti-correlated with the overall spatial distribution of the ribosomes which are mainly excluded from the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. When we compare the spatial distribution of the slow-diffusion state of IF2α and IF2γ, we observe a corresponding difference. The spatial distribution of slow-diffusing IF2γ is similar to that of the ribosomes (i.e. for the fast-growing <italic>E. coli</italic> on the poles and in the middle where the new cell poles would appear <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>). The slow-diffusion state of IF2α is more homogeneously distributed, including both the nucleoid and the inter-nucleoid space (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).

On the other hand, IF2 has also been identified to participate in an interaction network that includes transcription factor NusA and RNA polymerase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. However, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been investigated if the link between IF2 and the transcription machinery is direct. Interestingly and related, the IF2 gene, <italic>infB,</italic> is located in an operon between the genes encoding transcription factor NusA and the ribosome biogenesis factor RbfA.</p><p id="P26">While the intracellular diffusion of RNA polymerase and transcription factors has been extensively studied <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, the diffusion of immature ribosomal particles has, to our knowledge, not been investigated. Maturation of the 30S subunits takes ~60 seconds and starts before transcription is completed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Immature 30S are, hence, likely to be tethered to the chromosome through RNA polymerase, at least during the earlier phase before transcription termination (i.e. the first 30 s <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>). If Domain I of IF2α is responsible for factor binding to immature ribosomes, this could explain its spatial distribution in the cell. As an initial naïve test to find the additional binding partner of IF2a, we decided to compare the diffusion behavior of RbfA and NusA with Domain I of IF2. To this end, we performed single-molecule tracking of RbfA-HaloTag and NusA-HaloTag fusions. Based on the results from the HMM analysis, we observe two main diffusive clusters for NusA-HaloTag – a slow-diffusion state with a diffusion coefficient of 0.1 μm<sup>2</sup>/s and a nucleoid-like spatial profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), and a fast-diffusion state at 4.5 μm<sup>2</sup>/s distributed homogeneously in the cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">19</xref>). HaloTag-RbfA, on the other hand, showed a very different diffusional behavior, with two main diffusional states at ~1 μm<sup>2</sup>/s and ~9 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, both distributed homogeneously in the cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">20</xref>). Hence, we conclude that the slow-diffusion state of Domain I and nucleoid-like spatial distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>) is compatible with the hypothesis that Domain I interacts with the transcription machinery but not with maturing ribosomes.</p><p id="P27">As mentioned previously, an interaction between IF2 and NusA has been detected previously. In this large-scale study, the authors used pull-down and mass spectrometry to identify protein-protein interactions in <italic>E. coli</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. We fused a polyhistidine tag to IF2α, IF2γ, and isolated Domain I of IF2, and performed affinity purification of these proteins to investigate if NusA co-elutes with the tagged proteins. The experiment was performed in a strain where the HaloTag gene was fused to NusA on the chromosome to facilitate its detection. Affinity purification of tagged IF2α confirmed that it co-purifies with NusA-HaloTag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). No such interaction was detected for IF2γ, strongly indicating that Domain I is necessary for the interaction. We also conclude that Domain I is sufficient for the interaction since large amounts of NusA-HaloTag were co-purified during affinity chromatography of Domain I alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). No interaction was detected between HaloTag alone and either of the IF2 isoforms or Domain I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p id="P28">The pull-down experiment shows that Domain I of IF2 indeed interacts with NusA. However, it does not exclude the possibility that the interaction is indirect. To further evaluate the interaction, we first used Alphafold 3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup> to predict a structure of the possible complex between Domain I of IF2 and NusA. The Alphafold prediction suggests that the interactions are predominantly mediated by the N1 structural domain (1-50 aa) and the following sequence forming two β-strands (57-90 aa) on IF2, and the C-terminal part including domains KH2 and AR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>) on NusA. We then used the orthogonal photo-crosslinkable amino acid benzoyl-phenylalanine (pBpa) to investigate if Domain I of IF2 directly interacts with NusA in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. For this, we constructed different mutants of IF2 Domain I in which the pBPA amino acid was incorporated in several positions (amino acids 13, 59, and 88) predicted from the Alphafold structure to be in close proximity with NusA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). The IF2 Domain I mutants were then expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> harboring a chromosomal NusA-HaloTag, and crosslinks were induced by UV illumination. For each selected Domain I position, we observed cross-linking to NusA-HaloTag, providing evidence that Domain I of IF2 interacts with NusA in the cell directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p><p id="P29">The Alphafold model predicted that the interaction with IF2 is mediated by the domains KH2 and AR1 of NusA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The C-terminal fragment of NusA that includes the AR1 and AR2 domains is not essential for cell viability and can be deleted <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. This allowed us to validate our finding by investigating the diffusional behavior of the IF2 Domain I in the absence of its potential corresponding interaction domain on NusA. Hence, we tracked IF2 Domain I in cells with the C-terminal fragment of NusA deleted from the chromosome and the results were striking. The short nucleoid-associated bindings that were detected in the WT strain virtually disappeared in the strain expressing truncated NusA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). On the other hand, if full-length NusA was expressed from an inducible plasmid in cells with the chromosomally mutated NusA gene, the diffusional pattern was restored and the Domain I occupancy in the slow diffusion state even exceeded the level in the WT strain when production of full-length NusA was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Hence, we conclude that IF2 and NusA interact with each other via their N-terminal and C-terminal domain, respectively. Interestingly, we observe similar diffusion coefficients for IF2 Domain I and NusA in the free diffusional state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 8</xref>), suggesting that IF2α and NusA might establish their interaction in the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Effect of IF2 Domain I deletion on cell growth</title><p id="P30">Previous studies have shown that the presence of all IF2 isoforms is required for fast <italic>E. coli</italic> growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.

To further study the effect of the different IF2 isoforms, we created a strain with a chromosomal deletion of the gene fragment corresponding to the IF2 Domain I (ΔIF2-Domain-I). Hence, in this strain IF2α is absent, but both of the shorter isoforms, IF2β and IF2γ, can be expressed. The growth defect associated with the lack of IF2 Domain I was moderate in rich LB (18% slower) and minimal media M9 supplemented with 0.4% glucose as a carbon source (15% slower), but more pronounced in M9 supplemented with 0.4% succinate (41% slower) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the mutant strain needs longer time to adapt to the new environment after a change of growth media, i.e., a prolonged lag phase during adaptation to the new environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b, c</xref>). Both WT and the ΔIF2-Domain-I strain that were grown overnight in either M9-glucose or M9-succinate (“adapted” strains) were able to quickly resume growth when diluted in fresh media of the same type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b, c</xref>, yellow and blue curves). When the strains were grown in rich LB media (“unadapted” strains), a clear extension of the lag phase was shown when the cultures were diluted into M9-glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>) or M9-succinate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>, orange and purple curves). However, the lag phase after the media change was significantly longer for the ΔIF2-Domain-I strain than for the WT strain, particularly in M9-succinate (10 hours). The lag phase is the most poorly understood stage of bacterial growth but is critical for bacterial fitness in a changing environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>.

In the cell environment, however, these processes are tightly coordinated, connected, and highly organized to achieve optimal speed, fidelity, usage of the available resources, and adaptability to a changing environment. A comprehensive understanding of biology on the molecular level, hence, requires the development of methods that can capture this additional layer of complexity directly in living cells. Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy in live cells is a unique approach that can complement the extensive knowledge collected from reconstituted in vitro systems, and expand our understanding of how key macromolecular complexes function in the crowded and interconnected cell environment.</p><p id="P32">We have previously applied our single-molecule-tracking approach to study the kinetics of translation by directly following the movement of initiator and elongator tRNAs, as well as ribosomal subunits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. In this study, we were able to capture diffusional dynamics of IF2 and IF3 in live <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Analysis of ribosome binding kinetics of IFs and fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> reveal that the initiator tRNA is the last to bind to the ribosome during translation initiation in agreement with in vitro studies in bulk. We furthermore observe that IF2, the main factor facilitating the binding of fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>, does not form a stable complex with the ribosome prior to arrival of fMet-tRNA<sup>fMet</sup>. Such transient complex formation likely helps to tune the accuracy of translation initiation, given that a single point mutation, which renders IF2 to bind ribosomes with higher affinity, is associated with a decrease in accuracy of initiation and compromised fitness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. We note, that both IF2α and IF2γ isoforms show such behavior, but our conclusions are based primarily on results with IF2γ, due to the fact that IF2α binds not only the ribosome but also the transcription machinery.

Our work establishes that the N-terminal Domain I, present only in the IF2α isoform, is responsible for binding to the C-terminus of NusA, a multifunctional transcription factor. NusA, together with the universally conserved transcription factor NusG, has previously been shown to bind both the RNAP and the ribosome, providing a physical link for transcription-translation coupling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>.

However, several studies have shown that the transcription machinery can assist in translation initiation and thus stimulate an early establishment of coupling, with the prominent example of RfaH, a specialized paralog of NusG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>. However, RfaH is present in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells at very low concentration, and regulates expression of only a small subset of operons.

Available Cryo-EM structures of coupled RNAP and ribosomes which include NusA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> show that the two machineries are oriented in a way compatible with IF2 binding to both the ribosome and NusA, if one considers that the IF2 Domain I is connected to the C-terminal part of IF2 via a long flexible linker <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> and that the coupled complex has a dynamic interface in the absence of NusG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p id="P34">One of the most prominent roles of NusA in RNAP regulation is to stimulate hairpin-stabilized transcription pauses and termination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>.
