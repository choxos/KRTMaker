However, information in more complex samples, such as tissues, is lacking. Importantly, these observations need to be set in context of populations; imaging on the molecular scale to-date is limited to few observations <italic>in-situ</italic> that struggle to be generalised. This is due to limitations in throughput and versatility employed by current instrumentation. Here, we utilise plasma focused ion beam milling to examine the molecular landscape of mouse hippocampus by cryoET in targeted regions across multiple individuals revealing the complex organisation of macromolecules from the CA1 strata pyramidale (sp) to radiatum (sr). Our data represent a molecular atlas, producing snapshots of hippocampal architecture in adult mouse. The combination of instrumentation and application of technical advancements provides a framework to explore specific structural questions within native tissues in a targeted manner.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Within the brain, a myriad of molecular interactions are responsible for maintaining cellular connectivity, homeostasis and maintenance. Characterising the molecular and cellular organisation of molecules within the context of brain tissue could unlock fundamental mechanistic insight into a range of processes, with consequences for our understanding of health and disease. Structures of proteins, complexes, and other macromolecules have enabled us to understand the molecular underpinning of many processes. Very few approaches exist that enable a molecular assessment of macromolecules in the native context of an intact brain, including within biopsies. Routine tissue analysis remains challenging, particularly when investigating molecular aspects across multiple subjects to understand disease-related genotype-phenotype relationships. Tools that bridge the gap between structure, function and cellular dysfunction are needed.</p><p id="P3">To investigate molecules in context, the vitrification state is crucial as biological molecules require hydration to remain in a folded, functional state. Provided this requirement is met, it is now possible to visualise cellular architecture and determine the structures of macromolecules to sub-nanometre resolution by sub-volume averaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Tissues present a particular challenge as biopsy section thickness is ~1000 fold greater than the 200-300 nm sectioning required to create electron transparent regions suitable for imaging on the molecular scale via cryo-electron tomography (cryoET). Cryo-ultramicrotomy (CEMOVIS) can be used to section ribbons of tissue down to 40 nm in thickness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> but suffers from multiple artefacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> obfuscating detail. Cryo-focused ion beam (FIB) milling is now routinely used for creating thin lamellae of cellular samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> however conventional traditional liquid metal ion source (LMIS) FIBs are limited in sputter yield but have been demonstrated to work with cryo lift-out of samples ~ 50 μm depth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Therefore, for tissue samples, where thickness is typically ≥ 100 μm, larger volumes of material need to be removed to fabricate lamellae. Alternatively, plasma focused ion beams (PFIB) have recently been utilised for cryogenic life science samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, both for volume electron microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and lamellae fabrication, allowing for high-resolution sub-tomogram averaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The increased sputter yield of xenon plasma allows for excavation of large volumes, necessary for lamellae fabrication in thick specimens in a shorter time frame<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Lamellae fabrication from samples high-pressure frozen directly onto electron microscopy grids has been demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. For tissues, however, this results in compression of material during high pressure freezing (HPF), deforming morphological features within the native tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Alternatively, cryo-lift-out has been demonstrated to generate spatially related lamellae across entire organisms and multicellular samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> though due to the use of LMIS, this is still limited to depths of sample 30–50 μm thick. As methods to section tissues can cause physical damage to cells near the surface of the tissue section, increasing the depth at which tissues can be excised for structural biology approaches will increase its effectiveness at investigating regions of interest on the molecular scale.</p><p id="P5">Here we demonstrate the ability to robustly vitrify mouse brain tissue within three hours postmortem for structural characterisation by cryoET. Utilising the well-characterised global morphology of the mouse hippocampus to map each layer using cryo-fluorescence microscopy, we have adapted a PFIB milling and cryo lift-out strategy to image specific sub-regions of the CA1 region of the hippocampus from samples frozen in HPF carriers up to 200 μm thick. This enabled features, particularly synapses and the apical dendrite network, to be characterised within this layer by cryoET. We demonstrate this using biopsies from several mice and by sampling multiple regions within the brain, exemplifying the potential to investigate targeted structural biological questions across cohorts. We further demonstrate its versatility by incorporating different sample geometries, using a planar lift-out to generate serial sections and lamella spanning from the CA1 strata pyramidale through radiatum, maintaining spatial information on the molecular scale. This illustrates the capacity to apply high-throughput lamellae fabrication and cryo-ET analysis to characterise the molecular landscape within tissues. The basis of this work forms a framework for the future investigation of the molecular organisation crucial to disease, not just of the brain, across multiple individuals.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Extraction of brain tissue from high pressure freezing carriers</title><p id="P6">One of the main challenges of producing tissue samples for cryoET imaging is to manipulate and thin vitrified biopsies (~200 μm) to electron transparent sections (~200 nm) in a timely manner, without altering their structure. We were able to develop two routines, “perpendicular” and “planar”, enabling different geometries for lift out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a). This used an adapted cryo-lift-out<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> approach to shape and extract regions preserving the hydrated state of the sample using HPF. Prior to HPF, mouse hemibrains (~6 months of age) were sectioned to 100-200 μm in thickness using a vibratome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). Subsequently, sub-regions of hippocampus could be targeted and correlated using micron-scale fluorescence microscopy to nanometre-scale imaging by cryo electron tomography (cryoET) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To excise regions of interest we used PFIB milling, which enables greater sputter yields. This is essential as extensive trench preparation and undercuts are required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 1</xref>). For a desired perpendicular lift length of ~60-70 μm, 10-14 sections could be deposited with time taken for the various steps outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Extended Data Table 2</xref>. For planar geometries, the trench milling, and undercuts are larger due to the increased size and orientation, increasing the amount of time needed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). For this work, 26 lift-outs were extracted resulting in 186 serial sections being deposited. Of these, 170 were retained (91.4%) upon transfer between microscopes for lamellae fabrication.</p><p id="P8">After deposition, serial sections were subsequently thinned to electron transparency using a combination of xenon plasma (to around ~ 400 - 600 nm) and manually polishing with argon plasma. This hybrid approach was used as xenon has a milling rate 3-4 times greater than argon, reducing milling time for bulk removal of material before polishing with the finer argon beam<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Resulting lamella reached thicknesses comparable to those obtained for cellular lamella and had contrast transfer functions which could be accurately fit to sub nanometre resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Brain tissue vitrification</title><p id="P9">To adequately carry out cryoET and structural studies in any environment, the sample needs to be maintained in an amorphous, frozen-hydrated state. Furthermore, the tissue needs to be maintained with minimal cell death and preserved without compression during high pressure freezing and in buffer conditions that lead to as little necrosis and morphological disturbance as possible. We could therefore investigate the optimal conditions for vitrification of mouse cortex and hippocampal sections.</p><p id="P10">We assessed the vitrification of mouse brain slices under different conditions, such as tissue thickness, cryoprotectant, and incubation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). Vitrification was assessed based on the visibility of non-vitreous ice in transmission electron microscope (TEM) overview images of lamella, ice diffraction in TEM images, and distortion of membranes. We assessed 18 conditions through this approach and were able to determine several conditions where vitreous samples could be obtained. Importantly, several conditions led to partially vitrified preparations where the nature of the non-vitreous state could only be visualized through reflections in certain images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 3</xref>). Conditions that produced the most robust vitrification were incubated for at least 15 minutes with combinations of cryoprotectants of at least 10% low molecular weight (here, sucrose MW = 0.34 kDa or ethylene glycol, MW = 0.062 kDa) and higher molecular weight (e.g. dextran, MW = 40 kDa) components. Cryoprotectants containing only large MW components such as dextran or BSA (molecular weight 66.5 kDa) were insufficient to yield vitrified tissue, where samples exhibited either dehydration artefacts, such as distorted membranes, or contained reflections in tilt images at different angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 3b</xref>). Tilt series for subsequent analysis were only acquired in lamellae where we did not observe any of these features.</p><p id="P11">Within vitrified sections of mouse cortex, we were able to observe common cellular and brain-specific features. These included myelin, synaptic vesicles, mitochondria, membranes, ribosomes, microtubules, and open space outside of membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, the substantial spaces between cells contrasts with chemically fixed tissues, where a large portion of the extracellular space is lost due to fixation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Hippocampal layer targeting using cryo-CLEM</title><p id="P12">Using the known architecture of mouse hippocampus, we targeted the CA1 strata pyramidale (CA1-sp) and radiatum (CA1-sr) by mapping the location of large, neuronal, cell bodies with live-cell nuclear stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b, c</xref>). Cryo-confocal microscopy overviews (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>) enabled orientation information to be acquired prior to fluorescence mapping in the FIB/SEM chamber. Additionally, the slice integrity post-freezing and presence of a wide enough range of hippocampal features could be assessed for accurate downstream targeting. The orientation information was subsequently used for positioning the carrier for milling and correlation of fluorescence with the integrated fluorescence microscope (IFM) for targeted lift-out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). To map the cellular organisation of the entire tissue section, we acquired fluorescence tilesets that spanned the entire 2 mm by 2 mm carrier. With a 20x fluorescence objective, these tilesets could be acquired in as little as 20 minutes for one fluorophore depending on the desired number of Z steps (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Extended Data Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We initially targeted, lifted-out, sectioned, and thinned regions of tissue containing fluorescently labelled cell bodies from the CA1-sp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figure 5</xref>), as this enabled us to validate our approach for fluorescent targets. Individual nuclei, including regions of heterochromatin and euchromatin, could be identified within the cryo-fluorescence data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figure 5a, c</xref>). Retention of fluorescent targets could be monitored at all stages, from initial carrier overviews and Z stacks through to the final thinned lamella to aid in targeted tilt series acquisition in the TEM. In this hippocampal layer, we were able to collect tilt series where most of the field of view was ribosomes along with tomograms containing mitochondria and vesicles, in line with features expected of and near cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figure 5</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Beyond the stratum pyramidale, we were also able to target sublayers that were largely devoid of fluorescence using the established morphology of mouse hippocampus. In this case, we selected the CA1-sr. This layer is known to be rich in synaptic connections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and can be targeted via proximity to the CA1-sp, which was readily identified when the CA3 stratum pyramidale and the dentate gyrus were present in sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). For targeting the CA1-sr, we first considered the positioning of the underlying dentate gyrus, the CA1 stratum lacunosum molecular (CA1-slm), and measured the thickness of the overlying CA1-sp nuclei (~50 um). We targeted 50-150 μm below the CA1-sp nuclei for our CA1-sr lift-outs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P15">From this sublayer, we collected six datasets originating from 2 mice, one male and one female, totalling 359 tilt series (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Extended Data Table 3</xref>). In contrast to the CA1-sp datasets, we did not observe large numbers of ribosomes. As specific mechanisms exist to keep ribosomes localised to cell bodies, rather than migrating along neuronal processes, this is consistent with characteristics expected of the CA1-sr. Instead, we observed cellular features more typically observed in neuronal processes. These included mitochondria with (13/359, or 4%) and without (119/359, or 33%) granular deposits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, cytoskeletal elements like microtubules (302/359, or 84%) and thinner filaments including actin (114/359, or 32%) in dendrites and other processes, small clusters of 1-20 ribosomes (60/359, or 17%), processes with vesicles (311/359, or 87%), and synapses (56/359, between 3-30% of tomograms collected from each dataset) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Extended Data Table 3</xref>). In our CA1-sr data we found abundant synapses where cell adhesion molecules and inter-membrane interactions could be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Synapse Organization within the CA1-sr</title><p id="P16">Synapses could be identified by their canonical organisation. This consisted of a presynapse, containing vesicles, and in some cases mitochondria, inside an enclosed membrane that widened ending with a cleft. This cleft contains multiple putative adhesion molecules spanning it. Finally, at the other side of the cleft is a postsynapse where the widened compartment narrows. Various subcellular organelles and molecular features could be visualised within the post-synaptic compartment. Of note, actin filaments and post-synaptic membrane densities could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Within the presynapse, synaptic vesicles appeared spherical and could be further rendered in segmentations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Synaptic vesicles had a mean diameter of 45.4 ± 2.2 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Figure 8</xref>), consistent with previously reported values for cryogenically preserved synaptic vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and larger than vesicles in resin embedded synapses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we were able to observe the process of synaptic vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane in some instances of our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), evidencing synaptic activity occurring at the time of high pressure freezing. These events were somewhat rare and were noted in 8 out of 107 total synapses across all datasets. Indeed, the process of synaptic vesicle fusion is a fast process (~ 100 μs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>) with respect to high pressure freezing (~ 50 ms). In the examples we acquired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), the synaptic vesicle first forms tethers with the presynaptic membrane, often in proximity to apparent tethering densities that could be recruitment molecules such as Munc13-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Besides the presynaptic vesicles, we could also occasionally identify large dense core vesicles on the presynaptic side, which could be identified by their large size and electron dense interior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The synaptic cleft could be identified as two closely mated membranes, approximately 20-30 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> apart with cell adhesion molecules spanning the cleft. The relative populations of molecules on the pre- and postsynaptic membranes could often be different, with molecules on the postsynaptic face not being in contact with molecules on the presynapse, i.e. in some instances, we see these densities continue beyond where the membranes are in contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In the postsynaptic compartment, we were often able to observe actin filaments. Likewise, we found small clusters of ribosomes only on the postsynaptic side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7</xref>), which is consistent with ribosomes being more common in dendrites but not axons. In some tomograms, we could identify a region near the membrane that appears more electron dense, indicative of a putative post synaptic density (PSD). However, importantly, these could not always be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Assessment of the molecular organisation of tissue from the CA1 strata pyramidale to radiatum</title><p id="P19">One benefit of serial lift-out is that semi-continuous sampling offers insights into structural changes of proximal regions across an organism or sample. By utilising the faster milling rate of the PFIB, a greater amount of material can be removed in a shorter time frame allowing for unique geometries of complex samples to be achieved. When observed from different perspectives, previously unseen aspects of the neuronal organisation can be revealed. To complement our existing data, we developed a strategy to investigate morphological features of the CA1-sr that run within the plane of the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Figure 10</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Using cryo-lift-out, we excised regions that span the transition zone from CA1-sp to CA1-sr to investigate how constituents identified in our samples isolated using the perpendicular approach change with respect to position from sp to sr. To sample across layers of hippocampus, we performed a planar lift out that spanned CA1-stratum oriens (CA1-so) to lacunosum moleculare (CA1-slm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). By mapping the layers of hippocampus using cryo-CLEM as outlined above, a region containing multiple layers of hippocampus was identified and trenches milled using 200 nA Xe around the region of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b-c</xref>). The regions lifted out were 350 and 390 μm in length yielding 40 and 42 sections amenable to thinning of 5 μm thickness, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d-e</xref>). Serial sections from one of these planar lift-outs were taken forward for lamellae fabrication, where 39 lamellae were thinned from a single, continuous lift out and transferred to the TEM for tilt series acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4g-h</xref>). From 13 imaged lamellae, 246 tomograms were generated spanning a 150 μm region directly below the CA1-sp.</p><p id="P21">From these data, the cellular composition across the CA1-sr was characterised. Within cells, typical cellular features were identified at each distance across the serial lift out. Features observed include both in plane and perpendicular microtubules (221/246 or 90%), and thinner filaments including actin (75/246 or 30%) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (38/246 or 15%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4j</xref>).</p><p id="P22">By manipulating the milling geometry and isolating a tissue sample from within the plane of the sample, we could observe CA1 apical dendrites from an axial perspective (25/246) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4j</xref>). Dendrites can be readily identified from TEM search images due to the round plasma membrane and dense arrangement of microtubules within (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4h, i</xref>). From this angle, organisation of the dendritic cytoskeleton containing axial microtubules, actin/filamentous networks, and smooth ER could be investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4j</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In contrast, perpendicular lift outs in the same region of CA1-sr did not yield many apical dendrite cross sections where head on views of microtubules and actin could be found (1/359), but instead favoured an orientation with side-views of dendrites where groups of microtubules could be found traversing the field of view (10/359) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Figure 6b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Analysis of the apical dendrite cytoskeleton network from planar lift out</title><p id="P23">A representative segmentation depicting the axial view of a dendrite illustrates the main cellular components observed across 26 tomograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The most ubiquitous features were axial microtubules, extruded endoplasmic reticulum, and bundles of actin filaments, found in every tomogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b-d</xref> respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Data Figure 10a</xref>). The number of microtubules observed across the dataset was interrogated in relation to their distance from the CA1-so, ranging from 4-34 per tomogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Figure 10b</xref>). Globally, interfilament distances exhibited a gaussian distribution where nearest neighbours had a mean value of 57.7nm and a median of 54.0 nm (n=481) and exhibited no significant difference as a function of distance across the region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Extended Figure 10c-d</xref>). This suggests no trends are evident in microtubule organisation across the regions analysed.</p><p id="P24">Microtubules of both 13 pf and 14 pf could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a-b</xref>) and had incomplete ends in 3% (15/481) of filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Figure 8a</xref>). Density was also visible within the lumenal space, with additional density connecting lumenal particles and the inner microtubule wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e-f</xref>). Interestingly, bridging densities can be seen between microtubules in proximity, suggesting that at least some microtubules are bundled/cross linked by putative protein tethers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5g</xref>).

Notably, this did not require genetically modified animals with fluorescently encoded tags or injection of material, illustrating that with judicious generic labelling, a diverse range of experimental setups and animal models of varying genetic background can be assessed. This can be applied equally with tissues other than brain.

Vitrification of tissues is non trivial, and no thorough assessment of high pressure freezing of tissue exists that demonstrates high quality, vitreous, sample preparation. Therefore, we started from combinations of cryoprotectants that had previously resulted in vitrification of thick specimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> while also maintaining tissue health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. We incorporated three buffers – phosphate buffer, artificial CSF and an NMDG-substituted artificial CSF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> – into our cryoprotectant formulation demonstrating that vitrification can be achieved without removal of maintenance media (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>). Illustrating the benefit of proper vitrification, our tomograms from vitrified brain tissue contained more open, extracellular space compared to fixed tissue. Similar observations have also been made for tissue that has undergone cryo fixation compared to chemical fixation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Ultimately, this avoids non-native changes in morphology, allowing an investigation of more subtle ultrastructural changes that could underpin developmental or disease mechanisms.</p><p id="P28">Importantly, in the present work hippocampal slices were maintained at 4°C as samples were prepared. While the time taken for slices to be HPF was 1-4 hours, slices maintained in such a way are viable in organotypic experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. We did not detect any variation in synaptic vesicle size as a function of post-mortem interval. Nevertheless, the process of HPF and vibratome sectioning will need to be improved in the future for near-pristine preservation from dissection to vitrification be achieved.</p><p id="P29">Previous work has used high-pressure freezing to generate brain samples for cryo-lift out or FIB milling but are limited to either i) very few (&lt; N=2) examples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> or ii) approaches where only very thin specimens can be frozen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In the former case, there was no assessment of the vitrification while in the latter case, where tissue is frozen “on-grid”, the large forces the brain is exposed to can lead to disruption of tissues during the freezing process, limiting application. In the present study, the method of freezing allows viable tissue slices to be frozen in a format where samples are protected from compression during freezing.</p><p id="P30">Crucially, the strength is the ability to image molecules within the hippocampus. In our data, we were able to visualise multiple regions and sub-cellular structures. As a focus, we aimed to image in the CA1-sr; in this region of the hippocampus, there is a high degree of pyramidal cells and mossy fibers forming synaptic circuits with neurons emanating from the CA1-sp. Our data are consistent with this, as our data mostly exclude myelin but include multiple examples of active synaptic boutons. The organisation of synaptic contacts within our data show many synaptic vesicles, including membrane fusing with the presynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In some instances, individual synaptic cleft proteins could be visualised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). As synapses are larger than the mean free path of an electron (~ 300 nm), it is not possible to obtain whole synapses within a tomogram, however, the ability to visualise molecules in the synaptic cleft gives indications of the molecular diversity in the synapse.</p><p id="P31">For our measurements of synaptic vesicles, we used four metrics: diameter, calculated sphere volume from the measured diameter, volume calculated from a convex hull of the segmentation, and sphericity based on the points in the convex hull. For diameter, a large range of vesicle sizes were found, ranging from 41.2 - 51.2 nm as an average per tomogram. We did not find any relationship between vesicle diameter and the sex of the mouse, cryo protectant and buffer composition, post-mortem interval before vitrification, or the day tilt series were collected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Figure 8g</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Extended Data Table 3</xref>). For volume calculated from a convex hull, the missing wedge will obscure the tops and bottoms of vesicles, causing vesicles to have smaller volumes and have lower measures of sphericity.</p><p id="P32">The ability to extract tissue samples in a variety of orientations allows for lamellae to be fabricated with views previously unobtainable through conventional cellular cryoET experiments. By imaging features from multiple angles, detrimental artefacts arising from the “missing wedge” in Fourier space can be reduced. Furthermore, as the hippocampus is a differentiated tissue, cell populations exist in an organised fashion, where features of interest exist in specific planes. In the present case, dendrites originating from CA1-sp run parallel to one another, traversing our sample plane in the CA1-sr. By lifting out a section of tissue in the plane of the sample, previously inaccessible views of the CA1-sp apical dendrite cytoskeletal network could be imaged in vitrified samples. By preserving the native, hydrated state of the dendrite, fine molecular details that are obfuscated by chemical fixation could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). As we integrate multi-scale correlation, the spatial relationship of sub-layers within the tissue with respect to the bulk sample can be maintained and tracked between sequentially deposited sections. Tissue composition, such as cell and synapse types, have been shown to vary from regions of CA1-sr more proximal to CA1-sp to more distal regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. The ability to sample every 5-10 μm facilitates investigation of the subtle changes in molecular composition within and between layers.</p><p id="P33">In summary, our paper demonstrates a robust, flexible strategy for the preparation of frozen-hydrated, natively preserved (brain) tissue. Importantly, scaling structural biology to tissues requires techniques that can generate enough samples, in a targeted way, that allows a pool of 3-dimensional datasets from cohorts of individuals. This requires reproducibility, high success and feasible timeframes. We were able to generate 10s of tissue chunks per day from individual slices, which incorporate large-scale mapping from micron to nanometre scale. Our data demonstrate pristinely preserved molecular information, allowing an analysis of molecular context within brain structures. This lays a framework for the routine assessment of tissue samples in the future, where specific features relating to pathology may be correlated and assessed on a molecular scale.</p><p id="P34">Crucially, this allows an assessment from different samples on the order of days, potentially enabling targeted clinical observations at a significant scale.
