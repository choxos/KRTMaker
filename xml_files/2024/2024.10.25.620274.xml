However, these TCR-T cells can cross-react with off-target peptides, leading to severe autoimmune toxicities. Current efforts focus on identifying TCRs with reduced cross-reactivity. Here, we show that T cell cross-reactivity can be controlled by the co-signalling molecules CD5, CD8, and CD4, without modifying the TCR. We find the largest reduction in cytotoxic T cell cross-reactivity by knocking out CD8 and expressing CD4. Cytotoxic T cells engineered with a CD8-to-CD4 co-receptor switch show reduced cross-reactivity to random and positional scanning peptide libraries, as well as to self-peptides, while maintaining their on-target potency. Therefore, co-receptor switching generates super selective T cells that reduce the risk of lethal off-target cross-reactivity, and offers a universal method to enhance the safety of T cell immunotherapies for any TCR.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F6" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS199770-f006"/></fig>

This therapeutic strategy enables targeting nearly all tumour antigens, including tumour specific developmental antigens and neo-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). However, the engineered T cells can cross-react with off-target peptides in healthy tissues and cause fatal autoimmune toxicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). This cross-reactivity has hampered efforts to produce highly potent TCR-T cell therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Identifying the potential off-target cross-reactivities of TCRs before first-in-human clinical trials is challenging due to the lack of animal models or cell lines that represent the entire human proteome and HLA allele diversity. Indeed, the clinical a3a TCR targeting the cancer-testis antigen MAGE-A3 passed safety screens but ultimately cross-reacted with a lower affinity off-target peptide from the cardiac protein Titin, causing the death of two patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). As a result, efforts are underway to establish pipelines to identify effective yet safe TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Typically, these methods screen TCRs with different complementary determining regions (CDRs) for their ability to recognise the on-target tumour but not off-target self pMHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). In addition to screening methods, it has also been proposed that modifying the CDR loops to reduce their flexibility or introduce catch bonds may generally increase TCR specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). However, these strategies that rely on mutating the TCR sequence to reduce cross-reactivity require prior knowledge of the self antigen that causes lethal cross-reactivity and modifying the TCR sequence to reduce cross-reactivity to one antigen may result in new cross-reactivities to other self antigens. Collectively, this makes it challenging and costly to screen and optimise each new candidate therapeutic TCR.</p><p id="P5">Instead of modifying the TCR CDR loops to reduce binding cross-reactivity, we hypothesised that functional cross-reactivity can be reduced by manipulating T cell signalling without modifying the TCR. In this way, even though the TCR can bind a large number peptides, T cells would only become activated in response to the few peptides that bind with high affinity. Put differently, we suggest that enhancing the ability of T cells to discriminate antigens based on their affinity would reduce their functional cross-reactivity. Given that co-signalling receptors on the T cell surface are known to impact TCR signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), we reasoned that they impact T cell cross-reactivity.</p><p id="P6">Here, we established a platform to quantify the impact of co-signalling receptors on T cell ligand discrimination. While a knockout of the surface molecule CD5 decreased antigen discrimination, we found that a knockout of CD8 or expression of CD4 increased it. The largest effect was observed by combining CD8 knockout and CD4 expression (’co-receptor switch’). We demonstrate that a CD8→CD4 co-receptor switch dramatically reduced T cell cross-reactivity to peptide libraries and self peptides. Overall, co-receptor switching is a broadly applicable strategy to produce super selective T cells that minimise the risk of lethal cross-reactivities without compromising on-target potency, and can be applied to any TCR.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>T cell co-signalling receptors differentially modulate ligand sensitivity and discrimination</title><p id="P7">We established a platform to quantify the contribution of different T cell co-signalling receptors to ligand discrimination. We selected the NY-ESO-1 specific c259 TCR contained in the investigational TCR-T therapy lete-cel as a model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). First, we measured the binding affinity of the c259 TCR to a panel of 7 NY-ESO-1 peptide variants on HLA-A*02:01 by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Second, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock-out out five co-signalling receptors in primary human T cells expressing the c259 TCR that were previously suggested to impact ligand discrimination: CD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), CD5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), CD43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), CD2 and LFA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Third, we co-cultured these T cells with antigen-presenting-cells (APCs) pulsed with a titration of each of the 7 peptides with different affinities to the TCR and assessed their ability to induce multiple measures of T cell activation (target cell killing, IFN<italic>γ</italic> secretion, and 4-1BB upregulation). Finally, we quantified pMHC potency as the concentration of peptide required to elicit 15% activation (P15) from WT or KO T cells. By plotting the fold-change in potency (ΔP15) over affinity we could determine whether the co-sigalling molecule was selectively decreasing activation to lower-affinity ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We achieved high knockout efficiency of each co-signalling receptor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>) enabling assessment of their impact on ligand discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2-4</xref>). The knock-out of CD43 had no impact on activation whereas the knock-out of CD2 or LFA-1 individually or in combination reduced activation for all pMHC affinities to a similar extent and therefore, these molecules do not impact ligand discrimination. In contrast, a knock-out of CD5 selectively improved activation against lower affinity ligands and therefore, CD5 KO reduced ligand discrimination. The knockout of CD8 selectively reduced activation to lower affinity peptides without impacting the higher-affinity NY-ESO-1 target antigen and therefore, CD8 KO increases ligand discrimination. Since the c259 TCR is affinity-matured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), we confirmed that CD8 KO also increased the discrimination of the parental wild-type 1G4 TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). Taken together, co-signalling molecules can control TCR ligand discrimination and a CD8 KO in particular can selectively reduce activation to lower affinity ligands without impacting potency to the higher-affinity on-target antigen.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>CD8 knock-out abolishes therapeutic a3a TCR cross-reactivity to Titin</title><p id="P9">T cells engineered with the MAGE-A3 specific a3a TCR caused lethal cardiac toxicities in a clinical trial due to cross-reactivity to a lower affinity peptide from the muscle protein Titin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Since we have demonstrated that the CD8 co-receptor can decrease T cell ligand discrimination, we decided to investigate whether the cross-reactivity to Titin was CD8 dependent.</p><p id="P10">Given that TCR-T therapies rely on expressing the therapeutic MHC-I restricted TCR in both CD8+ cytotoxic and CD4+ helper T cells, we first examined their individual abilities to react to each antigen. Whilst both cytotoxic and helper T cells responded to the on-target MAGE-A3 antigen, only cytotoxic T cells responded to the off-target Titin antigen confirming that cytotoxic T cells are the likely source of autoimmune toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>). By knocking out CD8 in cytotoxic cells we abolish activation against Titin without impacting responses to the higher-affinity on-target antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C-D</xref>). The CD8 KO also abolished the activation of T cells against Nalm6 cells that endogenously express Titin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Helper T cells display enhanced discrimination against pMHC-I antigens due to their incompatible CD4 co-receptor</title><p id="P11">The observation that CD4+ helper T cells only responded to the higher-affinity MAGE-A3 antigen whereas CD8+ cytotoxic T cells also responded to the lower-affinity Titin antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-B</xref>) suggested that helper T cells may have a different capacity to discriminate ligands.</p><p id="P12">We compared ligand discrimination in helper vs cytotoxic T cells using the NY-ESO-1 c259 TCR plat-form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Consistent with the a3a TCR, we found that cytotoxic T cells activated more strongly against low affinity pMHCs than helper T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-C</xref>). Interestingly, helper T cells displayed even higher discrimination than CD8 KO cytotoxic T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The degree to which T cells are able to respond to lower-affinity antigens is partly determined by a kinetic proofreading mechanism that introduces a time-delay between pMHC binding and TCR signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). This time-delay is thought to be determined by biochemical steps that follow pMHC binding, including phosphorylation of ITAMs and ZAP70 by Lck, ZAP70 auto-phosphorylation, and the bridging of ZAP-70 and LAT by Lck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). By fitting the proofreading model directly to the potency over pMHC affinity data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>), we confirmed that the time-delay for helper T cells is even larger than CD8 KO cytotoxic T cells. Thus, high levels of ligand discrimination for helper T cells cannot be explained simply by the absence of CD8 co-receptor alone.</p><p id="P14">Helper T cells express the CD4 co-receptor that like CD8 has an intracellular association with Lck, but unlike CD8 cannot bind the MHC-I antigens targeted by the c259 TCR. We hypothesised that the presence of the incompatible CD4 co-receptor could be responsible for the enhanced discrimination of helper T cells. Indeed, CD4 KO helper T cells displayed improved activation to lower affinity peptides, reducing ligand discrimination compared to wild-type helper T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F-I</xref>). Therefore, the incompatible CD4 co-receptor increases the ligand discrimination of helper T cells targeting pMHC-I antigens.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Expression of the incompatible CD4 co-receptor in cytotoxic T cells enhances their ligand discrimination</title><p id="P15">Since the CD4 co-receptor increased the ability of helper T cells to discriminate ligands using an MHC-I restricted TCR, we examined whether it could also do this in cytotoxic T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Indeed, expression of CD4 in cytotoxic T cells selectively reduced activation and target killing against lower affinity pMHCs, without affecting responses to the high affinity cognate peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6A</xref>). Moreover, expression of CD4 in CD8 KO cytotoxic T cells synergised to produce T cells with extremely high levels of discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6B-C</xref>). For example, whereas wild-type T cells can respond to the lower-affinity 4D peptide, these CD8→CD4 co-receptor switch T cells ignore this same antigen unless its concentration was increased by a dramatic ~3000-fold. Thus, a CD8→CD4 co-receptor switch dramatically increased the ligand discrimination of cytotoxic T cells.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>CD8→CD4 co-receptor switch cytotoxic T cells display reduced cross-reactivity whilst maintaining potent target killing</title><p id="P16">We next used three methods to examine how the increase in ligand discrimination that we report impacts T cell cross-reactivity.</p><p id="P17">In a pooled peptide library that contains a random mixture of peptides, it is expected that the majority of peptides that bind the TCR would do so with low affinity. As a result, we predicted that increasing ligand discrimination would reduce T cell cross-reactivity to a pooled library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). We stimulated T cells with target cells pulsed with a random pooled 9-mer peptide library, where each position can be any amino acid except cysteine, with a theoretical diversity of 19<sup>9</sup> peptides. Cytotoxic T cells expressing the c259 TCR killed target cells pulsed with the random peptide mixture, but reduced cross-reactive killing was observed in CD8 KO and especially in CD8→CD4 co-receptor switch T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P18">A positional scanning library includes all single amino acid changes relative to a target peptide (163 NY-ESO-1 variant peptides in the present case). Although cytotoxic c259 TCR-T cells killed targets expressing many of these peptides, CD8 KO cells and CD8→CD4 co-receptor switch T cells display reduced killing to many of these peptides with the exception of the target peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). To confirm that this reduced cross-reactivity was a result of increased ligand discrimination based on affinity, we developed a workflow to use a high-throughput SPR-based instrument to accurately and rapidly measure all 163 TCR/pMHC affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7, Table S2</xref>). As predicted, the reduced cross-reactivity of CD8 KO and CD8→CD4 co-receptor switch T cells was dependent on affinity with reduced responses observed only to lower-affinity interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E-F</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Data from positional scanning libraries can also be used to predict TCR off-target cross-reactivities and this method has previously been used to predict potential self peptides recognised by the c259 TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). We found that c259 TCR-T cells responded to a subset of these predicted peptides whose affinity we then measured by SPR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). The CD8 KO and especially the CD8→CD4 co-receptor switch T cells displayed reduced responses to target cells presenting these cross-reactive self peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S9</xref>). Importantly, this reduced cross-reactivity did not compromise potency to the on-target NY-ESO-1 cancer antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5I</xref>). Thus, co-receptor switching can reduce T cell cross-reactivity to increase the safety of TCR-T cell therapies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">It has been estimated that a single T cell can recognise over 10<sup>6</sup> different peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). This cross-reactivity is an essential feature of adaptive immunity, enabling the limited number of T cell clones within an organism to provide protection against a much larger number of pathogenic peptides. However, T cell cross-reactivity poses a significant challenge to the success of TCR-T therapies as it can lead to lethal off-target toxicities. Identifying safe and effective TCRs remains a critical bottleneck in the development of new therapies. Despite this binding cross-reactivity, T cells use kinetic proofreading to discriminate between high and low affinity peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Since ligand discrimination emerges not only from TCR binding but from TCR signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), we hypothesised that modifying T cell co-signalling receptors involved in this signalling pathway could be exploited to increase T cell ligand discrimination and reduce cross-reactivity without modifying the TCR. We have demonstrated the ability to increase and decrease ligand discrimination by genetic knockout and/or expression of the surface molecules CD5, CD4, and CD8 in helper/cytotoxic T cells. The CD8→CD4 co-receptor switch produced super selective T cells that display a striking increase in ligand discrimination and reduced cross-reactivity to a pooled and positional scanning libraries, and to self peptides without impacting on-target potency.</p><p id="P21">The CD8 co-receptor plays an essential role in thymic selection but its role in ligand discrimination is debated. Previous work established that CD8 increases T cell activation by stabilising the extracellular TCR-pMHC interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) and by recruiting Lck to the signalling subunits of the TCR-CD3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). It has been proposed that CD8 can selectively stabilise high-affinity TCR/pMHC interactions through a positive feedback that amplifies differences in binding affinity and hence enhances ligand discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). On the other hand, it has been suggested that CD8 slows the dissociation rate of TCR/pMHC interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), which preferentially increases the sensitivity to low affinity peptides and hence reduces ligand discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Our systematic analyses support the latter hypothesis, showing that CD8 KO selectively reduces activation towards lower-affinity antigens and hence CD8 KO increases ligand discrimination.</p><p id="P22">We found that CD4+ helper T cells display higher levels of ligand discrimination compared to CD8+ cytotoxic or CD8 KO cytotoxic T cells recognizing MHC-I antigens. This suggested that the CD4 co-receptor, which binds MHC-II, might further increase ligand discrimination. We confirmed this by showing that CD4 KO in helper T cells reduced their ligand discrimination and expression of CD4 in WT or CD8 KO cytotoxic T cells enhanced their ligand discrimination. These findings are consistent with the Lck sequestration model first proposed to understand thymocyte development. This model postulates that CD4/CD8 co-receptors inhibit signalling when they are not able to recognise the ligand recognised by the TCR, by sequestering Lck from the TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). We suggest that removal of a compatible co-receptor or the introduction of an incompatible co-receptor increases the proofreading time-delay between pMHC binding and TCR signalling leading to enhanced ligand discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Whilst increasing the discrimination of therapeutic TCRs can increase their safety, decreasing ligand discrimination has been proposed as an attractive strategy to increase activation against lower affinity immune escape peptide variants in tumours with high genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). We have identified CD5 KO as a candidate modification to decrease T cell ligand discrimination and our findings are consistent with its negative regulatory function that fine-tunes TCR signalling to maintain T cell tolerance and reduce the risk of autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Although reducing the function of CD5 has been shown to enhance anti-tumour activity in TCR-T and CAR-T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), this may be a double-edge sword because it would also increase cross-reactivity and hence the risk of autoimmune toxicities. Similarly, on-going clinical trials have engineered CD4+ helper T cells to express the CD8 co-receptor to increase their potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) but our results suggest that this may increase their cross-reactivity and the risk of autoimmune toxicities.</p><p id="P24">Overall, we have demonstrated that super selective T cells with reduced cross-reactivity and enhanced ligand discrimination can be generated without impacting on-target potency and importantly, without modifying the TCR. We have applied the method to the clinical a3a and c259 TCRs showing that it can abolish functional cross-reactivity to self peptides. A limitation of this method is that if a TCR does not bind its target cancer peptide with high affinity, its potency may be reduced by co-receptor switching. Therefore, affinity-maturation might be required for lower-affinity therapeutic TCRs. Given that these super selective T cells are generated by modifying genes extrinsic to the TCR, it has the potential to dramatically increase the safety of TCR-T cell therapies regardless of the therapeutic TCR that is used.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P25">U87 and HEK cell lines were cultured at 37°C and 10% CO2 in DMEM D6429 media (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 μg/mL Streptomycin and 50 units/mL Penicillin.</p><p id="P26">T2 cells and Nalm6 cells were cultured at 37°C and 10% CO2 in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 μg/mL Streptomycin, 50 units/mL Penicillin.</p><p id="P27">Primary human T cells were isolated from leukocyte cones and cultured at 37°C and 10% CO2 in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 μg/mL Streptomycin, 50 units/mL Penicillin and 50 U/mL IL2.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Lentivirus production</title><p id="P28">0.8 Million HEK 293T cells were seeded in a 6-well plate (Day 1) and incubated overnight.

CD58 was immobilised on a reference flow cell at matching levels to those of pMHCs on the remaining flow cells. The signal from the reference flow cell was subtracted (Single referencing) and the average signal from the closest buffer injection was subtracted (Double referencing).

The DS-A2 protein was produced as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Briefly, the DS-A2 and β2-microglobulin (β2m) subunits were produced in E. coli as inclusion bodies and solubilized in 8 M urea. The protein was then refolded in the presence of GlyLeu, a dipeptide that binds with low affinity to the peptide-binding cleft. The refolded DS-A2–β2m complexes were purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex S75 10/300 column (GE Healthcare/Cytiva) in HBS-EP buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Tween 20). Locallibrary peptides were loaded by incubating the DS-A2–β2m complex with each peptide for 2 h at room temperature. The pMHC complexes were stored at 4°C until use within 24 h.</p><p id="P66">Soluble c259 TCR was produced as separate TCRα and TCRβ chains in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Both chains were recovered as inclusion bodies, solubilised in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8 M urea, 2 mM DTT and stored in aliquots at -70ºC. For refolding, 30 mg of each TCR chain was added to 1 L of refolding buffer (150 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 3 M urea, 200 mM Arg-HCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF) and stirred for 1 h at 4ºC. This was followed by dialysis in 10 L 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) buffer for 3 days in total, with the dialysis buffer changed after 1 day. The refolded c259 TCR was purified using anion exchange chromatography (HiTrap Q HP; Cytiva), followed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 Increase; Cytiva) in HBS-EP Buffer. Purified c259 was used within 48 h.</p><p id="P67">High-throughput affinity measurements of c259 TCR binding to MHC loaded with the peptide library were performed using LSA or LSA<sup>XT</sup> (Carterra). Each pMHC was immobilised via biotin-streptavidin binding on a different spot of the SAHC30M biosensor (Carterra) for 20 min, resulting in immobilisation levels between 200 and 900 RUs. Measurements were performed in HBS-EP Buffer at 37 °C. A 2-fold dilution series of c259 TCR was prepared in HBS-EP buffer, with the highest concentration between 100 - 130 μM. Starting with the highest dilution, increasing concentrations of c259 were injected over the chip for 5 min, followed by 5 -10 min of dissociation, without regeneration. Afterwards, a <italic>β</italic>2m specific antibody (clone B2M-01 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or BBM.1 (Absolute Antibody)) was injected for 10 min. The resulting data was analysed using Kinetics Software (Carterra). Any spikes were removed from the data, before referencing against empty control spots or spots immobilised with CD86 at matching immobilisation levels. The final in a series 6 buffer injection before TCR injection was subtracted from the data for double referencing. Subsequently, the steady state binding RU was calculated by taking the average RU from over 20 seconds. Steady-state analysis was performed to obtain the K<sub>D</sub> values. First, steady-state data was fitted with a one site-specific binding model (Response = B<sub>max</sub> [TCR]/(K<sub>D</sub> + [TCR]), with K<sub>D</sub> and B<sub>max</sub> unconstrained. We then constructed an empirical standard curve using high affinity pMHCs (K<sub>D</sub> &lt; 20μM) to relate maximal anti-<italic>β</italic>2m binding to TCR B<sub>max</sub>. Next, steady state data for all pMHCs were fitted with a one site-specific binding model with B<sub>max</sub> constrained to the B<sub>max</sub> inferred from the empirical standard curve. We excluded K<sub>D</sub> values for peptides, where we observed little or no anti-<italic>β</italic>2m binding responses, indicating that the pMHC complex was unstable and lost the peptide over time (indicated as N/A in Table 2). We further excluded K<sub>D</sub> values for pMHC that produced a TCR binding response of less than 5 RU (indicated as non-binders (NB) in Table 2).</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="P68">EC<sub>50</sub> is calculated as the concentration of antigen required to elicit 50% of the maximum response determined for each condition individually whereas P<sub>15</sub> is calculated as the concentration of antigen required to elicit 15% of the maximum activation.</p><p id="P69">The study is largely focused on comparing antigen sensitivity using EC<sub>50</sub> or P<sub>15</sub> measures, which we have found displays standard deviations of 0.2 (on log-transformed values).
