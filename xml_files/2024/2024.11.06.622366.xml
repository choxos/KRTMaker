Failure of this process, in compromised mitochondria, leads to kinase activation at the surface, and ultimately mitophagy. Analysis of PINK1-import within intact cells reveals an alternative pathway into the matrix. Structural modelling predicts that PINK1’s trans-membrane-domain (TMD) forms either an α-helix or α/β-hybrid at the interface between Tim17, of the TIM23-core-complex, and, respectively, either Romo1 or PARL. These mutually exclusive interactions both encapsulate a hydrated protein-channel. The α-helical-TMD form adopts a pose suggestive of translocation through the Romo1/Tim17-channel, while the α/β-hybrid-TMD is retracted into PARL’s active-site for cleavage, presumably after import through the adjacent rhomboid/Tim17-channel. We propose structural plasticity of the PINK1-TMD underlies alternative destinies for full-length matrix-import or cleavage/retro-translocation. The results reveal new insights of PINK1’s role in mitochondrial function, quality-control and early-onset Parkinson’s disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Nearly all mitochondrial proteins are synthesised in the cytosol, save only a few (13 in humans) which are encoded by the mitochondrial genome. Consequently, there is a high demand for protein import in mitochondrial biogenesis, maintenance and regeneration. Proteins destined for import contain mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS) which direct them to the mitochondrial outer-membrane, inter-membrane space (IMS), inner-membrane or matrix <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Those heading for the matrix are usually (but not always) delivered to the mitochondria as precursor proteins with a cleavable N-terminal MTS (pre-sequence) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Import begins with targeting to the translocase of the outer-membrane (TOM)–acting as both receptor and protein-channel for entry into the IMS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Translocases of the inner-membrane (TIM) are then required for transport across and into the inner-membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The major route into the matrix occurs <italic>via</italic> the TIM23-pathway, in a process characterised by two distinct rate-limiting steps: (1) transport through TOM, and (2) initiation of transport through the TIM23-complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Subsequent translocation into the matrix then proceeds very quickly (non-rate limiting). Passage across and into the inner-membrane are both driven by the membrane potential (Δψ), while matrix entry also requires ATP turnover by the mitochondrial Hsp70 homologue (mtHsp70).</p><p id="P4">The core TIM23-complex comprises the homologous subunits Tim23 and Tim17, of which humans have two orthologs (TIMM17A and TIMM17B), along with Tim44 peripherally associated on the matrix side. The latter associates with mtHsp70 for ATP-driven translocation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. It had been assumed that the protein-channel is formed at the interface between Tim17 and Tim23, however when the structure of the core-complex was resolved, it did not contain a hydrophilic water containing pore <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Instead, Tim17 forms a hydrophilic ‘slide’, similar to that found in the YidC-family <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>; perhaps suitable for the insertion of proteins into the membrane (like YidC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, but not for conducting polypeptides across the membrane.</p><p id="P5">Formation of a protein-channel is likely to require association with additional proteins; for example Mgr2 in yeast (Romo1 in humans) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>; AlphaFold modelling suggests that this is indeed the case <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Though, one problem with this proposal is that neither of Mgr2 and Romo are essential <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Once the channel is formed then translocation necessarily occurs with minimal leakage of small molecules, to conserve the proton motive force (PMF) across the inner-membrane. This is presumably accomplished through an intimate association of channel constituents and the precursor, and by fast passage of precursors across the inner-membrane, as noted <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Membrane integrity may also be achieved by transient assembly of the protein-channel upon demand.</p><p id="P6">One mitochondrial-targeted protein requiring this machinery is the stress-responsive protein PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1). PINK1 is a mitochondrial serine-threonine kinase most widely known for its role in targeting damaged mitochondria for degradation <italic>via</italic> its interaction with the ubiquitin ligase Parkin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. This process, termed mitophagy, ensures the maintenance of a functional cell-wide mitochondrial network, with errors in the process being linked to Parkinson’s Disease. PINK1 comprises an N-terminal MTS, an outer-membrane targeting sequence (OMS) followed by a transmembrane domain (TMD), and a C-terminal kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In normally functioning mitochondria, it is thought that PINK1 partially imports into mitochondria, with the N-terminal region (MTS, OMS and TMD) sitting deeply within the inner-membrane. This then enables cleavage between the OMD and the TMD (between residues A103 and F104) by the inner-membrane resident, the rhomboid protease PARL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The bisected TMD and kinase of PINK1 then undergo retro-translocation out of the mitochondria for degradation by the proteasome; whereby the new N-terminus (F104) acts as a type-2 N-degron, recruiting E3 enzymes UBR1, UBR2 and UBR4 that target the protein for degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The cleaved MTS, OMS and other half of the TMD remain in the inner-membrane; presumably this fragment is eventually released from the TIM23-PARL complex for degradation.</p><p id="P8">Conditions of mitochondrial stress, i.e. membrane depolarisation (induced also artificially by the ionophore CCCP), results in import arrest and, as a result, failure of PINK1 inner-membrane insertion and PARL cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). In these circumstances, PARL is not recruited, and the uncleaved full-length PINK1 protein defaults to the outer-membrane; so the kinase domain is stabilised at the mitochondrial surface <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Subsequent PINK1 dimerization facilitates autophosphorylation and Parkin recruitment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Phosphorylation of Parkin then induces a downstream ubiquitination cascade, leading to proteasomal-mediated protein degradation and ultimately mitophagy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. It has also been reported that reactive oxygen species (ROS) also promote PINK1/ Parkin dependent mitophagy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">These alternative scenarios explain how PINK1 acts as a reporter of mitochondrial fitness for quality control. However, the current model does not consider the possibility and consequences of fully imported PINK1, where the kinase domain crosses the inner-membrane to enter the matrix <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. This prospect has been suggested by the identification of a potential PINK1-kinase substrate within the mitochondrial interior. PINK1 knock-outs result in a loss of phosphorylation of the matrix facing subunit NdufA10 of the respiratory Complex I, required for high rates of electron transfer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Additionally, it has been shown that PINK1 activity is regulated through degradation by the Lon-protease in the matrix <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that, in addition to stress-related mitophagy signalling, PINK1 has additional regulatory roles relevant to mitochondrial structure, function and homeostasis. This could be achieved indirectly through trans-membrane signalling cascades from the cytosolic kinase domain of PINK1 to the IMS and matrix. Alternatively, regulation of Complex I, <italic>inter alia</italic>, could be activated directly by matrix localised PINK1.</p><p id="P10">Given uncertainties about these alternative destinations of PINK1 we re-examined PINK1 mitochondrial transport, including its potential for both IMS and matrix import. For this, we had to overcome considerable technical barriers. The first was the production of full-length human PINK1, and the second the deployment of an accurate and real-time cellular assay for mitochondrial import (MitoLuc) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The assay was further developed in this study to monitor transport into the IMS as well as the matrix. Thereby, we were able to construct and purify a series of human PINK1 precursor proteins amenable for the analysis of its import. The import data are supported by structural modelling (using AlphaFold2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that address the mechanistic basis for PINK1 inner-membrane insertion for proteolysis and transport.</p><p id="P11">The combined results reveal that PINK1 can be directed either into the matrix or the outer-membrane and suggest a mechanism for this discrimination, based around the structural plasticity of PINK1’s TMD. These data, along with the effects of Parkinson’s disease-causing residue substitutions on the import behaviour of PINK1, have motivated a re-evaluation of PINK1’s role in mitochondrial regulation. The results also raise the prospect of there being multiple bespoke protein-channels through the inner-mmebrane for different purposes, formed by the assembly of the TIM23-core-complex with various accessory partners, with Mgr2/Romo1 being one of many alternatives.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Import of PINK1 into the IMS occurs in 2 rate limiting steps</title><p id="P12">To better understand the import behaviour of PINK1, we first set out to interrogate its transport across the outer-membrane into the IMS. This was achieved by the development of our in-cell import assay–MitoLuc <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. This involved the encapsulation of a large fragment of a split luciferase (11S) into the mitochondrial IMS (i11S) of intact human cultured cells; while the corresponding small fragment (pep86) is incorporated into the import protein (PINK1). The cells (in this case HEKs) are then perforated to allow the entry of the import protein substrate and assay reagents. Successful import then results in the association of the small and large fragments for the formation of an active luciferase for a real time and accurate monitor of transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>; i11S); see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Materials and Methods</xref> for details.</p><p id="P13">To provide a more granular readout of the import process, we engineered the luminescent reporter (pep86) in 3 different positions along PINK1: (1) at the N-terminal domain between the MTS and OMS, (2) between the TMD and the kinase domain and (3) at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a, 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). The 3 variants all contained one active luminescent ‘light’ (L) and two inactive ‘dark’ (D) pep86 sequences; the latter disabled by pairwise amino acid swapping (x3). Thus, the three construct, hereafter termed LDD, DLD and DDL, were identical save for the position of the active reporter.</p><p id="P14">The full-length proteins were successfully purified (typical example shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>) and shown to associate with the large fragment of the luciferase (11S) in solution for the formation of an active luciferase and the liberation of bioluminescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Based on our previous analysis and methodological development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, we know that these association kinetics are suitable for implementation in the MitoLuc assay. This is because the internalised mitochondrial volumes are tiny, so the concentration of pep86 and 11S will be very high (much higher than those shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Therefore, the association rates will be very high (substancially higher than the rate of import) and non-rate limiting. Therefore, in the MitoLuc assay, the luminescence response reports on the rate of mitochondrial import, rather than on the assembly of 11S and pep86. Slight variations in the bioluminescent yield of the various PINK1-pep86-11S complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>, B<sub>max</sub>) were used to scale the subsequent import measurements accordingly.</p><p id="P15">Progression of the 3 reporting regions of PINK1 into the IMS within HEK cells was then monitored over time, one by one, for each of the LDD, DLD and DDL variants. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref> describes the import assay for LDD, whereby entry of the N-terminal region into the IMS is monitored. The DLD variant reports on the entry of the region prior to the kinase domain into the IMS, and DDL the C-terminus as a result of IMS entry of the full-length protein including the kinase domain. The luminescence traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>) chart the progression of the respective regions across the outer-membrane. The amplitude (maximum luminescence) reflects the total amount of the pep86 reporter entering the IMS and the rate reflects the time taken to cross the outer-membrane. Both of these were similar in PINK1 to the canonical matrix-bound precursor protein (ACP1) characterised previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Import of ACP gives us a measure of IMS build up of a precursor on its way to the matrix. This is as expected because we have previously shown that initiation of transport across the inner-membrane is rate limiting <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In the case of PINK1, from this data alone, we cannot say if (or how much) of the IMS signal is due to its final destination in the IMS, or as a result of build up of proteins on their way to the matrix.</p><p id="P17">The PINK1 data could be fitted to a two-step reaction mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>) for transport across the outer-membrane. The rates are unaffected by the position of the luciferase fragment within PINK1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>), demonstrating that the passage of the N-terminal, central and C-terminal regions of PINK1 into the IMS occurs by the same mechanism. Presumably, these two steps are: (1) association with the TOM complex and (2) passage through the channel into the IMS.</p><p id="P18">The amount of material in the IMS decreases progressively from the N-terminal to the central and C-terminal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>), which probably reflects the directionality of transport (N→C-terminus) through TOM40, as well as the relative slow rate (rate-limiting) of this step <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Transport quantities into the IMS were insensitive to respiratory and ATP synthase (inner-membrane) inhibitors (Antimycin A and Oligomycin, ‘AO’) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>); this was as expected because the outer-membrane is not subject to their effects.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>PINK1 is fully imported into the matrix</title><p id="P19">Following import across the outer-membrane and into the IMS it is generally accepted that PINK1 becomes partially incorporated into the inner-membrane of uncompromised mitochondria <italic>via</italic> the TIM23-complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>; whereafter it associates with PARL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). It has been suggested, though not widely accepted, that the interaction with the import machinery can also promote PINK1 entry into the matrix <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">To explore the prospect of partial or complete transport of PINK1 across the mitochondrial inner-membrane, we interrogated our PINK1 LDD, DLD, and DDL variants using the MitoLuc assay monitoring precursor entry into the matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>) with 11S encapsulated in the matrix (m11S). The data reveal that PINK1 does indeed enter the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). Furthermore, the luminescence signal from the C-terminal pep86 reporter demonstrates that PINK1 is fully imported, <italic>i.e.</italic> the entire protein crosses the inner-membrane to enter the matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>; DDL).</p><p id="P21">Unlike the IMS data, which fitted to a two step model, the matrix import datasets are too complex to fit to a kinetic model. Nevertheless, the data reveals several basic features about PINK1’s mitochondrial trafficking. While substantial, the total quantity of import is somewhat lower than the canonical matrix-targeting benchmark ACP1 (also carrying the luminescence reporter pep86 at the C-terminus; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>), suggesting that not all of the PINK1 enters the matrix, and that some of it is retained in the IMS. Further, in contrast to IMS import, subsequent passage into the matrix is sensitive to Antimycin A and Oligomycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>), suggesting that, as expected, translocation occurs <italic>via</italic> the Tim23 pathway, which requires both ATP and the membrane potential (Δψ) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Critically, deletion of the N-terminal targeting region of PINK1, up to the kinase domain, completely ablates the luminescent signal (see below). This demonstrates that the assay is a genuine measure of matrix import, rather than a result of PINK1 association with residual 11S in the cytosol.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Modelling of PINK1 and its interaction partners reveals structural plasticity in the PINK1 TMD</title><p id="P22">The results above demonstrate that PINK1 can be fully transported across the inner-membrane. Therefore, following entry into the IMS and contact with the inner-membrane PINK1 has alternative destinations in functional mitochondria: (1) delivery to the rhomboid protease PARL for cleavage and retro-translocation to the outer-membrane, as previously described) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, or (2) transport into the matrix. We presumed both to be mediated through interactions with the TIM23-complex. To better understand these distinct pathways, and how they are discriminated, we explored the predicted structures of PINK1 in complex with PARL, both alone and in combination with the TIM23-core-complex.</p><p id="P23">Structural models of PINK1 were produced by the deep learning AlphaFold2 (AF) program, see Methods for full details. Details of all AF models produced for this study are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Top ranking models and plots of quality metrics are available for download from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/xj9ca/">https://osf.io/xj9ca/</ext-link>, with key plots also included in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figures</xref>.</p><p id="P24">Initially, an AF model of the PINK1-PARL complex was built, with the highest scoring pose shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>. Each chain of the model is in good agreement with experimentally determined structures: the kinase domain of the PINK1 model aligns well with the resolvable region of <italic>Pediculus humanus corporis</italic> PINK1 (residues 147-574) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, with an RMSD of 0.11 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7a</xref>). The PARL chain of the model compares well with the <italic>E. coli</italic> rhomboid homologue GlpG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>?), with slightly higher structural variability than the PINK1 chain (RMSD 0.64 nm), expected due to the vast evolutionary distance between human PINK and <italic>E. coli</italic> GlpG. Accordingly, the predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) is generally favourable, at ca. 80-90 for most of each chain <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7b</xref>. The pTM score across the complex is respectable at 0.63.</p><p id="P25">In general, the predicted aligned error (PAE) score between the PINK1 and PARL chains in the complex ‘is low. This is expected, as any complex formed by these proteins is likely be transient. Similarly, whilst not so low as to reject the model, the ipTM is moderately low at 0.5. However, a notable high scoring PAE region can be seen in the graph (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7c</xref>, arrow), indicating a more confident region of the model. This region corresponds to a small three stranded β-sheet formed between PINK1 and PARL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). One strand of the β-sheet is formed from a section of the TMD region of PINK1 (sequence GLGLGL) between the cleavage site and three highly conserved acidic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>), while the other two strands are contributed by PARL.</p><p id="P26">Thus, in the presence of PARL, the PINK1 TMD spans the membrane as an α/β-hybrid. Interestingly, in the AF model of PINK1 alone taken from the EBI database <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, the TMD including the GLGLGL-motif is entirely α-helical (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7d</xref>). Notably, the α/β-hybrid arrangement brings the PINK1 cleavage site into proximity of PARL protease active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>: S277/H335). This configuration shows strong similarities to the structure of γ-secretase bound to amyloid precursor protein (APP) and to Notch <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, including the proximity of the active site to the substrate, and the formation of the three-strand β-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b-c</xref>). This supports the designation of this model as a plausible pre-cleavage PINK1/PARL interaction. In the modelled complex the kinase domain is shown in the IMS, as predicted by AF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), though it is unclear if PINK1 ever folds in the IMS, or if it remains unfolded prior to transport to the matrix or retro-transport the outer-membrane.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Structural modelling identifies potential alternative protein-channels at the interface between the TIM23-core-complex and either Romo1 or PARL</title><p id="P27">To investigate the structure of PINK1 in the context of the mitochondrial import machinery, we augmented the AF PINK1-PARL model to also include the TIM23-core-complex (Tim17-23-44) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>). This was achieved by creating an AF-model of the latter with PARL bound (Tim17-23-44-PARL). This model had solid AF scores of pTM=0.66 and ipTM=0.65. The pLDDT was high for the whole complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8a</xref>), except for the N-terminal region of Tim44 which we excluded from downstream analyses.

In respect of IMS import, the two rate determining steps of transport across the OM were unaffected by the 3EA amino acid substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7g</xref>). This confirms that the effect is a not a consequence of altered interactions with the TOM complex. The lower yield of IMS entry is presumably a result of restricted transport further downstream, through the TIM23-complex.

Structures of the γ-secretase complex with its clients Notch and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) also show the induction of an α/β-hybrid TMD within the active site of the protease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. The similarity of this arrangement is striking; they all involve β-augmentation of the substrate and protease, wherein the cleavage site is between the α-helix and β-strand of the TMD.</p><p id="P60">The relatively weak hydrophobicity of PINK1’s TMD might account for the destabilisation of the TMD α-helix critical for its structural plasticity, and suit both PARL and Romo1 promoted alternative destinies. The more hydrophilic TMD α-helical state resists stalling in the inner-membrane and is free to proceed into the matrix, while the α/β-hybrid can easily be incorporated into the water rich constriction of the membrane harbouring the active site of PARL. Interestingly, this is also a feature of other rhomboid proteases.</p><p id="P61">If the TMD is a conformational switch, goverened by distinct interactions between PINK1 and PARL or Romo1, for cleavage or matrix import, then the question remains: what regulates the incorporation of PINK1 into the respective complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>–box 3a or 3b)? Perhaps the putative redox-sensor is important for the modulation of the TMD conformation by ROS, as well as other accessory factors of the TIM23-complex. Alternatively, the loss of membrane potential may have a contrasting effect on the incorporation of PINK1 into the the PARL or Romo1 containing complexes. In which case, varing degrees of mitochondrial stress could impact the balance between kinase degradation, activation at the outer-membrane or in the matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>–box 3a-c).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Impact of PINK1 transport for human health</title><p id="P62">It is well known that perturbation of the normal functioning of PINK1 causes human disease. Several mutations of <italic>pink1</italic> have been implicated in early onset Parkinson’s disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. They result in amino acid substitutions in both the N-terminal region and the kinase domain, affecting mitochondrial transport, cleavage, kinase activity and thereby regulation of mitophagy. The results presented here suggest that the explanation for some of the associated phenotypes could be more nuanced. First of all, the loss of kinase activity will affect mitophagy independent activities of PINK1 within the matrix. Secondly, changes of the N-terminal region could potentially affect the conformational switch within PINK1’s TMD, upsetting the balance between matrix and outer membrane regulatory activity. One notable example being I111S, linked to Parkinson’s disease, previously shown to affect the PINK1-PARL interaction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, and which we also demonstrate reduces matrix import. Perhaps then, loss of PINK1 matrix function also contributes to the early onset Parkinson’s disease.</p><p id="P63">In general, the dynamic properties of PINK1’s TMD are most likely critical for PINK1’s targeting, processing, distribution and activation. Therefore, amino acid substitutions in and around this region could bring about an imbalance of PINK1s localisation and activity, and thereby cause disease. For instance, variants affecting the putative redox-sensor, and potential dynamic response to ROS, at the matrix end of the TMD of PINK1 are also associated with early onset Parkinson’s disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P64">Clearly, more work needs to be done to better understand the cues for PINK1 distribution and degradation and their consequences, and how they are affected by the various <italic>pink1</italic> mutants. With this new framework, and further analysis, it is conceivable that new strategies could be developed for the treatment of specific forms of Parkinson’s disease. For instance, by controlling and rebalancing the alternative destinations of PINK1 to correct the mis-regulation of mitochondrial structure, function and quality control. One way to achieve this could be by small molecule interventions that shift the conformational dynamics of its TMD to promote either inner-membrane transport or cleavage as required.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS199931-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d59aAcDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was carried out using the computational facilities of the Advanced Computing Research Centre, University of Bristol - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/">http://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/</ext-link>.

Key elements of PINK1 are labelled (top left, as in <bold>a</bold>); mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), outer-membrane targeting sequence (OMS), trans-membrane domain (TMD), with consistent colouring throughout; blue arrows indicate the direction of protein translocation. With functional mitochondria, PINK1 is thought to undergo partial import into mitochondria followed by cleavage within the transmembrane domain by the inner-mitochondrial membrane resident rhomboid protease PARL. PARL cleavage precedes a process of retro-translocation, whereby PINK1 slides back out into the cytoplasm and is subject to degradation by the proteasome.

Key elements of PINK1 are labelled in Box 1; mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), outer-membrane targeting sequence (OMS), trans-membrane domain (TMD), with consistent colouring throughout; blue arrows indicate the direction of protein translocation. According to the current model PINK1 is transported through the TOM-complex into the IMS to make contact with the TIM23-complex (Box 1→2). In functional mitochondria, generating a membrane potential (Δψ), PINK1-Tim17-23 recruit either Romo1 (Box 2a) or PARL (Box 2b)–both completing a channel for translocation of the N-terminus across the membrane, driven by Δψ. In the former case, PINK1’s TMD forms an α-helix which can readily be transported into the matrix along with the rest of the protein, again driven by Δψ (Box 3a). While, the interaction with PARL promotes transport into the matrix and entry of the TMD into the inner-membrane (Box 3b). Formation of the α/β-hybrid promotes retraction of the TMD from the channel into the proteolytic active site for cleavage between phenylalanine (F) and alanine (A). The respective cleavage produces can be transported in opposite directions into the IMS and matrix. Retro-translocation of the C-terminal fragment back through the TOM-complex results in degradation by the proteosome. When mitochondria become compromised the loss of Δψ mean that PINK1’s N-terminus is not transported and the full-length protein is then trapped at the outer-membrane (Box 3c), leading to dimirisation, kinase activation and Parkin recruitment. The 3 conserved glutamates (E) are shown making important, but distinct, interactions with both Romo1 and PARL associated complexes. Between the 3Es and the TMD is an isoleucine (I), which when substituted with serine (I111S) brings about early onset Parkinson’s disease. ROS may regulate this process by promoting the Lon-dependent degradation of matrix PINK1 (Box 3a) and by the oxidation of activated thiols between PINK1’s OMS and TMD (Box 3a, 3b).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199931-f009"/></fig></floats-group></article>
