Therefore, identifying the intra-cellular factors that can influence the phase separation of proteins in cells is critical, both for fundamental research, e.g. to understand how the intracellular organization is orchestrated, and applied sciences, e.g., to decipher the mechanisms leading to diseases involving biomolecular condensates. For decades, researchers have studied how physical parameters, including temperature and pressure, impact phase separation. However, most of this physical and chemical knowledge is disconnected from biological systems where these parameters only vary to a limited extent. Nonetheless, growing evidence suggests that intracellular factors can globally modulate the phase separation behavior of biomolecules in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). For example, the bacterial cytosol can undergo changes in material state depending on metabolic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Furthermore, studies increasingly show that the yeast cytoplasm undergoes extensive changes in its physicochemical properties depending on environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). For example, cells that are quiescent, energy depleted, or starved for carbon, show global rearrangements of their biomolecular content, and many proteins are observed to form large macromolecular assemblies under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether these changes are driven by specific alterations in protein-protein interactions or if they arise due to more global physicochemical parameters such as pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), solvent quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), or molecular crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Additionally, the extent to which these physicochemical properties can be modulated by genetic alterations, such as gene knockouts, remains unexplored.</p><p id="P4">Here, we set out to investigate the genetic factors influencing protein phase separation using a synthetic system for which a phase diagram can be measured in living cells. We show that the system reacts as expected to osmotic compression. Furthermore, the system’s phase diagram changed dramatically in cells after entry into stationary phase, despite no changes in the apparent affinity between its constituent components. Due to the bioorthogonal nature of the system, these changes in phase behavior likely originated in a global regulation of intracellular protein phase separation propensity, independently of direct protein regulation. To map how genetic perturbations could impact such global regulation, we introduced this system to the yeast knockout (KO) collection and measured phase diagrams in thousands of single gene KOs, identifying 68 KOs that robustly change the system’s phase diagram. These KOs were enriched in TORC1-signaling and amino-acid homeostasis-related genes, and were associated with diverse phenotypes. In line with these findings, TORC1 inhibition by rapamycin, as well as nitrogen starvation influenced phase separation of our system in wild-type cells. Nitrogen starvation also inhibited phase separation of a different synthetic system that relies on interactions between disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), and also decreased the tendency of the protein EDC3 to form condensates. These observations support that changes in the phase boundaries of our system reflect global changes in protein phase separation propensity, rather than specific effects on a particular constituent of the condensate, and that nitrogen availability and TORC1-signaling are important in maintaining the physicochemical properties of the cytoplasm. TORC1 signaling can influence protein phase separation by tuning ribosome-mediated crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), however, diffusion measurement of 40-nm GEM particles showed that this mechanism does not explain the changes in phase separation in all KOs. Finally, metabolomic and proteomic profiling data of KO strains further highlighted the importance of the metabolism for the maintenance of phase separation homeostasis.</p><p id="P5">Taken together, our findings reflect an intricate interplay between genetic factors, cellular metabolism, and environmental cues in regulating intracellular protein phase separation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A synthetic minimal system can measure phase separation propensity using <italic>in vivo</italic> phase diagrams</title><p id="P6">We previously developed a synthetic system that allows its phase diagram to be measured in living cells. The system is composed of a tetramer and a dimer that interact with each other via binding domains to form mesh-like phase separated assemblies in living yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). Phase diagrams can be visualized for this system, by measuring the concentration of each component by proxy of green and red fluorescence intensities, and plotting the two concentrations against each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). If a condensate is present, dilute phase concentrations, i.e. concentrations outside the condensate, fall on the phase boundary and we refer to these as dimer-tetramer phase-boundary concentrations (PB-concentrations). By expressing the dimer and tetramer at stochastic levels, determined by random fluctuations in the copy number of separate expression plasmids, we can reveal their PB-concentrations across varying stoichiometries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref>). To test the responsiveness of our system, we artificially and rapidly increased the concentration of both components by reducing cell volume using hyperosmotic shock. After hyperosmotic shock, we observed widespread nucleation of the synthetic condensates, followed by progressive growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-I</xref>, Movie S1 and S2). In this way, the percentage of cells with multiple puncta among those that had a condensate before the treatment increased over time, from 0.07% before the treatment to 0.42% after 15 minutes and 11.1% after 1h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). This delay indicates that newly nucleated condensates are not detectable shortly after the hyperosmotic shock due to their small size. We measured the phase diagram in cells before and after the hyperosmotic shock and observed an upward shift of the phase boundary 15 min after the treatment, as the dilute phase concentrations of dimer and tetramer increased. This shift was reversed one hour after the treatment, as condensates had matured and the dilute phase could be estimated reliably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H-I</xref>). This result confirms that the system responds to concentration changes as expected from theory.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Acute glucose starvation and stationary phase enhance phase separation</title><p id="P7">During glucose starvation, many proteins form punctate structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), and global physicochemical properties of the cytoplasm change, including a drop in pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), an initial fluidization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and then a transition to a solid-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Therefore, we next tested whether acute glucose starvation in wild type cells enhances phase separation of our system. Indeed, acute glucose starvation provoked a downward shift of the phase boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), and re-addition of glucose reversed this change with the phase boundary returning to its original position in the dimer-tetramer concentration space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Previous works reported that global rearrangements of the cytoplasm during acute glucose starvation can be mediated by a decrease in cytoplasmic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Glucose starvation does not lead to intracellular acidification when the external pH is adjusted to 7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). However, acute glucose starvation in pH 7.5 media still shifted the phase boundaries of our system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that pH is one, but not the only parameter mediating the change of phase separation of our system during acute glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). A similar effect was observed with cells in stationary phase where the dimer-tetramer PB-concentrations also underwent a downward shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Interestingly, in this condition, the range of concentrations at which phase separation took place widened greatly, suggesting larger cell-to-cell variability of phase boundaries compared to log-phase conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). Importantly, if the changes in phase separation are due to shifts in the intracellular milieu rather than chemical changes to the system components, the interaction between the components should remain the same. We previously showed that increasing the affinity between the dimer and tetramer resulted in a downward shift of the phase boundaries and longer fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) profiles. By contrast, in stationary phase cells, the apparent affinity of our system did not significantly change as reflected in similar FRAP profiles. The dimer’s relative recovery after 25 s was 0.66±0.02 during growth and 0.69±0.05 in stationary phase, while the tetramer’s recovery was 0.64±0.03 and 0.62±0.05, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G-H</xref>). Thus, the shift in the phase boundary is likely due to global changes in the physicochemical properties of the cytoplasm rather than specific changes in protein interaction.</p><p id="P8">These results highlight that acute glucose starvation enhances phase separation, with pH contributing, but not solely accounting for this effect. Additionally, cells in stationary phase display a wider range of phase separation propensities than cells in log-phase, possibly reflecting a bet-hedging strategy in the physicochemical state of the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>A yeast library to measure the genetic factors influencing phase separation</title><p id="P9">To investigate genetic factors influencing protein phase separation propensity, we introduced the synthetic system to the yeast knockout (KO) library by synthetic genetic array (SGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). In the resulting library, each strain expresses the synthetic system in the background of a specific single gene deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We imaged the resulting library, composed of 3022 strains, acquiring 193,536 images, and quantifying the concentrations of the dimer and tetramer in &gt;25 million segmented cells. To analyze thousands of phase diagrams, we employed two methods. For the first method, we fitted an ellipse to the PB-concentrations of a strain and used the ellipse center to summarize its location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>). The resulting density distribution of ellipse centers peaked at a particular coordinate. We defined strains close to this peak density as “reference strains”, whereas strains farthest from this peak density were identified as potential outliers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). This “center-method” measures only the displacement of the entire phase boundary and we therefore employed a second analysis method that could capture changes in the scaling of the ellipse, as such changes would not necessarily change its center. This method considers the upper and lower parts of the ellipse as two separate “branches” and we refer to this second method as the “branch-method” (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). We collected the strains exhibiting the most extreme changes PB-concentrations based on either method, as well as reference strains from the center of both distributions. This set of 301 KOs comprises 186 identified by the ellipse center-method and 189 by the “branch-method”, of which 74 were common. The outlier and reference strains were transferred to a new 384-well plate, which was imaged and analyzed three more times. Both measurements showed good correlations across the repeats (Pearson correlation coefficients between the first and second repeat: 0.89, and 0.90 for x and y coordinates of the ellipse fit’s centers, and 0.83 and 0.87 for the second method, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). The 68 strains that behaved as outliers in at least two repeats were deemed high confidence outliers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, among those KOs, five are encoded on the complementary DNA strand of another high confidence outlier (YPT6/VPS63, SLM6/REI1 ,YNL198C/GCR2, YML012C-A/UBX2, YKR047W/NAP1). As there are 303 overlapping ORFs in the library, we expect to sample less than one by chance from a draw of 68, so observing five represents a significant enrichment (Wilcoxon test <italic>P</italic>&lt;2.2*10<sup>-16</sup>).</p><p id="P10">Furthermore, 10 dubious ORFs were detected as high confidence outliers, however, only YLR402W did not have an open reading frame on the complementary strand or immediately next to it. YLR402W does not have any ortholog, even in closely related Saccharomyces species, but it is present in a dataset of 1,000 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). We find that expressing this protein rescues the change in phase boundary observed in the KO. Interestingly, structure prediction suggests YLR402W can self-assemble into amyloid-like structures and its expression modulates cell size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Altogether, these data imply that YLR402W is a functional protein and we propose to call it AIS1 for “Altered Intracellular phase Separation”.</p><p id="P11">All high confidence outliers and their details are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) showed that “protein complex” was a term over-represented among the high confidence outliers along with “membrane-less organelles”, “cell size regulation”, “regulation of phosphorylation”, and “TORC1-signaling”, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We next examined the phenotypes associated with the KOs as annotated in YeastMine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Outlier strains are highly pleiotropic and are associated with a disproportionately large number of phenotypes (median=54) relative to random sets of KO strains (median=16-17; 16.23 on average across 100 samples, two-sided Z-test <italic>P</italic>&lt; 2.2*10<sup>-16</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Similarly to the random sets, reference KOs that did not exhibit a change in PB-concentrations and showed equally few annotated phenotypes (median 15.5, two-sided Z-test <italic>P</italic>=.80, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Interestingly, among the enriched phenotypes, <italic>“abnormal alpha-amino acid accumulation”</italic> was associated with 50 outliers of our screen (74% of total), while this phenotype was only represented in 29% of strains in a random set. Similarly, <italic>“increased heat sensitivity”</italic> was associated with 38 outliers (56% of total) compared to 17% in the random set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Finally, we tested the impact of the high confidence outliers on the formation of mesoscale assemblies by tagging and imaging EDC3 (P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>)) and HSP104 (JUNQ/IPOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>)) in these KO strains. When compared to reference KO strains, the outliers showed a significantly higher fraction of cells with puncta of endogenously tagged EDC3 (<italic>P</italic>=.0046), while the fraction of cells with puncta of HSP104 was not significantly altered (<italic>P</italic>=.1297). However, the variance of the fraction of cells with puncta was significantly altered in both cases (F-test <italic>P</italic>=.0008 (EDC3) and <italic>P</italic>=.0010 (HSP104), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Thus, the KOs modulating the phase separation of the synthetic system also show a disproportionate impact on the propensity of EDC3 and HSP104 to self-assemble at the mesoscale.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>TORC1 inhibition, nitrogen and amino acid starvation globally inhibit protein phase separation</title><p id="P14">The GO-term ‘<italic>positive regulation of TORC1 signaling</italic>’, and the phenotype <italic>“abnormal alpha-amino acid accumulation”</italic>, to which TORC1 signaling is responsive, as well as the phenotype <italic>“decreased resistance to [the TORC1 inhibitor] sirolimus”</italic> were enriched in the high confidence outliers of our screen. Furthermore, the protein complexes represented with multiple subunits in the high confidence outliers could be linked to TORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This prompted us to test whether TORC1 inhibition would change the phase diagram of our system in wild type cells. Indeed, TORC1 inhibition with 100 nM rapamycin inhibited phase separation, whereby higher concentrations of both components were necessary for phase separation after four and six hours, but not after two hours of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). TORC1 signaling is responsive to nitrogen availability, and cells starved for nitrogen for six hours also showed inhibited phase separation of our system, as seen by an upward shift of the phase boundary in the phase diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). To test whether this inhibition of phase separation is a general phenomenon, we conducted the same experiment with two additional phase separating systems: a second synthetic system based on intrinsically disordered regions interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-F</xref>), as well as the naturally phase separating protein EDC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G-H</xref>). Both were expressed from plasmids to yield a high variability in expression, and both systems showed inhibited phase separation after six hours of nitrogen starvation, as seen by an increased dilute phase concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D-H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The change in phase separation of selected KOs is likely influenced by crowding and metabolism</title><p id="P15">TORC1 has been shown to alter phase separation by controlling crowding through changes in ribosome density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). To investigate whether ribosome-mediated crowding underlies the changes in phase boundaries in our system, we selected a set of six KOs that altered the system’s phase behavior (ΔNAP1, ΔLST7, ΔUBX2, ΔYML010W-A, ΔVPS41 and ΔYLR402W), and assessed their intracellular crowding using 40 nm genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticle (GEM) diffusion measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). ΔNAP1, ΔUBX2, ΔYML010W-A and ΔVPS41 were chosen because they influenced the phase behavior of our system strongly, ΔLST7 because it is a known positive regulator of TORC1, and ΔYLR402W because it is the only ORF of unknown function with no other gene encoded on the opposite strand in the genome. In these measurements, GEM nanoparticles are tracked inside the cells, and their diffusivities are used to infer intracellular crowding on the 40 nm length scale. GEM diffusivities were significantly increased in ΔLST7 and ΔYLR402W compared to the reference strain ΔHIS3 (ΔLST7: 0.25±0.01 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, ΔYLR402W: 0.26±0.02 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, ΔHIS3: 0.17±0.01 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), while they were slightly decreased in ΔNAP1 (0.16±0.01 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), and not significantly altered in the other KO strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). We then measured the diffusivities of our condensates to explore whether changes in phase separation propensity were associated with differences in crowding at the mesoscale. Five of the six strains indeed showed altered motion of the condensates. Specifically, ΔNAP1, ΔLST7, and ΔYLR402W showed increased diffusivities, while ΔUBX2 and ΔVPS41 showed the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To further characterize this subset of KOs and identify potential intracellular effectors of phase separation propensity, we profiled the metabolome of these six strains. Out of 166 metabolites detected in all samples, the abundance of 43 compounds was significantly different from the control strain ΔHIS3 in at least two strains. These were mostly related to the nucleotide-, tryptophan-, phospholipid-, and mevalonate- metabolism, as well as notably trehalose, a sugar previously shown to alter viscosity of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D-E</xref>). The importance of the metabolism was further reflected in a dataset of differentially expressed proteins reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Among the 68 KOs that changed phase separation, 62 were profiled in this study. To characterize commonalities in their proteomes, we first identified proteins disproportionately changing abundance among them. We identified 41 such proteins out of 1850 (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>), and these mapped to four clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>) enriched in the terms “<italic>Pentose-phosphate pathway</italic>” (Wikipathways (WP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>)), “<italic>Starch and cellulose biosynthesis</italic>” (GO), “<italic>Biosynthesis of amino acids</italic>” (KEGG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>)), and “<italic>Tryptophan/Phenylalanine degradation</italic>” (WP), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). Finally, our own proteomics profiling of the six strains used for metabolics also highlighted the importance of the metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">Our synthetic two-component system enabled high-throughput characterization of <italic>in vivo</italic> phase diagrams and reacted to intracellular concentration changes as expected: nucleation of droplets increased after osmotic compression of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P18">It is very difficult to understand the regulation of endogenous condensates, which contain a large number of components and are regulated by complex pathways. In contrast, changes in phase separation of our bioorthogonal system are likely to be due to fundamental physicochemical changes in the cellular environment that will broadly impact phase separation in the cell. A predicted feature of a passive reporter of this cellular phase separation propensity is that the phase boundary can change without any change in the chemical nature of the system components or their interactions. Accordingly, we found that the phase boundary of our system can dramatically change when cells enter stationary phase without any change in apparent affinity between the two components as measured by FRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P19">During acute glucose starvation and stationary phase, the yeast cytoplasm undergoes dramatic changes, with many mesoscale protein assemblies appearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).

During acute glucose starvation, the intracellular pH decreases and this likely drives some of these global changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). However, acute glucose starvation without acidification also enhanced the phase separation of our system, indicating that pH is one, but not the only factor impacting phase separation in this condition. Furthermore, the range of concentrations at which phase separation of our system takes place is larger in stationary phase than in log-phase, suggesting a wider heterogeneity of cells’ intracellular milieu in the former condition. Such heterogeneity might be associated with a bet-hedging strategy in stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), whereby cells adjust the properties of their cytoplasm during stationary phase in diverse ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P20">We introduced the system to the yeast KO collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) and measured its phase diagram in 2888 deletion backgrounds. We found 68 KOs that robustly alter phase separation of our synthetic system. These deletion strains exhibit an extraordinarily high number of phenotypes, as annotated in YeastMine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Phase separation has been implicated in a multitude of fundamental cellular processes, including transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), and stress adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). The recent explosion of biological processes associated with phase separation has led to considerable skepticism about the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Our results suggest that phase separation may indeed make fundamental contributions to many aspects of biology.</p><p id="P21">One of the most frequent phenotypes among the outliers is <italic>“increased heat sensitivity”</italic>. Given that stress granules form in response to heat, and their formation through condensation is crucial for heat tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), it is compelling to speculate that the KOs with changed phase separation show increased heat sensitivity due to impaired stress granule assembly. A number of other phenotypes over-represented among the outliers of our screen relate to decreased resistance to DNA-damaging agents, including dieldrin, nitrosodiethylamine, and idarubicin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). This is notable, because the DNA damage response involves phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), and altering phase separation globally could therefore render cells more vulnerable to DNA damage.</p><p id="P22">KOs with altered phase separation are enriched in TORC1 signaling-related genes. Furthermore TORC1 inhibition and nitrogen starvation alter phase separation of our system in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This is in line with previous reports showing that changes in ribosome concentrations downstream of TORC1 signaling lead to changes in macromolecular crowding, which tunes protein phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). We used GEM diffusivity measurements to infer macromolecular crowding at the 40 nm length-scale to test whether the altered phase separation of a selected set of 6 KOs could be explained by this mechanism. ΔLST7 showed significantly higher GEM diffusivity, indicating lower ribosome density. This is in line with LST7 being necessary for TORC1 activation and thereby TORC1-mediated ribosome biogenesis. However, the other three strains did not show altered GEM diffusivity, implying that changes in macromolecular crowding is only one of multiple mechanisms by which TORC1 signaling can globally change phase separation of proteins.</p><p id="P23">We next measured diffusivity at the mesoscale in the same six KO strains, by tracking the motion of the condensates themselves, which are typically several hundred nanometers in size. We found that five out of six strains with changed phase separation also showed altered mesoscale diffusion. The process of phase separation occurs at multiple length-scales: nanoscale proteins condense into small droplets that then typically grow by diffusion, collision and coalescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). The cytoplasm is structured at various length-scales by ribosomes, polysomes, membranes and other unknown factors, each of which could frustrate condensate growth . This frustration of motion can be partly overcome by non-thermal active processes (e.g. actomyosin contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>)). We speculate that some mutants could affect the mesoscale structure or non-thermal motion of the cytoplasm at various length-scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Metabolomic profiling of these six strains showed alterations in nucleotide metabolism. This could reflect the overall energy state of the cell, influencing phase separation of our synthetic system indirectly. For example, active processes and ATP hydrolysis have been proposed to influence phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). However, nucleotide triphosphates could also act by decreasing the elasticity of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>), or solubilizing the protein components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>), as ATP can act as a biological hydrotrope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). In addition, tryptophan and related metabolites (Hydroxy-kynurenine, Kynurenate &amp; Kynurenine) changed significantly. In line with this observation, ΔARO1, which is auxotroph for Trp, was among the high-confidence outliers of our screen. Moreover, proteomics data showed differential abundance of two genes related to Trp metabolism (ARO9 and BNA5) in those strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>), and the Wikipathway “Tryptophan degradation” was enriched in the analysis of proteomics data reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). The quality of the solvent in the cell has been shown to significantly affect biological assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), and water potential was recently shown to be intricately linked to phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>). We speculate that certain metabolites including tryptophan and ATP might globally impact phase separation through change in solvent quality and water potential.</p><p id="P25">Taken together, our findings underscore that the propensity for intracellular protein phase separation is an emergent property influenced by a confluence of multiple pathways and factors. In classic genetic works, phenotypes such as adenine auxotrophy are directly and predictably influenced by specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). By contrast, we observed that metabolism (in particular amino acid, carbon, and nucleotide metabolism), energy state (e.g., NMP and NTP levels), pH, crowding, and additional factors such as water potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>) or cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>), can collectively be associated with changes in phase separation. This complexity illustrates the intricacies of biological systems, where certain processes are controlled by well-defined pathways or modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>), whereas others are governed by a complex landscape of interconnected factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>).

Indeed, the previous approach (i.e., identify a region with an absence of data points) was not amenable to a fitting procedure.

There were 41 proteins exhibiting ≥2-fold change in at least six high confidence outlier strains, and the abundance of those proteins across the 62 KO strains gave a matrix subsequently used for clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>) using the ‘hclust’ function in R with Ward distance. GO-term enrichment analysis was then performed on each cluster, using gProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).

Each component is encoded in a separate plasmid and carries an interaction domain (Im2 or E9), a multimerization domain (2-mer or 4-mer), and a fluorescent protein (RFP or YFP), respectively. A structural model of both components is shown along with a cartoon representation (fluorescent proteins are omitted for clarity). Schematics of the genetic constructs are shown underneath.
