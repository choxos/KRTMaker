STH control relies on microsopy-based diagnostics to monitor parasite prevalence and enable post-treatment surveillance, however, molecular diagnostics are rapidly being developed due to increased sensitivity, particularly in low-STH-prevalence settings. The genetic diversity of helminths and its potential impact on molecular diagnostics remains unclear. Using low-coverage genome sequencing, we assessed the presence of STHs in worm, faecal and purified egg samples from 27 countries, identifying differences in the genetic connectivity and diversity of STH-positive samples across regions and cryptic diversity between closely related human- and pig-infective species. We defined substancial copy number and sequence variants in current diagnostic targets and validated the impact of genetic variants on qPCR diagnostics using <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. Our study provides insights into the diversity and genomic epidemiology of STHs, highlighting challenges and opportunities for developing molecular diagnostics needed to support STH control efforts.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), which include the giant roundworm (<italic>Ascaris lumbricoides)</italic>, threadworm <italic>(Strongyloides stercoralis)</italic>, whipworms (<italic>Trichuris trichiura)</italic>, and hookworms (<italic>Necator americanus</italic> and <italic>Ancylostoma duodenale)</italic>, collectively infect nearly a quarter of the world’s human population. Infections are established from the consumption of infective eggs or penetration of the skin by infective larvae followed by migration to the hosts’ intestines, where STHs sexually mature, reproduce and lay eggs that are passed in the faeces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. <italic>Strongyloides</italic> species are unique in that their eggs hatch within the host, and larvae pass into the faeces, some of which can develop directly into infectious larvae and autoinfect the host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Light intensity STH infections are often asymptomatic, but moderate-to-heavy intensity infections can cause significant morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, including anaemia, malaise and weakness, intestinal obstruction, malnutrition, impaired growth and developmental delay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Control of STHs relies almost exclusively on annual or biannual mass drug administration (MDA) of anthelmintics to at-risk populations (preschool and school-aged children (SAC) as well as women of reproductive age) or to entire communities to reduce morbidity and transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>; along with health education and the improvement of water, sanitation and hygiene conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.

Moreover, validation of new assays using a cohort of geographically diverse samples that are representative of continent, region, and/or country would provide a greater understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the assay and, potentially, greater confidence in their application in new populations.</p><p id="P20">Our study emphasises the importance of sampling a wider range of human and nonhuman hosts globally to improve our understanding of the genetic makeup and evolution of STHs over time and space. Further work to define the genetic connectivity of STH populations may enable the definition of transmission zones and networks, providing a more precise means to prioritise control efforts. Our analyses provide a clear rationale for more comprehensive evaluation and validation of repetitive sequences currently being used as targets of molecular diagnostics. Collectively, these data and subsequent studies will form the foundations for the genomic epidemiology of all STH and their sustainable control as a public health problem.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Origin of samples and datasets</title><p id="P21">The complete list of samples, country of origin, and accession numbers are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and are further described in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref>.

Due to the large effects of the SNPs and other mismatches within the primer binding site of the wildtype samples, the mean fold loss of the wildtype is relative to the canonical repeat, whereas the mean fold loss of the mutant is relative to the wildtype repeat, within each assay.
