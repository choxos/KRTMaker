health and disease of humans and model organisms. However, for non-model species, reassessment and refinement of conventional methods to address novel technical and biological challenges are needed. Here, we evaluate three established nuclei isolation protocols and, building on experiences, optimised single nuclei isolation for parasitic nematodes (SNIP). We test the versatility of SNIP across diverse species and life stages, validating it with snRNA-seq to reveal sex, stage, and tissue-specific gene expression.

Applying sc/snRNA-seq to non-model organisms does, however, bring new biological and technical challenges that may need to be overcome. For example, the biological richness of non-model organism diversity brings a diversity of cell and tissue types that vary in their morphology and composition and will differ in their sensitivities toward cellular and nuclei dissociation. Further, sample access may be impacted by geographic or biological constraints, limiting the availability of or access to fresh material. Understanding and overcoming these challenges will likely require organism-specific biological knowledge. Therefore, conventional, well-established methods developed for model organisms may need adaptation and refinement for use in non-model organisms.</p><p id="P3">A field with exclusively non-model organisms that stands to benefit greatly from understanding biology at a single-cell resolution is parasitology. scRNA-seq of single-cell eukaryotic parasites such as <italic>Plasmodium spp</italic>. and <italic>Trypanosoma spp</italic>. has been particularly successful, with significant advances made in understanding life stage-specific gene expression patterns and transitions during their life cycles, mechanisms of infection and disease progression, as well as identifying new drug targets for interrupting transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. In contrast, the application of scRNA-seq for multicellular parasites has encountered distinct challenges due to vast differences in life history traits and hosts and great diversity in body plan and cellular composition between and even within species throughout their life cycles. Multicellular parasites are exposed to variable environmental conditions inside and outside the host, necessitating a toughened outer coating (i.e. cuticle, tegument, exoskeleton), which presents a major obstacle for single-cell/nuclei isolation. Further, because most species cannot be cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>, access to obligate parasitic stages can be geographically restricted and difficult or impossible to collect without sampling post-mortem. Despite these challenges, there are a growing number of single-cell life-stage atlases for parasitic helminths including the trematodes <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] and <italic>Fasciola hepatica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. More recently, cell atlases have been generated for <italic>Brugia malayi</italic> microfilariae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], <italic>Ascaris suum</italic> intestinal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], and <italic>Heligmosomoides bakeri</italic> mixed-sex adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. These studies often exploit protocols developed for mammalian tissues, although it is unclear how transferable and efficient these different single-cell isolation methods are for diverse species and life cycle stages of parasitic helminths.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we have tested and compared three widely-used single nuclei isolation protocols for use in snRNA-seq of parasitic nematodes. We focused on isolating single nuclei as opposed to single cells because frozen material can be used, providing many advantages, including sampling across life stages, the ability to collect and store samples over time, and simultaneous processing to minimise batch effects. Building on our experiences from the three-protocol comparison, we have developed a new nuclei isolation protocol and tested it on multiple life cycle stages and sexes of two gastrointestinal parasitic nematodes, <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> and <italic>Trichuris muris</italic>. We assessed the nuclei preparations from our protocol using the Parse Biosciences Evercode WT platform for snRNA-seq and Illumina sequencing. Here, we provide the protocol and discuss some of the challenges and opportunities of sc/snRNA-seq approaches to advance the adoption of this technology in non-model organisms and its applications to better understand helminth biology.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Comparison of three existing nuclei isolation protocols</title><p id="P5">To optimise a protocol for generating single nuclei suspensions from parasitic nematodes, we first compared the strengths and limitations of three established isolation protocols: (i) a <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> nuclei isolation protocol (hereinafter referred to as “Celegans”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], (ii) a Human Cell Atlas (HCA) protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], and (iii) the Frankenstein protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. The Celegans protocol was the only protocol explicitly used for a nematode. The HCA protocol has been extensively used on a wide range of mammalian tissues as part of the Human Cell Atlas Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. The Frankenstein protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] was chosen for its positive reputation amongst the 10X Genomics user community. An overview of the four key steps of the three protocols is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 A</xref>, which include tissue disruption, cell lysis and dissociation, homogenisation, and debris removal. Each protocol was performed using ten frozen adult female <italic>H. contortus</italic> worms to enable comparison between protocols.</p><sec id="S4"><title>Tissue disruption</title><p id="P6">Tissue disruption is the first stage of the process and involves breaking the tissue to reveal the cellular contents within. This step is particularly important for nematodes, which have a highly cross-linked acellular cuticle that, depending on the organism’s life history or life stage, provides protection from its environment, either inside or outside a host.</p><p id="P7">The HCA and Frankenstein methods involve mincing the tissue into smaller pieces using a scalpel, while the Celegans method does not include a tissue disruption step; however, considering <italic>C. elegans</italic> small size (~1 mm x 50 μm), exposure of cellular contents occurs during homogenisation below.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cell Lysis</title><p id="P8">The lysis step breaks down tissue and disrupt cellular membranes to make the nuclei accessible. The lysis buffer works in conjunction with mechanical homogenisation to create a nuclei suspension. Thus, the effectiveness of the lysis buffer, on its own, is not easily measured.</p><p id="P9">Different lysis buffers are used in each protocol, although all lysis buffer recipes typically contain the same four basic ingredients: 1) detergent to disrupt the cell membrane (e.g. Triton X-100, SDS); 2) pH stabiliser (e.g. HEPES, Tris-HCl); 3) salt to add ionic strength to facilitate cell disruption (e.g. MgCl<sub>2</sub> NaCl<sub>2</sub>, KCl); and 4) RNase inhibitor to protect RNA degradation (e.g. DTT, recombinant enzyme RNase inhibitor, EDTA). Additional RNase inhibitor was not added to the commercial lysis buffer used in the Frankenstein protocol.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Homogenisation</title><p id="P10">Homogenisation aims to completely release the cells from tissues and nuclei from cells, ensuring the suspension is free from clumps. The Celegans and HCA protocols use a glass Dounce tissue grinder to achieve a single nuclei suspension. The Celegans protocol uses ten strokes with the tight Dounce tissue grinder pestle followed by two sets of ten strokes with a plastic micro-pestle. In between each homogenisation set, the nuclei suspension is collected using low-speed centrifugation to separate it from large undigested tissue and avoid over-homogenisation. The HCA homogenisation step required continuous homogenisation with the Dounce tissue grinder with 10-20 strokes. In contrast, the Frankenstein protocol only used a plastic micro-pestle, a 5-minute incubation in the lysis buffer, and mixing with a wide-bore pipette tip.</p><p id="P11">We examined the samples after the homogenisation stage by microscopy to determine the amount of intact tissue vs empty cuticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 B</xref>). Empty cuticle debris was observed in the Celegans protocol, showing complete tissue homogenisation with the tight Dounce tissue grinder pestle. Large fragments of worms were prominent in the HCA and Frankenstein homogenates, indicating incomplete homogenisation.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Debris removal</title><p id="P12">The preceding steps generate significant amounts of debris, including acellular material that cannot be digested or homogenised and cellular material resulting from cell lysis. Large debris (&gt;30 μm) can cause clogs or wetting failures in microfluidics-based library protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], such as 10X Genomics, but presents less of a problem in combinatorial indexing strategies in which nuclei are distributed in microtitre plates. Nonetheless, small debris (&lt;30 μm) may contain ambient RNA, increasing the transcriptional background noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>], and should be removed.</p><p id="P13">All three protocols used at least one strainer for large debris removal and one wash for small debris removal. The Celegans protocol utilises low-speed centrifugation, buffer wash, and a 40 μm strainer. The HCA protocol strains the homogenate through a 40 μm filter, followed by a wash and Percoll density gradient. In the Frankenstein method, the homogenate is cleaned through a 70 μm strainer, washed, and then passed through a 35 μm strainer. Large debris was easily removed in all three protocols with cell strainers. Small debris was observed in all three protocols but was most visually abundant in the Celegans protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 B</xref>). The Percoll density gradient used in the HCA protocol did not remove more small debris than the other protocols but doubled the protocol time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Outcome</title><p id="P14">The resulting nuclei suspensions of the three protocols were assessed based on the total nuclei, RNA concentration, and nuclei morphology. Using ten female <italic>H. contortus</italic> worms as input, the Celegans, HCA, and Frankenstein protocols resulted in a mean recovery of 7,700 ± 1,540 standard deviation (SD), 19,227 ± 3,520 SD, and 13,678 ± 1,265 SD nuclei, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 C</xref>). Comparison of the three protocols revealed a significant difference between Celegans and HCA (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0065; t(4) = 5.1960), and Celegans and Frankenstein (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0065; t(4) = 5.1951), but was not statistically significant between HCA and Frankenstein (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0620; t(4) = 2.5690). Analysis of RNA concentration revealed that the Frankenstein protocol recovered the highest amount of RNA (11,790pg) followed by the HCA and Celegans protocols (7,770 pg and 5,940 pg), respectively. The RNA concentrations were below the assay limits for reporting an RNA integrity number (RIN); however, consistent with concentration, the Frankenstein protocol presented the most prominent 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA peaks on the High Sensitivity RNA tapestation gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 D</xref>). Considering the nuclei count from the replicate used for RNA extraction from the Celegans, HCA, and Frankenstein protocols, we isolated 0.52 pg of RNA/nucleus, 0.41 pg of RNA/nucleus, and 0.81 pg of RNA/nucleus, respectively. Finally, we assessed nuclei morphology to compare suspensions from the three protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 E</xref>). We observed notable degradation of the nuclear envelope in the Celegans protocol nuclei, which, in part, explains the poorer RNA recovery. An example of this can be seen in the FITC-SYBR Green I and overlay images of the nucleus isolated using the Celegans protocol in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 E</xref>; a broken nuclear membrane is shown leaking fluorescently stained nucleic acid contents. In contrast, most nuclei isolated from the Frankenstein protocol have smooth and intact membranes, and various nuclei sizes were recovered, suggesting the recovery of nuclei from diverse cell types.</p><p id="P15">In summary, the Frankenstein protocol generated the most RNA per nucleus and the most consistent morphologically robust and diverse nuclei despite slightly lower total nuclei recovered than the HCA protocol.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Optimisation of the <bold>S</bold>ingle <bold>N</bold>uclei Isolation of <bold>P</bold>arasites (<bold>SNIP</bold>) protocol</title><p id="P16">Next, we sought to improve nuclei isolation in parasitic nematodes based on lessons learned from performing the three initial protocols. The key stages of the optimised protocol are outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 A</xref> and summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p id="P17">We used frozen worms, which enabled greater flexibility in collecting and storing samples before processing. However, one disadvantage of the HCA and Frankenstein protocols was that the tissue was minced or chopped with a scalpel in a petri dish on wet ice, resulting in the worms immediately thawing, which could lead to degraded RNA and decreased nuclei quality if not processed quickly. To prevent this, for the macroscopic stages (e.g. adult worms of <italic>H. contortus</italic> and <italic>T. muris</italic>) we used spring scissors to cut through the cuticle and obtain &lt;2 mm pieces in the sample tube on dry ice. We ground the microscopic stages (e.g. larvae of <italic>H. contortus</italic>) using a mortar and pestle placed in dry ice. This technique enabled the tissue to be kept in a single tube and minimised sample loss, which is important when the starting material is limited, while keeping the sample frozen.</p><p id="P18">Damaged nuclei release soluble, “sticky” DNA, which can result in the clumping of intact nuclei. To address this, we included a DNase I enzyme and required MgCl<sub>2</sub> in the lysis buffer. Similarly, when lysing cells for single nuclei isolation, RNases are released; thus, to prevent RNA degradation, we added an RNase inhibitor to both the lysis and wash buffers. We note that several RNase inhibitors are commercially available; however, some brands have been associated with lower cDNA yield when used for particular scRNA-seq protocols and technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Therefore, we suggest selecting a recommended RNase inhibitor based on the intended downstream single-cell platform.</p><p id="P19">The Frankenstein and HCA protocols resulted in a large amount of undigested tissue, whereas homogenisation in the Celegans protocol was too harsh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 B</xref>). Therefore, we optimised the Dounce homogenisation, focusing on the number of strokes and using different-sized Dounce tissue grinder pestles. We found that five strokes with the loose Dounce tissue grinder pestle exposed worm tissue that had not been adequately disrupted with scissors in the previous step and released the first nuclei from well-exposed tissue pieces. Then, using the tight Dounce tissue grinder pestle, tissue and cells were lysed to release the maximum number of nuclei. After each set of strokes with the Dounce tissue grinder pestles, the large undigested tissue pieces were allowed to settle for up to 4 minutes, and the suspended nuclei in the supernatant were collected to prevent lysis from further homogenisation. This additional short incubation in the lysis buffer allowed the complete lysis of the cells within larger chunks of worm tissue. Collecting the nuclei suspension throughout the homogenisation is a step taken from the Celegans protocol. Homogenisation was deemed complete when the suspension was clear to the naked eye.</p><p id="P20">Removing both small and large debris in nematode nuclei suspensions is necessary due to the amount of debris generated from the cuticle and lysed cells; however, each method and iteration of debris removal results in nuclei loss and additional processing time. We found large debris was best removed by allowing the debris to settle by gravity during dissociation and filtering the final suspension through a 30 μm cell strainer. To ensure maximal recovery and minimise nuclei loss, we washed the cell strainer with additional wash buffer and pipetted the suspension through on the side of the filter with the tip against the mesh.</p><p id="P21">However, we found the only effective and efficient way to remove small debris from the nuclei suspensions was through Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Small cellular and cuticle debris, abundant in the pre-sorted female <italic>H. contortus</italic> sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 B</xref>), are removed efficiently with FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 C</xref>). The gating strategy for selecting SYBR Green I positively stained nuclei for FACS was determined using an unstained negative control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P22">We compared the nuclei count and RNA quality of our optimised nuclei isolation protocol with those of the three tested protocols. When starting with the same amount of adult worms, the optimised protocol had a mean recovery of 31,797 nuclei which is 4.1-fold more nuclei than the Celegans protocol (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0001, t(4) = 18.8851), 1.7-fold more than the HCA protocol (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0049, t(4) = 5.6394), and 2.3-fold more nuclei than the Frankenstein protocol (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0001, t(4) = 15.4725). RNA concentration for the optimised protocol was 210.0 ng, which equated to approximately 2.62 pg/nucleus; this equated to a 3.23-fold increase in RNA received per nucleus relative to 0.81 pg/nucleus from the previous best-performing Frankenstein protocol. The resulting nuclei have smooth nuclear membranes, and very few nuclei showed signs of damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 B, C</xref>), indicating a high-quality suspension to proceed with sequencing library preparation.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Validation of the SNIP protocol on multiple life stages of <italic>H. contortus and T. muris</italic></title><p id="P23">Once optimised, we further tested our protocol with adult male, adult female, and third-stage (L3) larvae of <italic>H. contortus</italic> and with adult female and male <italic>T. muris</italic> (mouse whipworm), a biologically and phylogenetically distinct parasitic nematode species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p><p id="P24">The microscopic size of L3 larvae of <italic>H. contortus</italic> precludes the use of scissors to cut the cuticle of the worms in the tissue disruption step of our protocol. Therefore, to ensure tissue disruption of this life stage, we ground the frozen larval pellet using a porcelain mortar and pestle on dry ice and then transferred the sample to the Dounce tube using a microspatula. Next, we optimised the number of sets of Dounce homogenisation strokes with the tight Dounce tissue grinder pestle. Homogenisation of the macroscopic adult worm samples was completed after one set of the loose Dounce tissue grinder strokes and two sets of tight Dounce tissue grinder strokes, as evidenced by a clear supernatant in the Dounce tube. In contrast, L3 larvae did not homogenise as easily and required additional sets of homogenisation with the tight Dounce tissue grinder pestle until the supernatant in the Dounce tube was clear to the naked eye. This was validated by fluorescent staining of aliquots of the supernatant after each round. In our hands, a maximum tissue volume equivalent to 20 μL per 1 mL Dounce capacity was optimal without requiring excessive time to complete homogenisation. Importantly, additional sets of the tight Dounce tissue grinder strokes do not result in nuclei lysis because the supernatant containing nuclei is collected after each Dounce homogenisation set.</p><p id="P25">Manual nuclei counts for three independent replicates of each species and life stage tested are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 A</xref>. Although our protocol was optimised using female <italic>H. contortus</italic>, it proved even more effective on the female <italic>T. muris</italic> samples; the number of nuclei isolated per worm was significantly higher in the adult female <italic>T. muris</italic> (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mtext>x</mml:mtext><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> = 26,675.33 nuclei/worm) than in <italic>H. contortus</italic> (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M2"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mtext>x</mml:mtext><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> = 3,570 nuclei/worm) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0001, t(4) = 15.9198). This is, in part, explained by the differences in parasite size; adult female <italic>H. contortus</italic> worms are between 20-30 mm x 300-500 μm, and adult female <italic>T. muris</italic> worms are 35-50 mm x 40-600 μm. The large range in width of <italic>T. muris</italic> is due to its whip-like intracellular anterior end. RNA recovery was 210.0 ng for <italic>H. contortus</italic> females, 37.9 pg for <italic>H. contortus</italic> males, 23.9 ng for <italic>H. contortus</italic> L3s, 901.6 ng for <italic>T. muris</italic> females, and 2,310.0 ng for <italic>T. muris</italic> males. This equates to approximately 2.62 pg/nucleus for <italic>H. contortus</italic> females, 0.53 pg/nucleus for <italic>H. contortus</italic> males, 0.17 pg/nucleus for <italic>H. contortus</italic> L3s, 1.66 pg/nucleus for <italic>T. muris</italic> females, and 2.50 pg/nucleus for <italic>T. muris</italic> males.</p><p id="P26">The FACS analysis of samples collected and fixed for snRNA-seq is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 B</xref>. Nuclei were sorted on a SYBR Green I positive signal (shown in the green box) with percentages of total events presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 B</xref>). An aliquot of unstained nuclei was used to determine gating for a SYBR Green I positive signal (FACS plots shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 1-2</xref>). The distinct clusters of SYBR Green I fluorescence-positive nuclei in the adult worm samples reflect different levels of ploidy within nuclei populations that, while well understood in the free-living model nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], are observed here for the first time for <italic>H.contortus</italic> and <italic>T. muris</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Single nuclei RNA sequencing identifies distinct cellular populations in different parasite life stages</title><p id="P27">To validate our optimised nuclei isolation protocol, we performed snRNA-seq on the nuclei suspensions obtained from the different species and life stages. We chose to use the Parse Biosciences Evercode platform, based on Split Pool Ligation-based Transcriptome sequencing (SPLiT-seq) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], over other commercial high-throughput platforms, such as 10X Genomics Chromium, primarily to enable greater flexibility in sampling different life stages throughout a life cycle (in preparation for developmental cell atlases). Specifically, with this technology, nuclei preparations from individual stages could be collected at different times, fixed, and stored frozen for up to six months before library preparation, enabling the processing of different samples together and thus minimising a source of technical bias between samples and replicates.</p><p id="P28">We performed two rounds of library preparation and sequencing, designated “experiment 1” and “experiment 2,” using the Parse Biosciences Evercode WT Mini kit. This kit allows up to 10,000 nuclei to be sequenced per experiment and distributed between 1 and 12 samples. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows the total nuclei and median genes and transcripts per nucleus from sequencing nuclei libraries of the two parasites and different life stages from experiments 1 and 2. The number of wells per sample was determined for both experiments based on the starting nuclei concentration. In experiment 1, we obtained consistent counts of genes and transcripts per nuclei for all stages. However, the total nuclei counts were more variable, with higher counts for <italic>T. muris</italic> adult females (n = 1,317) and lowest for <italic>H. contortus</italic> adult males (n = 224). For experiment 2, we increased the number of starting nuclei, which increased the number of total nuclei recovered. However, this experiment was also variable and was somewhat dependent on the starting nuclei concentration; here, the nuclei counts of <italic>T. muris</italic> adult males were lower concentration and required three wells, whereas the counts for <italic>H. contortus</italic> L3 were higher and only required one well.</p><p id="P29">The sequencing aimed to validate the library preparation approach on various sample inputs, not to generate comprehensive scRNA-seq data for a full description of transcriptional variation, which requires far larger numbers of nuclei or cells per sample. Nonetheless, despite low sample input, analysis of transcript expression per species revealed clusters of nuclei based on: 1) life stage and sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 A,F</xref> for <italic>H. contortus</italic> and <italic>T. muris</italic>, respectively); and 2) clustering of nuclei that were shared or unique to life stages and cell and tissue-specific variation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 B,G</xref>). Here, we have inferred the putative function of each cluster based on gene set enrichment and orthology from the model free-living nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, revealing stage and tissue-specific gene expression such as putative mechanosensory neurons in <italic>H. contortus</italic> L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 C</xref>) and vulval muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 D</xref>) and sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 E</xref>) specific to adult female and males, respectively. Similar stage and tissue-specific expression were observed in <italic>T. muris</italic>, highlighting nuclei associated with gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 H</xref>) and highly distinct neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 I</xref>) specific to males, as well as a cluster highly enriched in WAP-domain/S1 peptidase protein expression-specific to females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 J</xref>). We acknowledge that significant evolutionary and phylogenetic differences between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the parasite species examined here mean that “marker genes” used to characterise a cell or tissue type must be applied cautiously. Considering the sparse functional annotation information for non-model species such as parasitic nematodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], data such as these represent both a challenge and an opportunity for improving genomic resources for these species and toward building more comprehensive cell and nuclei atlases for understanding their biology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">In this study, we evaluated three existing protocols for isolating single nuclei for snRNA-seq, from which we optimised a method for recovering nuclei from parasitic nematodes (SNIP). Our motivation for this work is to create robust cell atlases to better understand parasitic nematode development, shed light on the tissues and organs that mediate interactions with their hosts, and discover novel drug targets and mechanisms of drug resistance. Here, we discuss the rationale of our approach, challenges faced, and ongoing limitations to be overcome towards applying snRNA-seq for parasitic nematodes specifically, but more generally, the application of cellular-resolution technologies toward other complex and enigmatic non-model organisms.</p><p id="P31">The use of single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing to understand the fundamental biology of organisms at cellular resolution is advancing rapidly. Although there are successful examples of cell atlases of specific life stages or tissues of multicellular parasites using scRNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], we specifically chose to use snRNA-seq for several reasons. First, we want to collect and analyse different life stages of parasites over time and in response to perturbation, for example, drug treatment exposure. Whereas scRNA-seq typically requires the rapid processing of fresh tissue and live cells after recovery through to library preparation, snRNA-seq enables sample preservation via freezing, allowing the collection of samples over time that can be processed together, thus reducing library and sequencing batch effects. Here, we demonstrated the versatility of the protocol by sampling multiple species and life stages, each derived from different hosts (<italic>H. contortus</italic> in sheep and <italic>T. muris</italic> from mice) and sampling strategies (invasive and non-invasive sampling from hosts). Moreover, the freezing of parasites enabled sample collection and shipment from geographically distant collaborators rather than having to be physically located with the specimens at the time of collection for immediate processing. Such an approach opens up the possibility of sampling other non-model organisms from diverse or difficult-to-access locations worldwide, provided they can be frozen shortly after collection. The second reason for a nuclei-focused approach is the challenge of tissue dissociation into living cells. Both scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq aim to mirror the transcriptome of cells in tissue, and thus, the recovery of “healthy” cells is paramount. However, stress caused by a combination of physical and/or enzymatic treatment, temperature, and time can alter transcriptional profiles and result in artefacts during data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Therefore, effective cellular disassociation of an organism or tissue for scRNA-seq requires a balance between sufficient effort (physical or enzymatic) to disassociate and sufficient care not to damage cells or nuclei so they can be processed. The dissociation of frozen tissue to collect nuclei, in which transcriptional profiles are less susceptible to change and therefore better reflect the transcriptome signature of the cells, can be preferred for difficult-to-dissociate tissues that require greater physical forces to be applied during disassociation. We anticipated this to be important for dissociating parasitic nematodes, many of which are protected by a strong acellular cuticle and sheath and can be very resistant to breaking. Furthermore, our optimised protocol significantly improved the disassociation time; the original protocols tested took ~40-45 minutes to complete, whereas the optimised protocol took ~25 minutes. Other advantages of snRNA-seq over scRNA-seq include the capture of a greater diversity of cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], likely due to differential susceptibility to damage between cell types, and the physical constraints of cell size of commonly used microfluidic technologies, for example, 10X Genomics has a recommended maximum cell size limit of 30 μm and a maximum physical microfluidic channel width of 50-60 μm. Cell sizes are known to vary significantly in nematodes; for example, during the development of the model free-living nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the intestine significantly increases in tissue volume through to adulthood primarily due to intestinal cells growing in size, becoming multinucleated and polyploid, rather than a large increase in cell number by cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. We anticipate similar cell-size variation in the closely related <italic>H. contortus</italic> and may equally apply to specialised tissues such as the elongated stichosome of <italic>T. muris</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Moreover, approximately 30% of <italic>C. elegans</italic> somatic nuclei are contained in large, multinucleated cells due to cellular fusion during development to form complex tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Due to their unusual cell morphology properties, these cell types will likely be better represented in snRNA-seq than in scRNA-seq data.</p><p id="P32">We overcame several challenges during protocol development. For adult stages of parasitic worms, we found that chopping frozen tissue in a single tube on dry ice resulted in more efficient disassociation and lysis than thawing and mincing tissue. However, dissociating microscopic <italic>H. contortus</italic> L3 larvae, an environmentally robust free-living life stage with a sheath surrounding its external cuticle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], proved more challenging. We explored several approaches, including a <italic>C. elegans</italic> nuclei isolation protocol by Cao <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] that used shearing forces from pipetting samples through a 21 G needle for initial tissue disruption. However, in our hands, the <italic>H. contortus</italic> L3 larvae did not shear, whereas the larger adult stages persistently clogged the needle. Our approach of pre-grinding frozen L3 with a porcelain mortar and pestle, followed by a combination of loose and tight Douce strokes and recovery of nuclei in between sets of strokes, improved nuclei recovery significantly. Throughout the protocol, nuclei were lost at each step. We tackled this by recovering nuclei during homogenisation in stages, which prevented excessive mechanical damage and thus maximised the collection of intact nuclei. Once collected, nuclei needed to undergo filtration to remove large and small debris; we found that a single wash step and a 30 μm filter with a filter wash removes sufficient small and large debris to prevent clogging of the FACS machine capillaries while minimising nuclei loss. The Celegans protocol recommended using Flowmi Cell Strainers, which attach directly to a pipette; however, we found they were easily clogged by the amount of debris in parasitic nematode nuclei suspensions and could not be easily washed to increase nuclei recovery. Furthermore, while FACS removes small debris, reveals diverse nuclei populations, and provides another count measurement, it can also lead to loss of nuclei and decreased nuclei quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. The use of FACS as a filtration step may depend on the degree of debris, and may be worth comparing nuclei for sequencing with and without FACS if debris is minimal. We also experienced nuclei loss during the fixation process of the Parse Biosciences Evercode protocol for snRNA-seq. Parse Biosciences recommends that high nuclei numbers be fixed to account for loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]; however, the loss seems sample-dependent and fixation requires optimisation to minimise its impact. For example, the <italic>T. muris</italic> adult male nuclei suspension had a 69.33% nuclei loss vs only 11.88% for <italic>T. muris</italic> adult female samples. This result suggests that some nuclei are more fragile or could be indicative of more extensive nuclear blebbing in the <italic>T. muris</italic> male nuclei, causing an already compromised nuclear envelope to lyse during fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Similarly, the Parse Biosciences WT Mini library preparation requires high sample inputs (~55,000 cells/nuclei) at particular concentrations (between 298 and 3,575 cells/nuclei per μL as determined by the number of samples), which can be challenging to achieve with low biomass samples. One potential solution is to combine and concentrate fixed nuclei samples to obtain the proper input concentration, with the caveat that it can result in significant overall nuclei loss due to additional centrifugation and resuspension.</p><p id="P33">We acknowledge several limitations to our study. While we have gained insights from the two specific parasitic nematode species tested, nuclei isolations from other species (and extension to other non-model organisms) may present their own challenges and require species-specific optimisation, specifically in regard to the number of Dounce tissue grinder strokes. Some variation in nuclei counts may be due to differences in the susceptibility or resistance of some tissues and cell types to disruption. Until more dense atlases are created and a better understanding of cellular/nuclei proportions is made, this is difficult to address. We used Parse Biosciences for library preparation to enable the storage and simultaneous processing of different samples across life stages. However, as described above, the fixation and thawing lead to considerable nuclei loss. If individual or few samples can be processed without freezing and thawing after fixation, higher nuclei counts and more input material for library prep will likely be achieved.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P34">We have built on existing approaches to develop an optimised protocol for single nuclei isolation of parasitic nematodes for snRNA-seq. Validation on several diverse species and multiple life stages demonstrates versatility, and critical evaluation of crucial steps enables a significant head-start for using this protocol to isolate nuclei from other non-model organisms. The increasing accessibility of cellular-resolution techniques and optimised protocols will advance the understanding of organisms, such as parasitic nematodes, from fundamental biology to infection and disease, and toward novel approaches to control them.</p></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S15"><title>Trichuris muris</title><sec id="S16"><title>Mice</title><p id="P35">NSG (NOD.Cg-<italic>Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl</italic>/SzJ) mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions, under a 12 h light/dark cycle at a temperature of 19-24°C and humidity between 40 and 65%.
