Here, we investigate how the microenvironment of the injured cerebellum changes upon injury and contributes to the regenerative potential of normally gliogenic-NEPs and their adaptive reprogramming. Single cell transcriptomic and bulk chromatin accessibility analyses of the NEPs from injured neonatal cerebella compared to controls show a temporary increase in cellular processes involved in responding to reactive oxygen species (ROS), a known damage-associated molecular pattern. Analysis of ROS levels in cerebellar tissue confirm a transient increased one day after injury at postanal day 1, overlapping with the peak cell death in the cerebellum. In a transgenic mouse line that ubiquitously overexpresses human mitochondrial catalase (mCAT), ROS is reduced 1 day after injury to the granule cell progenitors, and we demonstrate that several steps in the regenerative process of NEPs are curtailed leading to reduced cerebellar growth. We also provide evidence that microglia are involved in one step of adaptive reprogramming by regulating NEP replenishment of the granule cell precursors. Collectively, our results highlight that changes in the tissue microenvironment regulate multiple steps in adaptative reprogramming of NEPs upon death of cerebellar granule cell progenitors at birth, highlighting the instructive roles of microenvironmental signals during regeneration of the neonatal brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Nestin-expressing progenitors</kwd><kwd>NEPs</kwd><kwd>granule cell progenitors</kwd><kwd>ROS</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The microenvironment surrounding a brain injury and the cellular responses elicited in the remaining cells are key determinants of how efficiently a repair process will unfold. An important factor underlying the effectiveness of regenerative responses to an injury is the plasticity of the stem/progenitor cells in a tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Burda and Sofroniew, 2014</xref>). The degree to which the microenvironment and specific cell types within it provide pro- or anti-regenerative factors is highly context dependent. The neonatal mouse cerebellum has a remarkable capacity to regenerate cells ablated around birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Wojcinski et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bayin N. S., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bayin et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Altman and Anderson, 1971</xref>). Thus, the cerebellum provides an ideal system to study the roles that signals in the microenvironment play in key steps of the repair process in the brain.</p><p id="P3">The cerebellum is a folded hindbrain structure that is critical for motor coordination. It also participates in higher order social and cognitive behaviors through its circuit connections with all other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Badura et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Buckner, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Burda and Sofroniew, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Salman and Tsai, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Strick et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Tomlinson et al., 2013</xref>). Compared to the rest of the brain, the cerebellum has protracted development, as its major growth occurs during the first two weeks after birth in mice and at least six months surrounding birth in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Altman and Bayer, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Rakic and Sidman, 1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dobbing and Sands, 1973</xref>). This timing of the major growth of the cerebellum makes it susceptible to injury around birth. Indeed, cerebellar hypoplasia is the second leading risk factor for autism spectrum disorders and cerebellar injury around birth can have devastating outcomes and significant effects on subsequent quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Stoodley et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is critical to better understand the regenerative processes that allow repair of the cerebellum.</p><p id="P4">All the cell types in the cerebellum are derived from two progenitor zones, the embryonic rhombic lip and the ventricular zone that give rise to the excitatory neurons, or the inhibitory neurons and glia, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Leto et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Joyner and Bayin, 2022</xref>). During postnatal growth, the rhombic lip-derived granule cell precursors (GCPs) cover the surface of the cerebellum in a structure named the external granule layer (EGL) and continue to proliferate in a sonic hedgehog (SHH) dependent manner for two weeks after birth in mice (Wechsler-Reya and Scott, 1999, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">McMahon et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Corrales et al., 2006</xref>). Following their exit from the cell cycle, the granule cells (GC) migrate inwards to form the internal granule layer (IGL). Other SHH-dependent progenitor populations of the neonatal cerebellum are either gliogenic Nestin-Expressing Progenitors (NEPs) that express SOX2 and generate astroglia (astrocytes and Bergman glia) or neurogenic-NEPs that generate late born interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bayin N. S., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cerrato et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Parmigiani et al., 2015</xref>). Gliogenic-NEPs reside either in the Bergmann glia layer (BgL) intermixed with Purkinje cells and generate Bergmann glia (Bg) and astrocytes, or in the white matter in the center of the lobules (folds) and generate astrocytes. Neurogenic-NEPs are restricted to the white matter and produce interneurons that migrate outwards to the outermost molecular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bayin N. S., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Brown et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">De Luca et al., 2015</xref>). Surprisingly, when the GCPs are killed upon injury soon after birth, the gliogenic-NEPs in the BgL (BgL-NEPs) undergo adaptive reprogramming to generate GCPs and replenish the EGL via a transitory cellular state that involves upregulation of the neurogenic gene <italic>Ascl1</italic> to promote a glial-to-neural fate switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Wojcinski et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bayin N. S., 2021</xref>). Adaptive reprogramming involves multiple sequential stages starting with increased proliferation of BgL-NEPs, then a fate switch to neuronal progenitors, migration to the site of injury (EGL) and acquisition of a GCP identity. The full repertoire of injury-induced signals that initiate and govern adaptive reprogramming remains to be discovered.</p><p id="P5">In the adult brain, numerous cell types communicate and provide a concerted response to injury, including astrocytes, microglia (macrophages of the brain) and stem cells of the neurogenic niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Frik et al., 2018</xref>). The timelines of the cellular responses of each cell type to injury - cell death, activation of microglia, reactive gliosis, proliferation, scar formation and cellular remodeling - have been delineated for specific adult brain injuries, particularly in the cerebral cortex. For example, upon traumatic brain injury cells release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which act as an inflammatory stimulus and activate microglia that can lead to gliosis, eventually causing neurotoxicity and scarring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Donat et al., 2017</xref>). However, the cellular composition and microenvironment of the early postnatal brain are very different from the adult. In the neonatal cerebellum, microglia are immature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Li et al., 2019</xref>) and are still being generated, and NEPs and GCPs are actively proliferating and producing astroglia and neurons. Therefore, the existing knowledge on how adult brain cells react to injury might not apply to the neonatal cerebellum. For example, in the spinal cord, while neonatal microglia and astrocytes facilitate scarless repair, the same cells in the adult promote scarring upon spinal cord injury in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Li et al., 2020</xref>). It is thus important to study the microenvironment of the neonatal brain during repair to determine what factors promote or inhibit regeneration.</p><p id="P6">Dying cells release many factors, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) that activate signaling cascades in neighboring cells. However, little is known about how these signals regulate brain repair, especially during development. The level of ROS during homeostasis is regulated by metabolic processes, and typically is increased following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Niethammer, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, ROS can directly react with proteins that regulate proliferation, viability, quiescence or differentiation and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bigarella et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Tan and Suda, 2018</xref>). Thus, ROS are considered key signaling molecules that participate in the crosstalk between progenitor cell fate decisions and metabolic switches in a context- and cell type-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bigarella et al., 2014</xref>). One significant mechanism by which ROS signaling is implicated during inflammatory responses following an injury is through the activation of microglia, which in turn can lead to more ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Smith et al., 2022</xref>). This process is critical as it can potentially promote repair. However, the role of ROS signaling during adaptive reprogramming of NEPs following neonatal cerebellar injury is not known.</p><p id="P7">Here we first delineate the sequential changes in the microenvironment upon injury (focused irradiation) to the mouse hindbrain at postnatal day 1 (P1). We then demonstrate a requirement for a transient increase in ROS levels at ∼24 hours (hr) post injury for cerebellar regeneration. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk ATAC-seq analyses revealed increased ROS signaling compared to controls that peaks 24 hr after injury in NEPs, particularly those in the BgL, demonstrating that ROS is an acute signal associated with the NEP response to GCP death. A functional role of ROS signaling was established using a transgene (<italic>mCAT</italic>) that expresses the human mitochondrial Catalase which can reduce ROS levels broadly. Several key steps in adaptive reprogramming were abrogated in <italic>mCAT</italic>/+ mice leading to reduced replenishment of the EGL and a smaller adult cerebellum. Finally, we show that the density of microglia is reduced at P5 in irradiated <italic>mCAT</italic> mice compared to controls and provide evidence that microglia play a role in the step of replenishing the EGL with BgL-derived GCPs during adaptive reprogramming.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animals</title><p id="P8">All the mouse experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) (protocol no. 07-01-001).

In summary, our ATAC-seq data analysis along with the scRNA-seq provide strong evidence that irradiation causes increased ROS signaling predominantly in the BgL-NEPs upon GCP death by inducing transcriptional and epigenetic changes within 1 day after injury (P2). In addition, genes related to cell survival and death, cellular stress and DNA damage are upregulated in NEPs shortly upon injury, possibly as a means to overcome the cellular effects of injury and induce adaptive reprogramming of NEPs to replenish the lost cells.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Transient increase in cerebellar ROS during apoptosis of granule cell precursors</title><p id="P36">To validate that the transient increase in expression of genes associated with cellular stress and ROS signaling in NEPs is due to an increase in ROS upon cerebellar injury, we quantified ROS levels in whole cerebellum samples using a mitochondrial superoxide indicator (MitoSOX) via flow cytometry.

GFAP expression was similar in all glia in both conditions at P8 and P12.

As expected, the density of microglia in the EGL was very low in the nonIR control and <italic>mCAT/+</italic> cerebella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-E</xref>). Interestingly, whereas control IR mice had a similar number of IBA1+ cells in the WM as nonIR mice of both genotypes at P5, the <italic>mCAT</italic>/+ IR mice had a lower density of microglia/macrophages in the WM compared to control IR mice at P5 (p=0.0012, n≥3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-D, F</xref>). This result raised the question of whether macrophages/microglia play a role in adaptive reprogramming. We, therefore, tested whether reducing the density of IBA1+ microglia/macrophages after birth would alter adaptive reprogramming at P5 or cerebellar regeneration at later stages. Since macrophages and cerebellar microglia are dependent on colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) for their survival, we administered PLX5622, a small molecule inhibitor of CSF receptor 1 (CSFR1), to pups every day from P0-5 (PLX treatment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kana et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Tan et al., 2021</xref>). As expected, IBA1+ cells were significantly decreased in the cerebellum of PLX-treated mice at P5 compared to their controls, both nonIR and IR (p=0.0015 and p=0.0059, n=3 and n=5, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6B-E</xref>). The thickness of the EGL was not significantly altered at P5 in PLX-treated IR mice compared to IR controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6H</xref>). Interestingly, similar to <italic>mCAT/+</italic> mice, the density of Nes-CFP+ cells in the EGL was significantly decreased in PLX-treated IR mice compared to IR controls at P5 (p=0.0008, n=5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6I-M</xref>). In contrast, the density of SOX2+ cells in the BgL, corresponding to the gliogenic BgL-NEPs, were unchanged in the PLX-treated and control mice, whether irradiated or not, suggesting that the decrease in expansion of BgL-NEPs caused by ROS is not mediated by microglia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6F</xref>). When mice were treated with PLX from P0-8 and allowed to age to P30, we found the cerebellar vermis section area was not decreased in PLX-treated IR mice compared to IR controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6N</xref>). Thus, reducing the density of IBA1+ microglia/macrophages in neonatal mice reduces the recruitment of Nes-CFP+ cells to the EGL at P5, but does not have a long-term significant impact on regeneration of the cerebellum.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S27" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P43">We demonstrate that a transient increase in ROS signaling after cerebellar injury to the EGL is critical for adaptive reprogramming and full recovery of cerebellar growth. ROS likely acts as an alarm signal shortly after injury and is primarily detected by BgL-NEPs. scRNA-seq at P1-5 and bulk ATAC-seq at P2 of NEPs following targeted irradiation at P1 revealed a rapid increase in transcriptional and epigenetic changes associated with upregulation of ROS and stress related pathways in NEPs that peaked at P2. A transient upregulation in ROS at P2 was confirmed using flow cytometry and found to correlate with the timing of cell death in the EGL one day after irradiation. By reducing mitochondrial ROS levels across all cell types at P2 using a <italic>mCAT</italic> transgene, we uncovered that ROS is required for several steps of adaptive reprogramming of BgL-NEPs. In addition, we found that microglia are reduced in injured <italic>mCAT/+</italic> pups, which is consistent with prior evidence that ROS can trigger immune cell recruitment in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kim et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Mehl et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, temporary depletion of microglia caused a reduction in the number of NEPs that migrate into the EGL at P5 following injury at P1, but no long-term reduction of cerebellar size. Thus, we identified key transcriptomic and epigenomic changes in cerebellar NEPs upon GCP ablation at birth and discovered roles for the tissue microenvironment, especially ROS and a more limited role of microglia during neonatal cerebellum regeneration.</p><p id="P44">scRNA-seq analysis of NEPs from nonIR (P1-3, P5) and nonIR (P2, P3, P5) showed an increase in genes associated with stress responses after irradiation in both the gliogenic and neurogenic subpopulations, but not in the GCPs. Furthermore, a predominant increase in ROS signaling was detected only in the gliogenic-NEPs one day after injury (P2). The injury-induced ROS and stress-related gene signatures were not observed in the later P3+5 gliogenic- and neurogenic-NEPs, suggesting that the increase in ROS levels is an early injury induced signal affecting the NEP transcriptome. Our bulk ATAC-seq data generated at P2 revealed that the open chromatin regions in the IR NEPs were enriched for transcription factor binding motifs related to ROS signaling and stress induced transcription factors such as FOXO3 and AP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>). Thus, cerebellar injury during development induces transcriptional and epigenomic signatures in the NEPs and ROS signaling could be a key driver of NEP adaptive reprogramming. Our results are in line with other regeneration systems where a temporary increase in ROS is observed upon cell death or injury and is considered to be a DAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Niethammer, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P45">Interestingly, although both gliogenic- and neurogenic-NEPs showed induction of cellular stress related genes upon injury, upregulation of ROS signaling and related genes was only observed in the <italic>Hopx</italic>-expressing gliogenic NEPs that undergo adaptive reprogramming. Whether the upregulation of ROS signaling primarily in the BgL-NEPs but not in the <italic>Ascl1+</italic> neurogenic-NEPs is due to BgL-NEPs being in proximity to the dying GCPs after injury or their direct contact due to their radial projections remains to be determined. The ability of BgL-NEPs to respond to GCP death via upregulating ROS signaling and impaired regeneration upon reduction of ROS levels, shows that ROS signaling is involved in triggering adaptive reprogramming upon injury.</p><p id="P46">The cellular composition of the neonatal cerebellum is dramatically different from the adult. During the early postnatal period, we found that astrocytes in the WM below the lobules are the first to initiate GFAP expression at P2 and that by P5 all astrocytes express a high level of GFAP. In contrast, Bg express a low level of GFAP at P5 and reach a high level by P8. Interestingly, we found that injury leads to an increase in the level of GFAP expression in each type of astroglia when they first initiate expression, deep WM astrocytes at P2 and Bg (and all astrocytes) at P5. Once adaptive reprogramming is nearing completion (P8), the GFAP levels remain similar in all astroglia in nonIR and IR cerebella. These results suggest that the neonatal astrocytes respond to injury differently than in the adult where GFAP upregulation is observed immediately after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Burda and Sofroniew, 2014</xref>), since Bg and astrocytes in the lobules have a delayed response to injury with GFAP not being upregulated for several days. Furthermore, at birth the microglia have not fully expanded in number in the cerebellum and previous scRNA-seq showed that the neonatal and adult microglia are transcriptionally distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hammond et al., 2019</xref>). Perhaps neonatal microglia are anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative upon injury in neonates, in contrast to adult microglia where upon traumatic brain injury they can inhibit regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Donat et al., 2017</xref>). Collectively, the differences in glial responses to injury in the neonatal cerebellum and adult brain likely contributes to the permissiveness of the neonatal cerebellum to regeneration. Details of the molecular changes that the neonatal cerebellar microglia/macrophages and astrocytes undergo upon GCP injury and their molecular crosstalk with NEPs remain to be determined.</p><p id="P47">We demonstrated the significance of ROS activation in the NEP reprogramming process using an <italic>mCAT</italic> transgenic mouse line in which human Catalase (CAT) is expressed in mitochondria, a protein that can lead to a reduction in hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and thus lower ROS. However, in <italic>mCAT</italic> neonatal cerebella we found that the percentage of MitoSOX high cells are comparable to control mice under nonIR conditions. Importantly, however, one day after irradiation at P1 when the percentage of MitoSOX high cells increases in control IR mice, the <italic>mCAT</italic> transgene reduces the percentage of MitoSOX high cells, such that it remains at the baseline nonIR <italic>mCAT</italic> level. Therefore, human CAT expression in mitochondria in this model inhibits the injury-induced increase in ROS levels without affecting the homeostatic production of superoxide. Of possible relevance, in this mouse model the observed change in ROS levels is likely global, impacting all cell types. The specific impact of increased mCAT in BgL-NEPs or microglia on their recruitment and function after an injury remains to be determined with new cell type-specific tools.</p><p id="P48">Our experiments depleting microglia using PLX5622 indicate that microglia/macrophages are involved in the regeneration of the EGL following irradiation. Previous studies have demonstrated a dual role of microglia in promoting and inhibiting regenerative processes within the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lee et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Our data support the idea that microglia are involved in the adaptive reprogramming of NEPs to GCPs by promoting their replenishment of GCPs in the EGL. While the direct mechanisms remain to be discovered, this finding highlights that the neonatal microglia support regeneration upon injury to the newborn cerebellum. PLX-treatment for 8 days after irradiation did not reduce the later growth of the injured cerebellum. One possibility is that after the cessation of PLX administration, regeneration proceeds normally. Alternatively, it raises the possibility that an additional regenerative process is required in parallel to microglial signaling.</p><p id="P49">Collectively, we have delineated the spatiotemporal cellular changes in the cerebellar glial microenvironment upon ablation of GCPs at birth and highlight ROS signaling as a key stimulator of adaptive reprogramming of NEPs. How DAMP-glia-progenitor crosstalk is orchestrated remains to be untangled. Understanding how microenvironmental responses shape repair processes is a crucial first step towards developing strategies to promote regeneration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS199518-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d128aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S28"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank past and present members of the Joyner laboratory for discussions and technical help.
