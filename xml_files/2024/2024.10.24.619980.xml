Yet, for many pathogens we know exceptionally little about their epidemiological and population dynamics, and this knowledge gap is slowing the development of efficient control strategies. Here we study the population genomics and molecular epidemiology of wheat powdery mildew, a disease caused by the biotrophic fungus <italic>Blumeria graminis forma specialis tritici</italic> (Bgt). We sampled Bgt for two consecutive years, 2022 and 2023, from 22 countries in Europe and surrounding regions, and compiled a genomic dataset of 415 Bgt isolates. We found one single epidemic unit in the north of Europe, consisting of a highly homogeneous population. Conversely, the south of Europe hosts smaller local populations which are less interconnected. In addition, we show that the population structure can be largely predicted by the prevalent wind patterns. We identified several loci that were under selection in the recent past, including fungicide targets and avirulence genes. Some of these loci are common between populations, while others are not, suggesting different local selective pressures. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of one of these loci, <italic>AvrPm17</italic>, coding for an effector recognized by the wheat receptor Pm17. We found evidence for a soft sweep on standing genetic variation. Multiple <italic>AvrPm17</italic> haplotypes, which can partially escape recognition by Pm17, spread rapidly throughout the continent upon its introduction in the early 2000s. We also identified a new virulent variant, which emerged more recently and can evade <italic>Pm17</italic> resistance altogether. Overall, we highlight the potential of genomic surveillance in resolving the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of agricultural pathogens, as well as in guiding control strategies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Rapid improvement of DNA sequencing technologies accelerated the progress of molecular epidemiology in the last two decades. Large scale real-time whole genome sequencing (WGS) of pathogen populations has become essential for research, surveillance and monitoring of human diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The most glaring example of this development was the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which at its peak saw the sequencing of hundreds of thousands of viral genomes each week. Among other things, this data has been used to track the epidemiological dynamics in different countries, follow the emergence and expansion of new variants, and design vaccines.</p><p id="P3">Beyond being a threat to human health, microbial pathogens are also a major issue in agriculture, where they cause an estimated loss of about 20% of some of the most important crops every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Long before the advent of whole genome sequencing (WGS), it was recognized that population genetics and molecular epidemiology studies could contribute towards understanding the biology of plant pathogens and improving disease control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The potential of these approaches, coupled with WGS, has renewed the interest in pathogen-informed strategies for pest management and resistance breeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Indeed, genomic data has been crucial to understand the emergence and dynamics of different agricultural diseases such as the olive quick decline syndrome in the south of Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], the recent outbreaks of wheat blast in Zambia and Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], and the rapid shift in UK populations of wheat yellow rust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Yet, despite significant progress, our knowledge about the population biology of most agricultural pathogens remains remarkably limited - How far can a pathogen disperse in one season? Which are the main directions and periods of dispersal? How many cycles of sexual and asexual reproduction occur each year? Where was the origin of the inoculum initiating a disease outbreak in a field? How connected are epidemics in different regions? - Often, there is but little evidence available to answer with confidence these and other basic questions about agricultural diseases.</p><p id="P5">In this study we focus on wheat powdery mildew in Europe and the Mediterranean, a region producing more than one third of the global wheat harvest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Powdery mildew is one of the most important wheat diseases, and it is caused by the ascomycete fungus <italic>Blumeria graminis forma specialis tritici</italic> (Bgt) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Bgt is a host-specific obligatory biotroph infecting the epidermal tissue of wheat leaves, spikes and stems. While it can occur everywhere wheat is cultivated, in Europe it is more prevalent at higher latitudes, as it favors temperate climates with cooler temperatures and high humidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. As with other crop pathogens, powdery mildew is controlled with chemical (fungicides) treatments and by breeding resistant wheat varieties. However, Bgt populations are becoming less sensitive to fungicides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], and new resistant host varieties have generally been effective for only a few years after their introduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. The durability of genetic resistance depends both on its physiological and molecular mechanism, and on the evolutionary potential of the pathogen populations which are exposed to it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. While our knowledge of the molecular interactions between wheat and Bgt is improving rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], many fundamental aspects of the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of wheat powdery mildew are still unknown.</p><p id="P6">Though Bgt is known to reproduce both sexually and asexually, it was suggested that sexual reproduction events are rare based on the genomic analysis of four isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. In a recent study, it was reported that European Bgt samples are genetically uniform and that there is no evidence for isolation by distance between them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], suggesting that a single panmictic Bgt population is infecting wheat fields in the continent. However, these results were based on a handful of strains sampled in different decades. Another study based on the analysis of virulence spectra of wheat and barley powdery mildews suggested that North and Central Europe constitute a single epidemic unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. It was also proposed that wheat powdery mildew spores are transported by the wind over two main axes, from south to north, following the progression of the vegetative season each year, and from west to east, following the prevailing wind direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>].

At this level, fineSTRUCTURE distinguished 45 populations, each of them composed of “statistically identical” individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S1 Appendix</xref>).

However, the resolution of these studies was often insufficient to resolve fine-scale evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>]).

This supports the hypothesis of Limpert and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], who proposed the existence of a single epidemic unit over Northern Europe based on changes in virulence over time. Conversely, in Southern Europe local populations are less connected, probably due to a more fragmented habitat for the pathogen. In this region land masses are separated by large sea stretches, and wheat growing areas are rare and more isolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>]. The combination of host availability and wind connectivity can also explain the diverging pattern of isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-wind within populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S4-S5 Tables, S15 Fig</xref>). We found a strong isolation-by-wind signal in Northern Europe, while in the south, wind and genetic distances were not correlated. This is not surprising considering that the main winds blow predominantly from west to east, and that both the Iberian and Italian peninsula are oriented on the north-south axis. Thus, the homogenizing action of the wind is lost in Southern Europe, due to the seas that constitute a barrier to gene flow between these two land masses.</p><p id="P41">Previous studies based on the analyses of virulence spectra hypothesized that spore dispersal occurs mainly along the south-north axis following host vegetative development within a season (the green wave hypothesis), and the west-east axis following wind patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Our data rejects the green wave hypothesis, at least at the continental level (some similar process could occur locally). At the same time, we found evidence for an eastward shift of Bgt populations over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S17 Fig</xref>). However, this analysis was limited by the low sample size and reduced geographic range of older collections. Asymmetric gene flow from west to east was reported for the wheat pathogen septoria tritici blotch (Zymoseptoria <italic>tritici</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>]) and is common for wind-dispersed organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. Increased sampling efforts will help clarify this hypothesis while also uncovering other spatial dynamics.</p><p id="P42">Our population genetics analysis revealed that gene flow is limited between different regions in Europe, and that this is caused mainly by a combination of low wind connectivity and host availability. In addition, we identified distinct signatures of selection for each population, showing that despite the high dispersal ability, Bgt populations might be adapted to local environmental conditions (in a broad sense). Indeed, climatic conditions and the genetic background of the host (hexaploid vs tetraploid) on which each sample was collected explained a part of the genetic variability in our dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2 Appendix, S5-S8 Tables</xref>). Beyond the differences between tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, it was reported that hexaploid winter wheat varieties in Europe are also genetically structured, and they can be separated into three groups containing accessions from the south, north-west, and north-east of Europe respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>]. We could not formally test whether this affected the population structure of the pathogens, as we lacked detailed genetic information about the host on which Bgt samples were collected. However, in Northern Europe there is a clear subdivision between wheat accessions from the west and the east [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>], while the pathogen population is uniform across the whole region. Thus, it is unlikely that the population structure of Bgt is strongly affected by that of winter wheat.</p><p id="P43">Our results on the rate of LD decay and the frequency of mating types highlight that sexual reproduction is prevalent in all populations of Bgt in Europe and the Mediterranean. Field observations report frequent chasmothecia formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>], and during this study we obtained chasmothecia from several countries. This contrasts with previous studies on <italic>Blumeria</italic> that suggested clonal or near-clonal reproduction for both barley and wheat powdery mildew [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>]. While we did not attempt to estimate the frequency of sexual reproduction, our observations suggest that it is more common than previously proposed.</p><p id="P44">Additional insights into the population biology of Bgt were obtained by the demographic analysis. We found that the Kingman coalescent is not a suitable model for Bgt populations and that the data is modelled better using the Beta coalescent. The better fit of a multiple merger coalescent model (the Beta coalescent) over the Kingman coalescent suggests that there is a large variability in the reproductive success of different genealogical lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. In aerially dispersed, obligatory biotrophic plant pathogens, the stochasticity introduced by wind and host availability may cause this increased variance in the offspring distribution. Individuals may produce hundreds of thousands of spores every generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>] but only a small proportion is successfully dispersed by the wind and lands on a viable host plant to continue reproduction. This is analogous to the sweepstake reproduction of several marine organisms (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>]). In this model of “few winners, many losers” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>], a small fraction of individuals can contribute disproportionately more to the next generation, thus increasing variance in reproductive success. Another process that leads to large variation in fitness between different lineages is the recurrence of population bottlenecks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. In the case of wheat powdery mildew, these might occur between successive crop growing seasons. In the absence of suitable hosts post-harvest, the pathogen population sizes may fall drastically, with few surviving on green bridges or as sexual spores in chasmothecia. Finally, recurring selective sweeps could also lead to multiple merger genealogies, as it was observed recently in Atlantic cod populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>]. In crop pathogens the recurring sweeps may be caused by successive deployment of new resistance genes and fungicides.</p><p id="P45">Future studies and further method development are needed to test these different hypotheses. Nonetheless, regardless of which of these processes affect Bgt populations, these results have important consequences for how we perform and interpret demographic inference in Bgt, and potentially in other pathogens. Most demographic analyses use the Kingman coalescent without testing its assumption about the variance of reproductive success between lineages. However, ignoring this assumption can lead to the inference of spurious population dynamics such as population growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. Beyond Bgt, multiple merger coalescent models have been tested for only one agricultural pathogen (Setosphaeria <italic>turcica</italic>, northern corn leaf blight). In that case, the Kingman coalescent resulted to be the best fitting model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>], but this might not be the case for other pathogens with a life cycle similar to Bgt (e.g., mildews and rusts), and researchers working on such pathogens should test whether the Kingman coalescent is an appropriate model prior to demographic analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Implications for control strategies</title><p id="P46">Insights into the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of crop diseases can be translated into better control methods only if they are on a spatial and temporal scale relevant for agriculture. One of the main results of the population genetic analysis in this study was the identification and characterization of different Bgt populations. In particular, the identification of one single homogeneous population over Northern Europe has important implications for the deployment of novel resistance genes and suggests that resistance breeding should be coordinated at least among countries in Northern and Eastern Europe. In the future, it might also become possible to leverage epidemiological dynamics for a strategic deployment of major resistance genes. For example, if the hypothesis of asymmetric gene flow in Northern Europe holds true, with higher gene flow from west to east, it would be conceivable to think of a staggered deployment of novel resistance sources starting from the east and moving toward the west; or at least to avoid the opposite pattern, as virulent variants selected on resistant material would move faster in the eastward direction. Whether such strategies are feasible, or cost effective, depends on the magnitude of the asymmetry in gene flow. Such scenarios could be explored with simulation studies, or by using molecular epidemiology to study past cases of resistance breakdown. Importantly, these hypotheses need to be tested in other pathogens as well, as their relevance might extend beyond wheat powdery mildew.</p><p id="P47">Investigating past examples of resistance genes that have lost effectiveness can provide precious guidance for future strategies. Here we showed that resistance to powdery mildew provided by the wheat receptor Pm17 was lost rapidly because multiple virulent haplotypes were already present in Europe before the introduction of the resistance gene (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>] for an analysis based on a global population). Those haplotypes carried variants that were able to partially escape recognition by Pm17 (variants B and C), and in the last two decades they spread throughout the continent. A new virulent variant that is not recognized at all by Pm17 appeared only recently in Northern Europe and Turkey (variant H), and it will be very informative to monitor how it will spread over time and space in the future. Our infection assays on a <italic>Pm3e</italic> line showed that virulent genotypes are already circulating in natural populations even though <italic>Pm3e</italic> has never been used in breeding. These results are similar to those obtained for oat, as it was reported that British populations of oat powdery mildew contained genotypes that were virulent onto new oat resistant varieties before their commercialization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>]. The existence of virulent genotypes prior to the introduction of new major resistance genes could explain why many of these genes have become ineffective so quickly. Future molecular epidemiology studies of additional <italic>Avr</italic> s in Bgt and other pathogens can reveal if this is indeed a common pattern.</p><p id="P48">In any case, field trials in one or few countries are likely not sufficient to predict the durability of novel major resistance genes. Complementing this data with infection tests using isolates from broader collections could help identify genes providing durable resistance (for genes that are active at the seedling stage). Such collections should represent the current pathogen population in the region where the resistance gene(s) will be deployed, and their geographic range can be determined by population genetics studies such as ours. For example, for wheat powdery mildew in Northern Europe, new resistant lines should be challenged at least with isolates from the entire range of the Northern European population (N_EUR), and possibly also with isolates from nearby populations in Southern Europe and Turkey.</p><p id="P49">Finally, as the cost of sampling and sequencing decreases, molecular surveillance of virulence and fungicide resistance at the local scale is becoming feasible. Such data can inform fine-scale decisions about disease control, such as which wheat variety should be sown and what fungicide should be used, based on the local pathogen population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S17"><title>Sampling</title><p id="P50">We sampled 276 isolates of <italic>B. g. tritici</italic> across Europe and the Mediterranean in the spring and summer months of 2022 and 2023 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S1 Fig</xref>). 173 of these isolates were sampled from infected fields of spring, winter, durum and spelt wheat (S1 Data). Of the remaining 103, 96 were collected from susceptible ‘trap pots’ of young wheat seedlings (8-20 days old) and 7 from infected durum wheat grown in a greenhouse. The samples were collected from over 90 locations spread over 20 countries in Europe and the Mediterranean region, with each sampling site contributing 1-13 samples over two years. Most of the samples (n=254) were propagated from asexual conidiospores while some (n=22) were revived from sexual fruiting bodies (chasmothecia) following the protocol from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. The samples were grown in the lab on Petri dishes containing fragments of young wheat leaves placed on an agar-benzimidazole medium. All samples obtained from asexual conidiospores were first propagated on both Kanzler and Inbar which are susceptible cultivars of hexaploid and tetraploid wheat respectively. This was done to avoid artificially selecting against samples that could infect only wheat of a certain ploidy (e.g., isolates belonging to the <italic>f. sp. dicocci</italic>). However, all samples were found to grow well on the susceptible hexaploid cultivar Kanzler, which was thus chosen as the sole host for all subsequent rounds of propagation. We isolated single colonies to ensure each sample consisted of one genotype, and not a mix of infections. This was achieved by performing a low-density infection of each sample on fresh, 10-day old wheat leaves laid out on Petri dishes filled with the agar-benzimidazole medium. Four days post infection, the Petri dish of each isolate was observed under a binocular microscope and fragments of leaves that housed a single colony were cut, isolated and allowed to grow independently. Once mature, these colonies were propagated further, and the entire process was repeated once again.

Watterson’s theta was obtained by dividing the density of biallelic SNPs in each window, as calculated by VCFtools SNPdensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref>], by the number of valid sites in that window. These estimates of pi and Watterson’s theta were used to calculate Tajima’s D in windows using the formula described in Tajima, 1989 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref>]. We also calculated d<sub>xy</sub> and Weir and Cockerham’s F<sub>ST</sub> in windows of 10kb using pixy.</p><p id="P67">Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) was calculated using PLINK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>] for the <italic>Europe+_recent</italic> dataset. All biallelic SNPs were first filtered to retain only SNPs with maximum 10% missing data. Next, separate vcf files were created for the five populations (ME, N_EUR, S_EUR1, S_EUR2 and TUR). We used the options –r2-unphased –ld-window-r2 0 and –ld-window-kb 10 to calculate LD between pairs of SNPs, which was visualized as average r<sup>2</sup>.

We selected the populations N_EUR2 and E_EUR2 for finest level of subdivision (level-10). To avoid the confounding effect of biased sampling we only used isolates sampled from 2022, and we selected one sample per location. The final dataset was composed of 15 and 17 samples for N_EUR2 and E_EUR2 respectively (S1 Data). To identify ancestral and derived alleles we included 5 isolates of the <italic>Blumeria graminis f.s.p secalis</italic> (Bgs), a related form of Bgt which infects rye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. We only considered sites that were not polymorphic in Bgs. For polymorphic sites in Bgt, we considered as ancestral the allele carried by Bgs and excluded sites where the allele carried by Bgs was not present in Bgt. Finally, we excluded all genomic sites with missing data, indels, multiallelic SNPs, and multiple site polymorphisms. The remaining sites were used to calculate the genome-wide site frequency spectra.</p><p id="P69">We considered a Beta coalescent with parameter α and exponential growth with rate <italic>g</italic> (maximizing Eq. 2 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>], with <italic>e</italic> = 0). This model belongs to a class of models named multiple merger coalescents, which allow for large variation in reproductive success, and consequently more than two lineages can coalesce at a single time point on the coalescent timescale (hence the name multiple mergers). This contrasts with the Kingman coalescent, in which the variance in reproductive success is small enough that at most two lineages can coalesce at a given time point. We used the approximate maximum-likelihood approach from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. We maximised the likelihood over a parameter grid with equidistant steps for both parameters. We let α vary from 1 to 2 in steps of 0.01. The size of mergers decreases with increasing α, up to no multiple mergers for α = 2 (i.e., the Kingman coalescent is a special case of the Beta coalescent corresponding to α = 2). We considered exponential growth rates <italic>g</italic> from 0 (no growth) to 10, in steps of 0.25, where a growth rate of <italic>g</italic> means that, within one unit of coalescent time, the population grows by exp(g) (be aware of the difference in timescales between different multiple merger rates, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>].</p><p id="P70">Additionally, for the samples from population E_EUR2, we assessed whether adding a chance (parametrized as probability <italic>e</italic>) of having misidentified the derived with the ancestral allele at each SNP affected the results of the inference. For this analysis we also included sites that were monomorphic in Bgs but showed an allele not present in Bgt, as they are used to infer the probability of misidentifying ancestral and derived alleles. Following Freund et al. 2023, we used a slightly different (composite) approximate likelihood approach (approximate likelihood function given by Eq. 17 in Supplementary Information A.4.1 of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]). We optimized over a grid of the same α and <italic>g</italic> values as above, but also probabilities <italic>e</italic> from 0 to 0.2 in steps of 0.01. The parameter <italic>e</italic> is estimated both from its effect on the SFS and from a comparison with the outgroup alleles used to call derived alleles in the sample, while considering different mutation rates for transitions and transversion. For this, we additionally optimized a fourth parameter, κ, that is the ratio between transition and transversion mutation rates (using four values: κ = 1, the estimate from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>], and 2/3 and 3/2 the values of this estimate). We report the (approximate) likelihood ratio between the best fitting models (with highest likelihoods) with and without a multiple merger component (i.e., α &lt; 2 vs. α = 2). We then graphically assessed the goodness of fit of both the best models with and without multiple merger component by plotting the expected value of the site frequency spectrum divided by the expected number of segregating sites.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Windscape</title><p id="P71">We estimated the wind connectivity between different sampling locations using the R package windscape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/matthewkling/windscape">https://github.com/matthewkling/windscape</ext-link>).

For each population we selected all SNPs with no missing data and a minor allele frequency greater than 0.05. Additionally, we excluded SNPs that could not be mapped unambiguously on the genetic map. We ran isoRelate to identify “identical-by-descent" (IBDe) segments between pairs of samples and we considered only IBDe segments that were larger than 2cM, larger than 50 Kb, and with a minimum number of SNPs equal or greater than 50. Two cM correspond to roughly to 25 sexual generations, as the average length in cM of a pair of IBDe segments after x generations can be obtained with 100/2x.
