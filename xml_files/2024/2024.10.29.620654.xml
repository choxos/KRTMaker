For twenty years, the GENCODE consortium has developed reference annotations for the human and mouse genomes, becoming a foundation for biomedical and genomics communities worldwide. Nevertheless, collections of important yet poorly-understood gene classes like long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) remain incomplete and scattered across multiple, uncoordinated catalogs, slowing down progress in the field. To address these issues, GENCODE has undertaken the most comprehensive lncRNAs annotation effort to date. This is founded on the manual annotation of full-length targeted long-read sequencing, on matched embryonic and adult tissues, of orthologous regions in human and mouse. Altogether 17,931 novel human genes (140,268 novel transcripts) and 22,784 novel mouse genes (136,169 novel transcripts) have been added to the GENCODE catalog representing a 2-fold and 6-fold increase in transcripts, respectively - the greatest increase since the sequencing of the human genome. Novel gene annotations display evolutionary constraints, have well-formed promoter regions, and link to phenotype-associated genetic variants. They greatly enhance the functional interpretability of the human genome, as they help explain millions of previously-mapped “orphan” omics measurements corresponding to transcription start sites, chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding sites. Crucially, our targeted design assigned human-mouse orthologs at a rate beyond previous studies, tripling the number of human disease-associated lncRNAs with mouse orthologs. The expanded and enhanced GENCODE lncRNA annotations mark a critical step towards deciphering the human and mouse genomes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In 2001, the first drafts of the human genome were published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Twenty years later, the complete reference sequence has been finalized, and millions of individual genomes have been sequenced. This data has had an enormous impact on our understanding of human biology and on our capacity to understand and treat disease. However, this data would have been of little value without a reliable map of genes and transcripts, making it nearly impossible to interpret the effect of genetic variation on phenotypes. Early estimates of the number of human genes were highly imprecise: between 30,000 and 40,000, according to the Human Genome Project consortium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, and between 27,000 and 39,000, according to Celera Genomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Shortly after the publication of the first human genome drafts, the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> was initiated to identify all elements in the human genome that confer biological function. As part of this broader effort, GENCODE, the encyclopedia of genes and transcripts, was launched to produce a definitive catalog of all human genes and transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Over the years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, GENCODE, an international partnership of manual annotation, computational biology, and experimental groups has established itself, together with RefSeq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, as the primary reference gene annotation catalogs.</p><p id="P3">For the past fifteen years, the number of annotated human protein-coding genes in GENCODE has remained quite stable. The number of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes, in contrast, has been steadily growing since 2007, when they started being systematically annotated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, although it appears to be reaching a plateau (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Many of these lncRNAs have been shown to participate in important biological functions and to be implicated in diseases. However, while the GENCODE/RefSeq protein-coding gene set has been driven towards convergence by collaborations such as MANE (Matched Annotation from NCBI and EMBL-EBI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and is believed to be reasonably complete, with no alternative catalogs with the same broad use, this is not the case for lncRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. A number of catalogs have been developed over the years, using different approaches and based on different data sets. For instance, FANTOM CAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and CHESS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, which are based on short-read RNAseq data, annotate a larger number of lncRNA transcripts than GENCODE. GENCODE does not utilize this data due to concerns that short-read connectivity may compromise the fidelity needed to produce reference-quality models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. As a result, despite efforts such as RNA Central<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, there is a fragmented landscape of non-interoperable and partially redundant lncRNA annotations, which slows down progress in the field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, in GENCODE and elsewhere, lncRNA transcript annotations are often partial, lacking the correct 5’ or 3’ ends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. This hampers their biological characterization; for instance, poor promoter mapping impacts CRISPR screens, while incomplete 3’ UTRs can significantly undermine RNAseq quantification assays.</p><p id="P4">Thus, during recent phases of GENCODE, we have emphasized producing a reference catalog of full-length lncRNAs. Toward that aim, we have specifically employed the Capture Long-read Sequencing (CLS) strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and designed a capture array with orthologous probes in the human and mouse genomes targeting different lncRNA annotations and additional regions of these genomes that could also host unknown lncRNAs. We employed a cDNA library preparation protocol, CapTrap-Seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, that enriches for 5’ to 3’ complete RNA molecules. We used this approach in a matched collection of adult and embryonic tissues in human and mouse, selected to maximize transcriptome complexity. The resulting libraries were sequenced pre- and post- capture using PacBio and ONT long-read sequencing technologies.</p><p id="P5">The manually supervised computational annotation of this data, has led to the inclusion of 17,931 novel human genes (140,268 novel transcripts) and 22,784 novel mouse genes (136,169 novel transcripts) in GENCODE, most of which were identified only post-capture. This is, by far, the largest addition to the GENCODE catalogs since the first drafts of the human and mouse genome sequences, and it constitutes a substantial advance toward a complete lncRNAs catalog in these species. Novel genes and transcripts have features characteristic of “bona fide” genes, including properly formed promoter regions, and strongly differing from those exhibited by matching decoy transcripts. Overall, they are associated with human phenotypes, as supported by GWAS mappings and mammalian sequence conservation.

Manual curation is a founding principle of GENCODE, vital for ensuring the stringency required for ‘reference quality’ gene annotation. Transcript models are constructed by expert annotators, whereby the evidence for every potential model has been traditionally considered on a locus-by-locus basis. Since this approach is not scalable to the one million CLS models produced here, we have deployed a computational workflow, manually supervised at key steps, and developed iteratively via extensive testing by annotators. In order to produce reference quality annotations, its parameters are set to run a minimal false positive rate (i.e., the creation of false annotations) at the expense of an elevated false negative rate (i.e., the rejection of true annotations). This workflow is containerized in a pipeline called TAGENE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplement</xref>)</p><p id="P13">As deployed here, we used TAGENE to first eliminate CLS models that are antisense to protein-coding genes or located entirely within the genomic bounds of GENCODE pseudogenes. Next, we examined how annotator confidence in a CLS model correlated with the support for its splice junctions as judged by recount<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> short-read RNAseq data. Conservatively, we opted to filter out all CLS models that contained any intron supported by less than 50 recount reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S13</xref>), despite the fact that we estimate that ~50% of the models rejected solely on this basis are likely to be correct. Finally, we complemented the TAGENE predictions with manually curated transcripts to help resolve the cases where new models had the potential to merge existing distinct lncRNA genes into single loci.</p><p id="P14">Using these filters, and additional methodological adjustments, we defined a set of CLS transcripts that meet the stringent requirements to be included in GENCODE. Thus, with this approach we annotated 140,268 and 17,931 new lncRNA transcripts and genes in human, and 136,169 and 22,784 in mouse (with respect to v27 and vM16, respectively), the vast majority incorporated in the latest releases v47 and vM36 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S6</xref>). This represents a substantial increase over the number of lncRNA annotations present in human GENCODE v46 (&gt;2x) and mouse vM35 (6x, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), and brings, for the first time, the number of lncRNA loci in human (37,127) and in mouse (37,336) to comparable numbers.

Here, we have specifically investigated if some of the novel CLS loci actually correspond to previously unknown protein-coding genes. First, we interrogated large-scale tissue-based proteomics experiments. We found convincing evidence for seven human protein-coding genes with multiple peptides that were not annotated as coding. All seven proteins have known human paralogues, and four are substantially truncated compared to their parent gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S14</xref>). Six proteins were detected principally or wholly in testis. For mouse, analysis of proteomics data led to the discovery of 23 protein-coding genes among the novel CLS loci, most of which were also testis expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S14C-F</xref>). Second, we used PhyloCSF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> to find open reading frames (ORFs) within CLS transcripts most likely to contain evolutionarily conserved novel protein-coding regions. Manual examination of over 800 of the top candidates identified one novel protein-coding gene in both human and mouse. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S15</xref>). Each of these novel genes has a novel ortholog in the other species.

As expected, given that pseudogenes are generally transcribed at low levels, our capture strategy enhanced the sensitivity in recording expression changes in pseudogenes and their parent genes.

Moreover, they tend to be lowly expressed often in a very cell-type specific manner, which makes them difficult to be captured by unbiased sequencing approaches. Therefore, they are poorly represented in transcriptomic data sets. All these make the annotation of lncRNAs particularly challenging.</p><p id="P32">There is increasing evidence, however, that lncRNAs are more than non-functional by-products of transcription. Growing numbers of carefully documented cases can attest to the bioactivity of mature lncRNA transcripts, and their important roles in both healthy and diseased states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P33">Thus, because of their growing biological relevance, a number of efforts have been dedicated to producing lncRNA catalogs for human and other species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Since lncRNAs can essentially be identified only through RNA sequencing, most lncRNA catalogs have been created by processing RNAseq data. This data has been so far largely produced using short-read technology, from which it is difficult to reliably infer exon connectivity along the entire transcript, particularly for lowly expressed transcripts.</p><p id="P34">As a result, existing lncRNA catalogs contain mostly incomplete and fragmentary models, the biological identity of which cannot be firmly established. They overlap only partially, and the lack of coordination and of consistent accessioning hinders their use by the community, slowing down progress in lncRNA biology. These catalogs are still very useful, however, since they pinpoint those regions in the genome that are likely to encode lncRNAs. Indeed, partially informed by these catalogs, we have employed a targeted RNA sequencing approach that has successfully led to the identification of hundreds of thousands of previously unknown human and mouse lncRNA transcripts, the vast majority of them supported by full-length high-quality sequences.</p><p id="P35">Our highly stringent filtering results in the exclusion of a substantial fraction of transcripts from GENCODE versions v47 and vM36. For instance, we included only CLS models supported by a minimum of 50 recount reads to each splice junction. This is remarkable, as it indicates that these transcripts have been previously detected in short-read RNAseq experiments, albeit in a fragmented and scattered way (too weak evidence to reliably infer full-length sequences). Thanks to our targeted approach, we have now been able to represent these transcripts as full-length models.</p><p id="P36">Rare and cell type specific transcripts will likely be underrepresented in bulk RNAseq datasets, therefore many CLS models not reaching our recount threshold are likely to correspond to “bona fide” transcript sequences (we estimate at least 50%, corresponding to tens of thousands of transcripts). Many of these may be incorporated in future GENCODE releases as our manual and automated curation workflows improve. Similarly, about 100,000 CLS models overlapping protein-coding regions were beyond the scope of this study and remain to be analyzed by the HAVANA team. These are likely to lead to many alternatively spliced transcripts and novel translations of existing genes and to extend annotated models to the correct transcript termini.</p><p id="P37">Transcript discovery and accurate annotation here have been greatly facilitated by advances in long-read RNAseq technologies. However, long-read RNAseq has so far been produced for a limited number of cell types and tissues, mostly in samples from European ancestry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that the survey of an increasing number of cell types, conditions, developmental stages, subcellular compartments, and RNA populations (i.e., polyA- RNAs) in samples from individuals of diverse genetic backgrounds, through further advanced long-read sequencing technologies, and library preparation protocols through the single-cell level, is likely to uncover a substantial number of yet unknown human genes.</p><p id="P38">Deep learning (DL) and large language models seem particularly appropriate to deal with the intrinsic semantic nature of biomolecular sequences, as illustrated by the success in predicting protein structures from amino acid sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. DL is also being explored to predict genes in genome sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. The accuracy of these methods crucially depends on the size (and the quality) of the training data. Our work, the vast amounts of data produced, and the resulting annotation, can also be considered an important contribution here. The combination of DL with more traditional AI rule-based systems, building on our extensive experience in manual curation, could be the basis of automatic methods producing genome annotations of quasi-manually-curated quality. These methods will be essential to produce high-quality annotations across the entire phylogenetic spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, which are essential to maximize the benefit of projects underway to sequence the genomes of all eukaryotic species on Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS199822-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d41aAcDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS199822-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d41aAcDcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS199822-supplement-Supplementary_Tables.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d41aAcDdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project was supported by Award Number 2 U24 HG007234 and U24 HG011451 from the National Human Genome Research Institute, Wellcome Trust [WT222155/Z/20/Z]; European Molecular Biology Laboratory.

The values correspond to the percentage of gene loci from the catalogs represented in the x-axis that overlap the annotations represented in the box-plot. For instance, 29% of the lncRNAs in the merge of all catalogs (lncRNA-merge) are included in GENCODE v47. Conversely, 74% of the lncRNAs in v47 are included in lncRNA-merge. Overlap is defined as a complete overlap of the gene span within either the x-axis set or the corresponding set on the same strand. Both spliced and unspliced genes are included in this analysis.

TSSs with cCRE support are those for which the distance between the TSS and the center of the cCRE is less than 2 Kb. We performed this analysis for unique TSSs of protein-coding genes, previously annotated lncRNAs, novel CLS transcript models (TM), and decoy models. The type of cCRE is color-coded; “any class” includes additional types of cCREs not shown in the barplot (CA-CTCF, CA-TF, CA, TF). <bold>C)</bold> Alluvial diagram showing the re-classification of TSS-proximity-dependent cCRE categories in the ENCODE registry, given the novel TSS models in the expanded annotation.

MEG9 is highly conserved between mouse and human, with additional exons found in mouse. The microRNA mir-541 cluster and the other miRNAs upstream are present throughout mammals. Given that splicing of the intron is required for miRNA maturation, we find the splice site of the 5’-most exon of the novel lncRNA to be highly conserved across deep mammalian genome alignments (214-way, 470-way). The novel transcript is expressed in liver only, as supported by histone modification marks for H3K27ac.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199822-f005"/></fig></floats-group></article>
