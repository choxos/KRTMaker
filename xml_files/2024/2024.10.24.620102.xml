While animal models have been essential for understanding pancreatic development and disease, they are limited by their low-throughput and major species-specific molecular and physiological differences. Generating 3D in vitro models, such as organoids, that are physiologically relevant is thus primordial for investigating pancreatic development and disease in the human context. However, producing human stem cell-derived pancreatic organoids with proper branched architecture and correct patterning of cell domains has remained challenging. Here, we successfully developed a protocol that efficiently and reproducibly generates such organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by optimising organoid culture format and media. Our differentiation protocol promotes acinar cell differentiation and generates organoids with branches patterned into central trunk and peripheral tip domains, without relying on animal-derived matrices for organoid culture. This platform opens the door to high-throughput investigations of human pancreas development in a system recapitulating the most important aspects of pancreatic tissue architecture. Lastly, we anticipate that this system will contribute to the partial replacement of animal models used to investigate diseases such as pancreatic cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Organoid differentiation</kwd><kwd>human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)</kwd><kwd>3D pancreatic model</kwd><kwd>branching morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>lineage specification</kwd><kwd>acinar fate differentiation</kwd><kwd>pancreatic diseases</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The pancreas has two vital functions, endocrine and exocrine, which control digestion and blood glucose levels. The exocrine compartment makes up over 90% of the organ and acinar cells are its primary constituent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. They are responsible for producing digestive enzymes, such as amylase, protease and lipase, stored as zymogen granules and released by exocytosis during digestion. Also, as part of the exocrine compartment, ductal cells form a ramified network of branches that transport the digestive enzymes to the duodenum and release bicarbonate ions to neutralize the acidic contents of the stomach.</p><p id="P4">During embryogenesis, the pancreas originates from the foregut endoderm at embryonic day (E) 9.5 in mice and 30 days post-conception (dpc) in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Until E14.5 in mice and 50dpc in human, primary branches form and elongate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. After E14.5, branches start bifurcating and form a ramified network of ducts connecting all acini to the duodenum. Concomitant with branch formation, pancreatic cells acquire specialized identities and localize into discrete regions of the developing pancreas. Bipotent progenitor cells located in the trunk regions give rise to ductal and endocrine cells, while progenitors in the tip regions give rise to acinar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Hence, the cellular mechanisms regulating cell differentiation and branching morphogenesis are spatiotemporally synchronized so that pancreatic cells organize themselves into a branched architecture fundamental for pancreatic function.</p><p id="P5">The gene regulatory networks (GRNs) governing pancreatic identities have been extensively characterized in mice and appear conserved in humans to some extent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The transcription factors <italic>PTF1A</italic> and <italic>NKX6.1</italic> respectively govern the allocation of multipotent progenitors to either an acinar fate or ductal/endocrine cell identities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. However, the role of many soluble and extracellular matrix proteins present in the pancreatic microenvironment remain elusive. The extended time required to study the effects of gene mutations in mice has impeded the systematic characterization of developmental signals. Moreover, clear differences have now been described between human and mouse pancreas development highlighting the importance of developing human experimental models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, which would also enable high-throughput functional characterizations.</p><p id="P6">The <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) followed by cultures in three-dimension (3D) can generate cellular structures, called organoids, which recapitulate key physiological organ features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The use of hiPSCs-derived organoids enables the systematic targeting of developmental pathways by using CrispR-Cas9 technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Most of the organoid culture protocols rely however on animal-derived materials, such as Matrigel, which are used as scaffolds to support organoid growth and morphogenesis. Here, we optimised a Matrigel-free 3D culture approach generating hiPSC-derived pancreas organoids with a branched architecture and proper regionalisation of acinar/tip and trunk compartments.</p><p id="P7">Understanding what regulates acinar cell differentiation is essential not only for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying pancreas development but also those underlying pancreatic cell plasticity in disease. Most importantly, acinar cell plasticity is linked to pancreatic inflammation and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). During pancreatic inflammation, acinar cells might dedifferentiate into ductal-like progenitor cells, which reacquire clear embryonic markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. This is a reversible process that allows the regeneration of pancreatic tissue after inflammation. However, persistent activation of mutated genes, such as oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic>, leads to permanent dedifferentiation of acinar cells and is linked to PDAC onset in 98% of cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The animal procedures used to model pancreatic inflammation and PDAC range from moderate to severe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Beside partially replacing the use of such animal procedures, human pancreatic organoids hold great promise for drug screening purposes. The organoid models developed previously either lacked a physiologically relevant architecture or still required to be transplanted in mice and thus remained low-throughput and dependent on animal surgical procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Hence, we anticipate that the physiological relevance of the pancreatic organoid platform that we developed here could support the development of high-throughput preclinical studies while partially replacing mouse models of pancreatic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>hiPSC culture</title><p id="P8">hiPSCs (AICS-0090-39)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> were maintained according to the manufacturer’s protocol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.coriell.org/0/PDF/Allen/ipsc/AICS-0090-391_CofA.pdf">https://www.coriell.org/0/PDF/Allen/ipsc/AICS-0090-391_CofA.pdf</ext-link>) on Matrigel-coated (Corning) 6 well-plates with mTesr1 growth medium (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (P/S) in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5 % CO2). hiPSCs were thawed at 37°C in a water bath and the cell suspension was then transferred dropwise to a falcon tube containing enough growth medium for a 1:10 dilution. hiPSCs were centrifuged, resuspended in growth medium containing 5μM ROCK inhibitor, and then seeded onto Matrigel-coated plates for maintenance.</p><p id="P9">Cells were passaged as single-cells at 70-80% confluency using Accutase (Invitrogen) and medium supplemented with 5μM Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 (Sigma) on the day of passaging.

Between D14 and D19, we observed that the level of <italic>Amylase</italic> expression strongly increased in organoids and <italic>CPA1</italic> expression is also maintained, indicating that our organoid culture medium promotes the differentiation of acinar cells. Altogether, the differentiation of acinar cells and the formation of a branched architecture demonstrates that our protocol enables the formation of pancreatic organoids with an exocrine identity.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S27" sec-type="conclusions | discussion"><title>Conclusions/Discussion</title><p id="P63">The derivation of pancreatic organoids from either stem cells or primary tissue allows the possibility of replicating native pancreas organisation, morphology, and the emergence of distinct cell populations in health and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Cell sources of human pancreatic organoids include hPSCs, primary cells from adult tissue, and foetal tissue obtained between 7-11 wpc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Human PSC-derived pancreatic organoids are capable of giving rise to ductal or acinar cells that usually self-organise as polarised spheres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. However, the generation of human stem cell-derived pancreatic organoids with proper branched architecture and correct patterning of acinar/tip and trunk cell domains has been an ongoing challenge.</p><p id="P64">The advent of pancreatic organoids for use as an in vitro model follows many years of optimisation of in vitro pancreatic cell differentiation protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, which aim to mimic pancreas development. Most recently, a highly optimised protocol was developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> that incorporated several existing protocols and made specific use of SHH and BMP inhibition, FGF and RA signalling activation, and the discovery that joint administration of Nicotinamide and EGF can increase pancreatic progenitor cell yield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Nicotinamide has been shown to increase the proportion of PDX1+NKX6.1+ by inhibiting CK1 and ROCK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, while epidermal growth factor (EGF) is known to activate the MAP kinase pathway and is required for pancreatic progenitor proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. This combination resulted in a heavily improved yield of PDX1+NKX6.1+ pancreatic progenitors relative to established protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Incorporation of this protocol was essential for our work as it has also been reported that a differentiation efficiency resulting in fewer than 60% PDX1+NKX6.1+ pancreatic progenitors typically do not form aggregates of sufficient size when using the Aggrewell platform. This result also highlights the importance of adequately replicating in vivo complexity to achieve effective production of pancreatic cell types with high fidelity.</p><p id="P65">Here, we present a protocol for the generation of hiPSC-derived pancreatic organoids that bear a resemblance to the neonatal pancreas. We have shown that these organoids harbour regionalised tip and trunk domains. Prominent branching and organoid expansion were observed during the final stage of differentiation that may have resulted from supplementation with Fgf7 and Fgf10, which are known to be important for the growth and morphogenesis of the exocrine pancreas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Fgf10 is also known to interact with and activate Notch to maintain pancreatic progenitor cell self-renewal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. However, Notch suppression is later required for proper lineage diversification and specification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, and several protocols use media supplementation with Notch inhibitor for the differentiation of PSCs into different pancreatic cell types in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Since in this work Notch inhibitor is applied from D14 onwards, our findings suggest that regionalisation is at least in part achieved by D14, after which Notch inhibition enables regionalised cell differentiation. The use of the Aggrewell microwell platform was a necessary intermediary step in creating an environment that facilitates cell interactions in 3D, without which branched organoid structures could not be generated. Moreover, our protocol eliminates the need for matrices such as Matrigel or collagen to culture pancreatic organoids. This is a significant advantage as it reduces the use of animal-derived reagents and minimizes the unpredictability of organoid differentiation efficiency due to reagent batch-to-batch variability.</p><p id="P66">Further optimisation will be able to determine whether the maturation of these organoids can be improved when cultured for extended periods of time. The fact that pancreatic cells dedifferentiate into embryonic-like states during pancreatic inflammation and PDAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, which are the states replicated in our system, suggests that our organoid platform could allow <italic>in vitro</italic> modelling of many aspects of the diseases and enable preclinical investigations in a high-throughput setup while partially replacing animal models. Pancreatic organoids derived from pluripotent human stem-cells have indeed been used to study PDAC initiation and progression in culture by induction of the KRAS and GNAS oncogenes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. So far, these studies were performed on cystic organoids solely composed of ductal or acinar cells. Inducing the expression of the KRAS and GNAS oncogenes in our organoid platform would enable the research community to study the effects of these mutations in a system that both recapitulates the branched architecture of the pancreas and the patterning of its acinar and ductal compartments. Moreover, the high-throughput nature of this platform could allow the screening of drugs that reduce tissue alterations caused by oncogene induction and thus identify potential therapeutic targets for pancreatitis and PDAC.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S28"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a fellowship from the NC3Rs (grant reference NC/V002260/1) to Jean-Francois Darrigrand.
