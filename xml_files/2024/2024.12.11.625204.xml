It causes glucocorticoid excess and substantially increases cardiovascular risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The condition is rare but Cushing Syndrome arising from prescribed glucocorticoid therapy has a broader public health impact. Synthetic glucocorticoids are front line treatments for many inflammatory conditions; ~2% of the adult population receive glucocorticoid prescriptions and there is an upward trend in prescriptions for sustained therapy in conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. About 60% of people receiving prolonged glucocorticoid therapy develop iatrogenic Cushing syndrome and acquire the burden of increased cardiovascular risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">The causes of cardiovascular disease are not fully defined but high blood pressure (BP) and loss of the physiological nocturnal BP dip are common complications of Cushing Syndrome. Hypertensive mechanisms are complex due to pleiotropic effects of glucocorticoids on BP regulatory systems, including arterial vascular tone and renal sodium excretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Abnormal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is well documented and the pressor response to angiotensin II is amplified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Glucocorticoid excess may also induce sympathetic hyperactivity and an exaggerated pressor response to noradrenalin has been reported in patients with Cushing Disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Indeed, sustained glucocorticoid excess impacts many vasoregulatory systems and vasoconstriction is augmented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Increased peripheral resistance is a significant factor for the onset and maintenance of arterial hypertension in Cushing Syndrome. Whether abnormal sodium handling by the kidney contributes is less certain. Increased renal sympathetic nerve activity and elevated angiotensin II promote sodium retention, as does hyperactivation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) by glucocorticoids when 11β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βHSD2) is saturated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Additionally, activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) stimulates sodium reabsorbing mechanisms in the proximal tubule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, thick limb of Henle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and distal convoluted tubule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and GR activation may also modulate epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity in the collecting duct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, although the physiological role is less certain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The increased abundance of phosphorylated NKCC2 and NCC in urinary vesicles from patients with Cushing Syndrome is consistent with induction of epithelial sodium transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In healthy humans, a 5-day infusion of either ACTH or cortisol reduces sodium excretion and expands plasma volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In a mouse model of Cushing Syndrome, ENaC activity is increased through MR and GR pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, other transporters are down-regulated and overall ACTH-infused mice are in negative sodium balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, dietary sodium depletion prevented hypertension in Cushing Syndrome mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, and such salt-sensitivity is indicative of a renal phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">The kidney determines long-term stability of BP by controlling extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) through the pressure-natriuresis response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This response has both renal vascular/hemodynamic and tubular/epithelial components that can be influenced by glucocorticoid excess and we hypothesized impairment of these in Cushing Syndrome. We tested this hypothesis in male C57BL/6JCrl mice infused with ACTH for 14-21 days, which we have previously shown captures the endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular features of Cushing Syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P9">Experiments described were performed between September 2018 and September 2021 in the Centre for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh. Adult male C57BL/6 mice (age 10-12 weeks) were commercially sourced (Charles River, UK) and maintained in our animal unit under controlled conditions (temperature (24 ± 1°C), humidity (50 ± 10% humidity) and light/dark cycle (lights on 7am to 7pm local time)). Mice had ad libitum access to water and commercial rodent chow. The control diet contained 0.3% sodium and 0.7% potassium by weight [RM1, SDS Diets, United Kingdom (UK)]; the high salt diet contained 3% sodium and 0.6% potassium by weight (RM 3% Na+ SY, SDS Diets, UK). Mice were randomized into treatment groups and experiments performed with a single blinding to group allocations. All procedures conformed to the guidelines from Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. Experiments were performed in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act under a UK Home Office Project Licence to the lead investigator (MAB) following ethical review by the University.</p><sec id="S7"><title>ACTH-treatment</title><p id="P10">Chronic administration was achieved by subcutaneous osmotic minipumps (Alzet, models 2002/2004, Charles River UK) which infused ACTH (2.5 μg/day, adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 1-24 human, rat; Sigma, MO, USA) for periods of up to 28 days as stated for each experiment. Pumps were primed in sterile saline at 37°C per manufacturer’s instructions and implanted aseptically under isoflurane anesthesia (4% induction; 2% maintenance), with postoperative buprenorphine administration (0.1 mg/kg; Vetergesic; sc) for analgesia and 0.9% sterile saline (0.5mL; IP).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Characterization of Cushing Syndrome features</title><p id="P11">Body weight and gonadal fat pad weight normalized to body weight were measured following 14 days of ACTH or vehicle infusion. Dissected left adrenal glands from control and ACTH mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours at room temperature before being transferred to 70% ethanol. Samples were dehydrated, using an ethanol series, followed by xylene and embedded into paraffin blocks. Fixed adrenal glands were sectioned (5 µm), stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and examined by light microscopy and photographed by an AxioScan slide scanner (Zeiss, Cambridge, UK). Adrenal gland cross-sectional area was calculated (QuPath). The adrenal glands were analysed in a randomized order by an observer blinded to the treatment groups.</p><p id="P12">Corticosterone was measured in plasma samples taken by tail venesection from the same mouse at the diurnal nadir (7am) and peak (7pm) in mice and measured by commercial ELISA kit (ADI-900-907; Enzo Life Sciences, UK). The cross-reactivity for this kit is 100% for corticosterone, 21.3% 11-deoxycorticosterone, 21.0% desoxycorticosterone, 0.46% progesterone, 0.31% testosterone, 0.28% tetrahydrocorticosterone, 0.18% aldosterone, 0.046% cortisol, and &lt;0.03% for pregnenolone, estradiol, cortisone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone acetate. For aldosterone, trunk blood was collected onto ice following decapitation at either 7-8am or 7-8pm. Plasma aldosterone was measured by commercial ELISA (ADI-900-173; Enzo Life Sciences). The cross-reactivity for this kit is 100% for aldosterone, 0.3% 11-deoxycorticosterone, 0.19% corticosterone, 0.2% progesterone, and &lt;0.001% for cortisol, dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and testosterone.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Evaluation of renal function</title><sec id="S10"><title>Acute pressure natriuresis response</title><p id="P13">Pressure natriuresis experiments were carried out in control mice and mice infused with ACTH for 21 days. Under intraperitoneal barbiturate non-recovery anesthesia (Inactin, 120 mg/kg; Sigma), the right jugular vein was cannulated for intravenous infusion of physiological saline (100 mM NaCl, 15 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM KCl, 0.25% fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-inulin (Sigma), 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), pH 7.4) to allow for calculation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and for maintenance of anesthesia. A tracheotomy was performed to relieve obstruction to breathing. The right carotid artery was cannulated for real-time mean arterial BP measurements (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Oxford, UK) and for intermittent blood collections. The bladder was catheterized to collect urine to measure urine flow rate and electrolyte excretion. Following a 30-minute equilibrium period, blood samples were collected for plasma (P1-P4) before and after 3 urine collections (U1-U3). U1 represented a 30-minute baseline period. The 1<sup>st</sup> pressure ramp was then induced by sequential arterial ligation of the mesenteric and coeliac arteries (U2, 20 minute), followed by a 2<sup>nd</sup> pressure ramp via distal aorta ligation (U3, 20 minute). BP was measured throughout baseline, 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> pressure ramp, as well as urine flow rate, sodium excretion and GFR. Urinary sodium concentrations were analysed using SpotChem EL SE-1520 analyser (Arkray, Kyoto, Japan). GFR was calculated as the ratio of urinary to plasma FITC-inulin concentrations multiplied by the urine flow rate. The pressure natriuresis and diuresis response and change in fractional sodium excretion were also calculated.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Renal blood flow</title><p id="P14">Renal blood flow was measured on the left renal artery in a sub-group of control and ACTH-treated mice who went through the pressure natriuresis protocol using a pulse-wave Doppler ultrasound probe (Transonic, NY, USA).

Each vessel mounted on the myograph was normalized using the DMT Normalization Module on LabChart (ADInstruments) to calculate and set the optimal pre-tension conditions by determining its internal circumference (µm). Vessels were equilibrated for 30 minutes in PSS and perfused with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. High potassium PSS (KPSS; 125 mM KCl) was used as a depolarizing contraction and maximal contraction was determined at the start and end of the experiment. Vascular reactivity was assessed by generating cumulative concentration-response curves to phenylephrine (1 nM to 30 μM PE; Sigma), acetylcholine (1nM to 30 μM ACh; Sigma) and sodium nitroprusside (1nM to 30 μM SNP; Sigma), separated by 30-minute washout periods. PE responses were calculated as a percentage of maximal KPSS response. ACh and SNP responses were calculated as a percentage of PE-induced pre-constriction.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p id="P17">Renal and second order mesenteric arteries were dissected and cleaned of perivascular fat from control and ACTH-treated (14 days) mice following decapitation.

Ocular lubricant (Lactri-lube) was applied to prevent eye dry out during surgery and buprenorphone (0.1 mg/kg; Vetergesic; sc) and sterile saline (0.5mL of 0.9% sterile saline IP) were administered postoperatively and mice were placed in a heated cage until mobility was fully regained. For 48 hours post-surgery, mice had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to Vetergesic jelly and mash diet (RM1 diet soaked in drinking water). BP and locomotor activity recordings started 7 days after device implant, with data acquisition at 1Hz for a 5-minute period every 30 minutes. In one cohort of mice, baseline was recorded for 3 days before 21 days of ACTH infusion. Twenty-four-hour averages of systolic and diastolic BP were calculated, as well as BP dip (day BP-night BP) and locomotor dip. In a separate cohort of mice, the BP response to matched high salt intake salt-sensitivity before and after ACTH-infusion was assessed. Systolic and diastolic BP were measured following 7 days control diet, 7 days high salt diet, 5 days washout period, 12 days ACTH infusion on control diet before transition to a high salt diet for 16 days.

Baseline BP was ~15 mmHg higher in ACTH-infused mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) but sodium excretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) and GFR (ACTH: 0.35±0.06 ml/min <italic>vs</italic> Control: 0.34±0.04 ml/min) were similar to vehicle-treated animals. To assess the pressure-natriuresis response, BP was acutely raised through sequential arterial ligation. This increased sodium excretion and urine flow rate in all mice. However, the natriuretic and diuretic response to increased pressure was significantly attenuated in the ACTH group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D &amp; 1E</xref>). Notably, at peak BP, GFR was not increased (Control: 0.32±0.11 ml/min <italic>vs</italic> ACTH: 0.38±0.07 ml/min) in either group of mice. Sodium excretion was plotted against BP to generate the pressure-natriuresis curve, which was significantly different in ACTH-treated mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental figure 2</xref>).

ACTH excess induced hypokalemia. These mice also had hypernatremia and increased plasma osmolarity and increased plasma copeptin, which are all indicative of volume contraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental table 1</xref>). Total sodium excretion over 24 hours was not affected by ACTH infusion, consistent with overall sodium balance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Sodium excretion has diurnal variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>, <bold>left</bold>) and physiologically ~75% of the total output is achieved during the period of activity. ACTH disrupted this diurnal variation, with only ~50% of the sodium output achieved during the active period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>, <bold>right</bold>).

GFR again autoregulated effectively in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting that hemodynamic impairment was not evident in the afferent arteriole, and was restricted to the larger renal arteries.</p><p id="P25">To investigate this further, wire myography was used to examine <italic>ex vivo</italic> constriction and relaxation responses of the renal artery. The contractile response to the depolarization stimulus (125 mM extracellular potassium) was no different between control and ACTH-treated groups and did not deteriorate over the time course of the myography protocol.

Recordings were made in n=4 mice for three consecutive baseline days and over 21 days of ACTH infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). ACTH infusion increased BP and at the end of the protocol both 24h systolic BP (+7.0±1.5 mmHg; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and 24h diastolic BP (+2.1±0.6 mmHg; <italic>P</italic>=0.004; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) were increased compared to baseline.

On a normal salt intake, Cushing Syndrome impaired the diurnal rhythm of sodium excretion and BP. The capacity of high salt intake to suppress aldosterone was lost and ACTH-excess promoted a transition to salt-sensitive hypertension, which in humans increases cardiovascular and mortality risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P33">Pressure natriuresis uses intrarenal paracrine signalling to modulate sodium excretion in response to renal artery perfusion pressure. Blood flow in the renal medulla is key to pressure-natriuresis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and an imbalance in any component diminishes its effectiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. It is a gateway to salt-sensitive hypertension, although whether this is through sodium retention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> or as a hallmark of generalised vasodysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> is controversial. In our mouse model of Cushing Syndrome, the peak increase in fractional sodium excretion, an index of tubular reabsorption, was about half that of control animals. This is a significant failure to downregulate epithelial sodium transport. Our study does not identify the specific transporter(s) responsible but it is unlikely to be a single point of failure: glucocorticoid excess will activate GR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and MR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> to promote sodium transport all along the nephron and can stimulate NCC and NKCC2 indirectly because of hypokalemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. It is also possible that the primary abnormality lies within the vascular, or pressure-sensing part of the response, rather than the effector systems that lead to natriuresis. We found that glucocorticoid excess increased renal blood flow and reduced the ability to autoregulate blood flow against a rise in renal perfusion pressure. This is important for two reasons: first, barotrauma to glomeruli contributes to progressive renal injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Second, an abnormal autoregulatory index can signal a generalized hemodynamic dysfunction that attenuates the ability of the kidney to “sense” pressure. Dahl Salt-Sensitive rats, for example, also have an impaired autoregulatory index and renal blood flow rises with BP across the physiological range of BP. It might be anticipated that this would cause larger blood flows through the renal medulla and augment pressure natriuresis. However, the relationship is reset so that at any given BP, renal blood flow is higher and medullary flow is lower than in salt-resistant animals: the pressure natriuresis response is impaired<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P34">Our study did not measure medullary blood flow directly and because we did not use manoeuvres to reduce renal perfusion pressure below baseline values, the full autoregulatory range was not assessed. Nevertheless, our results point to abnormalities in myogenic tone which contribute to progressive autoregulatory failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Generalised vasodysfunction contributes importantly to salt-sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and we therefore used isolated renal and mesenteric arteries to gain mechanistic insight into general vascular pathology. As anticipated, there was a molecular signature of increased glucocorticoid exposure in both arteries but only the renal artery showed an attenuated vasodilation response to acetylcholine. Notably, Cushing patients can show reduced nitric oxide bioavailability and animal models of glucocorticoid excess provide evidence of endothelial dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. However, this is not evident in our model and the impaired dilation response to the nitric oxide donor instead point to a vascular smooth muscle cell defect. In this context, conditional deletion of GR in vascular smooth muscle protects against dexamethasone induced hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> It is possible that our model captures early vascular pathophysiology and that the conduit renal artery is more susceptible to this than the mesenteric resistance arteries. In this context, we assessed mRNA for VEGF receptor 2, because VEGF is elevated along with other markers of arterial remodelling in Cushing patients, more so than in hypertension or Conns disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. <italic>Vegfr2</italic> was increased only in the renal artery; reduced elastin and increased TGFB mRNA provide other hallmarks of remodelling. An interesting observation was reduced expression of Emilin-1, a structural protein of the elastic fibre expressed in the adventitia. Emilin-1 acts as an endogenous brake on TGFB signalling and loss of function disrupts the collagen network reducing vascular elastogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and, myogenic tone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>: knockout mice are hypertensive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P35">Impaired pressure-natriuresis response is proposed as a core causal mechanism for the development of salt-sensitive hypertension, driving sodium retention and ECFV expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Consistent with this are studies in healthy humans in which chronic infusion of either ACTH or cortisol causes sodium retention and volume expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. However, our studies were performed after sustained ACTH excess and we have no evidence at this time point for ECFV expansion. Indeed, the mice had hypernatremia, plasma hypertonicity and elevated copeptin, all of which are indicative of ECFV contraction rather than volume expansion. However, even with the low equivalent sodium intake provided by regular rodent diets, our studies identify a reduced capacity to rapidly excrete salt. The diurnal pattern of sodium excretion was disrupted by ACTH excess and relatively more sodium was excreted during the sleep phase. Given that glucocorticoids are important circadian hormones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, it is possible that a disrupted sleep/eat cycle contributes to the changed sodium excretion pattern. However, two things argue against this. First, telemetry recording of activity and heart rate indicate that the normal diurnal variation of the sleep/wake cycle was maintained during ACTH infusion; second, urine flow and potassium excretion retained normal diurnal variation, suggesting that the circadian abnormality is specific for salt.</p><p id="P36">The increased excretion of sodium during the sleep phase was parallelled by disrupted BP rhythmicity, with attenuation of the “dip”. Non-dipping BP is an independent cardiovascular risk factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> and commonly observed in Cushing patients, particularly those with an adrenal origin for the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. These circadian abnormalities in salt excretion and BP are seen in human studies and have been attributed to an impaired pressure natriuresis response: a diminished capacity to efficiently excrete salt during the day causes BP to remain elevated at night to excrete the residual salt and achieve balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P37">Our model of Cushing Syndrome displayed renal and cardiovascular abnormalities suggesting loss of resilience in salt homeostasis and we hypothesized that the mice would show a strong salt sensitive BP. Examining the response to a high salt challenge in a single group of mice before and after chronic ACTH infusion revealed that C57BL6 mice, which are often considered a salt-resistant strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, have a degree of salt-sensitivity. Others have reported this<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> and our previous work indicates that the salt-sensitivity reflects increased sympathetic drive and not impaired pressure natriuresis and salt retention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. ACTH infusion amplified the BP response to high salt diet, supporting our hypothesis. Furthermore, despite persistent hypokalemia, ACTH-infusion abolished the suppression of aldosterone by salt intake. This might reflect a direct stimulatory effect of ACTH on aldosterone synthase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, overriding the normal drivers of aldosterone regulation.</p><p id="P38">In summary, the mouse model of Cushing Syndrome displays reduced ability of the kidney to regulate BP <italic>via</italic> salt excretion. Activated salt preference – increased salt intake in the salt replete state – may reflect activation of central pathways linked to gratification of primal needs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> and would potentiate the vulnerability to salt loads. There are further confounding factors: a single high salt meal stimulates ACTH and cortisol production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and chronic high salt intake modulates CNS and peripheral pathways to enhance circulating and tissue glucocorticoid bio-availability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P39">Given that high salt intake is the societal norm worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, this intersection of detrimental salt homeostasis phenotypes can create a vicious cycle impacting BP.
