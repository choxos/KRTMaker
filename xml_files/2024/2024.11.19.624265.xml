One major control point of this process is the Golgi apparatus, whose dysfunction causes numerous connective tissue disorders. Golgi function is tightly linked to its structure, which is maintained by the cytoskeleton and Golgi organising proteins. We sought to investigate the role of two of these organising proteins, the golgins GMAP210 and Golgin-160, in ECM secretion. We found that loss of either protein had distinct impacts on Golgi organisation. GMAP210 loss caused cisternal fragmentation and dilation, alongside the accumulation of tubulovesicular structures. Meanwhile, Golgin-160 knockout lead to Golgi fragmentation and vesicle build-up. Nonetheless, loss of each protein had a similar impact on ECM secretion and glycosaminoglycan synthesis. We therefore propose that golgins are collectively required to create the correct physical-chemical space to support efficient ECM protein secretion and modification. This is the first time that Golgin-160 has been shown to be required for ECM secretion.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex network of proteins, carbohydrate and mineral secreted by cells to build a scaffold that forms the structural basis of most tissues. To date, current resources describing the ‘matrisome’ have identified &gt;1000 proteins associated with this compartment in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Shao et al., 2023</xref>), explaining the capacity for extensive diversification of biochemical and mechanical properties between tissue types. The most abundant family of ECM proteins are the collagens. These proteins assemble to form the main structural components of connective tissues alongside other fibre and network forming proteins such as fibronectin and elastin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Karamanos et al., 2021</xref>). This assembly is supported by accessory factors like the proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Couchman and Pataki, 2012</xref>), a diverse set of proteins characterised by the presence of at least one glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain which helps to promote tissue hydration and sequester signalling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gandhi and Mancera, 2008</xref>). Meanwhile ECM turnover is regulated by secreted proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Arpino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Lee and Murphy, 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P4">All newly synthesized ECM proteins must transit the secretory pathway to reach the extracellular environment for assembly. As they do so, many are heavily modified, which alters their chemistry and consequently the way in which they interact and assemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adams, 2023</xref>). Regulation of ECM protein modification is therefore crucial to the assembly of a functional matrix. One of the main compartments responsible for facilitating this process is the Golgi apparatus, which contains enzymes catalysing modifications such as O-glycosylation, N- and O-linked glycan maturation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, lipidation and sulphation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Potelle et al., 2015</xref>). Given this central role in protein processing it is unsurprising that a great number of genes affecting Golgi function have been linked to various connective tissue disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hellicar et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Golgi structure is highly complex and tightly linked to its function. In mammalian systems it is composed of a stack of flattened, fenestrated membranous compartments called cisternae, which are laterally connected to form an interconnected Golgi ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Lowe, 2011</xref>). These stacks are polarised such that cargoes arriving from the ER enter the Golgi stack at the <italic>cis-</italic>face, transit through the <italic>medial</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> compartments, and then get sorted before exiting the Golgi at the <italic>trans</italic> Golgi network (TGN). Golgi resident enzymes are distributed across the cisternae with a <italic>cis-trans</italic> polarity to support the successive addition of post-translational modifications to cargoes as they transit the compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Rabouille et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tie et al., 2022</xref>). This distribution is maintained by intra-Golgi vesicular transport which recycles enzymes between Golgi cisternae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Arab et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P6">One of the major protein families responsible for maintaining Golgi organisation is the golgin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Barr and Short, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gillingham and Munro, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Witkos and Lowe, 2015</xref>). These proteins project coiled-coil domains into the cytosol from the Golgi surface to tether other Golgi membranes and transport vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Lowe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>). Specific golgins localise to distinct regions of the Golgi organelle and this, combined with their affinity for different vesicles, confers directionality and specificity to intra-Golgi traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wong et al., 2017</xref>). We and others have shown that one of these golgins, giantin, is required for the secretion of a healthy extracellular matrix. Loss of giantin prevents proper processing of the procollagen type I N-propeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Stevenson et al., 2021</xref>), impacts the abundance of ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Katayama et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kikukawa and Suzuki, 1992</xref>), and impairs GAG metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kikukawa et al., 1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kikukawa et al., 1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kikukawa et al., 1990</xref>). These phenotypes are variable between animal models, but interestingly, always impact skeletal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Katayama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Lan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Stevenson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Suzuki et al., 1988</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Another golgin which has been linked to ECM deposition and skeletal development is GMAP210. Mutations in the <italic>TRIP11</italic> gene encoding GMAP210 are causative of the human skeletal diseases achondrogenesis type 1A and odontochondrodysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Costantini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Del Pino et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Medina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Qian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Smits et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Upadhyai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Wehrle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Yeter et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Trip11</italic> mutant mice have a similar phenotype to giantin mutant rats, with both models showing neonatal lethal chondrodysplasia characterised by craniofacial defects, shortened limbs and ribs, and delayed mineralisation of bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bird et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Follit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Smits et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Yamaguchi et al., 2021</xref>). Loss of GMAP210 also impacts the secretion of specific ECM proteins in a selective manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bird et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Smits et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Yamaguchi et al., 2021</xref>)</p><p id="P8">Altogether these studies suggest that extracellular matrix secretion is particularly susceptible to the loss of at least two golgins, which appear to act non-redundantly in this context. This led us to question the extent to which ECM deposition is sensitive to the loss of golgins more widely, and how this relates to changes in Golgi organisation. To begin addressing this, we performed a comparative study between GMAP210 and a third golgin, Golgin-160. Golgin-160 was chosen because it resides on <italic>cis-</italic>Golgi membranes like GMAP210 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hicks et al., 2006</xref>) but remains poorly characterised at a functional level. Here we report that knockout of Golgin-160 has a similar impact on ECM organisation and composition as GMAP210 loss. Golgi morphology on the other hand, is affected differently, consistent with the two golgins acting in different ways to maintain Golgi homeostasis. We therefore conclude that GMAP210 and Golgin-160 function non-redundantly to create the correct physical and biochemical space to support the modification and secretion of complex ECM molecules.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Generation of golgin knockout cell lines</title><p id="P9">To test the role of different golgins on matrix secretion, we generated two GMAP210 and Golgin-160 knockout (KO) clones using CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering. GMAP210 KO clone 1 was generated using a gRNA targeting exon 4 of the <italic>TRIP11</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>). This exon is common to both predicted protein coding transcripts TRIP11-201 (Ensembl transcript ID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Transcript/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000100815;r=14:91965991-92040896;t=ENST00000267622">ENST00000267622.8</ext-link> Uniprot ID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15643-1">Q15643-1</ext-link>) and TRIP11-202 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Transcript/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000100815;r=14:91965991-92040896;t=ENST00000554357">ENST00000554357.5</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/H0YJ97">H0YJ97</ext-link>) and so mutation should impact all protein expression. The generated mutation was a single base pair insertion of alanine resulting in a frame shift from position Glu<sup>114</sup> and truncation at amino acid 155 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>). GMAP210 KO clone 2 was generated using a gRNA targeting exon 1 of transcript TRIP11-202 and upstream of the predicted start site of the longer transcript TRIP11-201. This resulted in a 10bp deletion in the promoter region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>). Loss of protein expression was confirmed in both clones by immunofluorescence using three different antibodies targeting the N- and C-terminus of the GMAP210 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>) and western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 1C</xref>). Note trance amounts of protein could be detected with the C-terminal antibody suggesting a truncation product may persist. Nonetheless, we considered this sufficient depletion for further study.</p><p id="P10">Golgin-160 KO clones were generated using a gRNA targeting exon 20 of transcript GOLGA3-201 (ensemble ID ENST00000204726.9, Uniprot ID: Q08378-1). This is expected to mutate all predicted transcripts encoding fragments larger than 44 amino acids. Mutation with this gRNA consistently produced a single alanine insertion, resulting in frame shift at amino acid Glu<sup>1312</sup> and truncation at amino acid 1331 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 1A</xref>). Consequently, two clones with the same mutation were carried forward for experiments to rule out clonal effects. Protein loss was confirmed by immunofluorescence and western blotting, again with antibodies targeting both the N- and C-terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 1D,E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Loss of either GMAP210 or Golgin-160 causes changes in ECM assembly and organisation</title><p id="P11">To investigate the requirement for GMAP210 and Golgin-160 in ECM secretion and assembly, we grew our new KO lines for a week in the presence of ascorbic acid to promote collagen secretion and visualised the cell-derived ECM by immuno-fluorescence labelling. Co-labelling of two major fibrillar ECM components, collagen type 1 and fibronectin, revealed an extensive network of highly aligned and organised extracellular fibrils in wildtype (WT) cell cultures, with cell nuclei stretching along the fibril axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-D</xref>). In GMAP210 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>) and Golgin-160 KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref>) cell cultures on the other hand, fibrils were identifiable, but they were less well ordered, showing poor alignment and an increase in branching. To examine the structure of these fibrils more closely, the cell layer was extracted, and the remaining cell-derived matrix was imaged by high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). Again, fibrils were less well organised in all golgin KO cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-F</xref>). They were also thinner, however the periodicity of the collagen fibrils was largely unchanged, suggesting assembly of collagen trimers into fibrils is normal but lateral interconnections between fibrils may be reduced.</p><p id="P12">The overall fluorescence intensity of collagen staining in the matrix appeared reduced in the KO cultures. We therefore determined the abundance of collagen type I in lysate and matrix fractions of cell cultures by immunoblotting against the Col1a1 chain. Col1a1 abundance in the lysate fractions of mutant cultures was comparable to that of WT lysates when normalised to total protein, suggesting expression is normal and collagen is not retained inside the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A,Ci</xref>). Col1a1 abundance was, however, reduced in the ECM fraction of all mutant lines when normalised against total cellular protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B, Cii</xref>), suggesting it is not being efficiently incorporated into the insoluble matrix. Collagen in the media was below the level of detection by this method.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>ECM composition is altered following loss of GMAP210 and Golgin-160</title><p id="P13">To determine whether the observed changes in ECM organisation in the golgin KO cultures reflect changes in ECM composition, the cell-derived matrix from WT and KO cultures was collected and analysed by mass-spectrometry. Principal component analysis showed distinction between the WT and Golgin-160 KO and between the KO matrix samples, but variation between repeats was high (Supplementary Figure2A). Results were filtered against the matrisome database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Shao et al., 2023</xref>) to indicate proteins specifically related to ECM structure and function. Overall, fewer proteins were significantly impacted by loss of Golgin-160 than of GMAP210, however there was a great deal of overlap between the KO lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). For example, laminin subunit gamma 1 (LAMC1), Laminin subunit alpha 5 (LAMA5), hemicentin-1 (HMCN1), Latent Transforming Growth Factor Beta Binding Protein 1 (LTBP1) and Transforming Growth Factor Beta 2 (TGFB2) were significantly reduced in abundance in at least one Golgin-160 KO line as well as the GMAP210 KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). Conversely, the abundance of fibrillins was increased in all KO lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). Interestingly, Lysyl Oxidase Like 1 (LOXL1), which was upregulated in the GMAP210 KO ECM, was downregulated in Golgin-160 KOs, and vice versa for Procollagen-Lysine,2-Oxoglutarate 5-Dioxygenase 1 (PLOD1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-C</xref>). This hints at golgin specific changes in the post-translational modification of collagen. Altogether these data show that both GMAP210 and Golgin-160 are required for the deposition of a well-organised ECM. The similarity seen between ECM phenotypes in GMAP210 and Golgin-160 KO cells also demonstrates the non-redundant nature of these golgins in this context and the broad susceptibility of ECM cargoes to golgin loss.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>GMAP210 and Golgin-160 are not required for procollagen processing</title><p id="P14">We have shown previously that KO of giantin disrupts procollagen processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Stevenson et al., 2021</xref>). To test whether impaired collagen processing is contributing to the ECM phenotypes reported here too, we interrogated our ECM proteomics data set for peptides relating to collagen pro-domains. Collagen type IV had the highest peptide count and therefore provided the most robust analysis. Comparing the average peptide counts across the Col4a2 sequence we found no significant increase in the number of peptides containing an intact N-propeptide cleavage site in the KO cultures (N-propeptide overlap sequence, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 2B and C</xref>), indicating that processing of collagen type IV proceeds effectively in the absence of Golgin-160 and GMAP210. Expression of a procollagen type 1 construct in which the N-propeptide is GFP tagged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">McCaughey et al., 2019</xref>), also revealed the presence of free collagen type I N-propeptide cleavage products in both WT and Golgin-160 KO cells indicating successful cleavage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 2D</xref>). GMAP210 KO cells did not tolerate procollagen type I over-expression and could not be tested. Altogether, these data indicate that loss of GMAP210 or Golgin-160 does not phenocopy loss of giantin with respect to collagen processing, and that this is not a contributing factor to the observed ECM phenotypes here.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Loss of GMAP210 or Golgin-160 leads to distinct changes in Golgi morphology</title><p id="P15">Having established that loss of GMAP210 or Golgin-160 has a similar impact on ECM deposition, we next sought to determine the impact of golgin loss on Golgi organisation. Cells were labelled with markers of the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>medial</italic>-Golgi and the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN). Golgi area and extent of fragmentation were then measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-D</xref>). Strikingly, each golgin KO had a different impact on Golgi morphology. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bird et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Smits et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Wehrle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Yamaguchi et al., 2022</xref>), loss of GMAP210 resulted in a clear compaction of Golgi structures compared to wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>). The Golgi also appeared fragmented, although this was difficult to quantify due to this compaction and poor definition of Golgi elements. In Golgin-160 KO cells on the other hand, no consistent change in Golgi size was observed, but there was a clear increase in Golgi fragment number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>). In all KO lines, the <italic>cis-trans</italic> polarity of the Golgi appeared to be maintained, although again this was harder to ascertain in the GMAP210 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To better define the impact of KO on Golgi membrane organisation, higher resolution imaging was performed using single-tilt electron tomography. For each cell line, 3D tomographic reconstructions were generated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental movies 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">3</xref>) and a section of the Golgi was segmented to build a 3D model of membrane organisation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental movies 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E-G</xref>). In these models, membranes associated with the Golgi apparatus were grouped into four structural categories: cisternae (blue), defined as laterally flattened, stacked membranous compartments; dilated structures (red) - large volume structures lacking flattened regions; tubulovesicular structures (yellow) - convoluted structures with interconnected regions of spherical and tubular shape; and vesicles (green) – small, spherical structures.</p><p id="P17">In wildtype cells, as expected, we observed tightly stacked, evenly flattened, fenestrated cisternae that were laterally connected to span lengths of tens of microns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). Dilated and tubulovesicular structures were predominantly localised to the <italic>trans</italic> side of the Golgi in these cells, with small numbers of vesicles concentrated at the cisternal rims and <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi face. In contrast, although the Golgi was identifiable in GMAP210 KO cells, membranes were highly disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). The cisternae were mostly stacked, but they were short with no lateral connections and few fenestrations, and many were dilated or had bulges along their length, particularly at the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-end of the stack. Some membranous structures resembling these dilated cisternae were also observed near, but not part of, a stack but their origin and identity is hard to assign. Finally, in many instances the cisternae were surrounded by extensive tubulovesicular structures interspersed with vesicles that wrapped around the mini-stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4Fiii, iv</xref>). Some of these structures had tunnel like indentations, which in cross-section appeared as internalised vesicles but were continuous with the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4Fii-iii</xref>, open headed arrows). Note, we did not see any obvious ER swelling as has been reported to occur in a cell type specific manner in some <italic>in vivo</italic> studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bird et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Smits et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Yamaguchi et al., 2021</xref>). Despite the similarity of the tubulovesicular membranes to ERGIC membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Appenzeller-Herzog and Hauri, 2006</xref>), we did not see any gross changes to ERGIC53 distribution in these cells at the light level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). To conclude, the geometry and organisation of Golgi membrane is severely perturbed in the absence of GMAP210 in a way that is suggestive of both structural and trafficking defects.</p><p id="P18">Examination of Golgin-160 KO cells showed well stacked, tightly flattened cisternae that remained juxtanuclear as in wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). However, consistent with the immunofluorescence data, there were very few lateral connections between cisternae meaning membranes were fragmented into closely apposed ministacks rather than forming a classical ribbon architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4Gi</xref>, pink brackets). Cisternae also appeared to have internal vesicles or holes unlike control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4Gii</xref>, double headed arrows). Strikingly, there was a clear accumulation of vesicular structures in the area surrounding the cisternal rims, as well as both the <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4Gv</xref>). This coincided with a high incidence of spherical structures attached to the membranes of cisternal rims that resembled frustrated vesicle budding or fusion profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4Gii</xref>, pink arrow). Intriguingly, budding vesicles were also frequently observed at the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4Giii</xref>, closed head arrows). Although the accumulating vesicles were reminiscent of COPI vesicles with an electron dense coat, we were unable to observe any gross changes in COPI localisation at the light level by immunofluorescence and individual puncta could not be distinguished in the Golgi region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 3B</xref>). In conclusion, loss of GMAP210 or Golgin-160 has a different impact on Golgi structural organisation.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Loss of either GMAP210 or Golgin-160 leads to reduced secretion of ECM components and regulators</title><p id="P19">Given the clear disruption to Golgi organisation in our knockout lines, we decided to look at secretion more generally. Cells were grown in serum-free medium overnight, before collecting the media to analyse the abundance of soluble secreted proteins by mass spectrometry. Three independent replicate samples were collected for all WT and KO lines and analysed simultaneously by 15-plex tandem-mass tagging mass spectrometry. The sum of raw abundance revealed replicate one to have contained more protein and thus pair-wise comparisons within replicates were chosen over averages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 4A</xref>). Principal component analysis reiterated the need for paired analysis with PC1 and 2 separating the samples by replicate, however good separation was observed at PC3 and PC4 between WT, Golgin-160 KO and GMAP210 KO lines, with individual clones clustering together for each KO. This indicates genotype is a key contributor to variance and highlights variation between secretomes in each line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 4B</xref>). The two individual KO clones for each golgin were pooled using a linear regression model to increase statistical power. Log-fold change in protein abundance was plotted against p-value to identify proteins whose secretion is significantly altered in KO cultures compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p id="P20">In total, 482 proteins and 427 proteins showed altered raw abundance (p&lt;0.05) in the secretome of GMAP210 KO and Golgin-160 KO cultures respectively compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 4C</xref>). GO term analysis revealed that the top 15 biological pathways affected in both golgin KO samples included collagen fibril and extracellular matrix organisation, consistent with the ECM defects described above, as well as cell adhesion and migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Proteins involved in osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation were also impacted by golgin loss. This was not surprising for the GMAP210 KOs given the skeletal phenotypes reported in animal models and human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bird et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Costantini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Del Pino et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Follit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Medina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Qian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Smits et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Upadhyai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Wehrle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Yamaguchi et al., 2021</xref>), but intriguingly, a similar effect was seen following loss of Golgin-160, which has not been reported to cause a skeletal phenotype in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Banu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bentson et al., 2013</xref>). Pathways associated with proteolysis and signalling appeared to be impacted by the loss of Golgin-160 specifically (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Examination of the individual proteins most heavily affected by loss of each golgin shows a clear depletion of ECM components and regulators in the media of both KO cultures, with a high degree of overlap between GMAP210 and Golgin-160 KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> - proteins impacted in the same way by each KO circled blue, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 4C</xref>). For example, the protein family showing the greatest depletion in both mutant media fractions were the proteoglycans. Biglycan (BGN), decorin (DCN), versican (VCAN) all showed reduced abundance in both KO samples, with aggrecan (AGRN) also depleted in the Golgin-160 KO and testican (SPOCK1) impacted in the GMAP210 KOs. This suggests the proteoglycans are particularly susceptible to Golgi dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> – proteins in green). Collagen types IV, V and VI, fibronectin (FBN), and nidogen 2 (NID2) also showed reduced abundance in the media from both KO lines compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, the secretion of matrix regulating enzymes such as FAM20C Golgi Associated Secretory Pathway Kinase (FAM20C) and PLOD2, as well as signalling molecules like TGFb, Growth Differentiation Factor 6 (GDF6) and LTBP2, was significantly downregulated in both KOs. Surprisingly, the protein showing the greatest increase in secretion in both KO lines was the intracellular protein Rho GDP Dissociation Inhibitor Beta (ARHGDIB), indicating aberrant translocation to the extracellular space.</p><p id="P22">As well as these similarities, we also observed many golgin-specific changes in this data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref> - proteins circled in purple differentially impacted by each KO, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 4C</xref>). For instance, thrombospondin secretion is more greatly affected in GMAP210 KO cultures, whilst Golgin-160 KO cells fail to efficiently secrete numerous additional ECM proteins and regulators like laminins and TIMP metalloproteases. Several components of the complement system also showed reduced secretion in the Golgin-160 KO cell lines implying this pathway may be impaired following Golgin-160 loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5Aii</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 4C</xref>). Overall, most proteins impacted by Golgin-160 loss showed reduced rather than increased abundance in culture media. In GMAP210 KO cells on the other hand, there were a significant number of proteins showing increased secretion, although these tended not to be ECM components. Of note, several lysosomal enzymes were released from GMAP210 KO cells suggesting either poor sorting at the Golgi or increased lysosome secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5Aii</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 4C</xref>). In conclusion, although the secretion of a large subset of ECM proteins is broadly susceptible to loss of golgin function, there are also cargoes that show specificity with respect to their reliance on particular golgins.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Golgin KOs induce changes in gene expression for some secreted proteins</title><p id="P23">Changes in secreted protein abundance in cell culture medium could arise due to altered gene expression of the cargos or altered trafficking to the cell surface. To test the former, we performed RT-PCR to measure the expression of cargo proteins identified in the secretome analysis. The proteins showing the greatest negative and positive fold change in abundance in the media of the KO cells were biglycan and ARHGDIB respectively. Consistent with this, we found that the expression of mRNA encoding each protein mirrored these changes, with biglycan expression reduced and ARHGDIB expression increased in KO clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). To determine whether gene expression correlated with secretion more widely, three more targets were tested by RT-PCR: THBS1, which is only affected in GMAP210 KO cells; PLOD1, which is only impacted by Golgin-160 loss; and FAM20C, which shows reduced secretion in both KO lines. The expression of FAM20C was reduced in all KO clones, in line with secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). However, PLOD1 expression was not significantly altered in any of the KO lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>) and THBS1 expression was not consistently impacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Gene expression levels therefore did not fully predict secretion patterns for all targets, suggesting golgin loss can lead to changes to ECM secretion in different ways.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Biglycan trafficking is unaffected by golgin loss</title><p id="P24">We next wanted to determine the direct impact of our golgin mutations on cargo transport and modification. For this we focused on biglycan as the protein showing the greatest fold change in secretion in all lines. Stable cell lines were generated expressing a construct encoding biglycan tagged with both mScarlet and a streptavidin binding protein (SBP) to allow live imaging of exogenous biglycan transport under the control of the RUSH trafficking system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Boncompain et al., 2021</xref>). In this system, tagged biglycan is expressed alongside a streptavidin-tagged ER hook, which binds the SBP tag on the biglycan and holds it in the ER. The addition of biotin prior to imaging is then used to outcompete this interaction and release biglycan for anterograde trafficking. In these experiments, the ER hook (not fluorescently labelled) is transiently expressed on a bi-cistronic vector that also encodes BFP-tagged Mannosidase-II (MannII-BFP) to provide a Golgi marker.</p><p id="P25">In the absence of ER hook, stably expressed BGN-SBP-mSc was localised to both the ER and Golgi in all cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>). After transient transfection with the ER hook, successful anchoring of the tagged biglycan was confirmed by localisation of fluorescence to the ER at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6Ai, Bi, Ci</xref> T 00:00). Upon the addition of biotin, biglycan began to accumulate in cytoplasmic punctae, presumed to be ER exit sites, before moving towards the Golgi region in punctate carriers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Movies 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6Aii</xref>, Bii, Cii). Arrival at the Golgi region occurred approximately 14 minutes after biotin addition in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). Here, the biglycan signal initially accumulated adjacent to the ManII-BFP labelled structures, but then showed increasing colocalization with ManII-BFP as it progressed through the stack (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Movies 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6Ai, Bi, Ci</xref>). Finally, approximately 20 minutes after arrival at the Golgi, the emergence of post-Golgi carriers carrying biglycan to the cell periphery was readily observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6Aiii, Biii, Ciii, E</xref>). Overall, transport kinetics were similar in all lines tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D,E</xref>), suggesting biglycan secretion is unimpeded by loss of GMAP210 or Golgin-160, at least in an over-expression bulk transport system. The changes in Golgi organisation observed in KO lines do not therefore significantly impact general cargo transport.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Post-translational modification of biglycan is impaired in golgin KO cell lines</title><p id="P26">The inter-connectivity of Golgi cisternae and their spatial organisation is important to support and optimise the function of Golgi resident enzymes that post-translationally modify cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Zhang and Wang, 2016</xref>). ECM proteins are often highly modified and these modifications are important to their assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Adams, 2023</xref>). We therefore sought to determine whether the disruption to Golgi organisation in our mutants impacts ECM protein modification, which may in turn contribute to assembly defects. Proteoglycans are heavily modified by the addition of large, sulphated GAG chains, making them highly susceptible to Golgi dysfunction. We therefore continued to focus on biglycan as a model cargo.</p><p id="P27">To look for changes in modification, cells stably expressing BGN-SBP-mSc were grown in serum free media overnight before collecting the media and lysate fractions of cultures for western blotting. Immunoblotting for both biglycan and the mScarlet tag showed that exogenous biglycan is secreted by all mutant lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>), consistent with the RUSH assays. Furthermore, the ratio of intracellular to extracellular protein was maintained, suggesting secretion rates are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). We did, however notice a shift in the molecular weight distribution of secreted biglycan in mutant cultures. In WT conditioned media, secreted BGN-SBP-mSc was identifiable as a broad band at around 250 kDa, with a small amount of protein running at 150kDa. In all KO lines however, a higher proportion of the protein ran at the lower molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Calculation of the normalised ratio of 250 kDa vs 150 kDa protein confirmed this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Blotting with the higher affinity RFP antibody also showed the presence of fully unmodified BGN-SBP-mSc at 75kDa in the media fraction, which was again secreted to a greater extent by KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p id="P28">These data suggest biglycan post-translational modification is perturbed in a similar way in the absence of either golgin. To better understand the nature of the biglycan modification defect, we first assessed N-glycosylation by subjecting secreted BGN-SBP-mSc to digestion by PNGase F, which cleaves N-glycan chains. After treatment, an identical small shift in biglycan molecular weight was observed in all samples indicating that this modification is intact in KO cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>). Note, digestion had little impact on the higher molecular weight bands suggesting N-glycosylation does not contribute a significant amount to the mass of these biglycan forms. On the other hand, treatment of immunoprecipitated biglycan with chondroitinase ABC which digests GAG chains, did result in the loss of all higher and mid-molecular weight forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). Interestingly, there was some resistance to digest in the GMAP210 KO clones that we attribute to altered modifications affecting enzyme-substrate affinity. Thus, we conclude that glycanation of biglycan is defective in the golgin KO cells.</p><p id="P29">One Golgi organisational feature common to both GMAP210 and Golgin-160 KO lines is fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon. To test if this would be sufficient to impair GAG chain synthesis, we fragmented the Golgi in our cell lines using the microtubule depolymerising agent nocodazole and repeated our secretion assays. Consistent with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Harada et al., 2024</xref>), drug treatment impaired BGN modification in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). Surprisingly however, we also found that nocodazole treatment exacerbated the GAG modification defects in mutant cells, suggesting the observed fragmentation in KO lines was not fully pervasive. Overall, our studies show that GAG chain synthesis is impaired in the absence of both golgins tested.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">In this study we show that loss of two <italic>cis-</italic>Golgi localised golgins causes distinct changes to Golgi morphology and function that ultimately lead to similar defects in ECM secretion, assembly and organisation. This is the first time that loss of Golgin-160 has been shown to impact ECM deposition and highlights the broad susceptibility of ECM cargoes to golgin loss. Altogether our data suggest that the impact of golgin depletion on ECM assembly is manifold, with gene expression, protein secretion, protein modification and ECM turnover all affected.</p><p id="P31">This study provides the most in-depth characterisation of Golgi structure in the absence of GMAP210 to date. In agreement with previous reports, we observed that loss of GMAP210 results in compaction of Golgi structures in the peri-nuclear region, fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon and cisternal dilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Bird et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Smits et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Wehrle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Yamaguchi et al., 2021</xref>). We also note the concurrent unstacking of cisternae and build-up of tubulovesicular membranes in the peri-Golgi region. Altogether, this is indicative of a severe, general disruption to Golgi membrane dynamics. In 2014, Wong <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated that GMAP210 tethers GalNAcT2 containing vesicles and supports the correct localisation of the golgins giantin and GCC88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>). Its loss may therefore impact enzyme sorting and transport directly, whilst indirectly triggering a cascade of problems in membrane trafficking by causing the mis-localisation of other Golgi organising proteins.</p><p id="P32">Loss of Golgin-160 did not seem to affect Golgi stacking or cisternal flattening, however there was a clear build-up of transport vesicles. Unfortunately, we were unable to confirm whether these were COPI vesicles at the light level as individual vesicles could not be distinguished in the peri-Golgi region. Regardless, the large number of vesicles in the peri-Golgi region in KO cells is consistent with a loss of vesicle tethering function, which may explain the large number of cargoes negatively impacted by Golgin-160 loss. A second feature of Golgi organisation in Golgin-160 KO cells was fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon. It has been reported that Golgin-160 recruits dynein to Golgi membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Yadav et al., 2012</xref>). Microtubules are required to support lateral tethering of cisternae, and thus reduced motor and microtubule recruitment in the absence of Golgin-160 may underly this phenotype. Note, we did not observe the Golgi positioning or anterograde transport defects reported previously in another system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Yadav et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="P33">In humans, severe and hypomorphic mutations in the Trip11 gene encoding GMAP210 cause achondrogenesis type 1A (ACG1A) and odontochondrodysplasia (OCDC) respectively, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Costantini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Del Pino et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Medina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Qian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Upadhyai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Wehrle et al., 2019</xref>).

This implies it has a greater impact on transport. Consistent with this, Golgin-160 has been shown to bind to the Golgi-associated PDZ domain containing protein PIST/GOPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hicks and Machamer, 2005</xref>), which supports transport of cargoes to the plasma membrane. More specifically, the anterograde trafficking of the membrane-bound GLUT4 transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Williams et al., 2006</xref>) and β4 adrenergic receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hicks et al., 2006</xref>) has been shown to require Golgin-160. Our results expand the list of golgin-160 dependent cargoes in the context of soluble protein secretion and show that extracellular matrix components are particularly affected.</p><p id="P35">Overall, whilst Golgin-160 KO had a primarily negative impact on general secretion, more than half of the cargoes impacted by GMAP210 loss showed increased secretion in KO cells compared to WT. Interestingly this was not the case for ECM proteins, which were almost always negatively impacted. One family of proteins specifically impacted by GMAP210 KO were the lysosomal enzymes cathepsins, four of which were aberrantly secreted by KO cells. This raises the possibility that the increased abundance of certain proteins in GMAP210 KO culture medium may stem from sorting defects. Interestingly, secreted cathepsins have been implicated in ECM degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Vidak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Vizovisek et al., 2019</xref>). Of note, two of those identified here (cathepsins B + K) have been shown to cleave targets such as SPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Podgorski et al., 2009</xref>), collagen type IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Guinec et al., 1993</xref>), and fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Guinec et al., 1993</xref>), which were all reduced in abundance in the same KO media. Whether secreted cathepsins are contributing to the ECM phenotypes observed here therefore remains an intriguing open question, especially considering their potential as drug targets if found to contribute to disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Jangra et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Proteoglycans appear particularly susceptible to the loss of both GMAP210 and Golgin-160, with KO affecting both gene expression and glycanation of biglycan. The biosynthetic pathway for GAG chains serves as an excellent example of the importance of Golgi organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hellicar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Ricard-Blum et al., 2024</xref>). Chains are built by enzymes organised sequentially across the Golgi stack and competition between enzymes determines which types of GAG chains are built. Consequently, chain chemistry is determined by relative enzyme abundance, enzyme distribution, and trafficking speeds, making it particularly sensitive to a variety of Golgi perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Adusumalli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ahat et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). In our case, a common structural feature in both GMAP210 and Golgin-160 KO lines is Golgi fragmentation. Previously, this has been shown to disrupt the balance of GAG chain species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ahat et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Harada et al., 2024</xref>) and reduce overall GAG sulphation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ahat et al., 2022</xref>). We also find that nocodazole-induced Golgi fragmentation in RPE1 cells impairs biglycan GAG modification. Interestingly, nocodazole treatment of our mutant lines exacerbated glycan defects, suggesting that Golgi fragmentation is not fully pervasive. It is therefore worth considering the role of other golgin-specific changes to Golgi morphology.</p><p id="P37">The most prominent feature of Golgin-160 KO cells was the accumulation of transport vesicles. Loss of the COPI-binding COG complex has previously been shown to interfere with GAG chain length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Adusumalli et al., 2021</xref>), presumably due to impaired enzyme recycling. Thus, disruption to vesicular transport may contribute to glycan assembly defects in Golgin-160 KO cells. Meanwhile, a striking feature of GMAP210 KO cells was cisternal dilation, a feature also seen following the treatment of cells with actin destabilising drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lazaro-Dieguez et al., 2006</xref>). One such drug, cytochalasin B, also inhibits proteoglycan synthesis without impacting secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lohmander et al., 1979</xref>). Thus, cisternal dilation may contribute to glycan under-modification in the KO cells, perhaps by impacting the frequency with which membrane-bound enzymes interact with soluble luminal cargo and so reducing the efficiency of modification. Overall, it seems likely that the combined effect of different perturbations to Golgi homeostasis in each mutant cell line contribute to impaired glycanation.</p><p id="P38">In conclusion, we propose that golgins have distinct, non-redundant functions but work collectively to create the correct physical and biochemical space to support efficient ECM protein secretion and modification.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P39">Telomerase immortalised human retinal pigment epithelial cells (hTERT-RPE1) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in DMEM-F12-HAM (Life technologies #11320-033) supplemented with 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco A5256701), passaging 1:10 every 3-4 days.
