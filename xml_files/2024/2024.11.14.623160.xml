While intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling has been shown to control cell migration in multiple cell contexts, it is unknown whether it is required for DVE migration. The pattern of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in the mouse embryo at early peri-implantation stages is also unknown. Using the GCaMP6f Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter line we performed a detailed assessment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics between E0.5 – E5.5 using live imaging. We find that prior to implantation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are rare, but at E5.5 widespread, periodic, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in extra-embryonic tissues can be observed, including in the VE and ExE. In contrast, cells of the E5.5 epiblast remain relatively quiescent but show sporadic large-scale multi-cellular waves. Inhibition of SERCA at E5.5 abolishes Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and leads to DVE arrest, indicative that these transients are required for axial patterning. Together these results reveal the pattern of Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in the early mouse embryo and a novel requirement in anterior-posterior axis formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>calcium signalling</kwd><kwd>anterior visceral endoderm</kwd><kwd>embryonic patterning</kwd><kwd>axial asymmetry</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The distal visceral endoderm (DVE) is a specialised cell population in the embryonic day 5.5 (E5.5) mouse embryo that undergoes a collective migration required for anterior-posterior axis specification (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Thomas, Brown et al. 1998</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Srinivas, Rodriguez et al. 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Stower and Srinivas 2018</xref>).

However, they also show characteristics traditionally associated with mesenchymal cells – highly dynamic basally located projections polarised in the direction of migration (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Srinivas, Rodriguez et al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Migeotte, Omelchenko et al. 2010</xref>).

Cells can generate a transient cytosolic increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> through mobilisation from intracellular stores (including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus and mitochondria), or from extracellular sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Clapham 2007</xref>). This is controlled by ion pumps and channels including the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA)(<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Sanderson, Charles et al. 1994</xref>). Cells can also signal cell-to-cell via gap junctions (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Lin, Rurangirwa et al. 2004</xref>), causing a sequential wave of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that can span multiple cells in a tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Leybaert and Sanderson 2012</xref>). Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can regulate migration by influencing the cytoskeleton, cell polarity and focal adhesions (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Tsai, Kuo et al. 2015</xref>). For example, in mesenchymal cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup> can form a front-rear (high-low) gradient, polarising cells to form lamellipodia only at the front of the cell while mediating rear detachment of protrusions through regulation of focal adhesions (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Tsai, Kuo et al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Kim, Lee et al. 2016</xref>).

In the mouse 2-cell stage, it has been shown that small vesicles located at the sub-plasmalemmel cytoplasm, termed Membrane Associated RNA-containing Vesicles (MARVs) have a higher level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> than the cytosol (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Wang, Yasmin et al. 2022</xref>) and persist until embryonic day 3.5 (E3.5) (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Wang, Yasmin et al. 2022</xref>).

Therefore, there exists a gap in our knowledge of any role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the mouse at early stages.</p><p id="P8">It has been possible to visualise Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during early development using fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators such as f-aequorin (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Leclerc, Webb et al. 2000</xref>), Calcium Green-1 dextran (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Wallingford, Ewald et al. 2001</xref>) and Fluo-4 AM (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Wang, Yasmin et al. 2022</xref>). However, there are technical difficulties to these approaches in the mouse embryo, particularly as it grows, including the dilution of injected reporters as cells divide, and the necessity for diffusion of the dye throughout the depth of tissues. To circumvent these issues we made use of a genetically encoded fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter mouse line GCaMP6f (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Chen, Wardill et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Madisen, Garner et al. 2015</xref>) to perform a detailed stage-series assessment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics between E0.5 - E5.5 using time-lapse microscopy. We find that at up to E3.5 Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are rare, stochastic events, while at E4.5 there is a higher level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm compared to the epiblast. At E5.5 there is a significant up-regulation in the frequency and amplitude of oscillations mainly in the extra-embryonic tissues of the extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE and VE). The epiblast remains relatively quiescent, but we observe occasional multi-cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves that spread across this tissue. Inhibition of SERCA abolishes Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at E5.5 and causes the arrest of DVE migration, an event required for anterior-posterior axis formation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mouse strains</title><p id="P9">B6;129S-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm95.1(CAG-GCaMP6f)Hze</sup></italic>/J (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Madisen, Garner et al. 2015</xref>) that contain a Cre-inducible GCaMp6f reporter were crossed to B6.Cg-<italic>Edil3</italic><sup><italic>Tg(Sox2-cre)1Amc/</italic></sup>J, Sox2-Cre (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi, Lewis et al. 2002</xref>) mice to generate mice that constitutively express the GCaMP6f reporter.

To train the CNN, a training dataset was created by manually identifying the time-point of the peak of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in three E5.5 time-lapse datasets. These time-points were used to construct an idealised probability Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging trace where the intensity is non-zero only at the peak time-point. Given an input Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging trace, and its idealised equivalent a CNN was trained to predict the probability of observing a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient peak within a symmetrical temporal window of N=35 time-points. All raw GCaMP6f time-lapse data (Ca<sup>2+</sup> trace) were first de-trended using asymmetric least squares fitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Eilers and Boelens 2005</xref>) prior to CNN input. Unbiased clustering of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients per embryo was carried out to assess the similarity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in each embryo in an unbiased manner. Individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces were pairwise compared to construct a similarity matrix with similarity was defined as the largest positive value of the signal cross-correlation. A hierarchical density based clustering method (HDBSCAN), was then applied using the Python HDBSCAN package (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Campello, Moulavi et al. 2013</xref>) to the similarity matrix to cluster Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces. Global clustering across all embryos was performed by computing the similarity matrix pooling together all Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces from all embryos. Individual traces have different minimum and maximum intensities within individual embryos. Traces were first normalised per embryo by z-score, using the mean and standard deviation of all traces from the respective embryo. HDBSCAN generates the optimal clustering number given min_cluster_size – the minimum number of samples in a group for that group to be considered a cluster and min_samples – the number of samples in a neighbourhood for a sample to be considered as a core point. The output clusters include ‘core’ clusters, whereby traces have within a ‘core’ cluster have high intra-similarity and a ‘outlier’ cluster, which contain traces determined insufficiently similar to a trace with core clusters, and insufficient intra-similarity to form a new core cluster. This approach compares similarity based on the shape of Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces and is therefore tolerant to slight misalignment in peak times, and peak-to-peak distances. For the global clustering, qualitative examination of the outlier cluster showed traces had a similar spiking pattern but were asynchronous in time. Therefore we also used the ‘outlier’ class as a cluster in the global clustering result. We label the clusters numerically, in ascending order of the mean transient number of traces in the cluster. Therefore in our global clustering, cluster 2 is also the outlier class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). As quantitative measures of Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak behaviour, we computed the mean number of peaks, mean intensity of peaks, periodicity as the mean peak-to-peak distance, and the mean duration of peaks within a trace. Peak duration was measured per peak as the difference between start and end peak times. We define peak start time as the timepoint just before half peak intensity and end time as the timepoint just after half peak intensity.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Kymograph visualisation of GCaMP6f Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter activity</title><p id="P15">To visualise GCaMP6f Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter activity in time-lapses of E5.5 embryos, individual traces were stacked together as a kymograph, each row being the normalised intensity trace, each column a time-point, with signal intensity coloured using the ‘magma’ colour-scheme. The yellower/whiter the colour, the stronger the trace intensity. The purpler/blacker the colouring, the weaker the trace intensity. Traces were normalised by min-max normalisation, (trace – min)/(max – min) where min and max are the minimum and maximum intensity across all traces within an embryo. The colour-scheme was then applied to the value range [0,1]. Traces are row-sorted by performing an indirect stable sort with cluster number first and the time of its first peak second. For global clustering, where individual traces were z-scored per embryo instead of min-max normalised, the same row-sorting is applied but with the kymograph colouring applied to the positive value range [0, 2].</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Spatiotemporal analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in E5.5 embryos</title><p id="P16">To investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of calcium transients in E5.5 GCaMP6f:membrane-tdTomato time-lapses obtained at 5 second interval for 10 minutes duration we used Motion Sensing Superpixel (MOSES) tracking (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Zhou, Ruiz-Puig et al. 2019</xref>).

While 71% (N=20/28) control embryos showed DVE migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A-A’, D</xref>), only 10% (N=4/40) of thaspsigargin treated embryos showed DVE migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C-C’, D</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Fig. S4A-B</xref>), with Hex-GFP cells instead arrested at the distal tip of embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E-F</xref>’, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Fig. S4A</xref>’). We found a similar inhibition of DVE migration when embryos were cultured in 200nM CPA (only 6/25 embryos showed DVE migration when cultured for 10 hours with 200nM CPA compared with 14/14 control embryos), suggesting that SERCA regulation of Ca2+ activity is required for DVE migration.</p><p id="P39">As Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling can also regulate a wide-range of cellular processes including proliferation, apoptosis and cell fate, we fixed embryos that had been cultured in 10nM thapsigargin or DMSO for 8 hours and performed whole-mount immunohistochemistry for key markers. We found no significant difference in the number of cell divisions as marked by Phospho-Histone H3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Fig. S4C-C</xref>’), nor in the apoptotic marker Cleaved Caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Fig. S4D-D</xref>’). Though there was no effect on the apoptosis or cell proliferation, thapsigargin treated embryos were on average 7% smaller than DMSO cultured controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Fig. S4E</xref>). Finally, we found no difference in key cell identity markers of the epiblast (OCT4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Fig. S5A</xref>) or extra-embryonic ectoderm (CDX2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Fig. S5B</xref>), nor to the distribution of F-actin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16">Fig. S5C-C</xref>’).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Cellular projections in DVE cells are not inhibited by thapsigargin treatment</title><p id="P40">We next investigated the cellular mechanism underpinning thapsigargin-mediated DVE arrest.

We imaged E5.5 Hex-GFP embryos treated with 10nM thapsigargin or DMSO as a negative control, using high resolution lattice lightsheet microscopy to capture entire image volumes every 5 minutes over the course of 6 hours. In 76% (N=13/17) of control embryos, the DVE successfully migrated within 6 hours, and DVE cells in these embryos showed basal projections (N=17/17; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6.G-G</xref>”, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD15">Movie S15</xref>).

This indicates that SERCA inhibition of DVE migration is not due to the loss of basal projections in DVE cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P41">Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling can control a diverse range of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Clapham 2007</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Paudel, Sindelar et al. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Stewart and Davis 2019</xref>), but its potential role during early mouse development has not been well characterised. Using a transgenic Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter mouse, we performed a detailed assessment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity between E0.5 - E5.5 by live imaging. We find that Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, though initially rare events, become upregulated in a tissue specific manner as development progresses. Extra-embryonic tissues such as the E5.5 VE and ExE show increased occurrences of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients but, in contrast, the pluripotent epiblast remains relatively quiescent, with only occasional, large scale Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves that spread across the tissue. We show that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the VE are functionally important, since inhibition of transients by blocking SERCA leads to migration arrest of the DVE cell population that is required for correct A-P patterning.</p><p id="P42">Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been show to control several aspects of cell migration in other contexts including; the front-back polarity of cells (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Tsai, Kuo et al. 2015</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Kim, Lee et al. 2016</xref>), the behaviour of leading cells (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi, Yamamoto et al. 2018</xref>), and the regulation of lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Tsai and Meyer 2012</xref>). However, in this study we find that DVE cells do not show any differences in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level relative to surrounding VE cells, nor a clear front-to-back gradient within cells. Furthermore, we find that DVE cells retain dynamic cellular projections when cultured with inhibitors of SERCA. This indicates that such projections are either not sufficient to drive migration, or those that are present are somehow qualitatively altered so that they no longer can facilitate DVE migration, for example, by affecting the regulation of focal adhesions (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Giannone, Ronde et al. 2002</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">D’Souza, Lim et al. 2020</xref>). Alternatively, the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> could be non-cell autonomous – DVE cells must migrate through the emVE epithelium, with surrounding cells undergoing cell-cell rearrangements to accommodate the migrating cells (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Takaoka, Yamamoto et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Trichas, Joyce et al. 2011</xref>). As Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity occurs throughout the VE, it could regulate cell-cell interactions, for example via the WNT-PCP pathway (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Wallingford, Ewald et al. 2001</xref>), which has also been implicated in DVE migration (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Trichas, Joyce et al. 2011</xref>). Interestingly, control embryos cultured in DMSO also show a decrease in the average number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, but show no detectible defect in DVE migration. The reduction in transients in the DMSO controls is an order of magnitude lower than that seen upon SERCA inhibition, which suggests that is a threshold in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient activity below which DVE migration is impaired.</p><p id="P43">In addition to the VE, we also find periodic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the extra-embryonic ectoderm, which serves as an important developmental signalling centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Tam and Loebel 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Stower and Srinivas 2018</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been shown in other contexts to regulate cell fate as well as signalling pathways involved in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Clapham 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Stewart and Davis 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Paudel, Sindelar et al. 2018</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Mizuno, Shiozawa et al. 2020</xref>). Though we find no loss of the key cell fate marker CDX2 in the ExE upon inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at E5.5, it is currently unclear whether any signalling pathways are affected in this tissue.</p><p id="P44">Though periodic single-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients occur throughout extra-embryonic tissues at E5.5, we find that they rarely occur in the epiblast. When Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are observed in the epiblast, in contrast to those observed in extra-embryonic tissues, they span multiple cells and progress from cell to cell as a wave. The difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient activity between embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues is similar to that seen in other species such as <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Leclerc, Webb et al. 2000</xref>), Zebrafish (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Gilland, Miller et al. 1999</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Markova, Senatore et al. 2015</xref>), and suggests a possible conservation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling across species with respect to the relative quiescence of pluripotent embryonic cells. Where the epiblast shows a wave of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, we observed in a third of cases that it was preceded by a transient in a neighbouring emVE cell, suggesting that the VE cell could be acting as a ‘trigger’ to this event. Whether this is indeed the case will be important to clarify in future experiments, particularly given VE cells are in contact with the basal aspect of epiblast cells, while transients within epiblast cells propagate in a apical to basal direction.</p><p id="P45">At pre-implantation stages, we observed numerous puncta with high levels of GCAMP6f signal. These are similar to the vesicles (MARVs) and mitochondria observed in previous studies using the Fluo-4 AM dye (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Hildebrandt, Wang et al. 2019</xref>, <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Wang, Yasmin et al. 2022</xref>), though we do not confirm their identity in this study. We also find that such puncta are not present at later stages when the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients begin, suggesting that there is a transition in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling as development proceeds.</p><p id="P46">In conclusion we have found a novel requirement for Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling during anterior-posterior axis formation in E5.5 the mouse embryo. Future work, to understand its mechanism of action in the DVE, and other tissues at this stage will be required using targeted approaches to affect Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling in specific cell types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Movie S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Movie_S1.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d44aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Movie S2</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Movie_S2.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d44aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Movie S3</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Movie_S3.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d44aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Movie S4</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Movie_S4.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d44aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Movie S5</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Movie_S5.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d44aAcEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Movie S6</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Movie_S6.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d44aAcEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Movie S7</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Movie_S7.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d44aAcEhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Movie S8</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Movie_S8.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d44aAcEiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD9"><label>Movie S9</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Movie_S9.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d44aAcEjB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD10"><label>Movie S10</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Movie_S10.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d44aAcEkB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD11"><label>Movie S11</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Movie_S11.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d44aAcElB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD12"><label>Movie S12</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Movie_S12.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d44aAcEmB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD13"><label>Movie S13</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Movie_S13.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d44aAcEnB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD14"><label>Movie S14</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Movie_S14.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d44aAcEoB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD15"><label>Movie S15</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Movie_S15.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" id="d44aAcEpB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD16"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS200149-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d44aAcEqB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank: Dr Christophe Royer for help with pre-implantation stages; Helena Coker at the Oxford-ZEISS Centre of Excellence in Biomedical Imaging for assistance with the lattice light-sheet 7 microscope; the Micron Advanced Bioimaging Facility, supported by Wellcome Strategic Awards 091911/B/10/Z and 107457/Z/15/Z, for assistance the Z.1 lightsheet microscope; Pathology Services Building and Biomedical Services staff for excellent animal support; and Dr Satish Arcot Jayaram for help with mouse breeding.

G” and H” show the position of the DVE at the end of the 6 hour culture imaging period. While embryos imaged in both DMSO and thapsigargin showed cellular projections, only 7.7% (2/26) embryos culture with thapsigargin migrated in the 6 hours culture compared to 76% (13/17) of DMSO controls (see <bold>Movie S15</bold>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS200149-f006"/></fig></floats-group></article>
