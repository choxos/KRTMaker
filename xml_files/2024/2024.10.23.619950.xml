In Schlemm’s canal (SC) endothelium, impaired pore formation is associated with glaucoma. However, our understanding of the cellular processes responsible for pore formation is limited by lack of <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. Here, we present a novel platform for studying transcellular pore formation in human endothelial cells. We induced pores in SC cells by seeding them atop micron-sized magnetic beads followed by application of a magnetic field to subject cells to a basal to apical force, mimicking <italic>in vivo</italic> biomechanical forces. The pore formation process was dynamic, with pores opening and closing. Glaucomatous cells exhibited impaired pore formation that correlated with their increased stiffness. We further discovered that application of forces from the apical to basal direction did not induce pores in SC cells but resulted in formation of pores in other types of endothelial cells. Our studies reveal the central role of cell mechanics in formation of transcellular pores in endothelial cells, and provide a new approach for investigating their associated underlying mechanism/s.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Transcellular transfer of materials (<italic>e.g</italic>., cells, proteins, or fluids) directly across cellular barriers occurs during leukocyte transmigration through microvascular endothelial cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> glomerular filtration across endothelial cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> and drainage of aqueous humor (AH) from the eye via pores within the hybrid blood vasculature/lymphatic endothelial cells of Schlemm’s canal’s (SC) inner wall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> In these cases, a pore (opening) must be created through an endothelial cell without damaging the cell.

This, in turn, was expected to initiate the formation of transcellular pores. We thus randomly scattered carboxyl-coated, ferromagnetic microspheres with nominal ∅ 5 μm on gelatin-coated glass substrates, followed by seeding phSC cells on top of these particles (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). Cells were then cultured for 2 to 7 hours so that they adopted a spread configuration similar to that seen <italic>in situ</italic>.</p><p id="P6">Scanning electron micrographs of fixed cells confirmed that phSC cells stretched over particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), with transcellular pores appearing above some particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). We denote pores that formed in association with particles as “particle-induced pores.” Notably, these transcellular pores exhibited smooth edges, allowing for clear differentiation from artifacts characterized by irregular and jagged edges that were likely byproducts of the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) sample preparation process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> Using high resolution SEM images, cell membrane thickness at the smooth edge of pores were measured as 56 ± 11 nm (mean ± standard deviation, N = 15 cells). Note that the transcellular pores were also formed at the location of smaller (∅ 2 μm) particles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>); however, we only used ∅ 5 μm particles in the rest of this study to facilitate detection of particles, and hence of pores overlying particles.</p><p id="P7">We observed a significant diversity of transcellular pore locations and morphologies. For example, some pores formed directly above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>) or adjacent to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>) particles. Further, it appeared that particles could induce pore formation irrespective of their specific location beneath cells; for example, transcellular pores formed in cells both with particles situated away from (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b and c</xref>) and near (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d and e</xref>) the cell border. In many cases, we observed distinct and obvious artifactual cracks, particularly adjacent to the particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b and c</xref>), which we speculate is due to the cells stretching over the particles, rendering them more vulnerable to artifacts during the SEM sample preparation process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> However, there were instances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>) where the cell did not exhibit major artifacts adjacent to a particle despite noticeable cellular deformation. In the case shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, transcellular pores were formed to the side of the particle and extended along the direction of membrane stretching. Further, some particles induced the formation of only one transcellular pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, c, and d</xref>), while others induced multiple transcellular pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e and f</xref>). Of note, the transcellular pores shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref> exhibit a structure reminiscent of “toffee-like” pores previously reported by Braakman <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Transcellular pores are rapidly detectable using an <italic>in vitro</italic> fluorescent assay</title><p id="P8">We employed confocal microscopy and an established fluorescent assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) to further investigate cell deformation at the location of particles and to also rapidly identify transcellular pores without the need for time-consuming SEM imaging. In this assay, a fluorescent tracer (fluorescently labeled streptavidin) adheres to a biotinylated gelatin substrate at sites not obscured by cells, marking areas surrounding subconfluent cells and, notably, at transcellular pore locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, b</xref>).</p><p id="P9"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> illustrates the principle of the fluorescent assay to detect transcellular pores.

After seeding over particles, cells naturally deformed, thinning directly above the particle (white arrow in panel iii inset). Cell thickness was quantified using cytoplasmic and nuclear staining in cross-sectional views, revealing that cell thickness above particles (1.6 ± 0.3 μm) was significantly less than beside the particles (5.9 ± 0.7 μm; two-tailed, paired t-test: p-value &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>).

In contrast, in other cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>), a cellular opening (transcellular pore) overlying the particle was observed, with the fluorescent tracer also adhering to the substrate, indicating transcellular pore formation. We also detected intracellular vesicles that appeared as empty spaces after cytoplasmic staining in our confocal images (white arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d and Fig. 3g</xref>). It is important to clarify that unlike transcellular pores, these vesicles are not openings extending through the cell and were also observed in cells that were not positioned over particles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Transcellular pores are highly dynamic</title><p id="P11">To screen compounds that facilitate pore formation in cells, it is useful to increase the number of cells that are examined; further, it is essential to develop a protocol for testing the effects of investigational compounds on pore formation. Thus, we extended our original protocol to include a treatment step and a second tracer. In the modified protocol, cells were seeded over particles for 2-7 hours in 16-well chambered slides and exposed to a first fluorescent tracer for 5 minutes to detect particle-induced pores, as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Cells were then subjected to a “treatment” (here, an external magnetic field or a putative SC-active agent) for a defined time (10 minutes for the external magnetic fields and 30 minutes for the putative SC-active agent), after which they were incubated with a second fluorescent tracer for 5 minutes. We captured images using widefield microscopy (brightfield and fluorescence), which facilitated the examination of hundreds of cells per well (581 ± 189 cells/well).</p><p id="P12">We observed a diversity of pore formation behaviors, and for definiteness we classified pores based on their labelling patterns by the two fluorescent labels used in the assay:

This enhances confidence in the true transient nature of pores identified as “transient pores”.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="P16">The existence of these different classes of pores indicates that the pore formation process is dynamic, and that pores can close in addition to opening in our assay.

These results underscore the complex nature of pore formation. It is also of interest to note that the spatial extent of second tracer labelling outside of and between cells was generally larger than the extent of labeling with the first tracer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), likely due to cell movement over the course of the assay and some lateral diffusion of the second tracer during its exposure time.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Particles induce fewer transcellular pores in normal vs. glaucomatous phSC cells</title><p id="P18">SC pores are reduced in glaucoma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and we wondered whether this behavior would be replicated in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assay.

Although we observed significant variability in particle-induced pore formation rate between the tested cell strains, pooling the data for normal and glaucomatous cell strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>) indicated that the glaucomatous cell strains formed significantly fewer transcellular pores at particle locations vs. normal cells (7.0 ± 3.2 vs. 11.0 ± 5.0 % pore/particle; two-tailed Mann-Whitney test: p &lt; 0.0001). Given that age is also a risk factor for glaucoma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> we examined the influence of donor age on particle-induced pore formation rate in phSC cells.

When accounting for glaucoma status as an independent variable, multiple linear regression revealed a somewhat stronger correlation between particle-induced pore incidence rate and donor age across both normal and glaucomatous phSC cells (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.39, p = 0.0004; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3b</xref>). Note that our glaucomatous cells were generally obtained from older donors compared to the normal cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We further investigated the pore dynamics in normal and glaucomatous cells by counting the number of pores detected by the first fluorescent tracer which were closed 10 minutes later when the cells were exposed to the second fluorescent tracer without any treatment (transient pores; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Pooling the data for normal and glaucomatous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>) indicated that the fraction of particle-induced pores that were transient was not significantly different between normal and glaucomatous cells (0.60 ± 0.30 vs. 0.48 ± 0.33 transient pore/particle-induced pore; two-tailed Mann-Whitney test: p-value = 0.3706), suggesting that the duration of pores is not markedly different between normal and glaucomatous phSC cells.</p><p id="P20">We also examined the incidence of emergent pores, <italic>i.e</italic>., pores detected by the second fluorescent tracer but not by the first fluorescent tracer without any treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>).

Specifically, at this low force level, there were 2.6-fold more magnet-induced pores in normal cells (from 2.9 ± 1.4 to 7.6 ± 2.8; ANOVA p = 0.0200) and 4.1-fold more for glaucomatous cells (from 2.1 ± 0.4 to 8.7 ± 2.2; ANOVA p = 0.0392) vs. the control group without magnetic force application. Similarly, at the highest magnetic field strength tested (461 ± 10 pN per particle), there were 4.7-fold more magnet-induced emergent pores in normal cells (from 2.9 ± 1.4 to 13.6 ± 2.7; ANOVA p &lt; 0.0001) and 5.0-fold more in glaucomatous cells (from 2.1 ± 0.4 to 10.8 ± 5.1; ANOVA p = 0.0070) vs. the control group.

This association was present when comparing cell strains with naturally occurring stiffness differences and when modulating cell stiffness with cell softening or stiffening agents, namely the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and S1P, respectively. Importantly, this association is consistent with the diminished pore formation ability of glaucomatous cells and reinforces the idea that SC cell stiffness is a fruitful therapeutic target for IOP lowering in glaucoma patients. For example, targeted latrunculin A micelles have been shown to reduce IOP via softening SC cells in an animal model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> Currently, no approved medications have been shown to directly target SC pore formation, but some, such as the ROCKi Netarsudil,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> may affect SC pores as part of their mode of action. Interestingly, the pore-forming response to magnetic force was higher in glaucomatous cells compared to normal cells. When a minimal force of ~250 pN per particle was applied, corresponding approximately to a local pressure of ~0.1 mmHg over the surface of the particle, there was a significant 4.1-fold increase in pore formation for glaucomatous cells compared to only 2.6-fold increase for normal cells. Although many possible explanations exist for this finding, these results hold out hope that impaired pore formation in glaucomatous cells could be rescued by further stretching and thinning of these cells. This raises important questions: Is there a minimum cell thickness that needs to be achieved to initiate pore formation? Could normal SC cells be more agile or dynamic in accommodating forces compared to glaucomatous cells? Is there an upper limit to the number of pores that a cell can form at the location of each GV/particle?</p><p id="P30">The obvious question is a mechanistic one: why do softer cells more readily form pores? We know that pore formation is triggered by mechanical stimulation (stretch),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and our SEM micrographs show pores forming at the location of particles where the cell membrane is thinned. Because pore formation requires near-apposition and fusion/reorganization of the basal and apical cell membranes, it seems likely that the key step in pore formation is cell thinning, and that this thinning process is facilitated in softer cells. We thus propose an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of transcellular pore formation in phSC cells, where a relatively soft normal phSC cell experiences significant stretching at the location of GVs and consequent transcellular pore forms at the thinnest location of the cell associated with the GV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). In contrast, the stiffer glaucomatous cells do not thin enough to initiate pore formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b</xref>). Our model thus suggests the testable hypothesis that there is a minimum cell thickness that needs to be achieved to initiate pore formation.</p><p id="P31">Here, it is important to note that a putative mechanistic link between a softer cell and more cell stretching/thinning, while appearing simple, actually hides significant complexity. Notably, many cellular biophysical properties are associated with cell stiffness, including the fact that stiffer cells exert more traction force on their substrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> This would suggest that stiffer cells overlying beads would generate <underline>more</underline> traction-induced deformation and cellular thinning over the bead, which according to our understanding, would increase, rather than decrease, pore formation. Clearly the situation would benefit from future studies of additional biomechanical readouts, such as those offered by traction force microscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> Further, our AFM measurements were made using a 10-micron tip over a time scale of seconds, so that the measured properties represent the acute mechanical response of the cell’s sub-cortical cytoskeleton.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> Conversely, our assay allows cells to spread over microparticle for hours, during which time the cell presumably remodels its cytoskeleton and adapts its physical configuration to accommodate the presence of the microparticle. It thus could be argued that it is somewhat surprising that a correlation between AFM-measured cell stiffness and pore-forming ability exists. Nonetheless, there is a strong association, and this intriguing finding strongly motivates future mechanistic studies.</p><p id="P32">In <italic>ex vivo</italic> settings, it has been shown that SC pores are reduced in glaucoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> Here, as well as in previous work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> we demonstrated that this same behavior is preserved in SC cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, further validating their use as a model for glaucoma. An additional observation that supports the use of these cells as a robust <italic>in vitro</italic> model is the directional dependence of pore formation. In our assay, we observed that basal-to-apical force induces pore formation in SC cells, whereas apical-to-basal force does not. This unique mechanobiological behavior of SC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> mirrors their specialized function <italic>in vivo</italic>, providing further motivation for using these cells to model the mechanophysiological properties of the outflow pathway in glaucoma.</p><p id="P33">Naturally, our work is subject to several constraints. The first relates to the time required for cell spreading over microparticles. The phSC cells exhibited a spreading duration ranging from 2 to 7 hours, with variations observed among different cell strains. Prolonged culturing times increase the risk of microparticle endocytosis, remodeling of the gelatin coating, and potential disruption of the assay. Consequently, optimizing the duration that phSC cells remain in contact with microparticles and the gelatin substrate is crucial. Alternatively, microparticle surface modifications may minimize the risk of microparticle endocytosis, although in our hands PEGylation, usually protective against internalization, led to endocytosis in our assay. For this reason, all assays were carried out with the beads as supplied.</p><p id="P34">Lastly, the quantification of pores was constrained by the need for manual counting (<italic>i.e</italic>., identifying fluorescent signals at the particle locations). Pore identification is challenging for multiple reasons, especially when cells were densely seeded. First, since phSC cells do not form tight junctions <italic>in vitro</italic>, fluorescent tracer can adhere to the substrate in a “patchy” pattern at cell-cell margins, generating signals that are hard to distinguish from pores. For this reason, we focused exclusively on transcellular pores, excluding paracellular pores. Additionally, the lateral diffusion of the fluorescent tracer under cells (at pore locations) and/or cell movement can cause pores to appear larger than their actual size. The accuracy of the fluorescent assay could be enhanced by developing methods that enable the formation of tight junctions by phSC cells. Additionally, implementing computer-aided algorithms for pore identification would streamline and improve the overall process.</p><p id="P35">In summary, this study presents a novel and valuable tool for understanding transcellular pore formation. We find that pore forming ability is strongly associated with cell stiffness in phSC cells. We expect that by elucidating the mechanisms underlying pore formation in SC cells, we can accelerate the development of innovative treatments targeting ocular hypertension in glaucoma patients.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Isolation and characterization of phSC cells</title><p id="P36">To account to human variability, a total of five phSC cell strains isolated from five healthy donor eyes and three cell strains isolated from three donors having a history of glaucoma were used in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).
