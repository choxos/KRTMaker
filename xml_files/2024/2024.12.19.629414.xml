Cancer-associated hypomethylation does not occur across the whole genome but leads to the formation of partially methylated domains (PMDs). However, the mechanisms underpinning PMD formation remain unclear. PMDs replicate late in S-phase leading to the proposal that they become hypomethylated due to incomplete re-methylation by the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 during cell division. Here we investigate the role of DNMT1 in the formation of PMDs in cancer by conducting whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), repli-seq and ChIP-seq on DNMT1 knockout HCT116 colorectal cancer cells (DNMT1 KO cells). We find that DNMT1 loss leads to preferential hypomethylation in late replicating, heterochromatic PMDs marked by the constitutive heterochromatic mark H3K9me3 or the facultative heterochromatic mark H3K27me3. However, we also observe that a subset of H3K9me3-marked PMDs gain methylation in DNMT1 KO cells. We find that, in DNMT1 KO cells, these hypermethylated PMDs remain late replicating but gain DNMT3A localisation. This is accompanied by loss of heterochromatic H3K9me3 and specific gain of euchromatic H3K36me2. Our observations suggest that hypermethylated PMDs lose their heterochromatic state, enabling their methylation by DNMT3A and the establishment of a hypermethylated, non-PMD state, despite their late replication timing. More generally, our findings suggest that the <italic>de novo</italic> DNMTs play a key role in establishing domain level DNA methylation patterns in cancer cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification which occurs by the addition of a methyl group on the 5â€™ position of a cytosine ring. In vertebrates, DNA methylation occurs largely in the context of CpG dinucleotides and the majority of CpGs in the genome are methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lister <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Suzuki &amp; Bird, 2008</xref>). DNA methylation is established in development by the de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), DNMT3A and DNMT3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Okano <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). Methylation patterns are then maintained predominantly by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dahlet <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>), although DNMT3A and B also play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jones &amp; Liang, 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P4">DNA methylation patterns are dysregulated in cancer and overall levels of DNA methylation are reduced in tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Feinberg &amp; Vogelstein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gama-Sosa <italic>et al</italic>, 1983</xref>). This hypomethylation is not uniform across the genome but occurs in interspersed, mega-base scale regions termed partially methylated domains (PMDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Berman <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hon <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Lister <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Cancer-associated hypomethylation is proposed to facilitate tumorigenesis through gene expression alterations, the activation of repetitive elements and the promotion of genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Besselink <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Howard <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wild &amp; Flanagan, 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P5">PMDs feature distinct genomic characteristics compared to the rest of the genome. They have a reduced mean CpG density, are gene poor and the genes within PMDs are generally repressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hovestadt <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lister <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). This suggests they are heterochromatic in nature. Indeed, PMD chromatin is resistant to nuclease digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Spracklin &amp; Pradhan, 2020</xref>) and is marked by the repressive histone marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Salhab <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>), associated with constitutive and facultative heterochromatin respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nicetto &amp; Zaret, 2019</xref>). In support of the heterochromatic nature of PMDs, they coincide with lamina associated domains (LADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Berman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) and overlap with the HiC defined B-compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Salhab <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). In addition, during S-phase, heterochromatin and PMDs are observed to replicate later than euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Du <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Salhab <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The molecular mechanisms responsible for the formation of PMDs remain unclear. Pulsechase experiments report that re-methylation of newly synthesised DNA is inefficient and can take several hours following replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Charlton <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Ming <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Stewart-Morgan <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Re-methylation kinetics are also non-uniform across the genome and heterochromatin is reported to be re-methylated more slowly than euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Ming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Stewart-Morgan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). This has led to the hypothesis that late replicating regions may not have sufficient time to become re-methylated following DNA replication in rapidly proliferating cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Petryk <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). The continuous proliferation of cancer cells could therefore lead to the hypomethylation of heterochromatin and the formation of PMDs with successive cell divisions. Indeed, PMD methylation levels negatively correlate with the number of mutations in tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) suggesting that PMDs lose DNA methylation as a function of the number of cell divisions that have occurred. Given that DNMT1 is primarily responsible for maintaining DNA methylation following replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Petryk <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>), this model predicts a central role for DNMT1 in the formation of PMDs. In support of this hypothesis, DNMT1 has been observed to be excluded from heterochromatic, late replicating satellite DNA in senescent cells where extensive hypomethylation of PMDs occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cruickshank <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To understand how maintenance methylation in cancer cells varies with replication timing and chromatin structure, we have interrogated DNA methylation changes in DNMT1 knock-out HCT116 cells (DNMT1 KO). While we observe that late-replicating, heterochromatic regions lose more DNA methylation in DNMT1 KO cells than early replicating, euchromatic regions, we also observe that a subset of H3K9me3-marked late-replicating regions gain DNA methylation. This associates with the recruitment of DNMT3A, loss of H3K9me3 and specific gain of H3K36me2. These results therefore suggest that DNMT3A plays an important role in counteracting hypomethylation in PMDs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ablation of DNMT1 leads to preferential hypomethylation of partially methylated domains</title><p id="P8">To understand the role of DNMT1 in shaping the cancer epigenome at the domain level, we compared the methylomes of HCT116 cells to their DNMT1 knock-out (DNMT1 KO cells) derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Rhee <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>) using Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) (HCT116 mean coverage= 1.6x, DNMT1 KO mean coverage= 2.4x). As complete removal of DNMT1 in somatic cells is lethal, DNMT1 KO cells express low levels of a truncated DNMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Egger <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Spada <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Before examining the nature of the changes in DNA methylation in DNMT1 KO cells, we first assessed the DNA methylation landscape in HCT116 cells. We used the WGBS to quantify mean DNA methylation levels in 10Kb bins across the genome, finding that they were bimodally distributed due to the presence of PMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). To understand the properties of these PMDs, we used methpipe to define 546 HCT116 PMDs on autosomal chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Decato <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). We then defined the rest of the genome as 556 HCT116 highly methylated domains (HMDs, see methods for details).</p><p id="P10">PMDs have previously been reported to replicate late in S-phase and be marked with heterochromatic histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Berman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). To understand whether this was also the case in HCT116 cells, we performed repli-seq to measure replication timing alongside ChIP-seq for the histone modifications H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3. We then compared replication timing between HCT116 PMDs and HMDs confirming that the replication timing of PMDs was significantly later than that of HMDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>, p &lt; 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Both the constitutive heterochromatin-associated H3K9me3 and the facultative heterochromatin-associated H3K27me3 marks had significantly higher levels in HCT116 PMDs compared to HMDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B-C</xref>, both p &lt; 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum tests). H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 were observed in peaks around promoters and gene bodies in HMDs respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>). However, we also noted a low, broad enrichment of both marks in PMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Further investigation revealed that HCT116 PMDs were split into 253 predominantly marked by H3K9me3 and 293 predominantly marked by H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). H3K9me3-marked PMDs were bordered by H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1E</xref>), a pattern previously reported in IMR90 and HCC1954 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The median length of H3K9me3-enriched PMDs was 1.86Mb compared to 0.59Mb for H3K27me3-enriched PMDs. In addition, the mean methylation level of H3K9me3-enriched PMDs was significantly lower than that of H3K27me3 enriched PMDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F</xref>, p = 6.85x10<sup>-13</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test) and the mean replication timing of H3K9me3-enriched PMDs was significantly later than H3K27me3-enriched PMDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1G</xref>, p &lt; 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test).</p><p id="P12">We then asked how the methylome changed in DNMT1 KO cells. Global mean methylation levels measured by WGBS in DNMT1 KO cells were 59.2% as compared to 75.7% in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1H</xref>), a similar reduction to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Rhee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>).

We find that losses of methylation in DNMT1 KO cells are biased towards PMDs. However, we also observe that several H3K9me3-marked regions have increased levels of methylation in these cells and lose PMD identity. In association with this, these hypermethylated PMDs lose H3K9me3, gain H3K36me2 and recruit the <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferase DNMT3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). These observations suggest a key role for <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferase activity in determining which parts of the genome become PMDs in cancer. We propose that the activity of DNMT1 is not sufficient to maintain DNA methylation levels throughout the genome and that reiterative activity of DNMT3A and B prevents euchromatic regions becoming hypomethylated. In contrast, a lack of this <italic>de novo</italic> activity leads to the formation of PMDs in heterochromatic regions in tumours.</p><p id="P38">Previous work has connected the hypomethylation of PMDs to their late replication in S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). Analysis of newly replicated DNA by bisulfite sequencing suggests that remethylation can take several hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Charlton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) and may occur in two phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Ming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). This is supported by mass-spectrometry analysis suggesting that some remethylation occurs post-mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Stewart-Morgan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). These studies have led to the hypothesis that there is insufficient time to maintain DNA methylation patterns in late replicating regions in rapidly dividing cancer cells resulting in their hypomethylation. Here we do observe that DNMT1 knockout in a colorectal cancer cell line biases DNA methylation losses to PMDs which are late replicating. This parallels a recent study reporting that losses of DNA methylation upon shRNA depletion of DNMT1 in HCT116 cells are biased to low-CpG density regions that are enriched in PMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Tiedemann <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). However, we observe weak correlations between DNA methylation loss and replication timing in DNMT1 KO cells. Furthermore, we observe that some regions of the genome gain DNA methylation in these cells while remaining late replicating. Overall, our results suggest that the formation of PMDs is not tightly linked to the replication timing program.</p><p id="P39">We instead observe stronger correlations between methylation levels and localisation of the <italic>de novo</italic> DNMTs. Normally DNMT3A localises to H3K36me2, a mark broadly distributed in euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Weinberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>) whereas DNMT3B is localised to the transcription-associated mark H3K36me3 in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Baubec <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>) and colorectal cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Masalmeh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). It is possible that the activity of these <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferases compensates for any failure to maintain methylation at euchromatin by DNMT1. Normally such activity is low at heterochromatin and this inability to correct errors made by DNMT1 could underpin the formation of PMDs. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that DNMT3A localises to hypermethylated PMDs in DNMT1 KO cells and a report that <italic>Kras</italic> mutant mouse lung cancers lacking DNMT3A have a more uniformly hypomethylated genome than those possessing DNMT3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Raddatz <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Previously, we also observed that PWWP domain mutations can cause DNMT3B to re-localise to H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin also leading to the hypermethylation of PMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Taglini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>).

Our observations of recruitment of DNMT3A to hypermethylated PMDs when H3K9me3 is reduced and H3K36me2 is elevated are consistent with these reports and also the observations that differences in the locations of PMDs between different head and neck tumours correlate with differences in H3K36me2 patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Zheng <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). They also suggest that DNMT3A re-localisation occurs following disruption of heterochromatin caused by DNMT1 loss. Indeed losses of H3K9me2/3 are previously reported in DNMT1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Espada <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) and acute depletion or inhibition of DNMT1 reduces H3K9me3 levels and alters heterochromatin compartmentalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Scelfo <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Spracklin <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>).

It is interesting to note that in our study, DNMT3A ChIP-seq signal in hypermethylated PMDs is weaker than that observed for euchromatic domains. This suggests, that hypermethylated PMDs could retain some heterochromatic features that inhibit DNMT3A recruitment to some degree. We and others have reported that DNMT3A is also recruited to the polycomb-associated H2AK119ub mark through its N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gretarsson <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gu <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wapenaar <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Weinberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>).

However, the significance of these euchromatin-associated histone marks in heterochromatic domains remains unclear at present and will require further investigation.</p><p id="P42">DNA sequence has also been proposed to play a central role in the formation of PMDs. Within PMDs single CpG methylation levels correlate with CpG density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gaidatzis <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>) and hypomethylation is particularly apparent at CpGs that are flanked by A or T nucleotides and distant from other CpGs, termed solo-WCGW CpGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Zhou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).

A bias to loss of methylation to low CpG density regions is also reported for DNMT1 depletion by shRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Tiedemann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>).

Bed counts for 10 kb genomic windows and domains were generated from the bam files using bedtools coverage (seetings: <italic>-counts</italic>, v2.27.1). For paired-end data, the BAM file was first converted to a BED file of fragment locations using BEDtools bamtobed function. Coverage counts were scaled to counts per 10 million based on total number of mapped reads per sample and divided by the input read count to obtain a normalised read count. An offset of 0.5 was added to all windows prior to scaling and input normalisation to prevent intervals with zero reads in the input sample generating a normalised count of infinity. Regions where coverage was 0 in all samples were removed from the analysis.
