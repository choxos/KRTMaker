While <italic>C. necator</italic> is amenable to genome editing, existing tools are often inefficient or rely on lengthy protocols, hindering its rapid transition to industrial applications. In this study, we simplified and accelerated the genome editing pipeline for <italic>C. necator</italic> by harnessing the Self-splicing Intron-Based Riboswitch (SIBR) system. We used SIBR to tightly control and delay Cas9-based counterselection, achieving &gt;80% editing efficiency at two genomic loci within 48 hours after electroporation. To further increase the versatility of the genome editing toolbox, we upgraded SIBR to SIBR2.0 and used it to regulate the expression of Cas12a. SIBR2.0-Cas12a could mediate gene deletion in <italic>C. necator</italic> with ~70% editing efficiency. Overall, we streamlined the genome editing pipeline for <italic>C. necator</italic>, facilitating its potential role in the transition to a bio-based economy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> H16</kwd><kwd>genome editing</kwd><kwd>CRISPR-Cas</kwd><kwd>SIBR</kwd><kwd>SIBR2.0</kwd><kwd>non-model microbes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">To promote the transition from a fossil-based to a bio-based economy, microorganisms which can grow on CO<sub>2</sub> or CO<sub>2</sub> derivatives are increasingly studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. In particular, the β-proteobacterium <italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> H16 (formerly known as <italic>Ralstonia eutropha</italic> H16) has emerged as a promising microorganism due to its ability to convert CO<sub>2</sub> into value-added compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. <italic>C. necator</italic> can naturally grow on CO<sub>2</sub> and hydrogen via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, and can also utilise formate derived from electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction as sole carbon source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. These features make <italic>C. necator</italic> an ideal microorganism for biotechnological processes that aim towards CO<sub>2</sub> valorisation.</p><p id="P3">Despite these promising properties, the potential of <italic>C. necator</italic> as a biotechnological platform strain remains untapped, which is partly attributed to the lack of efficient, simple and rapid genome editing tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. To date, one of the most common practices for gene deletion or insertion relies on the use of a suicide-vector system that includes two crossover events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The first crossover event selects for the integration of the suicide vector in the genome of <italic>C. necator</italic> through an antibiotic marker, whereas the second crossover event is mediated by a counter-selection cassette encoding <italic>sacB</italic> or <italic>cre/loxP</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Alternative approaches use the Tn<italic>5</italic> transposon, which randomly integrates into the bacterial chromosome, mediating gene knock-outs or knock-ins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Another approach involves the RalsTron system, developed as an alternative to random intron integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. More recently, an inducible CRISPR-Cas9 system was used for genome editing of <italic>C. necator</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Although the authors report high editing efficiencies, the editing protocol is prolonged (over a week). A faster CRISPR-based genome editing tool was also developed but resulted in low editing efficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Therefore, an efficient, standardised, and rapid genome editing tool is still required for the full exploitation of <italic>C. necator</italic>.</p><p id="P4">Recently, the Self-splicing Intron-Based Riboswitch (SIBR) system was developed and applied to tightly control the expression of Cas12a at the translational level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. This system allows the endogenous homologous recombination (HR) machinery to perform allelic exchanges before inducing CRISPR-Cas-mediated counter-selection, resulting in efficient gene deletion in phylogenetically diverse bacterial species such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic>, <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> IR1 and <italic>Clostridium autoethanogenum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. This genetic control framework is designed to be gene- and organism-independent and does not require the use of inducible promoters or the expression of any additional heterologous transcription factors or enzymes, making it ideal for non-model bacterial species. Moreover, a key feature of SIBR-Cas is that it enables distinct temporal separation of HR and CRISPR-Cas counter-selection, which is crucial for successful editing, particularly in bacterial species with inefficient endogenous HR system or when exogenous recombinases (e.g. λ Red) are not characterised and used in that species.</p><p id="P5">In this work, we used the previously established SIBR system to tightly and inducibly control the expression of Cas9 in <italic>C. necator</italic>, achieving ~80% editing efficiency at two genomic loci (<italic>glcEF</italic> and <italic>acoC</italic>), within just 48 hours after electroporation. Then, to expand the genome editing toolbox for <italic>C. necator</italic>, we tested the original SIBR design to control the expression of Cas12a. This attempt was initially unsuccessful due to an alternative translation initiation site within the original SIBR, which was organism- and gene-dependent. To address this limitation, we developed an updated version of SIBR, named SIBR2.0. Unlike SIBR, SIBR2.0 can be introduced along the CDS of the GOI, splitting a gene in two distinct exon sequences. This design ensures that, even in the presence of an alternative translation initiation site, only non-functional proteins will be expressed. We first validated SIBR2.0 by controlling the expression of the T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We then used SIBR2.0 to tightly and inducibly control the expression of Cas12a in <italic>C. necator</italic>. Lastly, using SIBR2.0 we successfully enabled CRISPR-Cas12a-mediated genome editing in <italic>C. necator</italic> with ~70% editing efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>SIBR can tightly and inducibly control the expression of Cas9 in <italic>C. necator</italic></title><p id="P6">SIBR was previously used to tightly control and inducibly express Cas12a (SIBR-Cas12a) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic>, <italic>Flavobacterium</italic> IR1 and <italic>Clostridium autoethanogenum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Since Cas12a has not been successfully used in <italic>C. necator</italic> before, we initially opted to utilise Cas9 as it has been shown to be functional in this bacterium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. To develop SIBR-Cas9 in <italic>C. necator</italic>, we followed a series of four checkpoint controls.</p><p id="P7">First, we verified the functionality of P<sub><italic>lacUV5</italic></sub> by expressing mRFP in <italic>C. necator</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) as this promoter was used to express SIBR-Cas12a and the crRNA in the original SIBR-Cas setup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p id="P8">Second, we tested the effect of theophylline on the growth of <italic>C. necator</italic>. Theophylline is the inducer for the splicing of SIBR and, to the best of our knowledge, its toxicity has never been tested in this organism. We performed a toxicity assay to determine the optimal theophylline concentration that will allow for the splicing of SIBR whilst ensuring the viability of the bacterium. The assay demonstrated that theophylline concentrations above 5 mM compromise growth, with a 30% decrease in growth rate at 10 mM and up to a 70% decrease when the concentration is increased to 20 mM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Based on these results, we used 5 mM theophylline as the working concentration of the inducer for all subsequent experiments.</p><p id="P9">Third, we assessed the functionality of Cas9 through the traditional targeting and cell killing assay, by constitutively expressing Cas9 and the sgRNA under P<sub><italic>lacUV5</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To mediate targeting, we designed two sgRNAs targeting the <italic>glcF</italic> locus (T1 and T2). We chose <italic>glcF</italic> as target gene as it has been previously inactivated in <italic>C. necator</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. For control, we designed a non-targeting (NT) sgRNA that did not target any genomic sequence in <italic>C. necator</italic>. Subsequently, we electroporated the Cas9-sgRNA constructs into <italic>C. necator</italic> and determined the colony counts, using a newly developed protocol for electrocompetent cell preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>; see Materials and Methods). For both the T sgRNAs, we observed a ~10<sup>4</sup>-fold reduction in the colony counts compared to the NT sgRNA control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), confirming the functionality of our CRISPR-Cas9 system in <italic>C. necator</italic>. Since T1 sgRNA showed the most drastic reduction in colony counts, we used it for subsequent experiments.</p><p id="P10">Fourth, we assessed the inducibility of the SIBR system in <italic>C. necator</italic>. To do this, we introduced SIBR variants with increased splicing efficiency (Int2&lt;Int3&lt;Int4; lowest to highest splicing efficiency) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] directly after the start codon of the <italic>cas9</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and combined them with the constitutively expressed <italic>glcF</italic>-T1 sgRNA. Then, we tested for inducible targeting and cell killing by transforming and subjecting <italic>C. necator</italic> cells on media containing or omitting the theophylline inducer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Transformants subjected to non-inducing conditions yielded ~10<sup>5</sup> colony counts, irrespective of the SIBR variant used. Using SIBR-Int2-Cas9 did not result in colony counts reduction, even in the presence of theophylline. In contrast, cells transformed with SIBR-Int3-Cas9 or SIBR-Int4-Cas9 and plated on media containing theophylline, had a ~10<sup>5</sup>-fold reduction in total colony counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To further assess the robustness of SIBR in <italic>C. necator</italic>, we selected SIBR-Int4-Cas9 and targeted another gene, <italic>acoC</italic>, which encodes the E2 subunit of a branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase. The products of <italic>acoC</italic> and its enclosing <italic>acoXABC</italic> operon are involved in the catabolism of acetoin in <italic>C. necator</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Genes within this locus are not essential and have been previously deleted as part of metabolic engineering efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], making them a suitable target for our assays. By using either of three sgRNAs targeting the <italic>acoC</italic> locus (T1, T2 and T3), we showed that a reduction in total colony counts was possible only when the transformed cells were subjected to inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). As <italic>acoC</italic>-T2 sgRNA exhibited the most drastic counterselection activity from all three tested sgRNAs, it was selected for subsequent targeting of this genomic locus.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>SIBR-Cas9 mediates efficient genome editing in <italic>C. necator</italic></title><p id="P12">After confirming stringent and inducible expression of Cas9 using SIBR-Int4 in <italic>C. necator</italic>, we proceeded by testing the effect of SIBR-Int4-Cas9 for editing its genome. To obtain the knock-out of the <italic>glcEF</italic> genes (resulting in the deletion of two glycolate dehydrogenase subunits), we cloned Homology Arms (HArms) corresponding to the upstream and downstream of the target locus. Then, we introduced them into plasmids bearing either the constitutively expressed Cas9 or the SIBR-Int4-Cas9, including either of the <italic>glcF</italic>-T1 sgRNA or the NT sgRNA control. Resulting colonies with or without SIBR induction were counted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>) and screened for the desired edit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref> <bold>and</bold> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The NT sgRNA controls resulted in low (&lt;5%) editing efficiency for all combinations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), indicating the possibility of (infrequent) HR between the genome of <italic>C. necator</italic> and the HArms present on the plasmids. When constitutively expressing Cas9 in combination with the <italic>glcF</italic>-T1 sgRNA, ~10% editing efficiency was observed when the cells were grown in media without theophylline. Including theophylline in the medium resulted in 0% editing efficiency, accompanied also with ~100-fold reduction in total colony counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref> <bold>and</bold> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Low editing efficiency (~10%) was also observed when transforming SIBR-Int4-Cas9 combined with <italic>glcF</italic>-T1 sgRNA and plating the transformed cells on non-inducing conditions. In contrast, including theophylline in the medium resulted in ~80% editing efficiency, albeit with low total colony counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref> <bold>and</bold> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). To verify the deletion of <italic>glcEF</italic>, a resulting edited colony was sequenced through Sanger sequencing, confirming the complete deletion of <italic>glcEF</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To further test the robustness of SIBR-Int4-Cas9 to mediate efficient gene deletion in <italic>C. necator</italic>, we continued by editing the <italic>acoC</italic> locus following the same approach as described for <italic>glcEF</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Resulting colonies were counted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>) and screened for the desired edit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). Like our <italic>glcEF</italic> knock-out assays, NT sgRNA controls showed &lt;5% editing efficiency regardless of the construct or medium used. Using the constitutively expressed Cas9 along with the <italic>acoC</italic>-T2 sgRNA, eliminated all the colonies in the presence or absence of theophylline. In contrast, using SIBR-Int4-Cas9 along with the <italic>acoC</italic>-T2 sgRNA resulted in ~95% editing efficiency, when the cells were grown on medium containing theophylline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). As observed when editing the <italic>glcEF</italic> locus, high editing efficiency was coupled to a reduced number of total colony counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>), suggesting effective counter-selection. Complete deletion of <italic>acoC</italic> from an edited colony was also confirmed through Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8</xref>). Collectively, by controlling the translation of Cas9 in <italic>C. necator</italic> using SIBR-Int4, we demonstrated high (&gt;80%) editing efficiencies at two different genomic loci.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>CRISPR-Cas12a is functional in <italic>C. necator</italic></title><p id="P15">To further expand the genome editing toolkit available for <italic>C. necator</italic> and to broaden the available target sites in the genome of <italic>C. necator</italic>, we explored whether we can use another Cas protein, Cas12a. This protein has distinct features compared to Cas9, including a different PAM recognition site (5’-(T)TTV-3’) located at the 5’ end of the protospacer sequence, and the ability to process its own crRNA array (due to its RNase activity), which makes it ideal for multiplex genome editing approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Like our previous tests with Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, c</xref>), we assessed the expression of active CRISPR-Cas12a complexes by constitutively expressing Cas12a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) along with either of two <italic>acoC</italic> targeting (T1 and T2) crRNAs or the NT crRNA, followed by plating on selective media and counting the total colony counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P16">For both the <italic>acoC</italic>-T crRNAs, we observed a complete elimination of colonies compared to the NT crRNA control, indicating the functionality of CRISPR-Cas12a for genome targeting in <italic>C. necator</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). As both T crRNAs performed equally well, we selected the <italic>acoC</italic>-T1 crRNA for all subsequent experiments targeting the <italic>acoC</italic> locus.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>An alternative translation initiation site within SIBR leads to Cas12a expression</title><p id="P17">Next, we conducted inducible targeting assays by introducing different variants of the SIBR-Cas12a constructs (Int2, Int3 and Int4) paired with either a NT crRNA or the <italic>acoC</italic>-T1 crRNA, into <italic>C. necator</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, d</xref>). Following transformation, cells were selected on solid medium with or without theophylline and the total colony counts were calculated. As expected, NT crRNA controls showed ~10<sup>5</sup> total colony counts in both inducing and non-inducing conditions when either of the three SIBR-Cas12a variants were used. Surprisingly, under non-inducing conditions, ~100-fold reduction in total colony counts was observed when the <italic>acoC</italic>-T1 crRNA was combined with either of the three SIBR-Cas12a variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). This result was unexpected as our previous data on Cas9 showed that SIBR-Int3 and SIBR-Int4 variants did not lead to reduction of total colony counts upon non-inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Moreover, as SIBR-Int2-Cas9 did not result in reduced total colony counts even under induction conditions, we expected that SIBR-Int2-Cas12a would result in a similar outcome. However, this was not the case as SIBR-Int2-Cas12a resulted in ~100-fold reduction in total colony counts compared to its NT crRNA counterpart, regardless of the presence or absence of the theophylline inducer.</p><p id="P18">Based on our observations, we hypothesised that there might be two potential causes for the functional expression of Cas12a in all the SIBR-Cas12a variants even in the absence of the theophylline inducer: (i) SIBR is self-splicing out of pre-mRNA transcripts in the absence of theophylline (i.e. leaky self-splicing), or (ii) Cas12a is translated from pre-mRNA transcripts from a secondary ribosome binding site (RBS) within the intron sequence near the 5’ end of the <italic>cas12a</italic> coding sequence (CDS).</p><p id="P19">To eliminate the possibility of leakiness due to the self-splicing of SIBR in the absence of theophylline, we introduced a STOP codon within the 5’ exon sequence of SIBR-Cas12a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9a</xref>). This design ensures that even if SIBR splices out in the absence of theophylline, a premature STOP codon will preclude the translation of functional Cas12a. As performed previously, plasmids encoding the modified Cas12a expression cassette (paired with either the NT crRNA or the <italic>acoC</italic>-T1 crRNA), were introduced into <italic>C. necator</italic>, and cells were plated on solid selective medium. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9b</xref>, the presence of a premature stop codon at the 5’ exon did not eliminate the translation of Cas12a, as a &gt;100 fold reduction in total colony counts was still observed in the absence of the inducer and when the <italic>acoC</italic>-T1 crRNA was used. This result indicated that factors other than leaky self-splicing result in the expression of Cas12a from the encoded pre-mRNA.</p><p id="P20">Following our second hypothesis, we conducted a bioinformatic analysis of the SIBR-Int4-Cas12a pre-mRNA sequence to identify any alternative RBS from which a functional Cas12a could be fully translated. Using the RBS Calculator biophysical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], we compared the predicted translation initiation rates (TIR) in <italic>C. necator</italic> over the sequence of both the SIBR-Int4-Cas9 and SIBR-Int4-Cas12a sequences. Although both SIBR-Int4-Cas9 and SIBR-Int4-Cas12a sequences share the same SIBR sequence, they differ in the downstream gene sequence (i.e. the <italic>cas9</italic> and <italic>cas12a</italic> sequence) which can affect the translation initiation rate based on the formation of secondary mRNA structures that inhibit the RBS and hinder the translation of the protein.</p><p id="P21">Interestingly, we identified a translation start site near the 3’ end of the intron sequence where the TIR was predicted to spike for SIBR-Int4-Cas12a, but not for SIBR-Int4-Cas9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>). The identified translation start site corresponds to a methionine codon, which is downstream of the final in-frame stop codon of the SIBR sequence and adjacent to the SIBR splicing site. Taken together, this prediction indicates that an alternative RBS site is present in the intron sequence and is recognized by the <italic>C. necator</italic> translation machinery. In the case of SIBR-Cas12a, this results in the full translation of a functional Cas12a that causes cell death when combined with a targeting guide, regardless of the presence or absence of the theophylline inducer. However, as SIBR-Int4-Cas9 is not predicted to have a spike in TIR at the same site as SIBR-Cas12a, Cas9 only gets translated in the presence of theophylline, leading to a tight and inducible protein translation system.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>SIBR2.0 – tight and inducible protein expression by transferring the SIBR along the coding sequence of the target gene</title><p id="P22">To overcome the apparent limitation encountered when using the original SIBR design to control Cas12a expression in <italic>C. necator</italic> and to broaden the applicability of SIBR for regulating multiple genes across various organisms, we developed an improved version of the SIBR system that we call SIBR2.0. This updated version is not limited to the introduction of SIBR directly after the ATG start codon of the gene of interest (GOI), but it can be introduced along the CDS of the GOI. With SIBR2.0, we achieve two main goals: (i) avoiding the translation of a full-length protein from an alternative RBS site within the SIBR sequence and, (ii) if translation still occurs from the alternative RBS site within the SIBR, this will result in a truncated, non-functional protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>).</p><p id="P23">To develop SIBR2.0, SIBR should be installed in the CDS of the GOI at a location that ensures proper intron splicing while maintaining the correct codon sequence after splicing. As the 5’ and 3’ exonic regions adjacent to the intron are known to have a role in intron splicing, any alteration in those regions can result in dysfunctional splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. During our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], we created a library of T4 <italic>td</italic> introns containing mutations at its 5’ and/or the 3’ flanking exons showing that, although the splicing of the intron is affected by the mutations present at the flanking 5’ or 3’ exons, there is still flexibility in sustaining mutations without detrimental effects to the splicing of the intron. Using this information, we developed a Python script called “SIBR Site Finder” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This script accepts a CDS sequence in FASTA format and returns a CSV file containing the following: (i) a list of the potential SIBR insertion sites along the GOI, (ii) the necessary silent mutations at the SIBR 5’ and 3’ exon sequences that are required for efficient splicing but also for maintaining the correct amino acid sequence after splicing of the SIBR, (iii) the full CDS of the GOI including the alternative SIBR placement, (iv) the amino acid sequence resulting after splicing of the intron, and (v) a score based on the predicted splicing efficiency of the intron (the higher the better). A schematic overview of these algorithmic steps is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3a</xref>.</p><p id="P24">To validate our script and design in a quantitative way, we reasoned that inserting the SIBR at different locations across the CDS of the green fluorescence protein (GFPuv) gene would give us quantitative measurements in a semi high-throughput way. To this end, we chose <italic>E. coli</italic> as a host (the original host where the T4 <italic>td</italic> intron library was generated) and used a plasmid where the <italic>gfpuv</italic> gene is expressed under the P<sub>tacl</sub> promoter and contains a SIBR in its CDS, at position 29 (SIBR2.0-29-GFPuv), as recommended by the SIBR Site Finder script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary file 4</xref> <bold>and</bold> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">5</xref>). For controls, we used an empty vector where the <italic>gfpuv</italic> gene was omitted and a plasmid where the <italic>gfpuv</italic> was intact (i.e. no interruption of the gene with the SIBR). To our surprise, we did not observe any measurable fluorescence when the <italic>gfpuv</italic> gene was interrupted with the SIBR and induced with theophylline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12</xref>). To determine whether splicing of the T4 <italic>td</italic> intron is happening at the introduced site, we replaced SIBR with a wild type T4 <italic>td</italic> intron (i.e. without the theophylline aptamer), introduced it at the exact same site, and repeated our experiment. Similarly, no fluorescence was detected even though the T4 <italic>td</italic> intron should be self-splicing out of the transcript, resulting in a processed mRNA and a fully functional GFPuv protein. Further changing the transcribed gene sequence (<italic>mrfp</italic>), the SIBR insertion position, the promoter (P<sub><italic>lacUV5</italic></sub>), the induction strength or even the organism, did not result in any measurable fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13</xref>).</p><p id="P25">The absence of fluorescence for all the tested conditions led us to hypothesise that the number of GFPuv (or mRFP) molecules produced after splicing may be insufficient to detect a fluorescent signal using a conventional plate reader. GFP detection is different from our previous successful attempts to control the expression of <italic>lacZ</italic> or <italic>cas</italic> genes with SIBR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], as in those cases the resulting proteins are enzymes that can be measured for their enzymatic activity (LacZ for its multi-turnover β-galactosidase activity and Cas for its genome targeting and cleavage activity resulting to cell death) and not solely by their relative abundance.</p><p id="P26">We therefore hypothesised that a signal amplification mechanism would be necessary to translate inducible SIBR splicing into detectable GFP fluorescence. To this end, we designed a T7 RNA polymerase-GFPuv cascade system where the SIBR controls the expression of T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP), a multi-turnover enzyme, which itself can transcribe many molecules of GFPuv under the T7 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b, c</xref>). We then used the SIBR Site Finder script and the T7 RNAP CDS as input and chose three insertion sites (between G201 and L202, G449 and L450, and between G671 and L672) to interrupt the T7 <italic>rnap</italic> gene with the SIBR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary File 4</xref> <bold>and</bold> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">5</xref>). The 5’ and 3’ flanking regions of the SIBR were nearly identical for all three sites and the sites were spread along the T7 RNA polymerase gene to determine the effect of the location of the SIBR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The three variations of the SIBR2.0-T7RNAP were then integrated into the genome of <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B (to avoid plasmid copy number variation) and its expression was controlled by the P<sub><italic>rhaBAD</italic></sub> promoter to attain tight, dual-level control of expression and maximise the signal-to-noise ratio of the cascade system. The three different <italic>E. coli</italic> strains were then tested for their response to both L-rhamnose and theophylline, by measuring end-point fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c, d</xref>).</p><p id="P27">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3d</xref>, all three SIBR insertion sites showed a similar response to L-rhamnose and theophylline addition, suggesting that, at least in this experimental setting and choice of gene, the insertion position of SIBR has little to no effect. In the absence of L-rhamnose, the measured fluorescence was negligible even with the highest tested theophylline concentration (1 mM) for all three variants. Similarly, when the highest concentration of L-rhamnose was used (2 g/L) but the theophylline inducer was omitted, the measured fluorescence was minimal across all three variants, demonstrating the strict nature of the SIBR. Notably, when higher L-rhamnose concentration was used, the fluorescence increased in a linear relation to the corresponding theophylline concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S4</xref>). This linearity demonstrates a tight and tunable expression system, which can be used for various biotechnological applications where tuning of gene expression is desired.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>SIBR2.0-Cas12a mediates efficient genome editing in <italic>C. necator</italic></title><p id="P28">Having characterised the SIBR2.0 system, we sought to apply it to control Cas12a expression, and thereby create a functional system for Cas12a genome editing in <italic>C. necator</italic>.

These positions were selected based on their intron splicing score and their position along the CDS of <italic>cas12a</italic>, ensuring that any alternative translation start site will result in a truncated, non-functional protein. The resulting constructs paired with either the <italic>acoC</italic>-T1 crRNA or the NT crRNA were electroporated into <italic>C. necator</italic> cells and were subjected to inducing or non-inducing conditions to quantify inducible targeting. SIBR-Int4-Cas12a, which we previously observed to be defective in inducible targeting assays, was used as a control.

These involved growing the cells in non-selective LB medium at 30 °C with or without rifampicin, or in LB at 37 °C without any antibiotics. As a control, cells were forced to retain the editing plasmid by culturing in selective LB medium (100 μg/mL kanamycin).

To this end, we developed several advances that simplify the genome editing pipeline and enhance the genome editing efficiency in <italic>C. necator</italic>.</p><p id="P33">First, we implemented a novel electroporation protocol that enabled rapid transformation of the large (~7-9 kb) SIBR plasmids with high efficiency. Though it is difficult to compare the performance of the electroporation protocol across existing publications that use plasmids of different sizes and use different properties to measure transformation efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], by using the <italic>C. necator</italic> Δ<italic>H16_A0006</italic> strain we obtained transformation efficiencies of up to ~10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>7</sup> total colony counts with large, unmodified plasmids isolated from <italic>E. coli</italic>. This streamlined and efficient protocol reduced the hands-on time and streamlined both targeting and editing assays to a total of ~48 hours.</p><p id="P34">Second, we adapted the original SIBR design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], and used it to tightly and inducibly control the expression of the Cas9 protein in <italic>C. necator</italic>, resulting in &gt;80% editing efficiency when targeting the <italic>glcEF</italic> or <italic>acoC</italic> genes. The high editing efficiency achieved by SIBR-Int4-Cas9 matches or outcompetes other existing genome editing approaches in <italic>C. necator</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], although at a faster turnaround time of ~48 hours after electroporation with the editing plasmid.</p><p id="P35">Third, we developed SIBR2.0 that widens the applicability of the SIBR system. This development arises through our observation that, in our plasmid context, the original SIBR-Cas design could not repress the expression of Cas12a in <italic>C. necator</italic>. Through a series of experiments, we discovered that an alternative translation initiation site exists within SIBR, is recognised by the <italic>C. necator</italic> translation machinery, and leads to the complete and functional translation of Cas12a. The alternative translation initiation site appears to be gene- and/or organism-specific as the original SIBR design was sufficient to control Cas9 but not Cas12a expression in <italic>C. necator</italic>, and was sufficient to control Cas12a expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. To overcome this limitation and to create a more versatile SIBR system, we developed SIBR2.0, which includes the introduction of SIBR at a more central position in the CDS of the GOI. This advancement ensures that even in the presence of an alternative initiation site, the translated protein will be truncated and therefore non-functional. We then used SIBR2.0 to tightly and inducibly control Cas12a expression in <italic>C. necator</italic>, resulting in ~70% editing efficiency when targeting the <italic>acoC</italic> gene. To our knowledge, this is the first successful use of CRISPR-Cas12a to edit the genome of <italic>C. necator</italic>, further expanding the genome editing toolbox in this species.</p><p id="P36">Fourth, we showed that by following our novel setup, it is possible to generate a knock-out <italic>C. necator</italic> strain within ~48 hours after electroporation and have a plasmid-free strain ready for downstream applications or iterative editing within ~4 days. This timeline represents at least a 50% reduction compared to the time required for generating a mutant as reported by previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Our reduced protocol is even more streamlined relative to traditional suicide-vector systems (i.e. pLO3), where generating a clean mutation takes usually 10-12 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P37">Lastly, during the development of SIBR2.0, we also developed the SIBR Site Finder script that allows the user to find appropriate sites along the CDS of the GOI to introduce SIBR2.0. We demonstrated the functionality of the script by introducing SIBR2.0 in multiple sites along the CDS of the GOI as demonstrated in the T7 RNAP-GFPuv (sites 201, 449 or 671) and Cas12a (sites 414 or 818) assays, without an observable reduction in GFPuv fluorescence or targeting efficiency, respectively, at any of the introduction sites. We also showed that SIBR2.0 is a tight gene expression system as demonstrated by our T7 RNAP-GFPuv assay which included a dual control system (rhamnose inducible promoter and SIBR2.0). Tight control using SIBR2.0 was also demonstrated during our Cas12a targeting assays as cell death was only observed when using a targeting guide RNA and when theophylline was included in the medium.</p><p id="P38">Overall, in this study we expanded the genome editing toolbox and streamlined genome editing in <italic>C. necator</italic> by developing both SIBR-Int4-Cas9 and SIBR2.0-818-Cas12a systems.

Furthermore, due to its tight and versatile nature, we expect that SIBR2.0 will open a new frontier for the tight and inducible expression of toxic proteins, the use of SIBR2.0 in genetic logic gates and genetic circuits, and the use of SIBR2.0-Cas for genome editing in microbes characterised by low endogenous homologous recombination efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p id="P39">Simple, efficient and rapid genome editing tools are desirable features to accelerate the transition from lab-scale to industrial-scale biotechnological applications.

Implemented in Python, the algorithm takes the CDS (in FASTA format) of the GOI as input. First, the DNA sequence is translated. Then, the resulting protein sequence is divided into all possible 5 amino acid long peptides. For each peptide, all possible CDSs are computed. Each peptide CDS is then assigned a “binding type”, which codifies the CDS’s base pair interactions at the T4 <italic>td</italic> intron P1 stem-loop. The interactions are encoded as follows: X denotes a position where any nucleotide is accepted; P and W indicate Watson-Crick base pairing and wobble base pairing, respectively; M is used to indicate a mismatch. Each binding type is then assigned a score, which measures the predicted splicing efficiency of the intron at each possible insertion site. The top-scoring insertion sites can then be experimentally validated by the user. (<bold>b</bold>) Insertion of SIBR2.0 along the T7 RNAP CDS.

The <italic>acoC</italic>-T1 or the NT crRNAs, along with the constitutively expressed Cas12a or the SIBR2.0-818-Cas12a were assembled into plasmids which contain homology arms (HArms) to direct recombination at the <italic>acoC</italic> target locus. Following electroporation, transformed cells were plated on selective solid medium with or without theophylline, the total colony counts (expressed in CFU/μg DNA) was calculated, and colony PCR was performed to define the editing efficiency for the <italic>acoC</italic> deletion. (<bold>d</bold>) Barplots represent the mean of three replicates. For each replicate, up to 16 colonies (as many as available) were screened through colony PCR.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201155-f004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Workflow for SIBR-based genome editing of <italic>C. necator</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Monitoring the loss of SIBR plasmids in populations of edited cells. Representative serial dilutions of cultures on selective agar plates (LB with 100 μg/mL kanamycin) at the time of each passage. For each dilution time series, the plasmid curing condition is indicated. Colony counts from each deletion series were used to quantify the kanamycin-resistant fraction of each bacterial population, as shown in (<bold>b</bold>).

Using the features of the standardised SIBR plasmid backbones, sgRNA or crRNA spacers can be inserted onto the plasmids via Golden Gate assembly. The assembly products can then be used directly for insertion of the HArms. The plasmid backbone is linearised using one of the restriction sites present within the MCS. HArms, which have been previously PCR-amplified from genomic DNA, are then assembled with the linearised backbone via Gibson assembly. (<bold>d</bold>) Workflow for (iterative) genome editing. SIBR-Int4-Cas9 or SIBR2.0-818-Cas12a editing plasmids are electroporated into <italic>C. necator</italic>. Transformants are plated onto selective solid medium, and the resulting colonies are screened for editing at the target locus. Confirmed deletion mutants can then be cured of the editing plasmids via overnight incubation in LB medium at 37 °C, enabling iterative editing or introduction of alternative plasmids.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201155-f005"/></fig></floats-group></article>
