They dimerise via leucine zipper coiled-coil domains, that are preceded by a basic DNA binding domain. Depending on which AP-1 transcription factors dimerise, different DNA sequences will be recognised resulting in differential gene expression. The affinity of AP-1 transcription factors for each other dictates which dimers form. The relative concentration of AP-1 transcription factors varies with tissue type and environment, adding another layer of control to this integral network of cellular regulation. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) protein structure prediction programs gives us a new technique to investigate or predict how dimerization effects combinatorial control. AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-Multimer are AI programs that predict 3D structures of proteins using primary sequence as their only input, even if there is no homologous model available. To fully realise the potential of AI for structural biology, it is essential to understand its current capabilities and limitations. In this study we used the classical example of an AP-1 dimer: Fos and Jun, to interrogate how AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-Multimer model leucine zipper domains, and if AlphaFold-Multimer can be used to differentiate between probable and improbable dimer interfaces. We found that AlphaFold-Multimer predicts highly confident leucine zipper dimers, even for dimer pairs, such as the FosB homodimer, for which electrostatics are known to prevent their formation in vivo. This is an important case study concerning high-confidence, but low-accuracy protein structure prediction.</p><sec id="S1"><title>50-75-word statement</title><p id="P2">Artificial intelligence (AI) programs that predict protein structures, like AlphaFold, could transform structural biology by speeding up the experimental process.

Since then, Fos and Jun have been incorporated into the larger category of Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factors, which are a ubiquitous family of homo or heterodimers with a coiled-coil Leucine zipper (L-zip) dimer interface.

These pathways include cell proliferation and apoptotic signalling, classifying AP-1 transcription factors as both oncogenic and tumour suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Eferl and Wagner, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, cell signalling pathways controlled by AP-1 transcription factors are frequently disrupted or dysregulated by viral and intracellular bacterial infections, contributing to the pathogenicity of these infectious agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Zachos, Clements and Conner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Gazon <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Krämer <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). The expression levels of each individual AP-1 protein vary depending on cell type and environment, and the relative affinity that AP-1 proteins have for each other varies depending on the primary sequence of their L-zip coiled-coil domain. This forms a complex network of transcriptional regulators, based on dimer formation and affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Eferl and Wagner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bejjani <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Perhaps unsurprisingly, the AP-1 L-zip dimer interface has been analysed in atomic detail to understand dimer affinity, specificity and formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Vinson <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Newman and Keating, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Vinson, Acharya and Taparowsky, 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P5">AP-1 L-zips are formed of 4-6 heptad repeats, and each residue in the heptad is labelled <italic>a-g</italic>. Residue <italic>d</italic> is normally a leucine, and residue <italic>a</italic> is normally aliphatic and non-polar; together they form the hydrophobic core of the coiled coil. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> Panel B, C) Residues <italic>e</italic> and <italic>g</italic> are usually polar or charged residues, and they interact to stabilise, or destabilise, the dimer interface, either side of the hydrophobic core.

These proteins have been used as textbook examples of coiled-coil structure motifs for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Branden and Tooze, 1991</xref>). It is well documented that Fos and Jun form stable heterodimers, and Jun can homodimerize, but Fos cannot form stable homodimers due to repelling charges within the L-zip dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Branden and Tooze, 1991</xref>).</p><p id="P7">As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> Panel D, E, the <italic>g</italic> position residues of FosB are mostly glutamates, which interact with the positively charged <italic>e</italic> position residues of JunD. The favourable electrostatic interaction allows a stable dimer to form. Conversely, electrostatic repulsion between these same <italic>g</italic> positioned glutamates and those in position <italic>e</italic>, prevent FosB from forming stable homodimers.

Crucially, some dimer pairs are possible, and others are forbidden, dictated by attractive or repulsive electrostatic interactions. Being able to accurately discriminate functionally-relevant L-zip interactions from those that are forbidden has the potential to inform our understanding of the transcriptional reprogramming that occurs in cancers and in response to certain intracellular pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Eferl and Wagner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kuhlmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Gazon <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Krämer <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>).

AlphaFold2 incorporates a neural network (Evoformer) that predicts 3D protein structures from a primary sequence, based on multiple sequence alignments. In addition to this, AlphaFold-Multimer was developed in March 2022, and uses a training set of oligomeric structures to predict the structure of multimeric proteins with known stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Evans <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). In AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-Multimer, the proximity of protein residues is represented by a graphical network which encodes positional information only.

The predicted structures of the FosB (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> Panel A) and JunD (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> Panel C) homodimers had very similar structures. The coiled coil structured regions covered residues 152±1-219±1 of FosB and 263±1-334±1 of JunD. This was consistent and reproducible across all five ranked structures (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These results are also consistent with the crystal structure of the FosB/JunD heterodimer (PDB code: 5VPF), which contains only residues 153-217 and 267-330, respectively. Upon first inspection, the Alphafold-Multimer structures of the FosB and JunD homodimers showed remarkably little difference to the FosB-JunD heterodimer.</p><p id="P11">Alignments between the crystal structure of the FosB-JunD heterodimer, and the three different AlphaFold-Multimer constructs confirmed that the coiled-coil regions are accurate representations of an L-zip. Within all three dimers, the L-zip Leu (<italic>d</italic>) residues and the <italic>a</italic> residues are positioned correctly to form a hydrophobic core between the coiled-coils. (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>.) The RMSD for these alignments are all &lt;1Å.

These pLDDT scores range from 0 to 100. A high pLDDT score is indicative of accurate local geometry within a protein chain (Mariani <italic>et al</italic>., 2013). pLDDT scores of &gt;90 are considered to be high confidence, and any score under 70 is considered to be low to very low confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Mariani <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Jumper <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).

The mean pLDDT score for the FosB(T180-V214)-JunD(I293-K327) heterodimer L-zip region was 97.7, for the JunD(I293-K327) homodimer it was 95.1, and for FosB(T180-V214) homodimer it was 94.4. These high pLDDT scores indicate that AlphaFold-Multimer is highly confident in the predicted structure of all three of these coiled-coil L-zip regions. Large regions of the predicted FosB and JunD dimer structures had no recognisable secondary structure and very low pLDDT scores of 20 to 40; it is reasonable to infer that these regions are intrinsically disordered based on experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Yin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kumar <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).

The ipTM scores are a global measure, designed to give the user an indication of the quality of the overall predicted structure, and have been adjusted to effectively evaluate multimeric protein complexes. In general, ipTM scores ≥0.8 indicate a high confidence predicted structure, and ipTM scores of between 0.6-0.8 indicate medium confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Evans <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> Panel A, the ipTM scores for the FosB and JunD homo/heterodimers were all low, at approximately 0.3. This was true for the dimers that are known to form <italic>in vivo</italic> (FosB/JunD and JunD/JunD), as well as the dimer unlikely to form <italic>in vivo</italic> (FosB/FosB).</p><p id="P15">We hypothesised that the low ipTM scores were due to the majority of these protein complexes being intrinsically unstructured, leading to the low pLDDT scores for these sections and lowering the overall ipTM score. To test this hypothesis, we ran three peptide pairs through AlphaFold-Multimer that represented the L-zip region of FosB and JunD. Residues T180-V214 of FosB and residues I293-K327 of JunD were run as homodimers and a heterodimer, using the exact same conditions as our full-length dimer constructs. The ipTM scores for these L-zip only regions were strikingly different to the full-length constructs. Notably, the FosB-JunD heterodimer (L-zip region only) had the highest ipTM scores, (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> Panel B), indicating a high confidence in this dimer interface. The FosB homodimer (L-zip region only) had much lower ipTM scores of between 0.25 and 0.48. These differing ipTM scores were the only indications of AlphaFold-Multimer distinguishing between L-zip constructs that are likely or unlikely to form <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P16">Predicted Alignment Error (PAE) scores are a measure of confidence of the relative position of pairs of residues within the predicted structure. Therefore, PAE scores can be used to assess the quality of the positioning of different domains within the predicted structure, or between monomers in multimeric structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Elfmann, Org Stülke and Stülke, 2023</xref>). PAE scores are measured in Ångströms (Å), and are defined as the expected position error at residue <italic>x</italic> if the actual and predicted structures are aligned at residue <italic>y</italic>. A low PAE indicates high confidence in the relative positions of a pair of residues, and a high PAE indicates low confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Varadi <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Evans <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Elfmann, Org Stülke and Stülke, 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The most common way to view and interpret PAE scores are through heatmaps like those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Each residue in the full multimer structure is numbered down the x and y axis, creating a matrix of every possible pair of residues within the full structure. The diagonal line seen down the centre of each heat map shows where every residue is aligned against itself, and the PAE score is always low, by definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Varadi <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Evans <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Elfmann, Org Stülke and Stülke, 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P18">As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> panel E, the PAE score heat map for the FosB-JunD dimer contained two areas of low PAE scores for intra-chain residue pairs (these can be seen along the diagonal), and two areas of low PAE scores for inter-chain residue pairs (seen off the diagonal). The inter-chain residue pairs exclusively fell within the L-zip region of the FosB-JunD dimer. This was to be expected for a well characterised dimer like Fos and Jun. Similar areas of low PAE scores for inter-chain residue pairs could be seen for the JunD homodimer and the FosB homodimer (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> Panel D, F). Ordinarily, areas of low PAE scores like this would indicate an accurate predicted structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Elfmann, Org Stülke and Stülke, 2023</xref>). It was remarkable that AlphaFold-Multimer still predicted low PAE scores for the L-zip region of the FosB homodimer, when it has been shown that FosB cannot stably homodimerize <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Newman and Keating, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Vinson, Acharya and Taparowsky, 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P19">PAE scores can also be expressed as pseudo-bonds. These pseudo-bonds can be drawn between any pair of residues within the predicted structure, but for convenience are usually drawn between residues that are close together in space, and each bond has an associated PAE score. We examined the L-zip region of our three predicted dimer structures to see if there was a difference between the network and PAE scores for the pseudo-bonds connecting the <italic>e</italic> and <italic>g</italic> residues in each dimer interface. Within each predicted dimer construct, we isolated the <italic>e</italic> and <italic>g</italic> residues from each monomer and drew the pseudo-bonds between them and the <italic>e</italic> and <italic>g</italic> residues from the corresponding monomer. We only looked at pseudo-bonds between residues that were &lt;10Å apart. It should be noted that the pseudo-bonds were drawn between the Cα of each residue, even though any atom in the residue could be &lt;10Å from an any atom in another residue.</p><p id="P20">As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, all the pseudo-bonds between the <italic>e</italic> and <italic>g</italic> residues of the FosB-JunD dimer had low PAE scores. The PAE scores for the pseudo-bonds in the JunD homodimer and the FosB homodimer were also all low, indicating a high-quality predicted structure. There were more longer ranging pseudo-bonds in the FosB-JunD heterodimer and the JunD-JunD homodimer, possibly because of how the sidechains for the <italic>e</italic> and <italic>g</italic> residues for these two dimers are positioned relatively close together. In the FosB homodimer, the <italic>e</italic> and <italic>g</italic> residue sidechains were positioned further apart from each other, resulting in a less extensive network of pseudo-bonds. It can be seen in the FosB homodimer structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, that there are pseudo-bonds with low PAE scores connecting multiple unfavourable Glu-Glu <italic>e</italic> to <italic>g</italic> pairs. These closely resemble the low scoring pseudo-bonds between favourable Lys-Glu or Arg-Glu <italic>e</italic> to <italic>g</italic> pairs seen in the FosB-JunD heterodimer. Close examination of the pseudo-bonds and their corresponding PAE scores of the three structures shows relatively little difference between the different dimer interfaces, despite the low likelihood that the FosB homodimer can form <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Electrostatic surface potentials indicate a highly unlikely dimer interaction in the FosB homodimer</title><p id="P21">Lastly, we wanted to visualise the interaction between the charged sidechains in our different dimer constructs.

Consequently, the predicted structure of the FosB L-zip homodimer contained two negatively charged surfaces in close proximity. There was no indication in the pLDDT scores, the PAE scores or the ipTM scores (Full-length constructs), that the FosB homodimer would contain such an implausible dimer interface. When in fact, these clashing negative surface potentials are strong indicators that this dimer construct should not be able to form <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P24">The electrostatic surface potential of the JunD homodimer was less clear.

These results were all consistent with the previous Fos/Jun dimerisation case study. Looking at the AlphaFold-Multimer metrics alone, there is little to nothing to show that these L-zip pairs are in fact unstable dimer structures.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>An energetically unfavourable synthetic peptide pair still forms a L-zip dimer</title><p id="P27">Next, we tested if AlphaFold-Multimer would form a L-Zip from a synthetic peptide, specifically engineered to be as energetically unfavourable as possible. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Vinson et al., (2002</xref>; 2006) calculated the coupling energy (ΔΔΔG<sub>int</sub>) of common <italic>g-e</italic> pairs, relative to an Ala-Ala pair, and their data were used as a guide to design, <italic>in silico</italic>, two peptides with the highest possible coupling energy. Each peptide contained five heptad repeats, and the <italic>e</italic> and <italic>g</italic> positions were filled with repelling negatively charged residues. The first iteration of this peptide contained all Glu residues. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> panel B) (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure 1</xref> for the monomer structures.)</p><p id="P28">It should be noted that <italic>de novo</italic> protein design using AlphaFold is still difficult and an ongoing area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Goverde et al., 2023</xref>). The results from the following experiments show some of the problems associated with using AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-Multimer to predict synthetic protein structures.</p><p id="P29">Despite the egregious clashing charges, AlphaFold-Multimer formed a L-Zip dimer from these synthetic peptides, with very high pLDDT scores (mean: 98.04) and very low PAE scores. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>. Panel C, D.) An alignment between the synthetic peptide and the FosB-JunD crystal structure, showed that the dimer structure had been formed with coiled-coil L-zip geometry: RMSD: 0.984Å. (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>.) As can be seen on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> Panel B, the ipTM scores for our synthetic peptide pair were also high, highest: 0.81, similar to the ipTM scores for the FosB/JunD heterodimer (L-zip region only). In this case, it appeared there was no way to distinguish the dimerization propensity of our synthetic peptide pair from that of the FosB-JunD dimer; both predicted structures had excellent confidence scores, but drastically different chances of forming <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>L-zip dimer prediction is dominated by leucine patterning and the commonness of <italic>e</italic> and <italic>g</italic> position residues, not electrostatics</title><p id="P30">As a final experiment, we wanted to test what would “break” the L-Zip dimer by using the synthetic peptide pair as a backbone and changing either the <italic>e/g</italic> residues, or the Leu (<italic>d</italic>) residues. Either all the <italic>e/g</italic> residues were changed to the same charged residue, or one, two or three Leu residues were changed to Ile residues. A predicted L-zip construct was recorded as “broken” when it included anti-parallel helices, parallel helices with incorrectly oriented Leu residues, or helices with very minimal interchain interaction. (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.)</p><p id="P31">Placing Glu and Lys residues in all the <italic>e/g</italic> positions still produced L-zips in all five AlphaFold-Multimer constructs. However, Asp and Arg <italic>e/g</italic> residues “broke” the L-zip, and caused AlphaFold-Multimer to produce alternative dimer interfaces. Sequence alignments of human L-zip proteins show that Arg and Asp are less commonly found in the <italic>e/g</italic> position than Lys or Glu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Vinson <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), and this could explain why AlphaFold-Multimer stopped recognising the L-zip heptad repeats when so many uncommon residues were included in the primary sequence. Changing one Leu to an Ile mostly maintained the L-zip construct, whereas, progressively mutating the Leu residues to Ile increased the number of “broken” L-zip constructs. (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.)</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P32">The neural network at the heart of AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold Multimer (Evoformer) builds and progressively refines a representation of the proximity of protein residues in the form of an evolving graphical network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Jumper <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Evans <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). The evidence presented in this study demonstrates how AlphaFold2 cannot account for other effects (for example electrostatic) that can modify proximity. This is because the edges in the graphical network encode only the nodes that they join. Additionally, the relaxation algorithms utilized by AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-Multimer (the Amber ff99SB force field) resolve steric clashes, but do not take into account destabilising electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hornak <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bouatta, Sorger and Al Quraishi, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Jumper <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). L-zips are an excellent demonstration of these limitations: AlphaFold uses multiple sequence alignments to accurately find the L-zip regions, without recognising when clashing charges make the dimer structure improbable.</p><p id="P33">At the time of writing, AlphaFold3 is available to beta test and these limitations remain in this latest iteration of the software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abramson <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P34">The points raised in this study are important to consider when using AlphaFold to study any protein that forms homodimers or heterodimers as part of a combinatorial control network, or any proteins that form coiled-coil dimers. As a specific example, disruptions to the network of AP-1 transcription factors have been implicated in the development of bone, skin, liver and lung cancer, to name but a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Eferl and Wagner, 2003</xref>). Assessing the different possible interactions within this nuanced network of transcription factors would be challenging using AlphaFold-Multimer. Similarly, to use AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-Multimer to design artificial dimers, would require the use of additional data or software to evaluate binding partner specificity and affinity.</p><p id="P35">In the case of L-zips, previous experimental data can be used to evaluate the AlphaFold-Multimer structures. The coupling energies experimentally calculated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Vinson et al., (2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">2006</xref>) can be used to estimate if a L-zip dimer will be stable. Unfortunately, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Vinson et al., (2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">2006</xref>) only looked at the most commonly found residues in these positions, therefore, it could not be used to accurately calculate the coupling energy of the FosB-JunD dimer, because JunD contains a relatively rare Thr as one of its <italic>g</italic> residues. However, previous experimentation like this can, and should, be used to assess the quality of AlphaFold structures. It should be emphasised that AlphaFold Multimer does not provide a theoretical K<sub>D</sub> for predicted structures, or any other indication of binding strength.</p><p id="P36">Altogether, this study is an important example of an AlphaFold structure with high confidence scores but low accuracy. It illustrates AlphaFold’s strengths and its weaknesses, showing that AlphaFold structures must be interpreted critically, and with prior knowledge of the physical principles affecting protein 3D geometry.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="P37">AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold multimer were accessed using the Galaxy Australia platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Community, 2024</xref>), running AlphaFold v2.3.2.
