With the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors, USP7 has also become a promising target for cancer therapy, and therefore systematically identifying USP7 deubiquitinase interaction partners and substrates has become an important goal. In this study, we selected a colorectal cancer cell model that is highly dependent on USP7 and in which USP7 knockdown significantly inhibited colorectal cancer cell viability, colony formation, and cell-cell adhesion. We then used inducible knockdown of USP7 followed by LC-MS/MS to quantify USP7 dependent proteins. We identified the Ajuba LIM domain protein as an interacting partner of USP7 through co-IP, its substantially reduced protein levels in response to USP7 knockdown, and its sensitivity to the specific USP7 inhibitor FT671. The Ajuba protein has been shown to have oncogenic functions in colorectal and other tumours, including regulation of cell-cell adhesion. We show that both knockdown of USP7 or Ajuba results in a substantial reduction of cell-cell adhesion, with concomitant effects on other proteins associated with adherens junctions. Our findings underlie the role of USP7 in colorectal cancer through its protein interaction networks and show that the Ajuba protein is a component of USP7 protein networks present in colorectal cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">There has been rapidly increasing interest in the role of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in many types of tumour including colorectal cancer (CRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Dewson et al., 2023</xref>). DUB proteins are proteases that reverse E3 ligase activity by cleaving a single ubiquitin, polyubiquitin chains or ubiquitin-like modifications on target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bushman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Reyes-Turcu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Sowa et al., 2009</xref>). This role of DUBs is similar to the regulatory role of the phosphatases in a kinase/phosphatase pathway(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Reyes-Turcu et al., 2009</xref>). There are nearly 100 DUBs in the human genome, grouped into five families: USP, OUT, UCH, Josephin (cysteine proteases) and JAMM (a family of metalloproteases); DUBs have high specificity for ubiquitin. Different DUBs have different domains for the protein-protein interactions, substrate specificity and cellular localisation. Quantitative studies of multiple aspects of DUBs, including protein activity, protein network and genetic studies, have discovered new DUB functions in both humans and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Reyes-Turcu et al., 2009</xref>)</p><p id="P3">Deubiquitination is a regulatory process involved in multiple cell functions, such as cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Song and Rape, 2008</xref>) gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Daniel and Grant, 2007</xref>) and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kennedy and D’Andrea, 2005</xref>). Moreover, mutations in many DUBs proteins have been implicated in various types of disease, including cancer and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Fischer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Shanmugham and Ovaa, 2008</xref>). Despite it being evident that DUBs are critical to cell function, the targets and regulation processes of most DUB members have yet to be elucidated.</p><p id="P4">The largest DUB family is ubiquitin specific protease (USP), which is comprised of more than 50 USP different deubiquitinating enzymes in humans and 16 UBPs in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Nijman et al., 2005</xref>). USPs have essential roles in protein regulation and function; disruption of their roles could lead to cancer progression. Thus, USP proteins have been targeted with anti-tumour chemotherapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bedford et al., 2011</xref>). As a therapeutic strategy for cancer, drugs that target DUBs are predicted to be well tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Nicholson et al., 2007</xref>). The structure of multiple DUBs in the USP/UBP class including USP7, have been characterised; this has enabled identification of the method of molecular recognition (ubiquitin or ubiquitin aldehyde-complexed) used by these proteases in their active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Saridakis et al., 2005</xref>). The ubiquitin recognition mechanism is the same for the USP/UBP class, which show homology in their catalytic sites only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Nicholson et al., 2007</xref>). and has interaction domains in their insertions and terminal extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Reyes-Turcu et al., 2009</xref>). These features provide USP with high selectivity for its targets.</p><p id="P5">USP7 is one member of the of USP family that due to its functional importance, has been quite extensively studied. Through its binding partners and substrates,, USP7 plays fundamental roles in diverse cellular and biological processes, such as DNA repair, cell cycle, epigenetic regulation and tumour suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Al-Eidan et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, mapping the USP7 network may lead to discovering new cellular functions of USP7 that are implicated in colorectal cancer. USP7 is overexpressed in many cancers, including colorectal in which it has been shown to stabilize a number of proteins that promote tumorigenesis in diverse process such as enhanced proliferation, increased angiogenesis and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Saha et al., 2023</xref>). USP7 promotes colorectal cancer (CRC) growth by upregulating various cellular pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Li et al., 2020</xref>) and p53–Mdm2 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Becker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Zhi et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, USP7, is one of genes identified and combined to form a prognostic mutation panel in stage II and III CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sho et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Despite the rapidly increasing number of USP7-related studies, relatively little is known about how USP7 regulates other key cancer-related pathways such as cell-cell adhesion, an important regulator of key tumour processes including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. In this study, we used an inducible knockdown model of USP7 in colorectal cancer cells to identify new potential interaction partners, substrates and ultimately functions, for USP7 in colorectal cancer. To identify potential new substrates and partners of USP7, we applied a quantitative label-free LC-MS/MS proteomics approach. First, we demonstrated that the inhibition of USP7 significantly reduced cell viability, cell proliferation, and cell-cell adhesion in 2D and 3D cultures. We then selected an appropriate USP7-sensitive cell-line by mining whole genome knockout studies and used an inducible knockout of USP7 in this cell-line to perform an LC-MS/MS screen for USP7-dependent proteins. From these results, we identified the LIM domain protein Ajuba as a novel interaction partner for USP7. We then used both cell-based and molecular approaches to investigate the role of Ajuba. Using Co-IP and knockdown, we show that Ajuba interacts with USP7 and that Ajuba protein levels are dependent on USP7. With Ajuba’s known roles in cell adhesion we next showed that knockdown of either USP7 or Ajuba in dispase-treated cell-cultures significantly enhanced loss of cell adhesion. We also showed that N-cadherin and E-cadherin levels are reduced in USP7 (and partially in Ajuba) knockdown cells albeit with no evidence of direct interaction between USP7 and the cadherins. In summary, we have identified Ajuba as a novel interaction partner of USP7 that mediates USP7 functional regulation of cell-cell adhesion in colorectal cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Maintenance of cell lines</title><p id="P7">The CRC cell-line, HCT116, was cultured in McCoy’s 5A media (Life Technologies, 26600023).

The DepMap project includes both large-scale CRISPR and RNAi screens of many cancer-cell lines and provides a significant resource for identifying the vulnerabilities of different cancer types using knockout or knockdown screens. We analysed the CRISPR and RNAi dependency scores across all cell-lines in the DepMap as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> and noted that several colorectal cancer cell-lines show strong negative gene-effect scores in both the CRISPR and RNAi datasets. Notably, growth of the LS180 cell-line, is significantly inhibited through either USP7 knockdown or knockout in the DepMap project (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). LS180 is a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line derived from a 58-year-old Caucasian female with Dukes type B adenocarcinoma of the colon (ECACC 87021202). The related LS174T cell line (ECACC 87060401) was derived from the same patient (“ECACC General Cell Collection: 87021202 LS180,” n.d.), and were subsequently modified to express a doxycycline-inducible siRNA construct pTER-USP7 (cell-line known as LS88) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kessler et al., 2007</xref>). We used this LS88 cell-line as the basis of our proteomic screen in this study. To identify suitable conditions for the proteomic screen, we confirmed that treatment of LS88 cells with doxycycline induced knockdown of USP7 in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and that levels of Trim27 and p53, two key proteins regulated by USP7 were regulated as expected according to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Meulmeester et al., 2005</xref>) following doxycycline treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). We next showed that cell viability is significantly affected following treatment of LS88 cells with doxycycline or siRNA induced knockdown of USP7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Further results of cell viability and colony formation following USP7 knockdown are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>.. We also confirmed that the observed decreases in cell viability were due to USP7 knockdown and not treatment with doxycycline per se, since doxycycline is known to have a negative effect on invasive potential and cell proliferation across varied human CRC cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Onoda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Sagar et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Finally, we also showed that inducible knockdown for 72 hrs in LS88 cells with doxycycline has similar effects to USP7 depletion via siRNA in another colorectal cancer cell-line, DLD-1. Notably, the DLD-1 cell-line, in common with many other colorectal cancer cell-lines has mutant truncated APC, and a previous study indicated that USP7 has a specific role in maintaining Wnt signalling in tumours with APC mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Novellasdemunt et al., 2017</xref>). We also observed that in the DepMap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org">depmap.org</ext-link>) gene-effect data, the effect of USP7 knockout or knockdown is markedly less pronounced in colorectal cancer cell-lines with APC mutation than in those without (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). In summary, the USP7 inducible knockdown cell-line LS88 in the highly USP7-dependent CRC cell line of LS180 represent an appropriate model for studying USP7 function in colorectal cancer. The effects are comparable to other widely used CRC cell-lines following USP7 depletion.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Differential analysis of the USP7 network using inducible knockdown proteomics</title><p id="P33">To broadly characterize proteome-wide altered protein expression in response to USP7 knockdown, we performed whole-cell profiling using quantitative label-free LC-MS/MS. Based on the altered phenotypic properties of the doxycycline-treated LS88 cells observed above, we compared doxycycline-treated LS88 cells at 72hrs to control (untreated) cells at 0 and 72 hrs after the start of the experiment. Three replicate samples were profiled using LC-MS/MS for each group. Data-dependent quantitative mass spectrometry analysis identified a total of 7,301 proteins of which 445 proteins were found to be significantly (p &lt; 0.05) differential between the treated and untreated samples at 72hrs. We then analysed the sample reproducibility as shown in the PCA and heatmap analyses and volcano plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>. Since our goal is to identify proteins whose expression decreases alongside depletion of USP7 (and are therefore potential substrates of the USP7 deubiquitinase), we analysed the set of 293 proteins which were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased following doxycycline treatment. We first analysed these proteins using DAVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Huang et al., 2008</xref>) to broadly assess the most significant pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). We noted that proteins related to ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis represent a significantly enriched group and show this set of proteins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>. Notably, the top 2 proteins, TRIM27 and TRIP12 are known interaction partners of USP7 ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Zaman et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that our dataset could be a rich source of USP7 substrates and novel interaction partners. We also noted that from the DAVID analysis, adherens junctions proteins represent the most significantly enriched group within the data. We further analysed this finding using ShinyGo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Ge et al., 2020</xref>) to represent the 10 most significant GO cellular components as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>. Although USP7 has been implicated in the regulation of several cancer-associated pathways, its role in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion is relatively unstudied. We focused on the Ajuba protein, that was previously found to promote growth, migration and metastasis in colorectal cancer, in addition to its roles and functions in regulating cell-cell adhesion and pathways such as Hippo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Jia et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, we annotated the volcano plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) with key proteins from this study and with selected proteins from the most significant GO cellular component categories in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>.

The level of Ajuba protein after USP7 inhibition was determined at different time points (0, 24, and 72hr) using doxycycline (1 μg/mL) in LS88. We observed a reduction of Ajuba expression after USP7 depletion, and a particularly marked decrease in Ajuba after 72hrs following doxycycline treatment, comparable to the time point used in the MS proteomics study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>). We further explored this effect by using FT671, a non-covalent selective USP7 inhibitor. We treated LS88 cells with the FT671-USP7 and the levels of Ajuba was analysed using Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). As the figure demonstrates, the Ajuba protein levels were changed after 48, 72, and 96 hours after the treatment. Similarly, the results from a different colorectal cancer cell line (HCT116) showed a reduction of Ajuba protein expression after the cells were treated with the inhibitor for 48 and 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Next, we analysed the sub-cellular localisation of Ajuba and USP7 using immunofluorescence.. As shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4-B</xref>) Ajuba and USP7 protein levels were markedly decreased in LS88 cells treated with doxycycline (1 μg/mL) where USP7 was downregulated. Ajuba was previously reported to localize mainly in nucleoplasm &amp; the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Thul et al., 2017</xref>), and USP7 was reported to localize predominantly to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Zapata et al., 2001</xref>). We observed that Ajuba and USP7 protein levels were very significantly (p&lt; 0.0001) higher in nuclei than in cytoplasm (p&lt; 0.001) in the cells treated with doxycycline which is consistent with their localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p id="P36">In order to further investigate the regulatory relationship between Ajuba and USP7, we used qRT-PCR to show that Ajuba mRNA expression was unaffected by USP7 downregulation in doxycycline treated LS88 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>), showing that USP7 does not regulate Ajuba at the transcriptional level. We next investigated whether Ajuba is a protein-protein interaction partner of USP7 by using immunoprecipitation with anti-USP7 antibodies in LS88 cells. We found that USP7 interacts with Ajuba in colorectal cancer cells when USP7 is pulled down and analysed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), showing that Ajuba is indeed a physically associated interaction partner of USP7 in colorectal cancer. We also found in both LS88 and LS147T cells that reciprocal knockdown of Ajuba does not alter USP7 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating that USP7 and Ajuba are not co-complexed proteins with mutual regulation of protein stability, but rather that Ajuba stability is dependent on USP7 but not vice-versa.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Knockdown of USP7 or Ajuba causes disruption of cell-cell adhesion in CRC cells</title><p id="P37">Since cell-cell and adherens junctions were found to be one of the most significantly enriched functions from the proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), we analysed whether knockdown of USP7 or Ajuba resulted in phenotypic changes to cell-cell adhesion. Dispase assays allow for the separation of cell culture monolayers that can then be subjected to mechanical stress. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, mechanical stress of siUSP7 or siAJUBA treated cells led to significantly increased fragmentation of monolayers as compared to control siRNA treatments, showing that reduction of either USP7 or Ajuba causes a very significant reduction in the mechanical strength of cell-cell adhesion in CRC cells.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Knockdown of USP7 or Ajuba disrupts cadherin but not catenin protein levels</title><p id="P38">To identify the underlying mechanisms of how cell-cell adhesion is disrupted through USP7 or Ajuba knockdown, we examined the expression of cell junction associated proteins. Since Ajuba has been identified to interact with several cadherins and catenins (CDH1/E-cadherin, CTNNA1/ α-catenin, CTNNB1/ β-catenin, CTNND1/ δ-catenin and JUP/plakoglobin), we focused our analysis on this group of proteins. Using immunoblotting, we investigated the protein levels of multiple cadherins and catenins following USP7 or Ajuba knockdown. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>, both N-cadherin and E-cadherin protein levels were reduced after USP7 inhibition in LS88 cells, and similarly the expression of N-cadherin and E-cadherin were reduced following USP7 knockdown in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). We also observed that treatment of LS88 and HCT116 cells with the USP7-inhibitor FT671 across a time course resulted in decreased N-cadherin expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). Since these findings suggest that USP7 may regulate cadherin expression in CRC cells, we employed IP-coupled westerns (co-IP) to determine whether there is a physical interaction between USP7 and E-cadherin. This analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>) did not indicate that there was a physical interaction between the proteins, suggesting that the reduction in E-cadherin expression is not mediated via interaction with USP7 and that E-cadherin is not a substrate of the deubiquitinase. Although USP7 has been shown to regulate Wnt/ β-catenin signaling in CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Herbst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Ji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Novellasdemunt et al., 2017</xref>), we found no altered β-catenin protein expression following USP7 knockdown in multiple CRC cell-lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>), except in SW480 cells, that carry the APC truncation mutation which results in β-catenin stabilisation, in line with a previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Herbst et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, there was no effect on either α-catenin or JUP/plakoglobin following USP7 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). We observed that levels of JUP were increased (p&lt; 0.05) following USP7 depletion in the proteomics data, but did not observe any increase using Western blots, nor was there an interaction detected via co-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>)).</p><p id="P39">Since Ajuba knockdown resulted in loss of cell-cell adhesion similarly to USP7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), we next examined the expression of cell junction associated proteins in response to Ajuba knockdown.

USP7 is known to promote cancer growth by upregulating several key cellular pathways, including the P53-MDM2 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Harakandi et al., 2021</xref>) and Wnt/-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Novellasdemunt et al., 2017</xref>). Its role as a regulator of these key cancer pathways has led to USP7 becoming an important therapeutic target and yet our wider understanding of its substrates, interactions and functions is incomplete.

This revealed significant decreases compared to the HEK 293T cell line. In addition, our study has used colony formation assay to examine the role of USP7 in the regulation of cell colonies, thereby revealing substantial cell colony inhibition in depleted USP7 CRC cells. These findings concur with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Behan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hayal et al., 2020</xref>). The current study verifies the importance of USP7 for cell survival in cases of colorectal cancer.</p><p id="P45">Cell adhesion plays an essential role in metastasis and cancer progression. The interaction between cancer cells and the endothelium defines the metastatic spread (Bendas and Borsig, 2012). One pathway that was enriched in our MS data for USP7 is cell adhesion. To characterize the USP7 role in cell-cell junction, USP7 was knocked down, and the impacts on cell-cell adhesion were observed using dispase-based assay and mechanical stress in LS88. The results showed significant reductions in cell junctions. In the subsequent stage, we examined the master proteins that play a major role in cell adhesion in USP7-depleted cells in our cell model LS88 and other CRC cells. The findings confirmed the low expression of N-cadherin and E-cadherin when USP7 levels are reduced, although transcription levels must be measured in this context. However, no physical interactions were found between USP7, N-cadherin, E-cadherin or JUP.</p><p id="P46">Many studies have shown that Ajuba acts as an oncogene due to its regulatory role in key signaling pathways, such as RAS/ERK, JAK/STAT, Wnt and Hippo. The protein acts as a co-regulator of main transcription factors, e.g. Sp1, Snail and nuclear hormone receptors. Amplified Ajuba expression has been found in viral types of tumours, suggesting its potential as a clinical prognostic and diagnostic marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Jia et al., 2020</xref>). Ajuba is one of the proteins that has been linked to cell adhesion for over a decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Marie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Nola et al., 2011</xref>). The bioinformatics results emerging from our MS data indicated that Ajuba is a novel substrate for USP7 in our cell model. These findings were acquired in the lab using immunochemistry, immunoprecipitation, and siRNA oligos. The data confirmed the MS data, thereby indicating that Ajuba interacts directly with USP7 in CRC cells. We subsequently tested the central hypothesis that USP7 may influence cell-cell adhesion by regulating Ajuba protein levels. The results showed a reduction of N-cadherin and ITGB4 protein levels in Ajuba downregulated cells. These findings are consistent with earlier research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Peifer and Wleschaus, 1990</xref>). The results from the dispase-based essay in our lab demonstrated the high number of fragments in Ajuba knocked down cells. When combined, these findings suggest that the inhibition in the cell-cell junction in USP7-depleted cells may occur via Ajuba protein levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Data 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS199440-supplement-Supplementary_Data_1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d47aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><caption><title>Full results from Mascot search engine analysis of all mass-spectrometry data</title></caption><media xlink:href="EMS199440-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.csv" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="csv; charset=utf-8" id="d47aAcEcC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><caption><title>Normalized area quantifications from Proteome Discoverer analysis of mass-spectrometry data</title></caption><media xlink:href="EMS199440-supplement-Supplementary_Table_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d47aAcEdC" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>RME acknowledges Medical Research Council (MR/S01411X/1) and European Commission FP7 (“Oncoprotnet”) for funding; YW acknowledges Medical Research Council (MR/S025480/1).
