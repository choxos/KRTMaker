LaccID, generated via 11 rounds of directed evolution from an ancestral fungal laccase, catalyzes the one-electron oxidation of diverse aromatic substrates using O<sub>2</sub> instead of toxic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and exhibits activity selective to the surface plasma membrane of both living and fixed cells. We show that LaccID can be used with mass spectrometry-based proteomics to map the changing surface composition of T cells that engage with tumor cells via antigen-specific T cell receptors. In addition, we use LaccID as a genetically-encodable tag for EM visualization of cell surface features in mammalian cell culture and in the fly brain.

Current PL enzymes fall largely into two broad classes: the peroxidases and the biotin ligases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Peroxidases such as APEX2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> generate phenoxyl radicals from phenol substrates and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which subsequently react with surface-exposed electron-rich sidechains like tyrosines. These enzymes are fast and versatile, able to use a wide range of substrates, but the requirement for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> renders the labeling conditions toxic, especially in tissue. Labeling by biotin ligases such as TurboID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> and BioID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> is milder; these enzymes use endogenous ATP to generate biotin-AMP esters that subsequently react with lysine sidechains. However, due to the strict requirement of these enzymes for biotin, it is difficult to avoid background from both endogenous biotin and endogenous biotinylated proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, which are abundant in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Furthermore, biotin ligases have rarely been used for cell surface mapping due to the absence of ATP in the extracellular environment. While ATP could be added exogenously, tissue penetration and unintentional activation of purine receptors are concerns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. For these reasons, new PL enzymes that use different chemistries than existing enzymes are needed to advance the field.</p><p id="P3">Given the versatility of phenoxyl radicals for covalent tagging of proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, and for generating contrast for electron microscopy (EM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, we searched for APEX2-like oxidizing enzymes that do not require toxic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for labeling. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and laccase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> are both copper enzymes that oxidize phenol using O<sub>2</sub> instead of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In particular, laccase drew our attention because: (1) it catalyzes one-electron oxidation to generate short-lived phenoxyl radicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. PPO, on the other hand, carries out two-electron oxidation to generate quinones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> which have much longer half-lives and therefore larger labeling radii. (2) Laccase has broad substrate scope, which includes diaminobenzidine (DAB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, a substrate that is used to generate contrast for EM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. (3) Laccase’s K<sub>m</sub> for O<sub>2</sub>, 20-50 μM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, is in the range of physiological O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in tissue (29-64 μM in the human brain for example<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>) suggesting potential <italic>in vivo</italic> applicability. (4) Laccase has been used for cell surface fluorescence imaging, albeit with antibody targeting rather than genetic-encoding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. And finally, (5) fungal laccases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, which have broader substrate scope and higher redox potential than their bacterial counterparts, have been engineered for numerous industrial applications, including paper-pulp biobleaching, textile dye decolorization, bioremediation, food processing, and biofuel cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">However, there are significant challenges to the use of laccases for PL technology, most notably because no laccase has previously been expressed and shown to be active in mammalian systems. The enzyme is also complex, with four copper atoms, two or more disulfides, glycosylation, optimal activity at acidic pH (pH 4-5), and an electron transfer pathway that is strongly interrupted by modest concentrations of hydroxyl anions or halides (e.g., NaCl, KCl) in cell culture media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Here we benchmarked several engineered laccase templates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, identified an ancestral fungal variant with slight activity in HEK293T cells, and performed extensive directed evolution on the yeast surface to improve its activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The resulting clone, LaccID, was deployed for both electron microscopy and cell surface proteome mapping in mammalian cells. Our work establishes a new enzyme class for PL with promising properties and paves the way for future improvements.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Engineering LaccID</title><p id="P5">Laccases are widely expressed in fungi, plants, insects, and bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, but there is no mammalian counterpart. The natural function of laccases is polymerization/depolymerization of aromatic substrates involved in lignin degradation/biosynthesis, stress defense, pigment synthesis, and sporulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Laccases possess four copper atoms distributed into two copper centers. Fungal laccases also contain at least two disulfide bonds and are heavily glycosylated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The most extensively engineered laccases for industrial applications are from white-rot fungi, which have been improved for activity in ionic liquids, high and low pH, high temperature, and physiological fluids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Given the lack of prior reports demonstrating laccase activity in mammalian systems, we first selected a panel of fungal laccase variants to test in HEK293T cells. We cloned them as fusions to a secretion signal, an epitope tag (V5), and transmembrane anchor (from CD4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>) for cell surface expression. Our panel consisted of: (i) LacAnc100<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, an ancestrally resurrected sequence from Basidiomycete PM1 fungi, which may offer improved heterologous expression and activity due to the generalist nature of ancient biocatalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>; (ii) Chu-B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, a mutant of PM1 laccase that was engineered for applications in human blood, withstanding neutral/alkaline pH and high halide concentrations; (iii) OB-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, another mutant of PM1 laccase engineered for improved expression in budding yeast, suggesting potential compatibility with mammalian expression systems; and (iv) KyLO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, a laccase mutant from ascomycetous <italic>Myceliophthora thermophila</italic> engineered for enhanced activity at pH 8.0.</p><p id="P7">All four laccases were well-expressed in HEK293T cells, as determined by anti-V5 western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). However, only a single laccase, LacAnc100, showed labeling activity when incubated with biotin-phenol (BP) probe for 1 hour. LacAnc100 exhibited a small degree of self-labeling (asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), which was less than the intensity of endogenous biotinylated protein bands and far lower than the promiscuous labeling catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with BP and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in just 1 minute. Yet this small activity provides a basis to carry out directed evolution of LacAnc100 to improve its properties.</p><p id="P8">We implemented directed evolution using yeast surface display (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>) due to our past success with this format for engineering APEX2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and TurboID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In addition, fungal laccases have been functionally expressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> at high titers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, indicating that yeast provide the necessary machinery for both copper insertion and glycosylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. We fused LacAnc100 to the yeast mating protein Aga2p for surface display and used error-prone PCR to create a library of variants with an average of 1-7 amino acid changes per gene.</p><p id="P9">BP labeling of the yeast library was followed by streptavidin-fluorophore staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to enrich populations with high activity. Several strategies were employed over 11 rounds of selection. First, we progressively increased selection stringency by reducing labeling time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 1a, 2a, and 3a</xref>). Second, at the end of each generation, all unique sequences were tested in HEK293T cells and beneficial mutations were manually combined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 1-3</xref>) before diversification of the winning clone for further evolution. Third, in some rounds, half of the cell population was subjected to labeling in the presence of the radical quenchers sodium ascorbate and Trolox to reduce radical half-life and intercellular “trans” labeling; the populations were recombined after FACS enrichment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P10">In total, we performed 11 rounds of selection over three generations of evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). FACS analysis of labeled yeast showed a gradual increase in biotinylation efficiency over the course of evolution, with LaccID being 4-fold more active than the original template LacAnc100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). This trend was reproduced when the clones were analyzed on the surface of HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), with LaccID exhibiting both highest expression and the highest activity-to-expression ratio of all clones.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Optimization of LaccID labeling conditions and characterization in mammalian cells</title><p id="P11">Although LaccID has higher biotinylation activity than the starting template LacAnc100, the activity is still much lower than that of HRP in a side-by-side comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). We hypothesized that the mammalian cell environment, including the culture media, may impact LaccID activity. Thus, we tested different media compositions, comparing complete DMEM to RPMI and EBSS media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We found that labeling with BP was strongest in EBSS, perhaps because it lacks thiols that could inhibit laccase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In a separate test, we found that additives such as 10% FBS and 0.5 mM cysteine can impair LaccID activity in EBSS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We next hypothesized that the substrate structure may influence biotinylation by LaccID. Many natural and synthetic substrates used by laccases have an ortho-methoxy substituent on the phenol, an electron-donating moiety that facilitates oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. When tested on LaccID-expressing HEK293T cells, biotin-methoxyphenol (BMP) showed higher labeling than BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), and comparable labeling in both RPMI and EBSS media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Substrate titration and time-course experiments showed that 1-2 hours of labeling with 250-500 μM BP or BMP substrate provides optimal signal to noise ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 4d-e</xref>). Interestingly, while LaccID shows stronger labeling with BMP than BP, HRP and APEX2 exhibit the opposite preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Confocal immunofluorescence imaging confirmed the surface localization and activity of LaccID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). When using BMP, in contrast to BP, cells adjacent to LaccID-expressing cells were also biotinylated to some extent (trans-labeling) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>), which was also observed on suspended K562 cells analyzed by FACS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4f</xref>). The BMP radical is expected to have a longer half-life than BP radical due to stabilization by the electron-donating methoxy group, thus resulting in a longer labeling radius. Consequently, for PL applications with LaccID, BMP is recommended to maximize sensitivity, and BP to maximize spatial specificity.</p><p id="P14">To examine the mechanism of LaccID labeling, we generated a mutant in which the His-Cys-His (HCH) motif, essential for electron transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, was changed to three alanines. As expected, this mutation abolished LaccID activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). To confirm that LaccID labeling depends on O<sub>2</sub>, we depleted O<sub>2</sub> from the labeling mixture with glucose oxidase, which consumes O<sub>2</sub> upon oxidation of its substrate glucose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. As expected, LaccID labeling decreased when both glucose oxidase and glucose were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Kinetic characterization of LaccID</title><p id="P15">To further characterize LaccID’s catalytic activity, especially in relation to the starting template LacAnc100, we purified recombinant enzyme using a protease cleavable His<sub>8</sub>-tag from yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). We first performed a thermal stability assay by increasing temperature while measuring oxidation of 2,2’-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), a commonly-used laccase substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. LaccID was more stable than LacAnc100, with a T<sub>50</sub> (temperature at which the enzyme loses 50% of activity after 10 minutes of incubation) of 57.8±0.5 °C compared to 54.8±0.2 °C for LacAnc100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). This aligns with the higher expression of LaccID compared to LacAnc100 observed in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). There was no significant difference in pH-dependent stability between the two enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To measure catalytic turnover, we utilized a broader panel of substrates: ABTS, guaiacol, 2,6-dimethoxy phenol (DMP), <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, and sinapic acid. Initial rates of product generation were measured by absorbance, showing that LaccID was 1.1 to 20.8-fold faster than LacAnc100 with the same substrates at pH 7.4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>). We then measured initial rates across a range of pH values. We observed that while LacAnc100 activity drops at neutral pH (pH 7.0) to only 0.17% of its peak value at pH 5.0, LaccID retains 16.6% of its peak (pH 5.0) activity at pH 7.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>).

We performed a side-by-side comparison of all ER-targeted constructs with all cell surface targeted constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-b</xref>). Interestingly, surface-targeted LaccID gave much cleaner localization to the cell surface than surface-targeted APEX2 or HRP, which exhibited significant pools of trapped intracellular protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The enhanced surface targeting of LaccID was further confirmed by antibody staining, with and without membrane permeabilization, followed by FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>). We then performed labeling with BP probe. While APEX2 and HRP showed BP labeling on both the cell surface and ER lumen, LaccID was exclusively active on the cell surface, with no labeling detected by ER-targeted LaccID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3a-b</xref>).</p><p id="P21">To further examine the cell surface specificity of LaccID, we performed promiscuous labeling with BP, enriched the biotinylated proteins with streptavidin beads, and blotted the enriched material with antibodies against the ER marker calreticulin and the cell surface marker N-cadherin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref> shows that surface-targeted LaccID enriches N-cadherin but not calreticulin, while surface-targeted APEX2 and HRP enrich both markers due to (1) significant pools of APEX2/HRP in the ER lumen due to their imperfect targeting to the cell surface, and (2) high activity of APEX2/HRP in the ER compartment. The serendipitous discovery of LaccID’s cell surface selectivity provides an opportunity for facile cell surface proteome mapping, explored below.</p><p id="P22">LaccID’s inactivity in the ER may result from limited intracellular copper, which is tightly regulated and facilitated by copper chaperones predominantly in the Golgi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.

We also generated a construct in which LaccID was targeted directly to the Golgi compartment.

Perhaps the discrepancy is due to lower oxygen availability inside living cells versus after cell fixation. We also examined the importance of glycosylation by introducing Asn-to-Ala mutations at six different potential N-glycosylation sites in surface-targeted LacAnc100, none of which appeared to significantly reduce its activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7f</xref>). Together, our findings indicate that LaccID is well-targeted to the cell surface, and selectively active there, in contrast to APEX2 and HRP which exhibit activity in ER and Golgi compartments.

LaccID offers unique benefits over established PL enzymes such as APEX2 and TurboID by utilizing gentle, non-toxic (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-free) labeling conditions, and accepting a broad range of substrate structures. In addition, LaccID can be used for selective proteome mapping at the cell surface without requiring special, membrane-impermeant substrates. This enabled us to use LaccID to map the surfaceome of T cells cocultured with tumor cells, and highlight dozens of proteins that are upregulated via T cell receptor-antigen interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). We also used LaccID for EM imaging in the fly brain and HEK293T cell cultures, delineating plasma membranes more clearly than peroxidase-based labels such as APEX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).

However, the current activity of LaccID is still much lower than that of APEX2 or TurboID, requiring 1-2 hours of labeling to give detectable signal, in contrast to APEX2 or TurboID which need only 1-10 minutes. Future generations of LaccID may benefit from directed evolution in mammalian cells, which have different glycosylation and copper insertion machinery than yeast. In addition, selection in the presence of serum, halides, and thiols could help to enrich variants that are tolerant to those additives. Our current LaccID did not exhibit activity in living fly brain tissue, but an improved version with in vivo activity would open the door to many PL applications.</p><p id="P35">Apart from LaccID, several antibody-based, non-genetically-encoded methods have recently been reported for mapping cell surface proteomes in culture.

Yeast cells were washed three times more in cold PBS-B by pelleting at 3,000x<italic>g</italic> for 2 min at 4 °C and resuspending in 1 ml cold PBS-B. Yeast cells were stained in 50 μL of PBS-B containing anti-Myc antibody (1:400) for 1 h at 4 °C for detecting enzyme expression, then the cells were washed three more times and stained in 50 μL of PBS-B with goat anti-chicken-AF488 and SA-PE for 40 min at 4 °C. Samples were washed for the final three times with 1 ml PBS-B before analysis or sorting. To analyze and sort, single yeast cells were gated on a forward-scatter area (FSC-A) by side-scatter area (SSC-A) plot around the clustered population (P1) on a ZE5 Cell Analyzer (Bio-Rad). P1 was then gated on a side-scatter width (SSC-W) by side-scatter height (SSC-H) plot around the clustered population (P2). P2 populated cells were then plotted to detect AF488 and phycoerythrin signals.

Next, proteins were treated with 3C-HRV protease (Genescript, #Z03092) overnight at 4ºC without shaking according to manufacturer instructions. The following day, Ni-NTA resin equilibrated in buffer A was added over the cleaved laccase samples and incubated at 25 ºC and 1,000 rpm in a thermomixer comfort shaker (Eppendorf) for 4 hours.

C18 StageTips were conditioned sequentially with 100 μl of 100% methanol (MeOH), 100 μl of 50% (vol/vol) acetonitrile (MeCN) with 0.1% (vol/vol) FA, and two washes of 100uL of 0.1% (v/v) FA. Acidified peptides were loaded onto the C18 StageTips and washed twice with 100 μl of 0.1% FA. The peptides were then eluted from the C18 resin using 50 μl of 50% MeCN/ 0.1% FA. The desalted peptide samples were snap-frozen and vacuum-centrifuged until completely dry.</p></sec><sec id="S45"><title>TMT labeling and fractionation</title><p id="P104">Desalted peptides were labeled with TMTpro reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each peptide sample was resuspended in 80 μL of 50 mM HEPES and labeled with 20 μl of the 25 ug/uL TMT reagents in MeCN. The samples were then incubated at RT for 1 hour while shaking at 1000 rpm. To quench the TMT-labeling reaction, 4 μL of 5% hydroxylamine was added to each sample, followed by a 15-minute incubation at RT with shaking. TMT-labeled samples were combined and vacuum-centrifuged to dry. The samples were then reconstituted in 200 μL of 0.1% FA and desalted on a C18 StageTips using the previously described protocol. The desalted TMT-labeled combined sample was then dried to completion.</p><p id="P105">The combined TMT-labeled peptide sample was fractionated by basic reverse phase (bRP) fractionation using an in-house packed SDB-RPS (3M) StageTip. The SDB-RPS StageTip was first conditioned sequentially with 100 μL of 100% MeOH, 100 μL 50% MeCN/0.1% FA, and two washes of 100 μL 0.1% FA. The peptide sample was reconstituted in 0.1% FA and loaded onto the SDB-RPS StageTip. Peptides were then eluted from the StageTip in eight fractions using 20 mM ammonium formate buffers with increasing (vol/vol) concentrations of MeCN (5%, 7.5%, 10%, 12.5%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 45%). The eight fractions were then dried down to completion.</p></sec><sec id="S46"><title>Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry</title><p id="P106">All peptide samples were separated and analyzed on an online liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system, consisting of a Vanquish Neo UPHLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All peptide fractions were reconstituted in 9 μl of 3% MeCN/ 0.1% FA. 4 μl of each fraction was injected onto a microcapillary column (Picofrit with 10 µm tip opening / 75 µm diameter, New Objective, PF360-75-10-N-5), packed in-house with 30 cm of C18 silica material (1.5 µm ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ medium, Dr. Maisch GmbH, r119.aq) and heated to 50 °C using column heater sleeves (PhoenixST). Peptides were eluted into the Orbitrap Exploris 480 at a flow rate of 200 nL/min. The bRP fractions were run on a 110min-method, including a linear 84 min gradient from 94.6% solvent A (0.1% formic acid) to 27% solvent B (99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid), followed by a linear 9 min gradient from 27% solvent B to 54% solvent B.</p><p id="P107">Mass spectrometry was conducted using a data-dependent acquisition mode, where MS1 spectra were measured with a resolution of 60,000, a normalized AGC target of 300%, and a mass range from 350 to 1800 m/z. MS2 spectra were acquired for the top 20 most abundant ions per cycle at a resolution of 45,000, an AGC target of 30%, an isolation window of 0.7 m/z and a normalized collision energy of 34.

Spectra within a precursor mass range of 600-6000 Da with a minimum MS1 signal-to-noise ratio of 25 were retained. Additionally, MS1 spectra within a retention time range of +/- 45 s, or within a precursor m/z tolerance of +/- 1.4 m/z were merged. MS/MS searching was performed against a human Uniprot database, released on September 02, 2021, supplemented with the sequence of LaccID to track its expression across samples. For searching, the full-mix function of the TMTpro modification with the fixed modification of carbamidomethylation on cysteine were used. Variable modifications included acetylation of the protein N-terminus, oxidation of methionine, cyclization to pyroglutamic acid, and N-term deamidation. Digestion parameters were set to “trypsin allow P” with an allowance of 4 missed cleavages. The matching tolerances were set with a minimum matched peak intensity of 30%, precursor and product mass tolerance of +/- 20 ppm, and a maximum ambiguous precursor charge of 3.</p><p id="P109">Peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) were validated with a maximum false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 1.2% for precursor charges ranging from +2 to +6. A target protein score of 0 was applied during protein polishing autovalidation to further filter PSMs. TMTpro reporter ion intensities were corrected for isotopic impurities using the afRICA correction method in the Spectrum Mill protein/peptide summary module, which utilizes determinant calculations according to Cramer’s Rule.
