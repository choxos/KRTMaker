Many of the most common cancers, including prostate, endometrial, cervical, bladder, intestinal, and pancreatic, occur within the abdomen and pelvis and are treated with localised RT as part of the treatment plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Despite the effectiveness of RT in local tumour control, the effects on surrounding normal healthy tissues, particularly the intestines can result in severe acute and late toxicity. This radiation-induced injury often leads to severe complications, with acute intestinal toxicity affecting around 90% of patients either during treatment or shortly after (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P5">RT-induced intestinal toxicity is often debilitating, manifesting as symptoms such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, and rectal bleeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). These symptoms primarily result from damage to the intestinal epithelium, which subsequently compromises the integrity of the intestinal barrier and triggers inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Radiation-induced damage to healthy intestinal tissue also limits the total therapeutic dose of RT that can be safely administered and may thus compromise local tumour control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Despite the prevalence of these side-effects, the underlying mechanisms of RT-induced intestinal toxicity remain poorly understood and underexplored. Additionally, there are currently no effective treatments for these complications, representing a significant clinical unmet need.</p><p id="P6">Investigation of the transcriptional response following RT-induced intestinal injury has revealed an association between immune cell populations, including macrophages and monocytes, with this injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). However, the role that immune cells play, and the molecular mechanisms and signals governing their recruitment and function during the response of healthy intestinal tissue to localised RT, remains unclear. Chemokines, which are critical regulators of leukocyte recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), may play a significant role in this process. The role of chemokines in tumour biology is well studied, however the potential role of chemokines in orchestrating RT-induced intestinal tissue toxicity remains ill-defined.</p><p id="P7">To address this gap, we developed a preclinical murine model of RT-induced intestinal toxicity, with a focus on the role of chemokine-mediated immune cell recruitment. Using this model, we demonstrated that the chemokine-mediated recruitment of specific innate immune cells, protects mice from intestinal injury following RT. Specifically, CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes are critical for protection against radiation-induced intestinal damage, with CCR2-deficient mice displaying increased sensitivity to radiation, reflected by more severe weight loss and compromised intestinal barrier function. Moreover, adoptive transfer of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes into CCR2-deficient mice rescues these animals from radiation-induced weight loss and intestinal permeability, underscoring the protective function of this monocyte recruitment.</p><p id="P8">Our findings establish a direct link between chemokine-mediated monocyte recruitment and protection against RT-induced intestinal injury. Importantly, we also identified a novel mechanism through which CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes exert their protective effect, by promoting IL-17 production by group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), which is crucial for maintaining intestinal barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). These mechanistic insights potentially open new avenues for therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment or targeting IL-17 production to alleviate RT-induced intestinal toxicity and improve cancer patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Establishment of a localised RT-induced intestinal toxicity model</title><p id="P9">RT-induced damage to healthy tissues in cancer treatment leads to toxicity and is associated with the activation of an immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). To investigate the role of the immune system in regulating RT-induced toxicity, we developed a mouse model of localised intestinal RT, utilising the small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) to deliver computed tomography (CT)-scan image-guided precise X-ray irradiation. Here, the radiation field was delivered by a 10mm<sup>2</sup> collimator, ensuring the radiation dose was restricted to the intestines, sparing the bone marrow and other major organs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). This targeted approach to the intestines contrasts with previous studies that have generally utilised total body irradiation alone or that have used limited lead shielding that is much likely to produce RT induced systemic effects distal to the targeted intestines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To determine the accuracy and localisation of RT dose delivery we used cone beam imaging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) and confirmed the accuracy by analysing the level and localisation of γH2AX staining, a marker of double-stranded DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), at 6 hours post-RT. Irradiation resulted in significant DNA damage, as evidenced by enhanced γH2AX levels in the small intestines and proximal large intestines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-C</xref>). In contrast, non-irradiated control mice (sham) exhibited minimal DNA damage. γH2AX levels were notably higher in the proximal large intestines, which were within the radiation field, compared to the distal large intestines, which was outside the irradiation field and showed expression levels similar to sham mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). These data confirm the precision of our SARRP approach, with minimal scatter radiation outside the targeted area.</p><p id="P11">We next assessed whether the localised delivery of RT in our model resulted in tissue damage and associated toxicity. A single 12 Gy fraction of localised RT caused acute body weight loss in mice, peaking at day 6 post-irradiation, with full recovery back to baseline levels by day 8 post-RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>). To assess the impact of RT on intestinal barrier integrity, we measured faecal albumin levels, a well-established marker of intestinal permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). 7 days post-irradiation, faecal albumin concentrations were significantly greater in irradiated mice compared to sham-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>), indicating that localised RT compromises intestinal barrier function.</p><p id="P12">We further investigated the effects of radiation on the highly proliferative crypt cells, damage to which has previously been associated with RT-induced intestinal toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Sections of the small intestine were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and the intestinal epithelium was analysed. H&amp;E staining of small intestine sections revealed significant epithelial damage, with a marked loss of crypts at day 7 post-irradiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-B</xref>). These findings confirm that our preclinical model successfully replicates RT-induced intestinal toxicity, as evidenced by weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>), increased gut permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref>), and damage to the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-B</xref>) following a 12 Gy dose of abdominal irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Local intestinal RT induces an acute innate immune response in the small intestine</title><p id="P13">The RT-induced host immune response appears to be a key driver of intestinal epithelial injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). However, whether the intestinal toxicity observed after localised intestinal RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F- G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-B</xref>) is immune-mediated, and the immune cells involved, is not known. To address the potential role of the immune response in promoting RT-induced acute intestinal injury, we initially performed unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of CD45<sup>+</sup> and CD45<sup>-</sup> cells from the small intestine, at rest and 5 days post-RT. This approach produced a comprehensive cell atlas, encompassing a diverse range of stromal and immune cell populations in both resting and post-RT conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Examination of cell proportions revealed an expansion of macrophage populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>), particularly within macrophage clusters 1, 2, and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Notably, the macrophage 3 cluster exhibited significant transcriptional changes in response to RT, with numerous genes differentially expressed following irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), as has been recently observed in radiation-induced salivary gland injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Specifically, cells in macrophage cluster 3 up-regulated the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β following RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) and the highest expression of the neutrophil recruiting pro-inflammatory chemokines <italic>Cxcl2</italic> and <italic>Cxcl3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). In contrast, macrophage clusters 1, 2 and 4 displayed no significant changes in gene expression after RT. Interestingly, the macrophage 2 cluster had the highest expression of <italic>Ccr2</italic>, indicating that this population likely contains macrophages recently differentiated from monocytes recruited from the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) term analysis of the different macrophage subtypes highlighted a range of GO terms associated with these populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B-E</xref>). In particular, terms associated with immune cell migration, function and chemotaxis. This is supported by the expression analysis of chemokine ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>) and receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>) by macrophages and across multiple cell types in the atlas post-RT.</p><p id="P15">Given the changes observed in innate immune cells from scRNA-seq, we used flow cytometry to fully characterise the numbers and phenotypes of innate immune cells over time, at 2, 5-, 7-, 14-, and 29-days post-RT (gating strategy in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Crucially this approach enabled analysis of cells that are not always captured by scRNAseq, such as neutrophils and eosinophils. Flow cytometry revealed significant increases in the levels of eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils within the small intestine at day 7 post-RT, with levels returning to baseline by day 14 post-RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To assess the potential clinical relevance of these immune changes, we analysed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma from bladder cancer patients treated with abdomino-pelvic RT (gating strategy in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). Human plasma analysis revealed elevated levels of the monocyte recruiting chemokine CCL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis of human PBMCs demonstrated increased levels of monocytes (CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>)) in bladder cancer patients treated with RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>). This observation was mimicked in our preclinical model with elevated blood monocytes at day 7 post-RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). Together, the elevated circulating monocyte and CCL2 levels observed in these patients are indicative that RT induces innate immune cell mobilisation from the bone marrow and recruitment to tissues. This data confirms that RT leads to immune cell recruitment in preclinical models and likely also in human patients.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The inability to recruit innate immune cells increases susceptibility to RT-induced intestinal toxicities</title><p id="P17">Having observed chemokine production and immune cell recruitment in irradiated tissues, we interrogated the importance of chemokine-driven innate immune cell recruitment in modulating RT-induced intestinal toxicity. We hypothesised that the accumulation of innate immune cells would promote or exacerbate RT-induced intestinal damage. To test this, we used a mouse model deficient in the inflammatory chemokine receptor (iCCR) cluster, which includes the genes encoding <italic>Ccr1</italic>, <italic>Ccr2</italic>, <italic>Ccr3</italic>, and <italic>Ccr5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We have previously established that these receptors control the recruitment of several innate immune cells including monocytes and eosinophils, but not neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis of the small intestine revealed that a lack of iCCRs results in an inability to recruit Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), eosinophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), and a reduction in the number of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>) at acute time points post-RT with no effect on the level of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Contrary to our hypothesis that enhanced immune cell recruitment would promote RT-induced toxicity, iCCR<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which had reduced innate cell recruitment to the intestine, were more susceptible to RT-induced toxicities, experiencing greater weight loss than the irradiated littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>), with ~80% of iCCR<sup>-/-</sup> mice reaching their humane endpoint by 7 days post-RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Furthermore, irradiated mice deficient in the iCCRs displayed higher faecal albumin levels than the irradiated wild-type (WT) controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H</xref>), indicating increased intestinal permeability. These findings suggest that iCCR-driven innate immune cell recruitment plays a protective role against RT-induced intestinal toxicities.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Localised RT induces changes in immune cell iCCR expression</title><p id="P19">Having demonstrated the collective importance of iCCR (CCR1, 2, 3 and 5) receptors in RT-induced toxicity, we next aimed to determine which specific iCCR receptors contribute to this protective function. Firstly, we analysed iCCR expression using the newly developed iCCR reporter mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). In agreement with our previous data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), irradiation of these mice induced significant increases in eosinophil, neutrophil, monocyte, and macrophage levels in the small intestine at 7 days post 12 Gy RT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>). Notably, a substantial increase in the proportion of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes expressing CCR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B-C</xref>), eosinophils expressing CCR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D-E</xref>) and macrophages positive for CCR2 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F-G</xref>), at day 7 post-RT. In contrast, there was no significant upregulation of CCR1, 2, 3, or 5 expression post-RT by neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H-I</xref>), suggesting that neutrophil recruitment is likely mediated via other known chemokine receptors and/or non-chemokine mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Together with the iCCR<sup>-/-</sup> data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), these data suggest that chemokine-dependent recruitment of monocyte and/or eosinophil may be protective following local intestinal RT.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>CCR2-driven monocyte recruitment is protective against RT-induced toxicities</title><p id="P20">With recent literature suggesting potential protective roles of CCR2<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes during inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), we examined the importance and function of monocytes, in the context of RT. To this end, we utilised CCR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice which have impaired monocyte egress from bone marrow, resulting in reduced monocytes and macrophage populations in the blood and intestines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). As expected, CCR2 deficiency severely impaired monocyte recruitment after RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A-B</xref>), and in turn, lead to a reduced macrophage population in comparison to irradiated WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C-D</xref>), whereas neutrophil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>) and eosinophil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>) recruitment remained unaffected.</p><p id="P21">Strikingly, CCR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed more pronounced weight loss compared to irradiated WT controls, particularly between day 5 to day 7 post-RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>), akin to iCCR<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Additionally, CCR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed exacerbated faecal albumin levels, indicating increased intestinal permeability, similar to iCCR<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5H</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes play a crucial role in limiting intestinal toxicity following RT.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Adoptive monocyte transfer rescues RT-induced intestinal toxicities</title><p id="P22">To directly test whether CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes have a protective effect in limiting RT-induced gut toxicity, we performed adoptive transfer of monocytes into CCR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice.

Previous literature has suggested that CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocyte-derived macrophages can regulate intestinal immune responses via effects on ILC3s, including via production of IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). As described earlier, analysis of our scRNAseq data demonstrated that macrophages in the small intestine upregulated transcription of IL-1β in response to RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). In agreement with these results, analysis of small intestine lysates showed significant increases in IL-1β at the protein level following intestinal RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). As IL-1β production by macrophages has been shown to regulate IL-17A and IL-22 production by ILC3s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), and these cytokines can play important roles in promoting intestinal repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), we next assessed the production of these molecules by ILC3s in RT-treated WT and CCR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice by flow cytometry (gating strategy depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9A</xref>).

Currently, no effective therapies exist to mitigate the acute and chronic gastrointestinal toxicities associated with RT, underscoring an urgent unmet clinical need to investigate the underlying mechanisms and to develop effective targeted therapeutic interventions.</p><p id="P28">In this study, we established a localised pre-clinical mouse model of intestinal irradiation that produces hallmark symptoms of RT-induced intestinal toxicity, such as weight loss, increased intestinal permeability, and intestinal epithelial damage. Analysis of this model revealed that innate immune cells rapidly infiltrate the irradiated small intestine, in agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). In addition, our results demonstrate that monocyte and eosinophil recruitment is driven by CCR1, 2, 3 and 5, as previously suggested in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>).

These findings advance our understanding of monocyte recruitment and offer novel therapeutic targets to potentially modify RT-induced intestinal inflammation.</p><p id="P29">Our data demonstrates that CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment plays a critical role in limiting RT-induced toxicity (weight loss and intestinal barrier integrity). These results are in agreement with emerging evidence highlighting the roles of CCR2<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes in various inflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). However, when considering the therapeutic manipulation of monocyte recruitment to reduce acute and late intestinal toxicity it is also important to consider the potential role of chemokines and the recruited immune cells in the tumour and how this may alter the therapeutic index of RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). For example, inhibition of the monocyte chemokine receptors CCR2 and 5 has previously been shown to limit radiation-induced monocyte infiltration to pancreatic adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). This inhibition resulted in improved tumour control and mouse survival when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Indeed, inhibition of CCR2 and monocyte recruitment is generally considered to be beneficial for reducing tumour burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Despite the range of preclinical studies suggesting the beneficial outcome of inhibiting CCR2 in different tumour models, human cancer clinical trials failed to produce improved cancer outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). The reasons behind the failure of CCR2 inhibition to influence clinical practice are likely to be complex and include the requirement for ongoing therapeutic intervention with CCR2 inhibition and the inevitable repopulation of these immune subsets once the therapy intervention is stopped. Our study provides additional insights into how potentially CCR2 inhibition may also have adverse effects on healthy tissues, decreasing the therapeutic index by increasing RT-induced toxicity. However, in contrast to ongoing protracted use of CCR2 inhibition for tumour control, promoting monocyte recruitment to decrease radiation induced intestinal injury may only be required for the limited period of the RT delivery. Together these findings suggest that any manipulation of chemokine receptors needs to be carefully considered in enhancing the therapeutic ratio to improve tumour control and decrease normal tissue toxicity.</p><p id="P30">To understand how monocyte recruitment plays a protective role in response to RT we also investigated potential cellular and molecular mechanisms known to be linked to CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes and regulation of intestinal inflammation. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, released by blood monocytes and intestinal macrophages, is crucial for tissue repair and host defence following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). We demonstrated an increase in the protein level of this cytokine in the small intestine and increased transcription by an inflammatory macrophage subset in response to RT. IL-1β has previously been shown to stimulate the production of IL-17 and IL-22 by ILC3s, cytokines that regulate intestinal barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). We demonstrated that IL-17 and IL-22 secretion by CCR6<sup>+</sup> ILC3s was regulated by CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Given the established role for IL-17 and IL-22 in regulating the integrity of the intestinal barrier following infection and injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), including in response to RT-induced injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), we propose that RT-induced infiltrating monocytes play a key role in ILC3-mediated repair of the intestinal epithelium. These findings underscore the importance of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocyte infiltration and differentiation in protecting against radiation-induced intestinal injury. Furthermore, our data also challenge previous suggestions that targeting the IL-17 axis may be useful in improving outcomes to RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>).</p><p id="P31">In conclusion, through the development of a highly targeted pre-clinical model of RT-induced intestinal toxicity, our findings uncover a critical protective role for Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes in mitigating radiation-induced intestinal toxicity. The recruitment of these monocytes by CCR2 and their subsequent effect on ILC3s may be key mechanisms underlying this intestinal protection. These results suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment or promoting ILC3 function in non-cancer tissues may represent promising approaches for reducing the major unmet clinical need of RT-induced intestinal injury.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Mice</title><p id="P32">Up to 5 mice aged between 9 and 16 weeks were housed in individually ventilated cages at the University of Manchester, under specific pathogen-free conditions, standard chow, and water provided ad libitum, constant temperature, and a 12-hour light and dark cycle.

Finally, a cluster was assigned a cell-type identity if over 60% of cells in that cluster shared the same annotation; those clusters that did not meet this criterion were removed from further consideration.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>scRNA-seq data analysis - differential expression analysis</title><p id="P56">Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed with the FindMarkers or FindAllMarkers function within Seurat. For identifying discriminatory cell markers between-clusters, the FindAllMarkers function was used, and only cluster-enriched genes were retained. To identify DEGs within the same clusters but across experimental conditions; cells were first pseudo-bulked through aggregation of counts with AggregateExpression and conditions compared using FindMarkers() with DESeq2 as the test mode.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>scRNA-seq data analysis - over-representation analysis</title><p id="P57">Differentially expressed genes were used for over-representation analysis (ORA) of gene ontology terms <italic>via</italic> the ClusterProfiler package (enrichGO). For cluster-specific annotations, DEGs passing a 5% p-adjusted value in conjunction with a Log2 fold-change greater than 0.5 were used. For condition-comparisons; DEGs that passed a 5% p-adjusted threshold were accepted.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Statistics</title><p id="P58">All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism, v10.1.2 (GraphPad Software). Data was analysed to determine normal distribution according to a variety of normality tests including the Anderson-Darling test, D’Agostino and Pearson test, Shapiro-Wilk test, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. This outcome determined subsequent analysis. All normally distributed data was analysed using unpaired parametric student’s t-test (comparison of only two groups), a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (comparison of 3 or more groups with one independent variable) with Dunnets multiple comparison test, or a two-way ANOVA (comparison of more than two groups with two independent variables). When not normally distributed, data was analysed using unpaired nonparametric student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA using the Kruskal Wallis test with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. Results from these tests were reported as significant if the P was ≤ 0.05, with results in graphs shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD). In figures, *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001 and ****P &lt; 0.0001.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary information</label><media xlink:href="EMS199992-supplement-Supplementary_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d137aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S33"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge members of the Dyer lab, the Targeted Therapy Group (including Dr Shuhui Cheng, Phil Jones and Lisa Cooper) and the Radiotherapy Network (RadNet) team for critical discussion and processing and analysis of clinical samples.

Within the tissues, Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes differentiate into intestinal macrophages which are known to secrete IL-1β. This increase in IL-1β, production can, in turn, activate ILC3 to produce the cytokines, IL-17 and IL-22, key in regulation of the intestinal barrier. However, CCR2 deficient mice lack the infiltration of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes into the small intestine, impacting macrophage numbers. This results in decreased ILC3 production of IL-17, leading to an increase in intestinal barrier permeability. Dysregulation of intestinal epithelial barrier permeability may result in increased translocation of commensal and pathogenic microbes.
