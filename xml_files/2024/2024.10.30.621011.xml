Epidemiological and animal studies have demonstrated that maternal immune activation (MIA) disrupts brain development, leading to impaired neurogenesis and increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which MIA impacts human cortical development remain poorly understood. Here we introduce a 3D ex vivo culture system, termed ‘cerebroids,’ derived from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of human fetal brain tissue, which faithfully preserves key developmental processes, along with critical cellular diversity and structural integrity of the developing human cortex. Using this platform, we show that IL-17A, a cytokine strongly implicated in NDDs, induces premature cortical folding, increases cortical thickness, and accelerates neurogenesis and neuronal maturation. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal significant dysregulation of ECM-related pathways, including the upregulation of proteoglycans such as brevican and versican. Notably, treatment with the anti-inflammatory agent parthenolide, an inhibitor of NF-κB and HDAC1 pathways, reverses IL-17A-induced cortical abnormalities, restoring normal cortical thickness, folding, and neurogenesis. These findings provide valuable insights into how IL-17A disrupts human cortical development during MIA, advancing our understanding of NDD-associated structural cortical alterations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">A growing body of evidence from epidemiological studies has demonstrated that maternal immune activation (MIA) significantly increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia, in offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).

Despite these findings, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the inflammatory environment in utero alters the developmental trajectory of the human cortex, leading to such structural and functional abnormalities, remain poorly understood.</p><p id="P3">Human pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived brain organoids offer a valuable platform for investigating human-specific aspects of developmental disturbances caused by genetic and environmental insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). However, the absence of immune and vascular components in these organoid models restricts their use, particularly in modeling MIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Ex vivo models using primary human tissue provide a more accurate representation of brain development, but conventional slice cultures are limited by low throughput and scalability issues. To address this critical gap, we have developed a high-throughput ex vivo three-dimensional (3D) culture system, called ‘cerebroids’, using human fetal brain tissue.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Establishment and validation of a 3D ex vivo culture of human fetal brain</title><p id="P4">To establish the 3D ex vivo culture system of the human fetal brain, we dissected the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from healthy fetal brain tissues at 11-14 gestational weeks (GW), a critical period of active neurogenesis in the developing cortex (11) and when MIA is most strongly associated with an increased risk of NDDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1, A and B, table S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The tissue was cut into approximately 10 mm<sup>2</sup> pieces, ensuring that each section retained intact architecture from the ventricular surface to the pial surface. These pieces were cultured in a free-floating manner on an orbital shaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1, C and D</xref>). This culture method preserves the structural integrity of the tissue and provides versatility for multiple downstream applications, including immunofluorescence staining on cryosections and comprehensive multiomics analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S1E</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The cytoarchitecture and apical-basal polarity of cells in the developing brain, particularly neural stem cells (NSCs) are critical for the proper developmental trajectory of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Cerebroids cultured for 8 and 15 days retained the organized layers of SOX2<sup>+</sup> NSCs, TBR2<sup>+</sup> intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) and CTIP2<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1B</xref>). The proper apical-basal polarity of NSCs and the integrity of their processes were confirmed by adenovirus-mediated GFP labelling of NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>), Nestin and GFAP immunostaining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2, A and B</xref>), as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S2, C to E</xref>). Notably, unlike cortical organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), the expression pattern of GFAP in NSCs within cerebroids was comparable to that of acutely fixed fetal tissue. The integrity of apical junctions in NSCs was verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1, D to F</xref>). Optimal culture conditions that ensure proper proliferation rate of NSCs are crucial for maintaining the polarity between the ventricular and cortical surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In cerebroids, NSCs exhibited a proliferative capacity comparable to that of acutely fixed fetal cortex, as demonstrated by Ki67 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, G and H</xref>). Furthermore, the capacity of NSCs to generate IPCs and neurons was confirmed through EdU pulse-chase experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, I to L</xref>). Mitotic nuclei of NSCs (pH3+) were also observed near the ventricular surface, mirroring the behavior of NSCs undergoing interkinetic nuclear migration during cell division in the developing cortex. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>). Next, we verified the presence of different cell types in cerebroids including HOPX<sup>+</sup> or PTPRZ1<sup>+</sup> outer radial glial cells, CTIP2<sup>+</sup> or SATB2<sup>+</sup> neurons, S100β<sup>+</sup> or Olig2<sup>+</sup> macroglia precursor cells, and IBA1<sup>+</sup>/CD68<sup>+</sup> microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3, A to C</xref>). We also confirmed the presence of vascular structures containing endothelial cells and pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1, T to U</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S3, D to H</xref>).</p><p id="P6">The extracellular matrix (ECM) creates a dynamic environment that facilitates interactions among various cell types by modulating the diffusion and distribution of signaling molecules. It is also involved in the regulation of central developmental processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). We confirmed that cerebroids maintain key components of the ECM in the developing cortex, such as heparan sulfate, brevican, chondroitin sulfate, collagens, and ECM-associated protein Reelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1, V to Z</xref>). Importantly, cerebroids, in contrast to iPSCs-derived cortical organoids, showed expression patterns of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate that were comparable to acutely fixed fetal tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S4, A and B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Together, these findings demonstrate that cerebroids offer a robust platform that preserves key cellular architecture, along with immune, vascular, and essential ECM components, enabling the study of both healthy neurodevelopment and disruptions caused by environmental factors.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Abnormal cortical development mediated by IL-17A</title><p id="P8">Emerging evidence links IL-17A to NDDs. Elevated levels of IL-17A are correlated with ASD severity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) and genetic variations in the IL17A gene have been identified in ASD cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). In animal models, IL-17A mediates MIA-induced autism-like behaviors and cortical abnormalities, which can be prevented by blocking IL-17A activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). To further explore the impact of IL-17A during MIA in cortical development (for additional rationale on using IL-17A to model MIA, see the Supplementary Text), we utilized cerebroids from GW 11-14 fetal brain tissues. Transcriptomic analysis of RNA-sequencing data from microglia/brain associated macrophages (BAM) isolated from cerebroids revealed that IL-17A treatment in culture activated various inflammation-related pathways, such as TLR, TNF, and NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). All donors used in this study exhibited comparable baseline inflammatory states, as determined by transcriptomic analysis of inflammatory markers in placental tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S5</xref>). IL-17A-treated cerebroids showed premature induction of cortical folding at 8 days ex vivo and the folding phenotype became more prominent at 15 days ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6, A and B</xref>). SEM imaging further confirmed alterations in the cortical surface structure of IL-17A-treated cerebroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). To measure the degree of folding, we calculated the gyrification index (GI), the ratio of the fiducial surface length to the convex hull length, and it was found that IL-17A-treated cerebroids exhibited increased GI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6C</xref>). Moreover, IL-17A-treated cerebroids exhibited a significant increase in overall thickness, which was observed across all three cortical layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, E and G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6, D to F</xref>). Particularly, the IZ/SP (layer 2) showed reduction in cell density, suggesting a potential expansion of ECM in IL-17A-treated cerebroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Next, we investigated which cell types contributed to the increased thickness. The number of CTIP2<sup>+</sup> deep layer neurons was significantly higher in IL-17A-treated cerebroids, while no significant difference was observed in the number of SOX2<sup>+</sup> NSCs or TBR2<sup>+</sup> IPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, H and I</xref>). Additionally, IL-17A treatment increased the number of SATB2<sup>+</sup> upper layer neurons and NeuN<sup>+</sup> mature neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2, J to N</xref>), suggesting accelerated neuronal maturation in IL-17A-treated cerebroids. The increased number of excitatory neurons induced by IL-17A is consistent with previous findings from studies modeling MIA using IL-6 in human dorsal forebrain organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). To further confirm this, we treated neurons differentiated from iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) with IL-17A and performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. IL-17A-treated neurons exhibited increased spontaneous neuronal activity, further supporting enhanced maturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S7, A to C</xref>). Premature cortical folding, increased cortical thickness, and accelerated neuronal maturation mirror clinical observations in some individuals with ASD, including macrocephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), an increased number of prefrontal cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), and enhanced cortical folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Enhanced neurogenesis by IL-17A</title><p id="P9">To identify the cellular mechanisms underlying abnormal cortical development, we examined the acute impact of IL-17A on NSCs. To determine whether the increased number of CTIP2<sup>+</sup> neurons in IL-17A-treated cerebroids was due to elevated nascent neurogenesis, we conducted an EdU pulse-chase experiment. Following a 2-hour pulse and 48-hour chase, we observed a higher number of EdU<sup>+</sup>CTIP2<sup>+</sup> neurons in IL-17A treated cerebroids, suggesting that IL-17A increases nascent neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, A to C</xref>). This phenotype was driven by an increased generation of TBR2<sup>+</sup> IPCs, as we observed a higher number of EdU<sup>+</sup>TBR2<sup>+</sup> cells in IL-17A treated cerebroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, D and E</xref>). The prolonged course of neurogenesis is a key factor in cortical expansion in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), and premature differentiation of neural progenitors into neurons can deplete the progenitor pool, resulting in reduced neuronal numbers and often leading to a microcephaly phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Although we detected more EdU-labelled CTIP2<sup>+</sup> neurons and TBR2<sup>+</sup> IPCs in IL-17A-treated cerebroids, the number of EdU<sup>+</sup> SOX2<sup>+</sup> NSCs remained comparable between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, D and F</xref>), suggesting that enhanced neurogenesis was accompanied by increased proliferation and replenishment of the NSC population. Notably, while no difference in the number of Ki67<sup>+</sup> proliferating NSCs was found between vehicle and IL-17A-treated groups, a greater number of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells and EdU<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in IL-17A-treated cerebroids, indicating that a higher number of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells reentered the cell cycle. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, G to J</xref>). To further support the observation of increased neurogenesis induced by IL-17A, iPSC-derived cortical organoids were treated with IL-17A. Consistent with findings in cerebroids, the number of CTIP2<sup>+</sup> neurons was increased in the IL-17A-treated organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, K to M</xref>). However, we did not observe a cortical folding phenotype in IL-17A-treated organoids, suggesting that ECM components and cell types absent in organoids may be crucial in mediating this phenotype. Additionally, IL-17A-treatment of iPSC-derived NPCs resulted in accelerated neurogenesis, as shown by an increased number of MAP2<sup>+</sup> cells in the IL-17A-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3, N to P</xref>). These findings from our organoid and NPC experiments suggest that the increased neurogenesis induced by IL-17A is due to a direct effect on NSCs, rather than being mediated by microglia-driven immune responses. This contrasts with recent findings in mice, where transcriptomic changes in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells in response to MIA were shown to require microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Remodeling of ECM induced by IL-17A</title><p id="P10">To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying abnormal cortical development, we performed bulk RNA-sequencing on whole cerebroids, as well as on three isolated cell populations: microglia/BAM, neuron-lineage committed cells (NLCCs), and NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). The cellular identities of these isolated populations were confirmed by expression levels of marker genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S8A</xref>). When comparing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between vehicle-treated control and IL-17A-treated cerebroids, we identified five common categories of DEGs, including pathways related to epigenetic regulation/Sin-HDAC complex, TNF/NF-kB signaling, ECM and ECM-related glycosylation, energy metabolism, and WNT signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, B to E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S8B</xref>). While each population exhibited distinct Reactome pathway alterations, ECM-related pathways were consistently enriched across all cell types analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S8B, fig. S9, A and B, fig. S10, fig. S11</xref>). Specifically, in NLCCs, IL-17A upregulated genes involved in ECM remodeling processes, including <italic>THBS2, THBS1, COL4A2, COL11A2, LAMA2, DSEL</italic>, and <italic>COL9A2</italic>, which are associated with integrin cell surface interactions, ECM degradation, collagen degradation, and collagen chain trimerization in Reactome enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Mounting evidence shows that mitochondrial dynamics significantly influence cellular metabolism and shape the behavior of NSCs during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Notably, mitochondria-related metabolic pathways were uniquely enriched in the Reactome pathway analysis of NSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S11</xref>), suggesting that altered mitochondria dynamics induced by IL-17A may contribute to the increased neurogenesis.</p><p id="P11">Moreover, many DEGs in IL-17A-treated cerebroids were associated with neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S12</xref>), suggesting that IL-17A may dysregulate shared pathways involved in these conditions. We further conducted a meta-analysis of transcriptomic data from post-mortem brains of individuals with ASD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S13</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Enrichment analysis revealed that many upregulated genes are linked to ECM components, reinforcing the significance of the ECM in the pathogenesis of NDDs.</p><p id="P12">To examine the ECM alterations induced by IL-17A, we performed mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis from three different protein fractions based on the solubility and complexity of proteins: CHAPS fraction, containing cellular proteins, the soluble ECM (sECM) fraction and insoluble ECM (iECM) fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S14A</xref>). We observed more than four hundred differentially abundant sECM and iECM proteins in IL-17A treated cerebroids. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, H to J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S14B</xref>). Protein-protein interaction network analysis of differentially abundant proteins in the CHAPS fraction of IL-17A-treated cerebroids revealed host-pathogen interaction of virus and IL-17A mediated signaling pathways, highlighting the activation of immune responses by IL-17A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S15</xref>). In the iECM fraction of IL-17A-treated cerebroids, two key chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, brevican (BCAN) and versican (VCAN), were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J</xref>). BCAN is a major proteoglycan in the brain’s ECM, playing critical roles in neural development, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). VCAN contributes to the structural integrity of the developing ECM and is involved in cell proliferation, migration, and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Both BCAN and VCAN bind to hyaluronic acid, a key ECM component that regulates cortical folding, cell migration, proliferation, axon guidance, and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Hyaluronic acid binding was also highlighted in the protein-protein interaction network in the iECM fraction of IL-17A-treated cerebroids, along with intermediate filament organization and processing of DNA double-strand break ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4K</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The altered proteoglycan expression was visualized using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), showing increased perineuronal net immunoreactivity in IL-17A-treated cerebroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S16A</xref>). Additionally, chondroitin sulfate immunoreactivity was elevated at the sites of cortical folding in IL-17A-treated cerebroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4M</xref>), aligning with evidence implicating the ECM in cortical folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). TEM further confirmed the presence of increased glycosaminoglycan-containing proteoglycans at the folding sites at the ultrastructural level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4, N and O</xref>). These findings suggest a strong association between altered ECM composition and IL-17A-induced cortical folding. We also observed that expression of BCAN was heightened in ventricular zones of IL-17A treated cerebroids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S16B</xref>). These alterations in ECM components are particularly significant considering recent findings showing increased BCAN and VCAN expression in postmortem brains of children with ASD, with BCAN specifically elevated in astrocytes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Reversed abnormal cortical development by Parthenolide</title><p id="P14">To further investigate the molecular pathways mediating the abnormal cortical development induced by IL-17A during MIA, we identified key transcriptional regulators modulating the expression of DEGs from our RNA sequencing analysis. Among the many transcriptional regulators, five - HDAC1, NFKB1, REL, RELA, and SPI1 - were found to be shared across at least two different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Parthenolide (PTL) is a known inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway, through its suppression of IκB kinase activity, and an inhibitor of HDAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). To confirm the involvement of these pathways in the abnormal cortical development phenotype, cerebroids were treated with PTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). While PTL alone did not induce any observable phenotype, it reversed the cortical folding and thickness abnormalities across different cortical layers in IL-17A-treated cerebroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5, C to I</xref>). Furthermore, PTL treatment mitigated the excessive neurogenesis, as evidenced by a reduction in the number of CTIP2<sup>+</sup>, SATB2<sup>+</sup> and NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons in IL-17A-treated cerebroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5, J and K</xref>). Given the upregulation of BCAN in the ventricular zone of IL-17A-treated cerebroids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">fig. S16B</xref>), we investigated whether PTL could reverse this effect as well. Following PTL treatment, BCAN expression in the ventricular zone was decreased, reaching levels similar to those observed in the vehicle group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5L</xref>). These data demonstrate that the NF-κB and HDAC1pathways play a crucial role in IL-17A-mediated abnormal cortical development during MIA.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">In this study, we developed a robust high-throughput 3D ex-vivo culture system, cerebroids, which faithfully preserve key components of cortical development such as cellular architecture, apical-basal polarity, and essential immune, vascular, and ECM elements.

Furthermore, this model offers a unique opportunity to dissect the molecular and mechanistic basis of these abnormalities during early development, a stage that is typically inaccessible. Our transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that IL-17A remodels the ECM, with contributions from various cortical cell types. While the ECM is known to play important role in various developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), the specific contributions of different cell types to ECM composition and organization, and how they uniquely remodel it in response to environmental insults such as MIA, remain poorly understood. The cell-type-specific alterations in the ECM caused by IL-17A remains a critical avenue for future research. Additionally, PTL treatment successfully reversed IL-17A-induced cortical folding and neurogenesis abnormalities, implicating the involvement of NF-κB and/or HDAC1 pathways. Further research is required to clarify the specific roles of these pathways and their downstream mechanisms in ECM remodelling, as well as their contributions to cortical alterations.</p><p id="P17">Epidemiological, clinical, and animal studies have shown that males are more vulnerable to NDDs associated with MIA, both in terms of prevalence and symptom manifestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Sex differences in response to MIA are likely influenced by a complex interplay of hormonal, placental, and microglia-mediated inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), though the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Due to limited tissue availability, sex differences were not explored in this study and further research is needed to address this gap. In this study we cultured cerebroids for 15 days at most. A recent study demonstrated that fetal brain organoids can be maintained in long-term culture through continuous tissue fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). While cerebroids provide a robust platform for investigating the acute effects of environmental insults, future efforts should focus on overcoming the challenges of long-term culture, ensuring the preservation of normal developmental trajectory, cytoarchitecture, and cellular integrity. Achieving this will enable more comprehensive, long-term investigations into the impact of environmental factors on cortical development. In conclusion, we have established cerebroids as a robust, physiologically relevant model for interrogating complex neurodevelopmental processes. We have also demonstrated their application as a platform to study IL-17A-mediated disruptions in cortical development during MIA. In addition to incorporating neuronal and glial elements, cerebroids also integrate immune and vascular components, along with the ECM. This physiologically relevant complexity offers a unique platform to explore cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions across diverse cell populations, providing valuable insights into healthy brain development and NDDs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary information</label><media xlink:href="EMS199794-supplement-Supplementary_information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d138aAbIbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S7"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Kang and Berg labs for their support and insightful discussions.
