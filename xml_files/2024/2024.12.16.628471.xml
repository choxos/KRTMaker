Some gastrointestinal nematodes occupy both submucosal and luminal niches and can cause profound changes in epithelial cells. Yet, there is little understanding of the specificity of parasite-host interactions with epithelial cells and the differential responses at the apical or basal sides. Organoids enable uncoupling of parasite-driven responses from immune-driven effects on the epithelium, and two-dimensional (2-D) organoids allow for controlled access to both sides. Here we used 2-D enteroids to model <italic>in vivo</italic> localisation of <italic>Heligmosomoides bakeri</italic> (<italic>H. bakeri</italic>) fourth-larval (L4) and adult stages and identify localisation-specific effects on gene expression. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we found an enhanced upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) during basal co-culture and an overall stronger response to L4 parasites than adults. Further, <italic>H. bakeri</italic> live worms induced much stronger effects on gene expression than their isolated excretory-secretory (ES), but cells that internalised <italic>H. bakeri</italic> extracellular vesicles (EVs) displayed up-regulation of ISGs, repair genes, and YAP/TAZ signalling. Our results demonstrate that nematodes and their products, including EVs, modify the host epithelium in a localisation-dependent and cell-specific manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Helminth</kwd><kwd>Parasitic Nematode</kwd><kwd>Organoid</kwd><kwd>Extracellular Vesicles</kwd><kwd>Intestinal epithelium</kwd><kwd>Stem cell</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The intestinal epithelium is a critical mucosal barrier responsible for water and nutrient uptake and protection of the body from the external environment while maintaining homeostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. This barrier consists of a semi-permeable mucous layer, and an underlying polarised epithelial layer containing multiple cell types, including absorptive enterocytes and secretory enteroendocrine, tuft, Paneth, and goblet cells, which are self-renewed by intestinal stem cells (ISCs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The polarisation of the intestinal epithelium underpins its many critical functions with the apical and basal epithelium having different biological roles: the former is specialised in selective absorption of water and nutrients, and the latter is involved in integrating signals to and from the rest of the body <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In particular, the intestinal epithelium is integral to the clearance of gastrointestinal (GI) nematode infections by sensing parasites, initiating immune responses and executing effector functions such as increased mucus production and peristalsis referred to as the ‘weep and sweep’ response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. These effector functions are a result of drastic remodelling of the host intestinal epithelium as a response to parasite-induced tissue damage, parasite excreted/secreted (ES) products, or host immune factors produced to control infection e.g. Interleukin(IL)-4 and IL-13 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4"><italic>Heligmosomoides bakeri</italic> (<italic>H. bakeri</italic>) is a rodent infective GI nematode that resides in either the submucosa or lumen of the small intestine during the different stages of its life cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Granulomas of host immune cells including myeloid cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and NK cells form around encysted fourth-stage (L4) larvae approximately four days post-infection (p.i.) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In parallel, ISCs in the epithelium overlying granulomas display a loss of the canonical ISC marker <italic>Lgr5</italic> coupled with an appearance of cells transiently expressing Sca1 (<italic>Ly6a</italic>) and other genes associated with foetal epithelium, which are suggested to represent a repair response to tissue damage during larval invasion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. ISC expression of foetal genes, but not the loss of <italic>Lgr5</italic> expression, was shown to be dependent on Interferon (IFN)-γ signalling, produced by CD8<sup>+</sup> T and NK cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Expansion and activation of tuft and goblet cells also occurs during early infection, with tuft cells responding to <italic>H. bakeri</italic> by secreting IL-25, which leads to the activation of Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC) type 2 (ILC2s) that in turn produce IL-13 resulting in further tuft and goblet cell expansion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Despite extensive knowledge on the effects that the immune response to parasites has on the epithelium, we still have little understanding of the direct modifications induced by <italic>H. bakeri</italic> parasites or their ES products on the intestinal epithelium.</p><p id="P5">GI nematodes produce a heterogenous milieu of ES products including small molecules such as metabolites and ascarosides as well as proteins and nucleic acids that are released individually or within extracellular vesicles (EVs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. We previously reported that <italic>H. bakeri</italic> EVs are internalised by the small intestinal MODE-K epithelial cell line, which displays features resembling enterocytes. The EVs reduced expression of <italic>Dusp1</italic> and the IL-33 receptor subunit encoding gene <italic>Il1rl1</italic> within MODE-K cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, it is not clear how these observations extrapolate to the intestinal epithelium as epithelial cell lines do not replicate the physiology and diversity of epithelial cell populations <italic>in vivo.</italic> 3-D organoid cultures more closely replicate the cellular composition and structural features of the intestinal epithelium, allowing investigation of direct interactions of live parasites and their ES products with the epithelium in absence of the immune system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. For instance, while there is an overall increase in tuft cell numbers during <italic>H. bakeri</italic> infection, adult <italic>H. bakeri</italic> ES (HES) treatment of 3-D organoids surprisingly abrogated IL-4/IL-13 induced tuft cell hyperplasia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Additionally, whilst the aforementioned foetal stem cell signature induced by <italic>H. bakeri</italic> infection was suggested to be dependent on IFN-γ, HES treatment of 3-D organoid cultures has been shown to elicit this transcriptional profile on a distinct cluster of cells, termed revival stem cells (revSCs), independently of immune cell factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. These examples demonstrate that organoids enable the differentiation of changes to the host epithelium driven by the parasite from those triggered by the host immune response. However, these studies have focused on the impact of adult HES delivered to the basal epithelium of 3-D organoids. Given that immune sensing receptors are known to localise to the basal epithelium, we reason it may be more responsive to parasites and their ES products, not reflecting host-parasite interactions that take place at the apical side <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Here, we use a 2-D small intestine organoid (enteroid) model that recapitulates key features of the host epithelium to test these hypotheses and investigate the host epithelial response to <italic>H. bakeri</italic> L4 larvae on basal epithelium, versus adult worms and their ES products at the apical surface. We found basal co-culture with either L4 larvae or adult parasites elicits a strong transcriptional response with upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and repair genes, many of which are targets of the YAP/TAZ transcription factors involved in tissue repair <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Apical stimulation with adult <italic>H. bakeri</italic> showed fewer transcriptional changes than basal treatment suggesting interactions at the apical membrane result in more subtle host responses. We then queried the relative contributions of EVs and non-vesicular HES at the apical epithelium and found weaker effects compared to live parasites. However, we show that only a specific subpopulation of cells internalised <italic>H. bakeri</italic> EVs and comparison of EV+ and EV- cells revealed a striking upregulation of genes associated with the IFN and repair responses in cells that internalised the vesicles. These findings demonstrate the direct and localisation-specific modulation of the epithelium by <italic>H. bakeri</italic> in the absence of host immune factors and highlight a previously unappreciated link between <italic>H. bakeri</italic> EVs and epithelial repair during infection.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>2-D enteroids mimic apical and basal <italic>in vitro</italic> niches of <italic>H. bakeri</italic> and respond to parasites in a life-stage and localisation-dependent manner</title><p id="P7">2-D organoid methods are well established for mouse caecal and colonic epithelia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. However, current methods for murine 2-D enteroid cultures either do not establish confluent monolayers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> or do not report on the presence of dividing, absorptive and secretory cellular populations of the intestinal epithelium <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Here, we modified existing protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>) to establish confluent monolayer cultures of mouse enteroids containing the diversity of cellular populations found in the small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b - i</xref>). Our 2-D enteroid cultures demonstrated some degree of spatial organisation as previously reported for caecaloids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Movie 1</xref>). Specifically, they contained Ki67<sup>+</sup> proliferative cells (stem and transit-amplifying (TA) cells), which self-organised into proliferative loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c &amp; e</xref>), surrounded by non-proliferative zones containing enterocytes, Paneth, tuft, goblet and enteroendocrine cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1c-i</xref>). Cellular polarisation was observed in our 2-D cultures with the brush border at the apical surface identified by the colocalisation of Villin and F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Next, we used our 2-D enteroids to determine the direct impact of <italic>H. bakeri</italic> L4 larvae or adult parasites at their respective sites in infection, either in contact with the basal or apical membranes of the epithelium. We further tested whether the life-stage of the parasite impacts the host response at the basal epithelium by comparing culture with L4 larvae or adult parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>). RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis showed that L4 larvae co-cultured at the basal epithelium induced stronger transcriptional changes (432 up-regulated and 808 down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs)) compared to co-culture of adult parasites (337 up-regulated, 718 down-regulated DEGs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). In contrast, we observed fewer DEGs when adult <italic>H. bakeri</italic> was cultured with the apical epithelium (142 up-regulated, 252 down-regulated) compared to the responses of either parasite stage cultured at the basal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Notably, basal co-cultures specifically induced stronger upregulation of several ISGs, compared to apical co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>). Other pathways were upregulated in all co-cultures to varying degrees. For example, upregulation of epithelial repair genes such as annexins and lymphocyte antigen-6 family genes (Ly6) was evident in L4 larvae basal co-culture and adult apical co-culture, and to a lesser extent in adult basal co-culture consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Many of the genes upregulated across all co-cultures are known targets of YAP/TAZ activation (transcription factors of the hippo signalling pathway involved in intestinal epithelial repair <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>), which were most strongly upregulated in response to L4 larvae compared to basal or apical culture with adult parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig 1</xref>). Genes downregulated across all comparisons included those related to stemness and cell cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. To understand whether parasite co-culture impacts the differentiation of the epithelium into secretory or absorptive lineages, we performed a pathway enrichment analysis method (CAMERA) of gene profiles associated with stem, TA, secretory progenitors, Paneth, goblet, tuft, enteroendocrine and enterocyte cells from published single-cell RNAseq datasets and determined enrichment or depletion of cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. We found that stem cells were downregulated by basal co-culture with adult or L4 larvae, and secretory progenitor cells by co-cultures of L4 larvae with the basal epithelium and adults at the apical side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d</xref>). Of the secretory lineages, Paneth cells were downregulated by all co-culture conditions, and enteroendocrine cells showed a downregulation only after basal parasite co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d</xref>). In contrast, enterocytes were consistently upregulated suggesting that <italic>H. bakeri</italic> co-culture skews differentiation of the epithelium towards the absorptive lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d</xref>). Finally, revSCs were strongly upregulated in all co-culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d</xref>). Taken together, we observed a direct response of the intestinal epithelium to <italic>H. bakeri</italic> parasites, which is characterised by upregulation of ISGs and repair genes and downregulation of stemness. In parallel, <italic>H. bakeri</italic> co-culture skewed differentiation of the epithelium towards the absorptive lineage and away from secretory cells. The magnitude of these responses was dictated by the life-stage of the parasites and its localisation within the epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Apical co-culture with <italic>H. bakeri</italic> adult parasites induces stronger host responses than their ES products</title><p id="P9">Previous studies have investigated the direct responses of the intestinal epithelium to HES using 3-D organoids via basal delivery. 2-D organoids enable the delivery of live adult parasites and their ES products at the apical epithelium, mimicking <italic>in vivo</italic> localisation. Thus, taking advantage of this culture system, we examined the differences in the apical epithelium responses to co-culture with <italic>H. bakeri</italic> adults, HES depleted of EVs (EVdepHES), or EVs. Strikingly, we found that while co-culture with ten <italic>H. bakeri</italic> adults resulted in considerable gene expression changes in the epithelia <italic>(</italic>142 up-regulated, 248 down-regulated DEGs), the exposure to EVdepHES only induced 16 and downregulated 11 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplemental Table 1</xref>). Further, we found no significant transcriptomic changes in the 2-D enteroid cultures treated with <italic>H. bakeri</italic> EVs for 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a-b</xref>). EVdepHES caused upregulation of several YAP/TAZ target genes (<italic>P2rx2, Fst, F3</italic>), cellular adhesion genes (<italic>Fn1, Cldn4</italic>) and the ISG <italic>Trim15,</italic> which were also upregulated by co-culture with adults. While we found similar host genes changing in response to the co-culture of live parasites and treatment with isolated EVdepHES at the apical epithelium, the former resulted in markedly stronger responses even though the dose of EVdepHES is much higher than what is expected to be derived from ten worms (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>). Genes downregulated after EVdepHES were also consistent with those downregulated by adult co-culture, including <italic>Mcm4</italic> and <italic>Kntc1</italic> related to the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3c</xref>). The remaining DEGs upon EVdepHES treatment did not group into a particular functional category. For example, while we observed upregulation of <italic>Clca1,</italic> a gene involved in mucus production, no other DEGs related to this function were detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplemental Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Enteroid cells that uptake <italic>H. bakeri</italic> EVs display strong induction of ISGs and wound repair genes</title><p id="P10">Given the low response of organoids to EVs at the RNA level, we aimed to understand what percentage of cells internalise EVs. We fluorescently labelled EVs with Alexa Fluor 647 (EV-647) and treated 2-D enteroids with EVs by co-culture at the apical surface for 24 h. The extent of internalisation was then quantified by flow cytometry. Control culture media was subject to an identical isolation and labelling process as EVs to account for any dye carryover (referred to as “Mock”). Importantly, 2-D enteroid cultures were dissociated using trypsin which would cleave any external EVs bound at the cell surface; therefore, the signal detected should only reflect internalised EVs. We found that 2-D enteroids treated with EV-647 displayed a significant shift in AF647 fluorescence, compared to either naïve or mock, indicating EV internalisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>). Strikingly, only a small percentage (x̅ = 6.4%) of total cells internalised EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>). EV internalisation into cells was further validated by super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Fig 2</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Next, we determined the gene expression profile of cells that internalised <italic>H. bakeri</italic> EVs by performing RNAseq on sorted EV-647+ cells and AF647- cells from the same 2-D enteroid, or sorted cells from mock treated cells (Mock) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4c</xref>). Mock and bystander cells displayed very similar transcriptional profiles with no significant DEGs, suggesting no paracrine impact of EV treatment on bystander cells at 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref>). In contrast, sorted EV-647+ cells demonstrated a striking uptake-specific transcriptional profile with 790 downregulated and 1007 upregulated genes compared to bystander cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4 e&amp;f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). The transcriptome of EV-647+ cells was characterised by the upregulation of several ISGs (i.e. <italic>Isg15, Mx2, Bst2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4f</xref>). We also observed an upregulation of genes related to epithelial repair, including genes that are highly expressed in the foetal epithelium and expressed in revSCs (<italic>Ly6a, Tacstd2, Clu,</italic> Annexins), accompanied by YAP/TAZ target genes; genes involved in extracellular matrix remodelling <italic>(Fn1, Ecm, Itgb1</italic>); and genes encoding tight junction proteins important for cell adhesion and barrier function (Claudins, <italic>Ocln</italic>); (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Fig 3a</xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis supported the upregulation of both an IFN response/viral response and pathways related to wound repair and remodelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4g</xref>). Downregulated pathways were predominantly related to metabolic alterations and specifically fatty acid oxidation, whose impairment has been recently linked to blocked differentiation of the airway epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4g</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. We again used CAMERA analysis to identify enrichment or depletion of cell type specific genes in the EV-AF647+ population to understand if EVs are either uptaken by specific cell types and/or play a role in differentiation towards certain cell types. Sorted EV-647+ cells were enriched in genes expressed by stem, goblet-, tuft- and most notably revSC cells and depleted in genes identified in enteroendocrine cells and enterocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4h</xref>). Notably, the opposite was found when comparing Bystander cells to mock treated cells: where genes expressed by RevSC, and tuft-, goblet- cells are downregulated and those expressed by enteroendocrine cells were upregulated. These data are consistent with a model where sorting of EV-647+ cells selectively removes or increases specific cell types within the bystander pool, or alternatively EV uptake is associated with differentiation towards certain lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). In summary, while <italic>H. bakeri</italic> EVs are internalised by only a small proportion of epithelial cells of 2-D enteroids, these cells display a specific transcriptional program of ISGs and epithelial repair genes and gene sets expressed in stem cells as well as goblet and tuft cells. These findings suggest specificity in EV uptake and scope for functional effects in driving or regulating epithelial repair during infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P12">Here, using 2-D enteroids we demonstrate that the life-stage and localisation of nematode parasites to the apical or basal membranes of the epithelium impacts the host epithelial response. Apical co-culture of adult parasites or their products induced a more subtle response in the epithelium compared to basal co-culture of adults, while basal L4 larvae compared to basal adults induced even larger changes. These results are in line with biological differences in the apical and basal epithelium that affect responsiveness to enteric pathogens. For example, some receptors involved in sensing PAMPs either localise to the apical or basal surface, or trigger different signalling pathways depending on the surface that encounters the ligands <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P13">We also observed that co-culture of 2-D enteroids with L4 larvae resulted in a stronger host response than co-culture with adult parasites, suggesting that there are life-stage-specific effects potentially resulting from the secretion of different ES products <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. We found that L4 larvae especially drive the upregulation of epithelial repair genes recapitulating findings <italic>in vivo.</italic> During <italic>H. bakeri</italic> infection the ISC niche is modified to a state reminiscent of the primitive foetal epithelium that is suggested to represent a repair phenotype.

Our data suggest that outwidth the presence of microbiota and IFN-γ signalling, these responses are initiated directly by the parasite or by their ES products and likely enhanced during infection by the host immune response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, in basal conditions where parasites were physically separated, thus removing any physical contact to the epithelium, these effects were the strongest suggesting physical contact is not essential for this host response, but may exacerbate it <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P14">2-D enteroids also revealed a striking difference in the response of the apical epithelium to ten adult parasites compared to their concentrated ES products (that we estimate would be derived from &gt;20-fold more parasites) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. These results may be explained as a consequence of additional stimuli introduced by parasite co-culture that are not captured by ES treatment, for example, physical interaction, competition for the availability of nutrients in the culture media, and the release of small molecules typically excluded from ES during the isolation process such as metabolites. In this regard, we note that our purification of EVs and EV-depleted HES is more stringent than in other studies, since it used both ultracentrifugation and size-exclusion chromatography. It is also possible that the potency of EVs is stronger in the presence of other ES factors or that the parasites contribute to potency of ES and EVs, for example by disrupting the mucus layer and enabling access to enteroid cells. It is also possible that ES products are dynamic and their content could differ when parasites sense the host epithelium. For example, <italic>H. bakeri</italic> ES from L4 larvae developing in colitis mice have altered secretomes than those from control mice suggesting that parasites can sense environmental changes and modify their ES accordingly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">Previous work has investigated the impact of adult HES on the basal epithelium using 3-D organoids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We found that co-culture of EVdepHES, at doses comparable to others, with the apical surface of 2-D enteroids had subtle effects suggesting the basal epithelium is more responsive to foreign material, which is consistent with the basal localisation of key molecules involved in sensing PAMPs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Despite EVdepHES having subtle effects on the apical epithelium, the transcriptional changes were consistent with those induced by the live parasites in this study. Our results are also in agreement with the previous effects of HES treatment on 3-D organoids, including upregulation of genes related to epithelial repair (<italic>Anxa8, F3, Fn1</italic>) (although neither <italic>Clu</italic> nor <italic>Ly6a</italic> were significantly changed in our dataset); and the downregulation of <italic>Clca1,</italic> a gene that regulates mucus production by goblet cells in the lung and colon (a process key to anthelmintic defence) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P16">Using 2D-enteroids we observed lower levels of EV internalisation than those previously found by our group using the MODE-K cell line and bone marrow macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. This could be explained by features of the intestinal epithelium that are recapitulated by 2-D enteroids but missing in cell lines, which may impact <italic>H. bakeri</italic> EV internalisation. These features include production of mucus and secreted molecules, and the presence of cell subtypes that could have different specificities for EV uptake. Strikingly, EV-647+ cells displayed a strong upregulation of many ISGs (<italic>Isg15, Cxcl10</italic> and <italic>Mx2)</italic> and epithelial repair genes associated with revSCs. This could suggest that enteroid cells internalising EVs are revSCs, or that uptake of EVs induces differentiation of cells into this population. Further work is required to understand exactly how EVs act within these cells and whether they contribute to the induction of this cell population.</p><p id="P17">Here, we detected a strong ISG signature during the co-culture of worms with the basal epithelium and in cells that uptake <italic>H. bakeri</italic> EVs, but in the absence of host microbiota or hematopoietic immune cells, suggesting a direct ISG induction in response to <italic>H. bakeri.</italic> Indeed, <italic>H. bakeri</italic> infection has been associated with the expression of ISGs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Type I IFN responses are also important for effective immunity to parasitic worms, for example functional type I IFN receptor <italic>(Ifnar)</italic> is required for DCs to optimally prime CD4+ T cells during <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> and <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> infections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Further, <italic>H. bakeri</italic> infection of <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice suggests a role for type I IFNs in limiting worm fecundity and granuloma formation <italic>in vivo,</italic> however the contribution of the epithelium towards this is unknown <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Interestingly, with the exception of <italic>Ifn1b</italic> which was detected at low levels (&lt;1.8 CPM) only in sorted EV+ cells, no other type I or II (<italic>Ifng)</italic> IFN genes were detected by sequencing in this study. This agrees with our previous work where we found that infection of 2-D caecaloids with <italic>T. muris</italic> L1 larvae led to an expansion of a population of enterocytes expressing several ISGs (including <italic>Isg15</italic>), however, neither <italic>Ifna</italic> nor <italic>Ifnb</italic> was detected <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. This begs the question of how parasitic nematodes induce ISG expression in intestinal epithelium in an IFN-independent manner. Expression of several ISGs including <italic>Isg15, Ifit1, Ifit2, Mx1</italic> and <italic>Viperin,</italic> which are highly expressed in EV-647+ cells, can occur independently of IFNα/β through the detection of self (e.g., released during tissue damage) or foreign nucleic acids leading to IRF3 dependant expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. It is possible that <italic>H. bakeri</italic> RNA or DNA from live worms, either secreted as free extracellular RNA or transported by EVs in the case of EV+ cells, could initiate host expression of ISGs independent of type I IFNs.</p><p id="P18">In conclusion, 2-D enteroids provide an <italic>in vitro</italic> model that allows for co-culture of GI nematodes to closely recapitulate <italic>in vivo</italic> localisation to the epithelium. This model enables a better understanding of the direct contributions of parasite localisation, life-stage and isolated ES products on intestinal epithelial responses as well as the different responsiveness of the basal and apical sides of the epithelium. This model has also demonstrated the specificity of cellular populations for EV uptake and paves the way for more directed studies of EV functions and mechanisms in modulating specific cell types such as revSCs. In the future, 2-D organoid co-cultures can be modified to introduce other host factors such as immune cells, stromal cells and cytokines in a controlled manner to further replicate the parasite niche and allow for a holistic and mechanistic understanding of host helminth interactions during infection.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>3-D enteroid culture</title><p id="P19">3-D organoids were generated from C57BL/N6 mice (6-8 weeks) by dissecting the duodenum opening the intestine longitudinally and then cutting into ~1-2 mm pieces.
