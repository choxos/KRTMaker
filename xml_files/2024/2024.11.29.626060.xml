Cdc42’s ability to bind to membranes, mediated by prenylation, is essential for its function. Prenylation involves either the post-translational addition of a 15-carbon farnesyl group or a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl group to Cdc42’s C-terminus. One of the mayor challenges in studying the biophysical and biochemical interactions of Cdc42 at the polarity spot <italic>in vitro</italic> is obtaining prenylated Cdc42, due to labor-intensive and not easily reproducible traditional methods. Here, we present a streamlined, Sortase A-based approach to farnesylate Cdc42 <italic>in vitro</italic>. This method leverages <italic>E. coli</italic>-expressed Cdc42 with a Sortase A recognition motif, facilitating efficient and accessible farnesylation and purification using a purification tag-based strategy. The farnesylated Cdc42 retains functionality, as evidenced by GTP-dependent membrane binding, making it suitable for further biophysical and biochemical investigations. Additionally, our method can be easily adapted to yield geranyl-geranylated Cdc42.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Small GTPases are highly conserved proteins and are involved in cell polarization in most eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Diepeveen et al., 2018</xref>]. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, polarity establishment is regulated by the membrane-binding Rho-family GTPase Cdc42, and initiated by its accumulation at the site of bud emergence. Accumulation of Cdc42 on the membrane is driven by at least two interconnected regulatory feedback loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chiou et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Woods and Lew, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Daalman et al., 2020</xref>] and relies on Cdc42’s ability to bind to membranes, which is facilitated by a post-translational modification called prenylation. Here a lipid group is covalentely appended to Cdc42’s C-terminus. Depending on the lipid added (15-carbon farnesyl or 20-carbon geranylgeranyl), prenylation refers to farnesylation or geranyl-geranylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Caplin et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Koch et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Coxon and Rogers, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Wang and Casey, 2016</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Over the last decades many <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have been performed to dissect the molecular interactions that regulate Cdc42’s GTPase activity and Cdc42’s role in polarity establishment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chiou et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Meca et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Miller et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chiou et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Guan et al., 2023</xref>]. Many studies have focussed on regulation of Cdc42 in the cytosol, rather than membrane bound Cdc42. A major challenge for studying membrane-bound Cdc42 <italic>in vitro</italic> is obtaining prenylated Cdc42. Purification of prenylated Cdc42 cannot be achieved using standard <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>-based recombinant expression systems, as prenylation is a eukaryotic post-translational modification for which <italic>E. coli</italic> lacks the required enzymatic machinery. So-far, prenylated Cdc42 was obtained though (1) insect cell expression systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Zheng et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Zhang and Zheng, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kozminski et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>], (2) purification of membrane-bound Cdc42 from yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Das et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Rapali et al., 2017</xref>], (3) <italic>in vitro</italic> geranyl-geranylation of recombinantly expressed Cdc42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Golding et al., 2019</xref>], or (4) <italic>E. coli</italic> cell-free prenylated protein synthesis systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sonal et al., 2022</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1 Fig. 1</xref>). These approaches are effective but can be difficult to implement: (1) Insect cell expression systems require cell culturing facilities that are not available at every research location. (2) Yeast purification does not allow for Cdc42 over-expression and results in the purification of a mixture of geranyated and farnesylated Cdc42. (3) <italic>in vitro</italic> geranyl-geranylation of Cdc42 requires additional purification and testing of the prenyltransferase geranylgeranyltransferase type-I (GGTase-I), which can vary in activity across different batches. (4) Setting up <italic>E. coli</italic> cell-free prenylated protein synthesis systems demands considerable time, especially for establishing efficient purification techniques for prenylated Cdc42. Further, these methods are not always as accessible and reproducible for researchers from a non-biochemistry group as needed, which hinders scientific progress - despite trying a range of these methods, along with other novel approaches, we did not achieve success with any of them (summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Here, we utilize the transpeptidase Sortase A (which we will refer to as ’Sortase’ in the following) from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> to prenylate Cdc42 in a straightforward <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Sortase is a versatile enzyme used for protein labeling due to its ability to perform both cleavage and ligation in one step: It recognizes the LPXTG motif (where L is leucine, P is proline, X is a variable amino acid, T is threonine, and G is glycine) in a substrate, cleaves the bond between threonine and glycine in this motif, and subsequently catalyzes the formation of an amide bond between the threonine of the substrate and the <italic>N</italic>-terminal glycine of an oligoglycine probe. Sortase has almost no requirements for the structure or sequence of the probe (as long as it contains oligoglycine), and even accepts a wide range of non-proteinaceous molecules, like fluorescent dyes, fatty acids, nucleic acids, polymers, or C14-C24 lipid chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Pritz et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antos et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Antos et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Popp and Ploegh, 2011</xref>]. We utilized the versatility of Sortase to produce one type of prenylated Cdc42 - farnesylated Cdc42. In the same way, our method can be used to yield the other type of prenylation: geranyl-geranyltion. To do so, we purified recombinantly expressed Cdc42, in which a Sortase recognition motif is inserted in-between Cdc42’s C-terminus and a <italic>C</italic>-terminal purification tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), and synthesized farnesylated triglycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Such peptides were not commercially available at that time, but several companies offer them now. We then performed a Sortase-mediated <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction, in which Cdc42’s <italic>C</italic>-terminal purification tag is replaced by the farnesylated triglycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Our approach offers several key advantages: (1) It utilizes recombinant Cdc42 expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, eliminating the need for specialized cell culturing skills and facilities. (2) It employs the commercially available Sortase enzyme, avoiding the need for additional enzyme purification. (3) It leverages a tag-based purification strategy for the straightforward purification of prenylated Cdc42. Conversely, a drawback of this technique is that it incorporates a small linker, composed of parts of the Sortase recognition motif and the oligoglycine from the probe, between Cdc42’s <italic>C</italic>-terminus and the farnesyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Our data shows that Sortase-mediated reactions are an effective method for farnesylating Cdc42, which can be easily be purified through a purification-tag-based approach. The addition of the detergent Brij58 aids the reaction yield, presumably through solubilizing farnesylated Cdc42. Further, farnesylated Cdc42 binds to membranes in a GTP-dependent manner, suggesting that the linker region between the protein’s <italic>C</italic>-terminus and the farnesyl group does not impede protein functionality.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cdc42 can easily be farnesylated in a Sortase-mediated reaction</title><p id="P6">We purified Cdc42 with a <italic>C</italic>-terminal Sortase recognition motif from <italic>E. coli</italic> and synthesized H<sub>2</sub>N-Gly<sub>3</sub>-cysteamine-farnesyl (‘farnesylated triglycine’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">1</xref></sup>, and used a His-tagged Sortase mutant with improved catalytic properties ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>], available from BPS Bioscience) for the labeling reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To optimize reaction conditions, we carried out screens using Bem1 and Cdc42 and Alexa488 peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). Initially we tried monitoring product formation of Cdc42-farnesyl using anti-farnesyl Western blotting, but an eight condition screen utilizing materials stated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kennedy et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Li et al., 2020</xref>] revealed that all conditions gave false-positive and false-negative signal (data not shown). Considering the wide use and probe tolerances of Sortase, we assumed that the general trends of Cdc42/Bem1 Alexa488 peptide condition screens are applicable to reactions of Cdc42 and farnesylated triglycine. We monitored the formation of labeled protein through the Alexa488-signal of the protein bands on SDS-PAGE(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). The more intense the signal, the more protein got labeled. Cdc42 and Bem1 Alexa488 peptide screens showed the same trends: Increasing amounts of Sortase enzyme, peptide probe, and reaction time lead to an increased signal, and thus increased product formation. Reactions carried out for 72 h at 4°C at a 2:100:2000 molar ratio of Sortase : protein : Alexa488 peptide lead to the highest amount of product formation. For the reaction of Cdc42 with farnesylated triglycine we used this condition, and 5× higher peptide concentrations to further boost product formation. We considered even longer incubation times as they might increase the yield, but decided against it as this also increases the chances for protein degradation and aggregation. We then used the Sortase-mediated reaction to ligate farnesylated triglycine to double-tagged Cdc42 (Flag-Cdc42-His, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) and utilized the presence/absence of the His-tag for cleaning-up the reaction mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). During the labeling reaction the Sortase enzyme cleaves Cdc42’s <italic>C</italic>-terminal His-tag and ligates farnesylated triglycine to the protein. The final reaction mixture therefore contains three Cdc42 species: <list list-type="bullet" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P8">educt: Flag-Cdc42-His, 29 kDa (marked with a diamond in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P9">desired product: Flag-Cdc42-farnesyl, 28.5 kDa (marked with a red dot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="P10">undesired side-product: Flag-Cdc42, 28 kDa (marked with a filled diamond in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>)</p></list-item></list></p><p id="P11">Additionally, Sortase (22 kDa, migrating at 26 kDa on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>)), cleaved <italic>C</italic>-terminal His-tags, and remaining farnesylated triglycine are part of the reaction mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P12">As a first step, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used to separate reactants and products by size. Considering the proteins’ sizes, SEC separates a mixture of the three Cdc42 species and Sortase enzyme from remaining farnesylated triglycine and cleaved His-tag peptides. Interestingly, in the presence of the detergent Brij58, two such peaks are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), both containing all three Cdc42 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The appearance of two peaks is detergent-dependent; in the absence of detergent, only peak 2 is present, while using CHAPS results in peak 2 with a broad shoulder in the region where peak 1 would normally appear (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). Next, the two SEC peak fractions were loaded repeatedly on a nickel column and the flow-through was collected (His-affinity chromatography (His-AC)). His-Sortase and Flag-Cdc42-His bind to the column material, leaving only the two reaction products (Flag-Cdc42-farnesyl, Flag-Cdc42) in the flow-through (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To qualify and quantify the labeling success, we analyzed all reaction and purification steps by SDS-PAGE and anti-His and anti-Cdc42 Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>): Bands that are visible on both anti-His and anti-Cdc42 blots correspond to the educt (Flag-Cdc42-His, diamond). Bands that are visible on the anti-Cdc42 blot, but not on the anti-His blot, correspond to either the undesired side-product (Flag-Cdc42, filled diamond) or farnesylated Cdc42 (red dot). After 72 hours of reaction, four distinct bands were observed on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>): a double band at 30 and 29.5 kDa, along with bands at 27 and 26 kDa. The double band was also present in the 0 hour sample (taken at the start of the reaction) and appeared on both the anti-Cdc42 and anti-His blots, identifying it as the educt (Flag-Cdc42-His). The 27 and 26 kDa bands were visible on the anti-Cdc42 blot but not the anti-His blot, suggesting they represent the reaction products (Flag-Cdc42 and Flag-Cdc42-farnesyl). Both SEC peaks showed two bands - ~30 and ~28 kDa - likely because some of the bands merged during this step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). A change in buffer conditions could explain why these bands migrated at a slightly higher molecular weight than before. Interestingly, the signal for SEC peak 1 was significantly weaker than that of peak 2 on SDS-PAGE, despite peak 1 having a higher absorbance during SEC. As in the 72 hour sample, the 30 kDa band from SEC peak 1 was visible on both anti-His and anti-Cdc42 blots, identifying it as the educt Flag-Cdc42-His. The 28 kDa band, detectable only on the anti-Cdc42 blot, likely corresponds to one of the reaction products. We performed a control reaction without the farnesylated triglycine, which results in a mixture of Flag-Cdc42-His (educt) and Flag-Cdc42 (side-product) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). This reaction was purified using only His-AC. The SDS-PAGE analysis showed a weak 30 kDa band and an intense 28 kDa band. The 30k Da band was visible on the anti-His blot, while the 28 kDa band was not, indicating that the 28 kDa band corresponds to the side-product Flag-Cdc42. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">2</xref></sup> After His-AC, the flow-through should contain only Flag-Cdc42 and Flag-Cdc42-farnesyl. The band patterns of both SEC peaks in the His-AC flow-through again showed the 30 and 28 kDa bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Notably, neither band was visible on the anti-His blot, indicating both are His-tag-free. Since the control reaction identified the lower band as Flag-Cdc42, the 30 kDa band must correspond to the desired product, Flag-Cdc42-farnesyl, which migrates similarly to the educt. We prepared His-AC flow-through samples for mass analysis (Max Perutz Labs, Vienna), which confirmed the presence of Flag-Cdc42-farnesyl in both sec peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>), confirming our Western blot analysis.</p><p id="P14">Starting with 3.4mg of Cdc42 for the reaction, we found that the His-AC flow-through from SEC peak 1 contained 1.7mg of protein (50% of total Cdc42), and SEC peak 2 contained 0.8mg (24% of total Cdc42), which matches the SEC absorbance data. Both peaks contain a mixture of Flag-Cdc42 and Flag-Cdc42-farnesyl. In SEC peak 1, the ratio of the 30 kDa Flag-Cdc42-farnesyl band to the 28 kDa Flag-Cdc42 band was approximately 2:1, while in SEC peak 2 it was around 1:2. This indicates that 0.85mg (33% of total Cdc42) of farnesylated Cdc42 was present in peak 1, and 0.27mg (8% of total Cdc42) in peak 2, leading to a total labeling efficiency (after all clean-up steps) of roughly 41%.</p><p id="P15">Our findings indicate that SEC peak 1 contains most of the farnesylated protein, with the peak only appearing when Brij58 is present. This is in agreement with literature, showing that Brij58 increases the solubility of prenylated Cdc42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sonal et al., 2022</xref>]. The weaker SDS-PAGE signal for SEC peak 1 may be due to farnesylated Cdc42 adhering to the surfaces of tubes and pipettes, leading to loss during handling. This implies that the actual labeling efficiency before clean-up steps is higher than 41%. Our purification strategy yields two samples; one with a 2:1 ratio of Flag-Cdc42-farnesyl to Flag-Cdc42 (SEC peak 1), and another with the reverse ratio (SEC peak 2). We also explored a hydrophobicity-based purification approach, but were unable to effectively separate farnesylated from not farnesylated Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Taken together, our data demonstrate that Sortase-mediated reactions provide an efficient method for farnesylating Cdc42. The presence of affinity tags facilitates purification, and the addition of the detergent Brij58 significantly boosts labeling efficiency, likely by improving solubility of the farnesylated Cdc42.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Membrane-binding of farnesylated Cdc42</title><p id="P17">To check whether the prenylated Cdc42 had functional membrane binding, we carried out a liposome co-floatation assay. Here, liposome-bound protein is distinguished from the unbound protein by centrifugation through a sucrose gradient. We mixed Cdc42 that previously underwent a Sortase-mediated reaction with or without the farnesylated triglycine peptide with negatively charged liposomes (80% phosphatidylcholine, 20% phosphatidylserine) into the first layer of high sucrose density and added two steps of lower densities on top. An excess of GTP was added to ensure an active state of Cdc42. After centrifugation at high speed, the top and bottom fraction were analysed through an anti-Cdc42 blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). We found that there is almost no protein present in fraction A on an anti-Cdc42 blot for the control reaction product, Sortase-mediated reaction without farnesylated triglycine peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In fraction B, for the control reaction product, we see a mixture of reaction products Flag-Cdc42 and Flag-Cdc42-His as seen in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). The absence of the control reaction product in the top fraction, indicates that no protein is bound to the liposomes, suggesting that without prenylation, Cdc42 does not bind membranes. For the Flag-Cdc42-farnesyl sample, on an anti-Cdc42 blot, we see the majority of protein in fraction A, indicative of protein-membrane binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The near absence of Flag-Cdc42-farnesyl in the bottom fraction suggest that the protein binds the membrane strongly and is rarely present in unbound form under the influence of GTP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">In this study, we utilized a Sortase-mediated reaction to farnesylate Cdc42. One of the major challenges we encountered was the detection of the farnesylated product, as previously used Western blotting protocols proved ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kennedy et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Li et al., 2020</xref>]. To address this, we adopted an indirect approach by blotting for all Cdc42 species, including the educt, and used a control reaction to identify the undesired side-product. This allowed us to exclude bands corresponding to non-farnesylated Cdc42 species and accurately identify the farnesylated product on the gel/blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). A more straightforward approach would be to implement an anti-farnesyl blotting protocol, which, if reliably developed, could significantly benefit the wider scientific community. Alternatively, using a fluorescently labeled farnesylated triglycine, similar to the approach by Sonal <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sonal et al., 2022</xref>], would allow to directly detect and measure the formation of the farnesylated Cdc42. Due to the limitations of blotting, we verified the presence of farnesylated Cdc42 using mass-spectrometry. However, only the intact protein mass-spectrometry analysis was successful. Earlier attempts to detect a farnesylated peptide through a peptide mapping approach (i.e., digesting Cdc42 with GluC) yielded unreliable data, likely due to peptide loss during processing and uneven digestion, as GluC appeared to have preferred cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). In summary, detecting farnesylation remains difficult, likely due to the opposing characteristics of the strongly hydrophobic farnesyl group and the comparatively hydrophilic protein, and more reliable methods are needed.</p><p id="P19">In addition to the challenges of detecting farnesylated Cdc42, working with it without significant loss is difficult. We suspect that a substantial portion of the farnesylated Cdc42 is lost during the labeling and purification processes. This is suggested by the observation that, despite high absorbance during SEC, the gel of the SEC peak 1 (containing the majority of farnesylated Cdc42) shows only a faint signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). We found that using low-binding materials (such as tubes and pipette tips) helped reduce the overall loss of farnesylated Cdc42. Given these challenges, we believe that an overall farnesylation yield of ~40% after all purification steps is high.</p><p id="P20">In addition to the Sortase-mediated reaction, we also attempted to express Cdc42 in insect cells, yeast, and <italic>E. coli</italic> co-expressing farnesyltransferase (FTase) and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). While expression and farnesylation were successful in all systems, the farnesylated Cdc42 remained stuck in the membrane fraction, and various solubilization methods we tried were unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). The development of a robust solubilization method would be a worthwhile research endeavor, as it would address the main challenge in these three systems and enhance their usability. A common strategy to prevent prenylated GTPases from being sequestered in the membrane fraction is co-expressing them with guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bezeljak et al., 2020</xref>]. This, however, introduces the GDI into the system, which may not always be desirable. Given the challenges with <italic>in vivo</italic> expression systems, <italic>in vitro</italic> prenylation appears to be a more viable option. Traditionally, this is achieved using purified FTase and geranylgeranyltransferase-I (GGTase-I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Golding et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kuhm et al., 2023</xref>]. We chose not to pursue this method because it would require purifying additional enzymes and verifying their activity, which, combined with the difficulty of detecting farnesylation, would introduce additional uncertainty.</p><p id="P21">Instead, we opted for the Sortase enzyme, which is versatile, commercially available, and easily purified (a process supported by well-established purification protocols)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Pritz et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Antos et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Antos et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Popp and Ploegh, 2011</xref>]. The drawback of our method is the insertion of a linker region between Cdc42’s <italic>C</italic>-terminus and the farnesyl group, consisting of the Sortase recognition motif and triglycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). With FTase-mediated prenylation, no linker is introduced: Prenylation targets a conserved <italic>C</italic>-terminal CAAX box, where ’C’ is a cysteine that undergoes modification, ’A’ represents aliphatic amino acids, and ’X’ is any amino acid. A thioether bond forms between the cysteine and a hydrophobic isoprenoid lipid, after which the remaining three amino acids are cleaved, and the cysteine is carboxymethylated[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Caplin et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Coxon and Rogers, 2003</xref>]. Thus, in this process, the farnesyl group is added directly to the cysteine. In contrast, our approach appends the Sortase recognition motif after the CAAX box, resulting in a linker region of ten amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). This linker could be shortened to seven amino acids by reducing the CAAX box to just the cysteine and appending the Sortase motif directly afterward. Nonetheless, we found no indication that the linker impaired Cdc42 functionality: Our earlier investigations demonstrated that neither <italic>C</italic>-terminal tags nor the presence of longer unstructured regions affected Cdc42 GTPase activity or its interaction with the GEF Cdc24 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Tschirpke et al., 2023</xref>]. Here, we further show that the linker does not impede membrane binding, indicating that Cdc42 remains functional despite the modification.</p><p id="P22">This was supported further by the liposome co-floatation assay, where we observed GTP dependent membrane binding of the farnesylated Cdc42. The observed binding of this assay is comparable to the strong Cdc42 binding observed in recent in vitro literature ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sonal et al., 2022</xref>]). However, this assay does not yet show the full binding dynamics of Cdc42. Addition of a GDI into the system could help to show the full cyclical behaviour of binding and unbinding of Cdc42([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Sonal et al., 2022</xref>]). Membrane composition can have a large influence on binding dynamics and was in this case chosen to be comparable to the most recent report on Cdc42 membrane binding (Sonal). Although other reports([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Das et al., 2012</xref>]) show the essence of other negatively charged lipids for reliable Cdc42 membrane binding, we have observed strong GTP dependent binding with a simple two component artificial membrane.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p id="P23">The gene of interest (Cdc42) was obtained from the genome of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> W303 and was amplified through PCR.

(b) Clean-up procedure for the labeling reaction: after an incubation of 72 h size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is used to separate unreacted farnesylated triglycine and cleaved purification His-tags from proteins, which elute as two peaks (peak 1 and 2). Each SEC peak is then loaded onto a His-affinity chromatography (His-AC) column. Labelled protein (Flag-Cdc42-farnesyl) and reacted but unlabelled protein (Flag-Cdc42) do not bind to the column due to the absence of a His-tag. (c) SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the reaction mixture pre-reaction (0 h), post-reaction (72 h), of the SEC peaks and the His-AC flow-through: Both SEC peaks contain all three Cdc42 species (Flag-Cdc42-His, Flag-Cdc42-farnesyl, Flag-Cdc42). After His-AC a mixture of Flag-Cdc42-farnesyl and Flag-Cdc42 remains. (d) SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of a Sortase-mediated reaction with and without farnesylated triglycine that was only cleaned-up by His-AC. The control reaction absent of farnesylated triglycine confirms that the ~28 kDa band is Flag-Cdc42.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201606-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Farnesylated Cdc42 can bind membranes in liposome co-floatation assay.</title><p>(a) Schematic illustration of the liposome co-floatation assay.
