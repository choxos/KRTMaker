Factors controlling the interactions of the genome with the NL have largely remained elusive. Here, we identified DNA topoisomerase 2 beta (TOP2B) as a regulator of these interactions. TOP2B binds predominantly to inter-LAD (iLAD) chromatin and its depletion results in a partial loss of genomic partitioning between LADs and iLADs, suggesting that its activity might protect specific iLADs from interacting with the NL. TOP2B depletion affects LAD interactions with lamin B receptor (LBR) more than with lamins. LBR depletion phenocopies the effects of TOP2B depletion, despite the different positioning of the two proteins in the genome. This suggests a complementary mechanism for organising the genome at the NL. Indeed, co-depletion of TOP2B and LBR causes partial LAD/iLAD inversion, reflecting changes typical of oncogene-induced senescence. We propose that a coordinated axis controlled by TOP2B in iLADs and LBR in LADs maintains the partitioning of the genome between the NL and the nuclear interior.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Lamina-associated domains</kwd><kwd>DNA topology</kwd><kwd>DNA Topoisomerases</kwd><kwd>genome organization</kwd><kwd>nuclear periphery</kwd><kwd>Lamin B receptor</kwd><kwd>NE tether</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The typical nuclear organisation of metazoan cells requires an extensive portion of the genome (up to 40%) to interact with the nuclear lamina (NL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Such interactions occur within extended regions of heterochromatin defined as lamina-associated domains (LADs). LADs have been extensively studied over the years, revealing that these structures have low gene density, harbor lowly expressed genes and heterochromatic marks such as H3K9 and H3K27 methylation, and exhibit transcriptional repressive capacity (5 Briand, 2020, 32241294,8-10). However, despite a good characterisation of LAD chromatin features, the key regulators of chromatin association with the NL remain poorly described.</p><p id="P3">The heterochromatic state of the LAD and its direct regulators have been proposed to play a role in genome-NL association. For example, H3K9me2 is a mark that is enriched at the nuclear periphery and is conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Tethering G9a, the main H3K9me2 writer, to a specific target sequence causes its association with the NL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Depletion of several factors that control heterochromatin maintenance induces LAD release from the NL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). However, the casual relationship between heterochromatin homeostasis and its association with the NL has not been understood.</p><p id="P4">Heterochromatin is thought to be important for genome-NL association because it provides a scaffold of interactions for NE tethers, transmembrane proteins that can physically tether H3K9 methylated regions to the nuclear periphery. A clear example is CEC-4 in C. elegans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) and LBR (Lamin B receptor) in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), which are considered important tethers of heterochromatin. LBR has been shown to favour conventional genome organisation in metazoan nuclei in synergy with the NL component Lamin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The transcriptional machinery is an important negative regulator of genome-NL association. Activation of a silent gene associated with the NL promotes physical separation from this component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Similarly, transcriptional inactivation can promote reattachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Conversely, physical detachment of a repressed gene has been shown to allow its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Furthermore, LAD remodeling during differentiation is coordinated with changes in the transcriptional programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). With a few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), most data suggest a mutually exclusive relationship between gene activation and genome-NL association.</p><p id="P6">Transcription could shape genome-NL interactions by sequestering active chromatin away from the NL, creating an environment incompatible with NL association. Consistent with this model, in C. elegans the chromatin binding factor MRG1 binds active acetylated regions and sequesters them away from the NL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). These data suggest a competition model in which different parts of the genome compete for interaction with the NL. This model is also supported by the comparison of genome-NL interactions between haploid and diploid HAP1 cells, which showed a reduction in interaction with the NL for the diploid compared to the haploid haplotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). This result supports the idea that there is a limited capacity for chromatin interactions with the NL.</p><p id="P7">One property of DNA that is emerging as a new level of regulation of chromatin structure and organisation is DNA supercoiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). This is the ability of DNA or chromatin to change conformation following the application of torsion, stretching or bending of the double helix. These physical forces can arise from the activity of powerful revolving machines such as polymerases, the catalytic activity of chromatin remodelers, or the binding and bending activity of DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Modelling and experimental data suggest that transcriptionally induced supercoiling may contribute to genome folding at multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Cells have specialised enzymes to deal with DNA supercoiling, called DNA topoisomerases. These enzymes can catalyse the relaxation of chromatin by introducing transient single (type I topoisomerases) or double (type II topoisomerases) strand breaks on DNA. TOP1, TOP2A and TOP2B are among the most studied topoisomerases and are currently targeted in chemotherapy. While these enzymes have mainly been studied in the context of replication, transcription and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), it has recently been proposed that they may also play a role in genome organisation, particularly in the context of loop extrusion machineries. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). TOP2B positioning and cutting activity has been described at the base of CTCF-bound chromatin loops in the vicinity of active genes, suggesting that it could regulate the topology between the transcription machinery and the loop-extruding cohesin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). In yeast, in interphase, Top2 activity is counteracted by condensin loop extrusion activity and this balance regulates the level of genome entanglement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). TOP2 activity is also important in regulating mitotic chromosome architecture by regulating sister chromatid resolution and chromatin condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Recently, TOP2 has also been found to act during mitotic exit and its activity is required to reestablish an untangled and compartmentalised genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Despite the growing evidence that topoisomerases may be involved in 3D genome organisation and folding, the relationship between these enzymes and the anchoring of the genome to the NL has not been investigated. Indeed, the literature on this topic is limited and somewhat sparse. In vitro nuclear reassembly in Xenopus extracts showed that TOP2 inhibitors can block the assembly of a nucleus around protein-free DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Cell-free preparations of Drosophila embryos show that lamins and DNA topoisomerases re-associate on newly assembled nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). These data suggest a role for TOP2 in the establishment of nuclear architecture. Interestingly, removal of the nuclear envelope reduces segregation defects in topoisomerase mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). TOP2B was found to be important for the transcription of neuronal genes proximal to AT-rich regions that may overlap with lamina-associated domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). TOP1 was shown to be able to reduce R-loop formation for long, highly active genes proximal to the NL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). These data mainly point to a role of the NL as a boundary or constraint.</p><p id="P10">Apart from this disjointed knowledge on topoisomerases and the NL, a study that addresses whether and how topoisomerases control genome-NL interactions is still missing. In this work, we fill this knowledge gap. We have investigated the role of topoisomerases in genome-NL interactions and linked this to NL tethering. We found that TOP2B is a regulator of genome association with the NL that acts in coordination with the NE tether LBR to maintain proper partitioning of the genome between the NL and the nuclear interior.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>LADs and iLADs differ in supercoiling state</title><sec id="S4"><title>LADs and iLADs have distinct topological states</title><p id="P11">How DNA supercoiling reflects the anchoring of the genome to the NL has never been investigated. To obtain information on the topological state of LADs in human cells, we used genome-wide maps of DNA supercoiling in RPE1 cells obtained by biotin-psoralen (bTMP) intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). Psoralen intercalates more frequently in under-twisted DNA (negatively supercoiled) than in relaxed or positively supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). In WT RPE1 cells, bTMP-seq revealed a clear differential pattern for iLADs and LADs:</p><p id="P12">iLADs show a higher level of psoralen intercalation. In contrast, LADs show a lower underwound state compared to iLADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, LADs are less negatively supercoiled than iLADs. Interestingly, on average, LAD borders represented sharp topological transition regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Sequence composition does not bias estimates of LAD topology</title><p id="P13">We considered that a difference in topological state between LADs and iLADs could be due to sequence bias of psoralen intercalation, given that psoralen has a bias for TA dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). However, this sequence preference should lead to increased rather than decreased intercalation in LADs, which are generally AT-rich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Furthermore, in our analysis, the psoralen intercalation signal in naked relaxed DNA is subtracted from the bTMP score generated in chromatin, thereby removing any potential DNA sequence bias. Therefore, it is unlikely that the differential supercoiling profile of LAD and iLAD is due to sequence bias.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Nucleosome positioning does not bias LAD topology estimates</title><p id="P14">Nucleosomal occupancy can also reduce psoralen intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Thus, the low levels of bTMP intercalation detected in LADs could be explained by a higher nucleosomal density in these regions. To test this, we measured nucleosomal occupancy for LADs and iLADs using MNase data for K562 (from ENCODE, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>)). This analysis showed decreased signal in LADs, suggesting that LADs are depleted of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). We observed similar results for MNase data generated in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). We further explored previously reported maps of nucleosome occupancy in mESCs generated by chemical mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). This revealed similar nucleosome density for LADs and iLADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that MNAse-seq may be biased for poor accessibility in LADs. However, linker DNA length distributions calculated from chemical mapping data showed that LADs tend to have longer linker DNA than iLADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). This result suggests that LADs have a slightly lower nucleosomal density than iLADs, which is consistent with data showing that LADs are enriched in histone H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>) and that histone H1 binding occurs on longer linker DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Thus, lower psoralen intercalation in LADs cannot be explained by increased nucleosomal occupancy and likely reflects a topological feature of heterochromatic and NL-bound regions.</p><p id="P15">Although we cannot completely rule out that other LAD features affecting chromatin accessibility might affect psoralen intercalation in LADs, these data suggest that LADs may have a different topological state than iLADs, with the former being less underwound than the latter.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7"><title>TOP2B regulates LAD partitioning <italic>in vivo</italic></title><sec id="S8"><title>TOP2B controls the partitioning of the genome between LADs and iLADs</title><p id="P16">To understand the impact of DNA topology on genome-NL association <italic>in vivo</italic>, we depleted either TOP1, TOP2A or TOP2B by RNA interference and mapped genome-NL interactions using pA-DamID, a recent adaptation of DamID that provides improved temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, all three DNA topoisomerases could modulate genome-NL interactions to some extent and at specific genomic locations, with both gain and loss of DNA-NL interactions following topoisomerase loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, we observed a more robust effect of TOP2B depletion. Unlike TOP1 and TOP2A, TOP2B depletion led to a substantial redistribution of genome-NL contacts. This was characterised by a switch from the bimodal distribution typical of control cells to a monomodal distribution in TOP2B-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), implying an overall loss of partitioning of the genome between the NL and the nuclear interior. Gains and losses of genome-NL interactions involved large parts of the genome, and changes could be detected in both LAD and iLAD regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Following TOP2B depletion, LADs showed a significant reduction in NL association and iLADs often gained NL interactions. This trend was observed by pA-DamID of both LMNB1 and LMNB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>). Such a de-partitioning effect could be adequately described as the slope in a correlation plot of the NL association score in control cells versus changes in NL interactions following topoisomerase depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). This analysis revealed substantially stronger effects for TOP2B loss than for the other two topoisomerases. Although TOP2A knockdown had some effects on genome-NL interactions, we decided not to investigate this enzyme further due to the apparent strong effects on cell cycle progression, consistent with the known role of TOP2A in decatenation and progression through mitosis {Uuskula-Reimand, 2022, 36322662). In contrast, TOP2B depletion did not alter cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Changes induced by TOP2B depletion are robust and reproducible</title><p id="P18">To verify these results, we performed several additional controls. First, we induced TOP2B depletion with two additional siRNAs. All depletion experiments showed similar effects and a high degree of genome-wide correlation, ruling out siRNA-specific effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 2A and 2B</xref>). Second, we considered that the pA-DamID score is a normalised signal calculated as the log2(ratio) of two different signals, one from an antibody (e.g. LMNB2) and the other from the use of a freely diffusible Dam. This second signal takes into account potential changes in DNA accessibility or sequence distortion. To rule out the possibility that TOP2B loss causes changes in genome accessibility, we examined the changes in the ‘Dam only’ and ‘LMNB2 only’ datasets after TOP2B knockdown. We found that most of the normalised signal changes were due to changes in LMNB2 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 3A and 3B</xref>). Third, to rule out a possible normalisation problem, we performed calibrated pA-DamID in RPE1 cells (control and TOP2B depleted) spiked in with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 3C</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S30">Methods</xref>). Data calibrated to mouse reads showed genome-wide profiles almost identical to uncalibrated data for changes in chromatin/NL contacts after TOP2B knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 3D and 3E</xref>). Thus, the changes in genome-NL interaction after TOP2B depletion described here are not an artefact of the normalisation process.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>TOP2B control over genome-NL interaction is conserved in other cell lines</title><p id="P19">Finally, we extended our analysis to additional cell lines by measuring genome-NL interactions in HCT116 and K562 cell lines that are hypomorphic for TOP2B. Both cell lines showed weaker LAD/iLAD partitioning upon TOP2 depletion, although to a lesser extent than in RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 4A-D</xref>). Taken together, these data support a role for TOP2B in the control of genome-NL interactions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Changes in genome-NL interactions after TOP2B depletion are not explained by changes in transcription</title><sec id="S12"><title>Transcription is relatively stable during TOP2 KD</title><p id="P20">We and others have previously shown that transcriptional activation promotes the physical separation of chromatin from the NL {Tumbar, 2001, 11175745; Therizol, 2014, 25477464; Brueckner, 2020, 32080885}. Similarly, transcriptional inhibition favours genome-NL reassociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Since TOP2B is considered to be a transcription-associated topoisomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>), we asked whether changes in gene expression following TOP2B depletion could explain changes in genome-NL interactions. RNA-seq analysis revealed modest changes in transcription upon TOP2B depletion, with 917 genes significantly upregulated and 645 genes downregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>). However, the overall disregulation was relatively marginal, as only 219 upregulated and 118 downregulated genes showed more than 2-fold change, suggesting that TOP2B depletion did not induce dramatic changes in gene expression at the time point analysed. Differentially expressed genes showed significant but very modest changes in the pA-DamID score (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>). Similarly, genes with a differential DamID score showed significant but marginal changes in expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5C</xref>). These changes could explain only a fraction of the overall alterations in NL association observed after TOP2B depletion. Thus, it is unlikely that transcriptional changes induced by TOP2B knockdown are the main cause of the pronounced de-partitioning phenotype.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Dissipation of dynamic supercoiling is not sufficient to promote LAD reshaping</title><sec id="S14"><title>In vivo chromatin relaxation by break inducers does not alter genome-NL interactions</title><p id="P21">Two types of DNA supercoiling can be identified in chromatin: unconstrained supercoiling generated by active processes such as transcription or replication and constrained supercoiling typical of DNA-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). If LAD partitioning is due to simple dynamic supercoiling, then its dissipation by single-strand break inducers should be sufficient to promote some changes in genome-NL contact. To test this hypothesis, we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> chromatin relaxation experiments: we mapped genome-NL interactions after three hours of treatment with two doses of bleomycin.

These considerations led us to investigate a possible link between TOP2B and LBR. We first mapped contacts between the genome and LBR utilizing pA-DamID and an LBR-specific antibody.

Differential LAD calling analysis identified 220 LADs significantly losing interactions with LMNB2.

Similarly, almost half of the LADs that significantly lose interaction with the NL in LBR knockout cells also detach upon TOP2B depletion. These data suggest that TOP2B and LBR may modulate genome-NL contacts in a similar manner. To test this directly, we compared the two differential scores (perturbation - control) for TOP2B knockdown and LBR knockout. We found a striking correlation between changes in genome-NL contacts after TOP2B depletion and after LBR knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>). The magnitude of the effect was greater for LBR knockout than for TOP2B depletion. These data show that TOP2B and LBR control the interactions between the genome and the NL in very similar ways.

In control RPE1 cells, H3K9me3 was enriched in the central part of the LADs.

This result suggests that strong LADs that detach from the NL after TOP2BKD are enriched in H3K9me3 and point to a mechanism where this type of heterochromatin is released from LBR after TOP2B depletion.

We propose that H3K9me2 is sensitive to the NL environment. However, given the low levels of this mark in these regions, it is unlikely that these changes are the drivers of the genome-NL interactions that are reshaped during TOP2B depletion. Thus, these data show that following TOP2B depletion, H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin released from LBR is not lost.</p><p id="P35">This study reveals a role for TOP2B in regulating chromatin contacts with the NL. Upon TOP2B depletion, constitutive LADs marked by H3K9me3 preferentially detach from the NL, whereas iLADs show increased NL interactions. Importantly, H3K9me3 itself remains largely unaffected. These data suggest a mechanism by which heterochromatin is not disrupted during TOP2B knockdown and is instead repositioned away from the NL. These changes in NL interactions are remarkably similar to those observed during oncogene-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Several lines of data in C. elegans and humans have suggested a competition model for genome partitioning at the NL.

We found that the catalytic activity of TOP2B is mainly concentrated in iLAD regions, and that some of these regions gain interactions with the NL following topoisomerase depletion. These data suggest that topological control of iLADs by TOP2B may protect this part of the genome from association with the NL. If TOP2B is limiting, iLADs might interact more frequently with the NL and compete with LADs for NL association. This phenomenon could be enhanced by the concomitant release of LADs when LBR is simultaneously depleted.</p><p id="P37">We propose that the activity of TOP2B and LBR may help to compartmentalise the genome between the nuclear periphery and the nuclear interior. Mapping data show that these two proteins occupy two distinct genomic compartments in interphase: LBR interacts with LADs and TOP2B binds to iLADs. Our co-depletion experiments show that TOP2B depletion can still trigger changes in genome-NL interactions even without LBR, suggesting that these two proteins are not epistatic. We propose that these two proteins form an axis that allows correct genome segregation between the NL and the interior by acting on two opposite parts of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>). The striking similarity in the way LBR and TOP2B shape genome-NL interactions could suggest that the activity of these two proteins is linked and coordinated. This hypothesis is supported by the more pronounced dissociation of LAD chromatin from LBR than from lamins upon loss of TOP2B. The underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated.</p><p id="P38">One possible mechanistic speculation is that a low abundant, fast-acting subpopulation of TOP2B present in LADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) helps to maintain a topological state optimal for LBR binding. Since topoisomerase cannot operate on constrained DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), such a model would imply that LBR does not constantly constrain chromatin, but TOP2B could control its transient interactions and operate on unconstrained chromatin. This model would be consistent with data showing that genome-NL interactions are highly dynamic even in a single interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>).</p><p id="P39">In a second model, TOP2B helps LBR to bind chromatin at the mitotic exit, and the two proteins then segregate into two distinct genome compartments in interphase. A recent paper has shown that TOP2 helps to maintain an untangled and compartmentalised genome after mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). LBR is one of the first proteins to leave chromatin prior to NE disassembly and mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>). It therefore needs to re-bind chromatin as cells exit mitosis and chromosomes begin to decondense. TOP2B activity may be required for optimal tethering at mitotic exit.

We have several explanations for this observation. First, LBR may play a critical role that cannot be replaced by any other tether in the nucleus. Differently, the depletion of TOP2B might be compensated by the activity of other topoisomerases like TOP2A or TOP1. Second, LBR has a nucleoplasmic portion with multiple domains dedicated to interactions with different chromatin components and features like histone modifications, DNA, lamins and HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>). Thus, TOP2B might regulate only a specific aspect of the complex binding properties of LBR, and thus, the effect of TOP2B loss is limited.</p><p id="P42">Finally, although several data, such as 1) the sensitivity of genome-NL interactions to TOP2B depletion, 2) the differential topological state between LAD and iLAD, and 3) the DNA topology-dependent binding properties of LBR in vitro, suggest a potential role for DNA topology in controlling genome-NL interactions, the direct role of this biophysical property of chromatin in the processes described above remains to be demonstrated. Our data suggest that simple chromatin relaxation and dynamic supercoil removal are not sufficient to promote changes in genome-NL interactions. It is possible that DNA supercoils restrained by protein-DNA interactions in specific cell cycle stages, such as the ones typical of NE tethering, might be the key players in this phenomenon. In addition, the ability of topoisomerase II to entangle or disentangle the genome needs to be considered. Further studies will be required to understand which peculiar function of TOP2B is required for proper genome partitioning between the NL and the nuclear interior.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S30" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S31"><title>Cell lines and cell culturing</title><p id="P43">Two different hTERT immortalized RPE1 cell lines were used in this study.

The following PCR program was used: 1 X (1 min 94°C), 14 X (30 sec 94°C, 30 sec 58°C, 30 sec 72°C), 1X (2 min 72°C).</p><p id="P47">To perform calibrated pA-DamID we spiked-in RPE1 cells with 20% mouse embryonic fibrobalsts before proceeding to pA-DamID. For this specific experiment we performed LMNB1 pA-DamID as this antibody performed well in mouse cells, differently from LMNB2 antibody (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Bioinformatic analysis of pA-DamID data</title><p id="P48">pA-DamID data was processed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>). Briefly, the adapter sequence was trimmed with cutadapt 1.11 before mapping the remaining genomic DNA sequence to hg38 with bwa mem 0.7.17. The following steps were performed with custom R scripts. Reads with a mapping quality of at least 10 and overlapping the ends of a GATC fragment were counted in 20-kb genomic bins. Counts were normalized to 1 million reads per sample and a log2-ratio over the Dam control sample was calculated with a pseudo count of 1. At least 2 biological replicates were generated for every experimental condition and the average score was used for downstream analyses.</p><sec id="S36"><title>Differential LAD calling</title><p id="P49">Differential LADs calling was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Briefly, to call differential LADs we converted the log2 (LMNB2 : Dam) data to z-scores (mean of zero and a standard deviation of one) to account for differences in dynamic range in pA-DamID signals between experiments, thus keeping the data distribution identical. LADs were determined in the control sample using a hidden Markov model on the average NL interaction profile between biological replicates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/gui11aume/HMMt">https://github.com/gui11aume/HMMt</ext-link>). The LAD score was defined as the mean signal of the z-scaled data tracks. Significant changes were called using a modified limma-voom approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). Significance was defined as a Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P-value lower than 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="S37"><title>Analysis at LAD borders</title><p id="P50">LADs as described in the section “differential LAD calling” were used to visualize the consensus NL interaction profile around LAD borders. To calculate average signal at the LAD border we used 20 kb binned genomic tracks from bTMP-seq (IP/Input) and pA-DamID (Log2(Ratio)). The flanks of the LADs were extracted from the LAD models and used as LAD borders. LAD flanks within 50 kb of the chromosome ends were excluded as these are not actual LAD borders but simply chromosome ends. Next, for every 20 kb genomic bin kb, the closest LAD border was determined. Relative positioning from the closest LAD border was used to calculate the mean score and the 95%-confidence interval of the mean. Taking the closest LAD border for every genomic bin ensures that each position is only considered once, even when a position is close to multiple LAD borders. For this analysis, LADs and iLADs smaller than 50 kb were excluded as these are only composed of two normalized bins (of 20 kb each). These small domains would therefore only provide a single data point at one side of the LAD border, and likely only increase the noisiness of the resulting consensus profile.</p></sec><sec id="S38"><title>Calibration of pA-DamID data</title><p id="P51">Calibrated pA-DamID data was processed similar to uncalibrated data, except that the reads were aligned to the human (hg38) and mouse (mm10) genomes at the same time and that genomic bins of 250 kb were used instead of 20 kb. The latter was necessary because the number of mouse reads was limited and larger bins resulted in more stable scaling estimates. The filtering step based on a mapping quality of 10 ensured that only unique alignments to either the human or mouse genome were used in the downstream analyses. After determining the log2-ratio over the Dam control using the combined genome reference, scaling factors were calculated to convert the mouse log<sub>2</sub>(ratios) to a z-score (see the section “different LAD scaling”). All mouse spike-ins were from the same biological sample, and this scaling ensured that all mouse profiles were normalized to the same dynamic range. Next, for each sample, the same scaling factors were used to scale the human log2(ratios). In contrast to uncalibrated data, with this approach quantitative differences in dynamic range between experiments due to increased or decreased protein-DNA interactions could be detected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S39"><title>In vivo and ex vivo chromatin relaxation</title><p id="P52">Bleomycin (Fisher Scientiifc, B2434-20MG) was dissolved in water, aliquoted and stored at -20°.

Cells or control genomic DNA were treated with 500 μg/ml bTMP for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. bTMP was UV cross-linked to DNA at 365 nm UV 800mJ/cm2 (UVP’s CL-1000). DNA was purified from cells using SDS and proteinase K digestion followed by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction. DNA was fragmented by sonication to a range of 200-500 bp fragments. The bTMP-DNA complex in TE was immunoprecipitated using avidin conjugated to magnetic beads (Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin Invitrogen, 65001) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed sequentially for 5 min each at room temperature with TSE I (20 mM Tris, pH 8.1, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS), TSE II (20 mM Tris, pH 8.1, 2 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS) and buffer III (10 mM Tris, pH 8.1, 0.25 M LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP40 and 1% deoxycholate). Beads were then washed twice with TE buffer for 5 min. bTMP enriched DNA was then “on-bead” end-repaired and A-tailed prior to ligation of Illumina sequencing adapters. Adapter-ligated bTMP-bound DNA was then eluted from the Dynabeads in 25 μl water by heating for 10 min at 98°C. Library preparation was continued using the NEB NEBNext® UltraTM II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB #E7645S) starting at “Step 4 : PCR amplification of adapter-ligated DNA” where 10 μl of the DNA was used. Final libraries were sized and quality controlled on a D1000 Tapestation tape (Agilent).

B) Genomic overlap in Mb for LADs released by LBR during TOP2B depletion and constitutive LADs, facultative LADs and constitutive iLADs. C) RNA-seq data showing transcript level for LBR and TOP2B during OIS. Results are from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) and are the average of three independent biological replicates. D) Correlation scatter plot of 20-kb genomic bins for differential LMNB2 scores (x-axis) for TOP2B knockdown (left plot), LBR knockout (middle plot), and co-depletion of TOP2B and LBR (left plot) and changes in lamina association after OIS (y-axis).

OIS data are from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) and are the average of three independent biological replicates. Since OIS data were generated in Tig3 fibroblasts and not RPE1 cells, discordant bins in control data between the two cell lines were filtered out to allow direct comparisons of conserved genome-NL interactions. This led to the removal of near 30% of the total number of 20-Kb bins.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199184-f006"/></fig><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Stability of heterochromatin in LADs released by LBR after TOP2 loss.</title><p>A) Representative genomic track for pA-DamlD signal for LMNB2 (blue, control and TOP2BKD cells), H3K9me3 (green, control cells), H3K9me2 (red, control cells), and H3K27me3 (yellow, control cells). 20-kb bins were used.
