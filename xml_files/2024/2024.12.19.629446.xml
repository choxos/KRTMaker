Understanding of circadian coordination of CAM remains limited to rhythmic post-translational regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PPC) by a specific clock-controlled protein kinase, PPCK. Here, candidate promoter regions (~3000 bp) of CAM-associated genes from <italic>Kalanchoë laxiflora</italic> were coupled to a firefly luciferase reporter and stable transgenic lines of both <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> and C<sub>3</sub> <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> were generated. In <italic>K. laxiflora</italic>, the CAM-associated <italic>GLUCOSE 6-PHOSPHATE/PHOSPHATE TRANSLOCATOR2</italic> promoter (<italic>KIGPT2p</italic>) generated robust circadian rhythms of luciferase luminescence in constant conditions, with peak activity in leaf pair 3, where CAM-associated nocturnal CO<sub>2</sub> fixation initiated during leaf development. <italic>KIGPT2p::LUC+</italic> did not drive rhythms of luminescence in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and the <italic>KIPPCK1</italic> promoter produced no LUC+ signal in either species. Furthermore, the <italic>CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN2</italic> promoter (<italic>KICAB2p</italic>), a clock-controlled promoter that drives a gene involved in light-reactions of photosynthesis, drove robust rhythms in both <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. <italic>KICAB2p</italic> circadian period changed during leaf development in <italic>K. laxiflora</italic>, revealing differing control by the core-clock during development. <italic>KICAB2p</italic> peak activity shifted to dawn in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> relative to a dusk phased peak in CAM leaves of <italic>K. laxiflora</italic>, highlighting differences in the timing of outputs from the core clock between species. These findings establish a robust <italic>PROMOTER::LUC+</italic> reporter system in a CAM plant and highlight divergent timing driving clock controlled promoters between species, and period lengthening with leaf age in <italic>Kalanchoë</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P7">The metabolic adaptation of photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation known as Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) requires fine-tuned temporal control of metabolism to avoid futile cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hartwell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boxall <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). In contrast to plants using C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, which open their stomatal pores for CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation in the light period, an inversion of stomatal opening and shift of primary atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation to the dark period allows CAM plants to increase water-use efficiency (WUE) by reducing evapotranspiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Cushman and Bohnert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Borland <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). This makes CAM a potential tool for achieving sustainable global food security in the face of climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Borland <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In particular, the forward engineering of a drought-inducible CAM system into existing crop varieties could adapt them to the extreme drought and high temperature events that are becoming more frequent due to the changing climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Borland <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P8">CAM has evolved from C<sub>3</sub> photosynthesis at least 66 times independently (Gilman <italic>et al., 2023</italic>). It serves as a metabolic addition that concentrates CO<sub>2</sub> around RuBisCO, the ancestral primary carboxylase. During CAM evolution, the timing of metabolic and physiological processes associated with CAM was reprogrammed through changes to the signal transduction cascade(s) that connect the core circadian clock to CAM enzymes and metabolite transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hartwell, 2006</xref>). Previous work to identify components responsible for the synchronization of the 24-h cycle of CAM in response to the endogenous clock has established phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase <italic>(PPCK1)</italic> in the model CAM plant <italic>Kalanchoë fedtschenkoi</italic> as a key circadian regulator of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Nimmo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Carter <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hartwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boxall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). PPCK phosphorylates PPC in the dark period, which reduces its sensitivity to feedback inhibition by malate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Nimmo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1984</xref>). When <italic>PPCK1</italic> was silenced using RNA interference (RNAi) in transgenic lines of <italic>K. fedtschenkoi</italic>, there was a 66% reduction in nocturnal primary CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. The disruption of CAM in the absence of clock-controlled <italic>KfPPCK1</italic> led to downregulation and/or perturbation of regulation of several core circadian clock genes, suggesting crosstalk between CAM-associated processes and the core clock mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boxall <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017)</xref>. Similar evidence for crosstalk between the metabolic steps of CAM and the core circadian clock was also reported in other transgenic RNAi lines of <italic>Kalanchoë</italic> that lacked key CAM pathway enzymes and lost their ability to operate the CAM cycle, instead reverting to relying on the C<sub>3</sub> cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dever <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Boxall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). However, the mechanism that connects <italic>PPCK1</italic> to the core clock so that it is produced <italic>de novo</italic> each night remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hartwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hartwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Gene regulatory network analysis has been applied to <italic>K. fedtschenkoi</italic> to predict candidate circadian clock regulators of CAM, with a specific focus on transcription factors that may bind to and regulate the promoters of core CAM pathway genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Moseley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>). In addition, the candidate upstream promoter regions of candidate CAM-associated genes were reported to be enriched for clock-controlled promoter motifs in the CAM crop <italic>Ananas comosus</italic> (pineapple) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Ming <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). However, none of the numerous published predictions from such <italic>in silico</italic> studies have been tested experimentally in transgenic CAM plants. Furthermore, despite this progress, almost no work has been done to understand the role of <italic>cis</italic>-elements in controlling CAM gene expression.</p><p id="P9">Transcription factor (TF) mediated timing of gene expression via interactions with conserved motif sequences on promoters of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) is understood most thoroughly from studies in the model C<sub>3</sub> plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Mockler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The mechanisms, signaling pathways and individual TFs that regulate specific CAM genes and optimise their timing are not well understood in CAM species, although it has become increasingly clear that the core circadian oscillator components are highly conserved across photosynthetic eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Corellou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Lai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). The core clock genes and their patterns of co-regulation are also broadly conserved in CAM species where this has been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Boxall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hartwell, 2006</xref>). Other mechanisms have been reported for circadian modulation of gene expression including via post-translational means including protein turnover, calcium signaling, protein phosphorylation and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Sugano <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Perales and Mas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Cha <italic>et al., 2017</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Ruiz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Uehara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Firefly luciferase (LUC)-mediated bioluminescence via heterologous expression of the <italic>LUC</italic> gene has been widely adopted as a molecular-genetic reporter by plant scientists. It has been leveraged to elucidate many different aspects of plant molecular biology, including regulation of promoter activity, as a marker gene for successful transformation and as a biosensor. One of the earliest uses of firefly luciferase as a reporter gene in plants coupled <italic>LUC</italic> to the upstream promoter region of the <italic>A. thaliana CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN2 (AtCAB2)</italic> gene and revealed that the activity of this promoter was under circadian clock control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Millar <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992a</xref>). Coupling the <italic>AtCAB2</italic> promoter upstream of the <italic>LUC</italic> coding sequence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Millar <italic>et al</italic>. (1992a)</xref> demonstrated that <italic>AtCAB2</italic> was under transcriptional rather than post-transcriptional or post-translational regulation by the endogenous circadian clock. Since that first seminal report, the use of the <italic>AtCAB2::LUC</italic> reporter in circadian research has led to the discovery of many of the key components of the plant core circadian clock. Random mutagenesis of the <italic>AtCAB2::LUC+</italic> reporter line of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> with ethyl methane sulphonate allowed screening for circadian clock-associated phenotypes via high-throughput imaging for perturbed rhythms of luciferase activity, and such forward genetic screening has led to the identification the major clock component and pseudo response regulator (<italic>PRR</italic>) gene, <italic>TIMING OF CAB2 EXPRESSION1 (TOC1)</italic>, as well as core clock genes <italic>LUX ARRYTHMO (LUX), EARLY BIRD (EBI)</italic> and <italic>TIME FOR COFFEE (TIC)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Millar <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Strayer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Hazen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Ding <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ashelford <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Many other core-clock gene promoters and candidate clock-controlled promoters of genes that have been discovered to display circadian rhythms of steady-state transcript abundance have been engineered to drive <italic>LUC</italic> in stable transgenic lines. Examples include the promoters of core clock genes <italic>TOC1, CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), LHY, GIGANTEA (GI)</italic>, the <italic>EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3)</italic> and <italic>ELF4</italic>, and several <italic>PRR</italic> genes, among many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Doyle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Nakamichi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Salome and McClung, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Locke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Palagyi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Greenwood et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Nimmo and Laird, 2021</xref>). Despite being a keystone for understanding plant molecular-circadian systems, a <italic>CAB2</italic> promoter region has not been leveraged for circadian studies in any CAM species and the use of <italic>PROMOTER::LUC</italic> constructs to study circadian biology in other plant species, beyond <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, has been limited to date. Currently, the sole model system for transgenic studies of CAM are species within the genus <italic>Kalanchoë</italic>, especially <italic>K. fedtschenkoi</italic> and <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dever <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hartwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boxall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Boxall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Lefoulon <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ceusters <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Hurtado-Castano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). These species have publicly available genomes and transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). Importantly to affirm findings from these data, stable transgenic lines can be generated via tissue culture using <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>, and a diploid accession of <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> that can set viable seed has more recently been identified. This further enhances the amenability of this system as a molecular-genetic model for both CAM and other novel adaptations of plant biology found in the genus <italic>Kalanchoë</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dever <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hartwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P11">For the current work, promoter regions of CAM-associated clock-controlled genes (CCCGs) and non-CAM CCGs from <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> were cloned upstream of the <italic>LUC+</italic> reporter and used to generate stable transgenic lines of both CAM <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> and C<sub>3</sub> <italic>A. thaliana. KfPPCK1</italic> has previously been identified as a CCCG that oscillates robustly at the level of its transcript abundance in constant conditions (LL), and its transcript oscillations were blocked by inhibitors of transcription, translation and general protein kinase and calcium/ calmodulin signaling pathway inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hartwell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Hartwell et al., 2002</xref>). However, the putative upstream promoter region of <italic>PPCK1</italic> has not been studied experimentally for a CAM species, and so the <italic>K. laxiflora PPCK1</italic> promoter <italic>(KlPPCK1p)</italic> was a key target for the <italic>PROMOTER::LUC+</italic> transgenic reporter lines developed here to study the circadian regulation of CAM-associated genes. The second CCCG chosen here was <italic>GLUCOSE 6-PHOSPHATE: PHOSPHATE TRANSLOCATOR2 (GPT2)</italic>, the coding region of which encodes a glucose 6-phosphate:phosphate translocator that is localised to the plastid inner envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kammerer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). In the C<sub>3</sub> species <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, GPT has been shown to have roles in sugar signaling during early seedling development, sucrose-induced leaf growth, and responses to microbial volatiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Dyson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Van Dingenen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gamez-Arcas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022</xref>). The regulation of <italic>AtGPT2</italic> is linked to light responses via <italic>REDOX RESPONSIVE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (RRTF1)</italic>, and its response to sucrose is regulated by the transcription factor <italic>AtMYB56</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Jeong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Weise <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Though there have been advances in understanding the functions of GPT2 in leaves of C<sub>3</sub> <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, understanding of its induction coincident with CAM is more limited. Haüsler <italic>et al</italic>.

Some differences could be explained by temperature compensation resulting from the conditions in which plants were imaged, which were used to reflect LL conditions used previously to measure physiology of the closely related <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> tetraploid accession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Boxall <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>). However, the differences between intermediate LPs and LP6 were significant. Plasticity of the clock during aging has been recognised previously and has been widely reported in mammalian systems, with period shortening with age in both rats and humans, whereas in insects a lengthening period was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">Witting <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Duffy and Czeisler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Giebultowicz and Long, 2015</xref>). For example, in the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, period lengthening with age was referred to as ‘age-related decay’, and clock mutants with disturbed rhythms have been shown to have accelerated aging phenotypes, indicating a causal relationship between aging and changed circadian patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Giebultowicz and Long, 2015</xref>). In plants, circadian period was reported to be shorter by ~1-h in older leaves relative to younger leaves using the gene <italic>COLD CIRCADIAN RHYTHM AND RNA BINDING (AtCCR2)</italic> fused to luciferase and the <italic>AtCCA1::LUC</italic> reporter as readouts from the clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Delayed fluorescence was used to demonstrate different period lengths between leaves and plant ages of wheat <italic>(Triticum aestivum)</italic> and <italic>Brassica napus</italic>, with the conclusion that aging itself was responsible for these changes and that the clock was running faster in young plants before senescence begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Rees <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>). <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> leaves also perform different roles as they age, including increasing levels of nocturnal CO<sub>2</sub> fixation and malate accumulation associated with CAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Jones, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hartwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), as well as the transition from sink leaves to source leaves. Such changes in metabolism as leaves develop and mature could explain why genes are required to be initiated at different times in different leaves. Further investigations into whether <italic>KICAB2p</italic> and other promoters would exhibit a lengthening period, thereby altering the phase relative to dawn and dusk, under entraining light/dark cycles would need to be conducted to reach stronger conclusions. Good candidates for future analysis via <italic>LUC+</italic> reporter constructs would include core-clock gene promoters such as those responsible for the clock-control of <italic>TOC1, CCA1</italic> or <italic>GI</italic>, and other CCGs and CCCGs, to determine whether the lengthening of circadian period with leaf age measured here is a genome-wide phenomenon, or whether it is specific to certain subsets of clock-controlled genes such as <italic>KICAB2p</italic> used here.</p><p id="P31"><italic>KIGPT2p</italic> drove robust rhythms of LUC+ bioluminescence in all LPs except LP1, and this result was consistent in multiple, independent, stable transgenic lines of <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A and 4C</xref>). A key difference in the temporal expression patterns of LUC+ driven by the <italic>KIGPT2p</italic> compared to <italic>KICAB2p</italic> in <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> was that one leaf pair, LP3, had 3.5-fold greater peak bioluminescence from 24-h onwards than the next highest expression from LP2. This would indicate a spike in the promoter activity at this specific stage in leaf development, where the CAM-related nocturnal CO<sub>2</sub> fixation phenotype of LP3 would match that of a weaker CAM species, or intermediate species that performs a mix of CO<sub>2</sub> being fixed in the day but more at night. Previous reports for the stress-inducible CAM species <italic>M. crystallinum</italic> revealed an increase in <italic>GPT2p</italic> activity upon CAM induction, plus the transcript abundance of <italic>McGPT2</italic> oscillated in both LD and LL conditions in CAM-induced plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Kore-eda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Cushman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Azad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Boxall <italic>et al</italic>. (2020)</xref> reported that the transcript abundance of <italic>KIGPT2</italic> was reduced and it lost rhythmicity when the CAM pathway ceased to operate due to a lack of <italic>PPC1</italic> in tetraploid <italic>K. laxiflora</italic>.</p><p id="P32">The results presented here showing that <italic>KIGPT2p</italic> activity was highest in LP3, taken together with the previous understanding that LP3 is where nocturnal CAM-related CO<sub>2</sub> fixation takes over from CO<sub>2</sub> fixation via the C<sub>3</sub> pathway during the light period, suggests that <italic>GPT2p</italic> may be activated developmentally as leaves grow and mature as part of the developmental induction of CAM in <italic>Kalanchoë</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Boxall et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, these results for <italic>KIGPT2p</italic> activity and its control during leaf development could also support the proposal that GPT2 plays a reduced role in active CAM as the leaves age through LP4, 5 and 6, wherein the level of CAM rises to the point where almost all atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> fixation occurs in the dark. Alternatively, the functional GPT2 protein may remain stable after it is installed in the chloroplast envelopes following the peak of expression in LP3. However, further investigations into the KlGPT2 protein levels, and its transport activity in isolated chloroplasts, measured across the developmental gradient from LP1 to LP6, would be required to understand the balance between changes in promoter activity across leaf ages and the abundance and activity of the encoded protein. These results also emphasise the need to study leaf pairs throughout their development and aging, as previous studies of the transcript abundance of <italic>KIGPT2</italic> sampled only LP6, and important conclusions could be missing without understanding the transcript abundance in intermediate leaves as they develop from using mostly C<sub>3</sub>, light period CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, to relying on nocturnal CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation via CAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Boxall <italic>et al., 2020</italic></xref>). These data also further emphasise the value of using the leaf developmental profile of <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> to study the transition from C<sub>3</sub> to CAM, as at each collected timepoint multiple developmental stages with a gradual increase in the level of CAM can be sampled and studied comparatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hartwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P33">A commonality between the <italic>KICAB2p</italic> and <italic>KIGPT2p</italic> activities was the waves in intensity of bioluminescence of LUC+ across the leaves, which can be observed in the timelapse videos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Videos</xref>). This observation provides further confirmation of the previous finding that the core-clock is actually a complex integration of single-cell autonomous clocks, which are coupled between neighbouring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Beck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Rascher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The data here for waves of LUC+ activity moving across <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> diploid OBG leaves is also similar to waves of clock-controlled expression observed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> previously, and is very similar to the previously reported waves of circadian delayed fluorescence in mature <italic>K. fedtschenkoi</italic> leaves performing CAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gould <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P34">The <italic>KIPPCKp::LUC+</italic> construct used here to generate stable transgenic lines of <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> diploid OBG consisted of ~2500 bp upstream from the <italic>KIPPCK1</italic> putative ATG start codon. This candidate promoter region was not able to drive detectable LUC+ bioluminescence in <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> or <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. On one hand, this construct therefore served as a good negative control as it demonstrated that there was no autoactivation of <italic>LUC+</italic> when the transgene is present in <italic>K. laxiflora</italic>. However, the result was counterintuitive to the known regulation of the <italic>PPCK1</italic> transcript, protein abundance and corresponding protein kinase activity, which are all known to peak each dark period in CAM leaves of <italic>Kalanchoë</italic> due to clock-control, leading to phosphorylation of PPC, which in turn makes PPC up to 10-times less sensitive to feedback inhibition by malate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Nimmo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Carter <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hartwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Boxall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). The negative results for the transgenic lines of <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> diploid carrying the <italic>KIPPCK1p::LUC+</italic> reporter may indicate that the cloned ~2500 bp putative promoter region does not possess all of the necessary regulatory motifs to drive expression of even low levels of the <italic>LUC+</italic> reporter. Either key promoter elements are present further than ~2500 bp upstream, or there may be distal promoter elements at large distances from the <italic>PPCK1</italic> transcribed region. An alternative explanation would be that the <italic>PPCK1</italic> promoter drives transcription constantly and the transcript is periodically turned over such that the steady-state transcript level oscillates every 24-h cycle, but this is not driven by rhythmic fluctuation of the activity of the <italic>PPCK1</italic> promoter. However, this latter explanation can be dismissed because if this was the explanation then the transgenic lines would have displayed a steady and constant level of LUC+ activity that did not vary over time under LL free-running conditions, whereas, in reality, the transgenic lines had no detectable bioluminescence, either rhythmic or continuous. Given the importance of PPCK1 for the optimised circadian control of CAM and the critical need to understand how PPCK1 transcript levels are increased each night to produce the active protein kinase that mediates PPC phosphorylation, further work must explore longer upstream candidate promoter regions from the <italic>PPCK1</italic> gene in <italic>Kalanchoë</italic> in the hope that a longer stretch of the upstream promoter region will replicate the observed regulation of the transcript abundance.</p><sec id="S7"><title>The <italic>KICAB2</italic> promoter was able to drive robust LUC+ rhythmicity in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> but CAM-associated <italic>KIGPT2</italic> or <italic>KIPPCK1</italic> promoters did not</title><p id="P35">When the <italic>K. laxiflora p::LUC+</italic> constructs were transformed stably into C<sub>3</sub> <italic>A. thaliana</italic> only <italic>KICAB2p</italic> was able to drive detectable LUC+ bioluminescence that displayed robust circadian rhythms. It was not surprising that the <italic>KIPPCK1</italic> promoter was unable to drive any detectable LUC+ bioluminescence in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, because the same construct also produced no light in multiple independent stable transgenic lines of <italic>K. laxiflora</italic>. However, the result for the <italic>KIGPT2p::LUC+</italic> construct in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is more interesting due to the very bright bioluminescence measured for this construct in <italic>K. laxiflora</italic>. Analysis of the sequences and transcript abundance of associated genes of <italic>KIGPT2</italic> and <italic>AtGPT2</italic> revealed key differences that may, at least in part, explain why the molecular-signalling cascades associated with the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> circadian clock were not able to activate and drive transcription downstream of the <italic>KIGPT2p</italic>. Firstly, there are two circadian clock controlled evening element (EE; AAAATATCT) motifs within the candidate upstream region for <italic>AtGPT2p</italic>, which are not present in the 3000bp <italic>KIGPT2p</italic> candidate region used in this work. The EE is necessary for evening specific transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Michael and McClung, 2002</xref>). Secondly, and perhaps reflecting this lack of EEs in <italic>KIGPT2p</italic>, the transcript levels of the orthologous genes cycle approximately 12-h out of phase with one another, peaking at opposite ends of the light period. <italic>AtGPT2</italic> transcript abundance levels peaked in the first half of the dark period according to an LL RNA-seq time course dataset for wild type <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ecotype Col-0, whereas the <italic>KIGPT2</italic> transcript level peaks at the beginning of the light period in both LD and LL experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Boxall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Papatheodorou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title><italic>KICAB2p</italic> has altered timing of activity when expressed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> compared to native <italic>K. laxiflora</italic></title><p id="P36"><italic>KICAB2p</italic> had altered timing of activity when expressed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> compared to native <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> in LP6.

The results revealed that the rhythmicity profiles of whole plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>) were not lost by detaching leaves, at least for the newest leaves.

Compared to the same promoter in <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> with a range of periods from 26.1 h – 28.52 h in newest to oldest leaves, there was an overlap of the range of mean periods driven by this promoter.

However, there was a significant difference between period lengths of different <italic>A. thaliana</italic> leaf ages, and the youngest leaf (LP4) had the longest period measured, compared to the oldest (LP1). This was also reflected in the data for <italic>AtCAB2p</italic>, where there was a clear trend of period lengthening as new leaves appeared. These results are consistent with those presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Kim <italic>et al</italic>. (2016)</xref> using <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Importantly, these results raise key questions about the differences between the two species, and the evolution of their circadian biology across the respective leaf developmental profiles. The initiation of CAM in correlation with the process of <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> leaf aging could contribute to an eroding of the circadian rhythm and lengthening period, or the processes may be more unrelated. This only highlights the need for more research into CAM molecular regulation, especially the daily temporal optimisation of CAM by the circadian clock, and transgenic tools such as those demonstrated in the present study will allow this with greater ease.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Conclusions and future directions</title><p id="P40">This study demonstrated that the firefly luciferase reporter gene system can be used as a robust, high throughput and reproducible experimental tool to understand the molecular-genetics of the circadian rhythms of CAM-associated genes that underpin the circadian control of CAM in the model species <italic>K. laxiflora</italic>. When comparing this system to C<sub>3</sub> model <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, we also uncovered fundamental differences in the clock control over specific promoter regions across the two species, with <italic>KICAB2p</italic> driving rhythms with different characteristics to those it generates in <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> when it was expressed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. This opens up some interesting questions regarding the ability of a host species’ circadian system to couple to promoter motifs from another species and control gene activity over time, especially given the long-term goal of engineering mechanisms from a CAM system with optimised temporal control in order to improve the WUE of C<sub>3</sub> crops. The data here demonstrate that it is unlikely that coding region transgenes driven by their native corresponding promoters will be sufficient to achieve the correct timing of gene expression in the target plant. Instead, there will be a need to understand all of the circadian timing interactions in the plant being improved. Going forward with these investigations, it would be useful to image more <italic>KIp::LUC+</italic> fusions including some of core-clock genes such as <italic>TOC1</italic> or <italic>CCA1/LHY</italic>, and <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> plants containing these constructs could be manipulated with stresses or other environmental stimuli, as has already been explored in some detail through circadian biology studies in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Such studies will enhance understanding of how the core-clock is affected by environmental perturbations in other species that use clock-control to achieve temporal optimisation of novel aspects of plant biology that are absent from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. For instance, plants could be grown under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> to investigate the response of the circadian system to the increasing global atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels that are driving climate change. Other reporters should be investigated for compatibility with <italic>Kalanchoë</italic> species, which could improve the ease and power of such investigations, such as an auto-luminescent fungal bioluminescence pathway (FBP), which would remove the need for application of the luciferin substrate and allow for <italic>in situ</italic> imaging of plants (Khakhar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020). Furthermore, other luciferase reporter gene innovations like nanoLUC, which is a more stable reporter protein than LUC, will prove valuable for monitoring circadian regulation of protein abundance through in-frame fusions of candidate circadian clock-controlled proteins, such as <italic>PPCK1</italic>, to the nanoLUC coding sequence (Khakhar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020; Urquiza-García and Millar, 2019)).</p><p id="P41">It will also be important to study the proteins related to promoters in this study. For instance, in the case of <italic>GPT2</italic>, the findings here emphasise the need to study the activity of the chloroplast envelope transporter that the gene encodes in order to determine whether the protein abundance and activity remains stable in CAM performing leaves after the spike in promoter activity in LP3. Finally, it will be interesting to determine the mechanistic basis for the interaction between the core-clock of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and the promoter regions from <italic>K. laxiflora</italic> used here. Specifically, exploring motifs or transcription factor binding sites that can be identified within these ~3000bp regions as being essential for regulatory elements from the clock-output pathway to interact with them and drive the observed rhythm of promoter activity. Understanding such interactions and signaling networks better would ultimately allow for temporal control to be optimised when considering engineering CAM into C<sub>3</sub> crops.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Plant materials</title><p id="P42">The <italic>Kalanchoë laxiflora</italic> plants used for the generation of transgenic lines were originally obtained from the University of Oxford Botanic Gardens (OBG), UK.

For <italic>K. laxiflora</italic>, leaf pairs 1 through 6 were excised from each plant at the base of their petiole using a scalpel around 18 to 24-h before imaging and the scalpel was used to remove half the leaf and the petiole, but with the leaf half to be imaged retaining the mid-rib. Each leaf explant was then placed on plates containing 0.4% agar with water (pH 5.8). They were sprayed evenly with a solution containing 5 mM luciferin in 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100 in water, filter sterilised. Plates with leaves were then returned to the growth cabinet under 12-h-light/ 12-h-dark entrainment conditions for the following ~18h, until the start of the next light period. For each time course imaging experiment of luciferase bioluminescence, plates of pre-entrained, excised leaves were transferred to the imaging cabinet set to a constant light intensity of ~30 μmoles photons m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and a constant temperature of 15°C. Illumination was provided by a mix of red and blue LEDs as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gould <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The software ‘micromanager’ connected to a programmable Arduino computer was used to control a Retiga LUMO™ CCD camera. Imaging commenced at the time that would have been the start of the 12-h-light period during pre-entrainment. The red and blue LEDs were switched off before each exposure of the camera, which lasted 20 mins. Images were captured every 2-h spanning a period 7- to 10-days under constant light and temperature (LL), circadian free-running conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Data analysis of LUC+ imaging measurements and statistical analysis of circadian rhythmicity and period length</title><p id="P51">Image stacks were analysed in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Schindelin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), selecting a small region of the leaf towards the distal end in the image, and measuring the ‘mean gray value’ of pixels as a quantitative measure of the amount of bioluminescence.
