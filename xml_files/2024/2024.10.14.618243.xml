In 1,321 early-life gut viromes and 55 negative controls (NCs) from four datasets, we identified viral contaminants and their prevalence across studies. Samples and NCs were indistinguishable in genomic and ecological features, with 71.5% of samples sharing at least one identical strain with NCs.

The number of viruses in the human gut has been estimated to exceed 10<sup>12</sup>, roughly equal to the number of bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Despite this quantity, the total weight of the human gut virome’s genetic material can be just ~50 microgram<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. This makes virome extraction and annotation challenging, particularly in low-diversity samples like those from early life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. A major issue here is distinguishing genuine sample signals from environmental contamination, a topic of recent debate in relation to the microbiome of the placenta<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>and blood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. To address this issue, proper negative controls (NCs) are essential at every step of sample processing. Best practices include sequencing NCs alongside the samples and removing sequences identified in NCs during data analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, the impact of contamination on virome samples, its sharedness across different studies, and appropriate decontamination strategies remain under-studied.</p><p id="P3">Here, we aimed to characterize the viral composition in NCs, assess the impact of environmental contamination on the samples (particularly low-biomass samples), and elucidate the level of genomic resolution necessary for virome decontamination. To do so, we employed publicly available data from four early-life virome studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> that had used viral-like particle (VLP) enrichment protocols and deposited raw sequencing data for both biological samples and NCs in public archives. Together, these studies include 1,321 biological samples (1,175 infant samples from 0 to 5 years and 146 maternal samples) and 55 NCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), in which we identified 971,583 putative virus sequences clustered to 193,970 viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2a,b</xref>).</p><p id="P4">We first aimed to determine if specific features (number of reads and reconstructed contigs, virus sequences, viral genome completeness, and viral diversity and richness) could distinguish NCs from biological samples. However, we found no significant differences between NCs and samples for any of these features (p &gt; 0.1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 2–7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). While we did observe significant differences in richness and diversity between NCs and samples in two studies when tested separately (FDR &lt; 1e-02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 6 &amp; 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), the direction of association was inconsistent. The average number of vOTUs detected varied substantially across studies (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 8</xref>). Biological samples had a median of 230 vOTUs (interquartile range (IQR): 64–594), whereas NCs had a lower median of 5 vOTUs (IQR: 0–33), although this difference was not statistically significant. Overall, NCs did not differ from biological samples in any major genomic and ecological features.</p><p id="P5">We next investigated differences in virome composition between NCs and biological samples, categorizing vOTUs with ≥ 50% genome completeness by nucleic acid type (dsDNA, ssDNA, RNA) based on their assigned taxonomy. Here, we observed a significantly lower proportion of ssDNA viruses in NCs compared to samples across all studies (beta = -14.9, FDR = 1e-04, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 9</xref>), driven mainly by a significant difference in one of the studies (Liang et al., FDR = 2e-02). When further tested separately, samples from Shah et al. had fewer RNA viruses than NCs (beta = -1.6, FDR = 2.3e-05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 9</xref>).</p><p id="P6">At the level of the predicted host domain, prokaryotic viruses dominated all datasets (p = 2.4e-129, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 10</xref>), consistent with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, with no difference between NCs and samples (FDR &gt; 0.1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). Study-specific testing revealed a lower proportion of prokaryotic viruses in NCs compared to samples in one study (FDR = 2e-05, Shah et al.). At the genus-level of prokaryotic viruses’ hosts, NCs primarily contained viruses with hosts typical of the human gut microbiota, such as <italic>Alistipes</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, and <italic>Escherichia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). These observations demonstrate that the viruses identified in NCs resemble the viruses of the human gut, at least at the highest taxonomy and predicted host levels.</p><p id="P7">We further investigated whether NCs from different studies share common viruses. Among the 5,984 vOTUs identified in NCs from all four studies, none were common across all studies. However, two vOTUs were found in NCs from three studies and 44 vOTUs were found in two studies, while 5,938 were study-specific. At strain-level (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Methods</xref>), only three viruses were shared between NCs and samples from two studies. Of note, two Caudoviricetes phages found shared between two studies from the U.S.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> are predicted to infect <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> complex species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>), which are common environmental contaminants often shared across U.S. hospitals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Another strain-level virus shared across two studies, phiX174, is commonly used as a positive sequencing control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Overall, NC vOTU compositions were more similar within the same study than across different studies (FDR &lt; 3e-04, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 12</xref>). Of all the vOTUs detected in NCs per study, 7.7–23.9% were shared within the same study at strain-level. NCs were also more similar to samples within their study than to samples from other studies (FDR &lt; 4e-04, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 12</xref>). In general, most of the NC viromes were study-specific, but a few viral strains were shared across studies, reflecting common environmental and technical contamination.</p><p id="P9">We then quantified sample contamination by analyzing the proportion and abundance of vOTUs shared with NCs within each study. Only 20.3% (N=256) of all biological samples did not share any vOTUs with any NCs, while some shared up to 100% composition. 75.3% of the samples overlap with NCs at vOTU-level, with a median of 4.9% (IQR: 1.9–12.9) of vOTUs per sample shared with NCs from the same study, with a median abundance of 1.7% (IQR: 0.3–8.7). Moreover, 41.1% of samples shared a median of 0.7% (IQR: 0.2–4.8) of vOTUs per sample with NCs from other studies, though this vOTU-sharing was significantly lower than to own NCs in two out of four studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>). The correlation between the percentage of vOTUs shared with the study’s NCs and those from other studies was moderate to strong (ρ &gt; 0.2, p &lt; 1.3e-10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 14</xref>). This suggests that the sample contamination level could be estimated using the proportion of sample vOTU-sharing with NCs from independent studies. To facilitate the use of available NCs in quality control of future studies, we have made the database of vOTU sequences identified in NCs publicly available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">Given the lower gut viral diversity reported for infants compared to adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, we investigated whether contamination levels differed between maternal and infant samples and across infant ages. In the two studies where both infant and maternal samples were available, we found that the proportion of vOTUs shared with NCs from the same study was significantly higher in infants than in mothers (beta = 2.5, FDR = 5.1e-06 in Garmaeva et al.; beta<sub>2</sub> = 11.6, FDR = 2.3e-07 in Maqsood et al.; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 15</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary figure 4b</xref>). The estimated contamination decreased with infant age but was significant in only one of the two longitudinal studies (beta = -0.1, FDR = 0.3 in Garmaeva et al.; beta2 = -7.7, FDR = 2e-04 in Liang et al.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 16</xref>). These observations suggest that lab-induced contamination is more likely to be sequenced and detected in early-life gut virome samples due to their low diversity and low overall viral load.</p><p id="P11">Since NCs harbored viruses similar to those in the human gut at predicted host-level, we assessed whether the overlap identified at vOTU-level extends to strain-level, indicating sample contamination, or simply reflects broader taxonomic similarities between environmental and gut viromes. We therefore estimated the proportion of samples sharing identical strains with their study’s NCs. To do so, we reconstructed virus strains for 5,635 vOTUs present in NCs and biological samples (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Methods</xref>). We found that only 32.6% of these vOTUs (N=1,838) were shared between NCs and at least one biological sample at strain-level, suggesting that the strain detected in the sample might originate from environmental contamination (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>). Across the entire dataset, 71.5% (N=806) of samples had at least one strain identical to one detected in NCs. Since more than half of vOTUs shared between samples and NCs differed at strain-level, likely representing true biological signals, we conclude that decontamination of NC-detected viruses from the dataset should be performed at strain-level.</p><p id="P12">After performing strain-level decontamination, the vOTU richness in samples sharing vOTUs with NCs dropped by 1.5% (IQR: 0.5–5.0) on average. The number of vOTUs shared with own NCs decreased by 33.3% (IQR: 14.9–50.0) and comprised 2.9% (IQR: 1.0–7.8) of all vOTU detected per sample. Next, we compared the decontamination results at strain- versus species-level. For the latter, all vOTUs shared with NCs were excluded, leading to a 4.9% (1.9–12.9) drop in vOTU richness per contaminated sample, which was significantly higher compared to the strain-level decontamination. These results further demonstrate that strain-level decontamination preserves key ecological features of the samples, such as richness.</p><p id="P13">In summary, our results show high similarity between NCs and samples in key ecological and genomic features. Although biological samples demonstrated compositional similarity to NCs, most of the viruses shared between NCs and samples represented different strains. We therefore recommend performing decontamination at strain-level rather than vOTU-level as this provides higher precision. In this study, we also provide a pipeline for strain-level decontamination.</p><p id="P14">We also observed study-specific NC composition that likely represents variation between experimental environments. However, we also observed that sample vOTU-sharedness with its NCs is correlated to sharedness with NCs in other studies, a measure that may help to estimate the level of sample contamination in study designs that lack NCs. Lastly, contamination in virome data is unavoidable, so NCs from multiple sources at different processing stages must be sequenced and deposited with samples for future data reuse. This is especially important for early-life virome studies, as we showed that infant feces sampled closer to birth are more prone to contamination and share more vOTUs with NCs than feces sampled later in life.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S2"><title>Publicly accessible datasets of VLP-enriched early-life human gut samples</title><p id="P15">Detailed descriptions and metadata of the studies mentioned below can be found in the original articles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.

The <italic>Liang</italic> et al. study included 19 NCs of different origins, including empty diaper samples, empty stool container samples, and reagent-only samples. For each NC, both DNA and RNA sequencing were performed, further doubling the number of NC samples to 38.

Briefly, the sorted sequence alignment map files of samples and NCs where the vOTU representative of interest was identified were processed with the ‘profile’ module of inStrain in the “--database_mode” with a minimum coverage requirement for variant calling of 1 (“--min_cov 1”). Next, we used the ‘compare’ module of inStrain to estimate the pairwise genome similarity among all reconstructed consensus sequences. Only regions with a minimum of 1X coverage were included in the analysis. Consensus sequence pairs with less than 75% of the genome available for comparison were excluded from the analysis. Population-level ANI (popANI) values were used to compare the similarity between strains belonging to the same vOTU. Virus strains were considered to be shared between samples if their compared genomic regions exhibited ≥ 99.999% popANI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Virus sequence decontamination from negative control sequences</title><p id="P29">To remove virus sequences shared between biological samples and NCs at strain-level, we zeroed out the RPKM values of the relevant vOTU representatives. To account for potential limitations due to varying sequencing depth between samples and NCs, we considered all cases of strain-sharing, including those with less than 75% of the genome available for comparison. For the comparison of strain- and species-level decontamination, vOTUs detected in the NCs and samples from the same study were zeroed out.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Data visualization</title><p id="P30">Results were visualized in graphical form using a set of custom R scripts (R v4.2.3), including calls to functions from the package ggplot2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (v3.5.0). All boxplots were prepared using ggplot2 and represent standard Tukey type with interquartile range (IQR, box), median (bar) and Q1 – 1.5 × IQR/Q3 + 1.5 x IQR (whiskers). Phylogenetic trees were built based on the estimated pairwise genome dissimilarity (1 – popANI), using only consensus sequence pairs for which at least 75%of the genome was available for comparison. Hierarchical clustering was applied to the matrices of genome dissimilarity using the function hclust() from the R package stats v.4.2.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Clustering trees were then converted into phylogenetic trees with the function as.phylo() from R package ape v.5.7.−1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

No prior selection was applied to the samples, and no statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. Of the 1,321 biological samples and 55 NCs retrieved, we used 1,313 and 55, respectively, for the statistical analyses.</p><p id="P32">Statistical analyses were performed using R (v4.2.3). To estimate differences between samples (N=1,313) and NCs (N=55) in features such as number of clean reads, reconstructed contigs, discovered viral sequences, viral richness, and viral diversity, we used linear mixed models (lme4, v1.1-23<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, and lmerTest, v3.1-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 2–4, 6–7</xref>).

In each comparison, the studies were analyzed both together and separately. When analyzed together, the study and subject group were included as nested random factors. For the biological samples, the subject group was defined as the subject ID to account for the repeated measurements, while NCs were grouped by the source within each study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). When analyzed separately, the subject group was used as a random factor. Garmaeva et al. was excluded from the per-study analysis due to the availability of only one NC. P-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction method. Viral diversity (Shannon index) was calculated using the “diversity” function in the vegan package v2.6-4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P33">For the viral composition analysis, the proportions of vOTUs with assigned nucleic acid type and predicted hosts were calculated using only vOTU representatives with at least 50% completeness, based on a binary RPKM table (presence/absence data).

To assess the correlation between sample vOTU-sharing with same-study NCs versus with different studies’ NCs, we calculated a study-wise Spearman correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 14</xref>). P-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction method.</p><p id="P36">For the analysis relating sample vOTU-sharing with the same study NC to participant type (infant versus mother), we used only biological samples from Garmaeva et al.

For Garmaeva et al., significance was estimated using linear mixed-effects models, with the subject group added as a random factor. For Maqsood et al., we used a linear model because only one timepoint was available per participant. P-values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p><p id="P37">For the analysis of vOTU-sharing with same-study NCs over time, we used only the two studies with multiple timepoints per subject (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 16</xref>): Garmaeva et al. (N=205) and Liang et al. In Liang et al., only one cohort had multiple timepoints per infant available, so only this cohort’s samples (N=146) were used for the analysis. The RNA samples from Liang et al. were excluded from this analysis. Significance was assessed separately for each study using linear mixed-effects models, with the subject group included as a random factor.
