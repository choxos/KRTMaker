Beneficial bacteria application shows promise in AR, however most studies focus on oral probiotic administration without monitoring the applied strains in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and their local effects. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the probiotic <italic>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG was administered via chewable tablets in seasonal AR patients, randomized to probiotic (n=33) or placebo (n=31) groups. Per-protocol analysis of the URT microbiome, immune markers and AR symptoms was performed. <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG trafficked from chewables to the oropharynx (77%, p=0.02) and nasopharynx (41%, p&lt;0.0001). Control of self-reported AR symptoms via validated questionnaires under grass pollen exposure was observed after two weeks of probiotic administration and not upon placebo. A local decrease in salivary interleukin-4 (p &lt; 0.05) and nasal IL-13 (p &lt; 0.0001) was observed in the probiotic group. These data indicate that <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG chewables can target the URT and exert local effects on key allergy cytokines after temporal probiotic engraftment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In a world where modern living increasingly distances us from natural environments, the groundbreaking work on the Old Friends hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) and the biodiversity hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) converge and both point towards the trend that reduced contact with natural environments leads to disruptions in the delicate balance of our microbiome and immune system functioning. This contributes to a global increase in allergic and inflammatory disorders. Notably, one such disorder is seasonal allergic rhinitis (AR) or hay fever, a prevalent condition that disproportionately affects high-income industrialized countries, impacting nearly half the population in some countries. The implications are vast, with a serious impact on the patient’s quality of life and a significant economic and health burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p id="P3">It is now well established that the pathogenesis of AR involves immune imbalance with a key role for interleukin (IL)-4, causing a Th2 immune response and IgE–mediated allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). In addition, IL-4 as a master Th2 cytokine drives the generation of pro-allergic IL-5 and IL-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Current systemic (e.g. antihistamines) and local AR drug treatment or prevention strategies (e.g. intranasal corticosteroid sprays) focus on symptom relieve and reduction of the inflammatory response, but they do not address the underlying immune imbalance linked to AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). For many patients, symptoms are not adequately controlled with the current strategies (approximately 20% in patients with severe and persistent symptoms) and there are often side effects, illustrating the need for alternative and/or add-on treatment options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In addition to the immune imbalances, we and others propose that new treatment strategies could originate from the new insights in the microbiome (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>)). Indeed, specific local microbiome imbalances have been described in nasal samples of AR patients based on sequencing studies, such as an increase of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and a decrease of beneficial lactobacilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). We have also recently found that lactobacilli, including <italic>Lacticaseibacillus</italic> species, are common low-abundant members of the human upper respiratory tract (URT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). They were reduced in prevalence and relative abundance in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), an airway disease that has several features in common with AR. In an <italic>ex vivo</italic> model, a specific <italic>Lacticaseibacillus</italic> strain was also able to restore airway epithelial integrity in explants obtained from CRS patients with nasal polyps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). These findings stimulate the exploration of nasal application of lactobacilli. However, direct nasal applications with live probiotics have to follow the guidelines for live biotherapeutic products (LBPs), which is a new and yet unclear regulatory path for drugs with live microorganisms such as probiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Therefore, oral application with selected probiotics strains is still the preferred administration route. Recent meta-analysis has already shown the clinical benefits of oral intervention with selected probiotics for AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The model probiotic strain <italic>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG has been the focus of many allergy-related clinical research trials, demonstrating the potential of this strain to exert systemic immunomodulatory effects when applied orally, via the gut-lung axis (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>) for an overview). For example, <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG has previously shown to prevent the development of early atopic disease in children at high risk when administered orally to mothers and infants during the first six months of their life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), and this preventive effect extended even up to the age of four years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). However, the available double-blind, placebo-controlled studies do not uniformly point to clinical efficacy in populations with AR. For instance, preventive administration of oral capsules of <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG in 38 birch-pollen sensitive teenagers and young adults before and during the birch pollen season did not significantly alleviate symptoms or reduce medication scores when compared to placebo capsules containing microcrystalline cellulose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). On the other hand, a slightly larger trial in younger children (n = 100; age 5-12 y/o) with <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG as add-on therapy to sublingual immunotherapy, showed an enhanced immune response in the group with probiotics compared to the immunotherapy alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Also, others have used <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG as add-on to corticosteroids in persistent adult AR patients and found significant improvement in the quality of life of the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). When <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG was combined with <italic>Lactobacillus gasseri</italic> TMC0356 and consumed as fermented milk before and during pollen season, this could alleviate symptom scores for nasal blockage and medication scores in 44 adult patients with seasonal AR caused by Japanese cedar pollinosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the specific timing of intervention, administration regimen, patient population and probiotic formulation (e.g. oral capsule, fermented drinks) have a large impact on the clinical efficacy, even for the same probiotic strain such as <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG. In addition, whether the URT is -in addition to the gut-also a direct site of action is for most studies not known. To the best of our knowledge, no study executed so far with <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG, when applied orally, has explored whether the strain can migrate to the nose. Research in mouse models suggests that nasal administration of <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG could be more effective compared to oral administration, for instance for the prevention of the development of birch pollen-induced allergic asthma (Spacova et al., 2019).</p><p id="P6">In this study, we aimed to explore whether the model probiotic <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG could traffic to the nose when applied in a formulation that promotes prolonged release in the oronasopharynx and whether this prolonged contact with the nasal mucosa could result in local benefits in the URT. Hereto, we designed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in patients with seasonal AR (n = 64) with <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG administered in a commercially available slow-release chewable and this in a semi-preventive set-up before the grass pollen season started. The chewable formulations were hypothesized to promote the local contact with the oral mucosa during chewing compared to standard capsules that are immediately ingested. In addition, we evaluated the effects of this probiotic intervention on total nasal symptoms scores of patients with AR in relation to their exposure to airborne pollen, local cytokine modulation and microbiome composition of the oropharynx and nasopharynx.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Set-up of a placebo-controlled intervention trial in patients with allergic rhinitis during grass pollen season in adjuvant setting</title><p id="P7">Eighty-seven participants were assessed for eligibility, of which sixty-four were randomized (33 to the verum treatment and 31 to the placebo treatment). Most participants that were not eligible were excluded because of cross allergy with other allergens (mainly house dust mite) or not having a reaction against grass pollen based on SPT. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> depicts patient recruitment and enrollment. Three participants dropped out during the trial (2 verum, 1 placebo; reasons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and per protocol analysis of the remaining participants that provided samples on all time-points was conducted. The study set-up and actual pollen concentrations, monitored in the aerobiological station in Brussels, in relation to the start dates of this study are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>. Patient demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Patients were allowed to use rescue medication (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> for baseline levels and Supplementary Table S1 for medication use at start and during the study). None of the participants showed problems with general oronasopharyngeal health, as assessed by the responsible clinician at each visit.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG traffics to the oronasophayrngeal region after administration in a chewable tablet</title><p id="P8">The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate whether orally applied <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG in a chewable was able to transfer to the oronasopharyngeal region to exert local effects. Trafficking was evaluated via qRT-PCR with strain-specific primers developed in-house for <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG. After the intervention period of 8 weeks, 13/31 (42%) and 24/31 (77%) participants in the probiotic group had detectable (&gt; 10<sup>2</sup> CFUs) <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG via qPCR for nasopharynx and oropharynx respectively, while <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG was not detected at start (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The 11/13 participants who had detectable <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG in the nasopharynx were also positive for oropharynx (paired samples are indicated with a grey line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the placebo group, one participant showed detectable (&gt; 10<sup>2</sup> CFUs) <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG in his/her nasopharynx at the start. After 8 weeks intervention, 5/30 participants (16.6%) and 4/30 (13.3%) participants were also positive for the nasopharynx and oropharynx. The detection levels at the end of the trial showed that <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG was detected with significantly higher amounts in the probiotic group compared to placebo, with p = 0.02 and p &lt; 0.0001 for nasopharynx and oropharynx, respectively (Mann-Whitney test).</p><p id="P9">In addition to the qPCR analysis with strain-specific primers, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V4 region revealed a strong correlation between the <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG amplicon sequence variant and the probiotic treatment group, both for the nasopharynx and oropharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The correlation with the oropharynx was stronger than for the nasopharynx, in line with the qPCR data analysis. To evaluate whether the probiotic intervention caused a shift in the microbiome profiles before and after the intervention, the diversity of taxa before and after treatment in both URT niches was investigated using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and visualized with Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA), followed by an adonis permutation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). A clear distinction between nasopharynx and oropharynx microbiome profiles was observed (Suppl. Figure S1-S3), and location determined 46% of variation in our dataset (p &lt; 0.001). Some shifts were detected for nasopharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) and oropharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) at the end of the study within participants, but these shifts seemed independent of the intervention, as they occurred in both probiotic and placebo group.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Impact of the probiotic chewables on self-reported AR symptoms via validated questionnaires</title><p id="P10">We then aimed to explore the impact of the probiotic intervention on self-reported AR symptoms using validated questionnaires and documented the total nasal symptom scores (TNSS) over time per participant per treatment group. We visualized these data under the timeline of the outdoor exposure to airborne grass pollen for the entire study period (8 weeks intervention + 2 weeks of follow-up) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The severity of TNSS aligns with grass pollen concentrations measured in the air per study day (average correlation per participant: 0.49 ± 0.18).</p><p id="P11">To investigate whether the probiotic chewable-treated group could control symptoms better than the placebo-group, a mixed effect linear model was used. This model considered the intrapersonal effect of each participant over the study period with multiple time-point measurements. Treatment, pollen concentrations, and their interaction were applied in the model. In addition, to account for the fact that a probiotic mode of action requires time and can result in a minimum time needed to treat, we also evaluated the effect size when removing days one by one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-C</xref>) ((shown as day threshold on the x-axis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Independent of the treatment, increased pollen concentrations resulted in significantly higher TNSS scores (p &lt; 0.05), as indicated by their positive effect sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). When looking at the effect of treatment, participants in the probiotic group had lower TNSS scores than participants in the placebo group, as illustrated by the negative effect sizes significant from day 21 to 28 (p &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The interaction effect of treatment and pollen concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) showed that the effect of the probiotic decreased when the pollen concentrations increased. This indicates that <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG chewables may provide protection against grass pollen-induced symptoms, but that this effect decreases as the pollen concentrations increase. Our model also allowed us to explore when the probiotic intervention showed most additional clinical benefit. Around 15 days, a tipping point was observed where the effect size showed a strong drop, indicating a time needed to treat of circa two weeks for this probiotic intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The strongest effect was observed 28 days after the start of the study (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> as black dot). Finally, we evaluated whether the presence of the <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> amplicon sequence variant in the microbiome profiles of the oro-and nasopharynx was associated with TNSS, but no effect was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, TNSS was positively associated with alpha diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Local immunomodulatory properties of the <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG chewables and standard-treatment-of care in AR patients with hay fever</title><p id="P12">We next investigated the local immunomodulatory capacity of <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG chewables. Th1 and Th2 cytokines were measured in saliva and nasal fluid obtained from the participants at baseline (start) and at week 8 (end of the treatment). We specifically focused on IL-4, as main marker of the Th2 immune response and IgE-mediated disease and monitored IL-5 and IL-13 as pro-allergic cytokines. The IL-4 levels were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05) in the saliva of the probiotic group after 8 weeks intervention compared to baseline (Šídák’s multiple comparisons test), while this was not significant in the placebo group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, a significant decrease (p &lt; 0.0001) in nasal fluid IL-13 levels was observed in both the probiotic and the placebo groups from baseline to week 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). For the other measured cytokines, no significant beneficial changes in cytokine levels were observed in the probiotic treatment group as compared to placebo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">In this study, we evaluated whether orally administered <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG in a chewable could traffic to the nose and induce local immunomodulatory effects in patients suffering from hay fever. We evaluated short-term persistence of the administered probiotic in the nose through a combination of microbiome analysis and strain-specific monitoring via qPCR. In addition, we assessed the local effects of <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG chewables in the nose and throat on key allergy cytokines.</p><p id="P14">Our analyses provide strong evidence for trafficking and temporary engraftment in the URT after oral administration of a probiotic containing chewable. Strain-specific primers confirmed the presence of <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG in 42% of the nasopharynx and 77% of the oropharynx samples of our study group after the study period. A strong association of the probiotic treated group with the <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> ASV was also observed in the 16S amplicon sequencing data for both respiratory niches at the end of the intervention. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to report trafficking of <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG to the oronasopharyngeal region after consumption via a chewable tablet. These results confirm our hypothesis that such chewables increase the retention of the probiotics in the mouth and in this way enable transfer of the probiotics throughout the URT for more local effects. To date, only one other randomized, placebo-controlled trial has been conducted with URT administration of potential probiotic strains in seasonal AR patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). In this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), patients (n = 24) administered a probiotic mixture containing <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> SP1, <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> 101/37 and <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> L1A in the nostrils daily for three weeks in a nasal allergen challenge model. No evidence of persistent colonization was observed in nasal samples using MALDI-TOF after a treatment-free interval of two weeks. The authors did not report on the engraftment of the applied strains during or immediately after the study period.</p><p id="P15">In our study, daily monitoring of TNSS via self-reporting also indicated that the <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG chewables could provide additional protection against grass pollen-induced nasal symptoms, even in this study set-up where patients were allowed to use their standard allergy medication if the symptoms were severe, and patients had extreme discomfort. However, the observed effect decreased with increasing pollen concentrations. Of interest, we observed a considerable time for the probiotics to exert their effects, which started at day 15 and reached a maximal effect 28 days after start of the trial. A maximal effect size of two weeks is also shown for intranasal corticosteroid sprays, which are used as first-line agents in patients with moderate-to-severe and persistent AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). In the study by Mårtensson and colleagues, no effects on the self-reported TNSS were found by the probiotic mixture in their nasal allergen challenged model, where they applied the strains for a short timeframe of three weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Other trials using oral probiotics did report effects on symptoms. For instance, a 10-week study with fermented milk containing <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG and <italic>L. gasseri</italic> TMC0356 in Japanese seasonal AR patients decreased the mean self-reported symptom score (weekly mean of daily measures via validated questionnaire) for nasal blockage starting from six weeks compared to the placebo group, which reached a significant effect after nine weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). It should be noted, however, that this study did not take pollen concentrations into consideration and calculated weekly means of the daily measures of the symptoms scores, resulting in missing information. Therefore, we preferred the mixed linear model used here taking daily consecutive values into account for TNSS and pollen concentrations, similarly as done in other research related to pollen concentrations and allergy symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>).</p><p id="P16">In addition to the effects on the symptoms, immunomodulatory properties are of high interest for probiotic application in AR patients. In this study, we found a significant decrease in IL-4 in saliva (p &lt; 0.05) and IL-13 in nasal fluid of the probiotic treated group (p &lt; 0.0001) at the end of the intervention. The decrease in IL-13 was also seen in nasal fluid of the placebo group, possibly because our study set-up allowed the use of rescue medication. No effect on IL-5 was observed in this study. Previous work by Mårtensson and colleagues with the probiotic nasal spray did not report any effect on cytokine levels in nasal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). On the other hand, immunomodulatory effects of <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG on Th2 cytokines have been widely described <italic>in vitro</italic> and in murine models. For instance, intranasally administered <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG in mice resulted in decreased IL-13 and IL-5 lung levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), and heat-killed <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG is able to inhibit cedar pollen induced IL-4 and IL-5 production <italic>in vitro</italic> in PMBCs of allergic patients to Japanese cedar pollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). The observed decrease in saliva IL-4 and nasal IL-13 levels in our study is particularly noteworthy as such effects are often challenging to observe in human trials.</p><p id="P17">An important limitation of our work presented here is that measurements for microbiome and immunological biomarkers were only collected at baseline and after the 8 weeks treatment period, when the patients visited the ENT specialist. Therefore, we might have missed biological changes that could happen within this period. We observed for instance, based on our mixed-effect linear model, that the probiotic chewables showed a minimal time needed to treat of two to three weeks, which might have been an important time-point for sampling to observe biological differences. However, increasing sample collection time-points at the ENT practice had the risk to reduce patient’s compliance to complete the trial. In follow-up research, this can be increased, using the positive indications here to motivate future participants. With enrollees’ compliance in mind, we also used mainly self-reported TNSS scores for the other time points when the patients were not visiting the ENT specialist. Another limitation of our study was that, despite randomization, participants in the probiotic group more frequently used corticosteroid sprays at baseline (46.7%) compared to the placebo group (23.3%). This indicates that the probiotic group might have experienced more severe complaints at baseline. Most of our study population were also patients with moderate to severe, persistent symptoms (based on ARIA guidelines), while patients with mild symptoms could benefit more from this therapy. Finally, our patients were allowed to use rescue medication (i.e., their standard treatment) because we evaluated a food supplement and not a drug. Our study was the first in human clinical trial with this specific supplement for this indication: without previous data for allergy patients, the risk to impact their quality of life (QOL) was considered too high. Therefore, we allowed the option to take rescue medication, but only when symptoms were not controlled. The need for rescue medication depended on the QOL perception of the patients. This could have impacted clear interpretations of certain effects or trends observed in this study, but was considered a valuable approach respecting the QOL of the patients.</p><p id="P18">Despite these limitations, our study provides new insights for the development of URT-targeting probiotics for AR patients and related patient groups: trafficking to the nose is possible if a slow-release formulation is chosen. In addition, this can result in measurable benefits for the patients. Our data also clearly show that a minimal treatment time of approximately two to three weeks is necessary. Probiotic/microbiome therapeutics that target the airways are thus a promising strategy for AR, alone or in combination with existing therapies, depending on the severity of the symptoms. Thus, nasal targeting probiotic/microbiome therapy warrants further investigation in respiratory allergies, especially in preventive settings and as add-on strategy to the existing medication options.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Clinical trial design</title><p id="P19">A double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed with a probiotic chewable in seasonal AR patients.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Importance</title></caption><p>Allergic rhinitis (AR) or hay fever is a highly prevalent condition, impacting nearly half the population in some countries. Supplementation of beneficial bacteria or probiotics has gained increasing attention in AR, and a key innovative way to do this is direct administration to the upper airways. Our study shows for the first time that the model probiotic strain <italic>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG can traffic to the nose in AR patients when administered via a slow-releasing chewable tablet. This trafficking is associated with local benefits in the airways, including on grass pollen-induced nasal symptoms and allergy-related cytokines.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study overview.</title><p>A) CONSORT flowchart for patient recruitment and enrollment. *Excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria (mostly because of cross allergy with house dust mite or not having a reaction on grass pollen based on SPT).
