Robust tissue size control implies the existence of compensatory mechanisms that allow developing systems to recover from growth perturbations. However, the difficulty of directly observing normal or compensatory developmental growth means we have little understanding of the cellular behaviours that confer robustness to tissue size control. Here, we study how growth perturbations affect proliferation kinetics and the timing of growth termination of <italic>Drosophila</italic> histoblasts, the progenitors that give rise to the adult abdominal epidermis. Histoblasts undergo extensive growth and proliferation during the pupal stage, which is accessible for long-term live-imaging and precise quantitative analysis. By manipulating cell number or volume prior to the pupal growth phase, we changed the starting size of the abdomen primordium, then observed how the histoblasts adapted to these changes by altering their growth dynamics. We show that, upon a decrease in starting tissue size, the histoblasts compensate by extending their temporal proliferative window, undergoing additional cell cycles, as well as increasing their apical area to maximise coverage of the abdominal surface. When initial tissue size is increased, the histoblasts undergo fewer division cycles and arrest proliferation earlier than normal. Thus, the proliferative window of this tissue is flexible enough to buffer for changes in tissue size. Our data also suggest that the histoblasts sense both spatial and temporal cues to arrest their growth at the appropriate time and ensure accurate tissue size control.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Developmental growth control in animals is essential for each tissue and organ to achieve the correct size and shape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. During development, organs grow until they reach their characteristic final size, at which time most cells stop proliferating except for stem or progenitor cells responsible for maintaining adult homeostasis and wound repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The striking robustness of body and organ size across individuals of the same species suggests that control mechanisms sense tissue size to both terminate developmental growth at the appropriate time and respond to perturbations. One example of this robustness is regenerative growth, whereby some adult and many developing tissues have the capacity to respond to acute cell loss and can regenerate an almost normal structure by formation of a regenerative blastema that undergoes growth and repatterning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Resilience in response to changes in tissue size has been experimentally investigated by manipulating the size of the primordium before its expansion to test whether the tissue is able to adapt. Early mouse embryos can be micromanipulated or disaggregated and reaggregated into morulas of larger or smaller sizes that are then transferred into pseudo-pregnant females and allowed to develop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. These studies have demonstrated that growth compensation occurs uniformly across the embryo but at different times (E5.5-6.5 for larger embryos and gastrulation or later for smaller embryos), though there are no mechanistic insights into this process. Interestingly, later during development, some organs (e.g. liver, heart) are able to undergo growth compensation in response to changes in primordium size, while others cannot (e.g. pancreas)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Compensatory, or catch-up growth has also been observed in human children following periods of growth restriction, suggesting this is a widely conserved phenomenon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Importantly, by challenging a developing system and carefully examining the parameters of compensatory growth, it should be possible to gain insights into the size-sensing mechanisms responsible for growth termination under normal conditions. However, as direct long-term observation of developmental growth remains difficult, we have very limited understanding of the cellular behaviours that allow compensatory growth and their relationship to “wild type” tissue size regulation.</p><p id="P4">The <italic>Drosophila</italic> abdominal epidermis is an ideal system to study these fundamental questions <italic>in vivo</italic>, since it is amenable to live-imaging, and we have previously developed an analysis pipeline that allows a comprehensive quantitative analysis of growth dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The adult abdominal epidermis originates from imaginal cells, specified during embryogenesis, called histoblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. These cells are arranged in small clusters (nests) embedded in the larval epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each abdominal hemisegment contains two nests located dorso-laterally (dorsal anterior and dorsal posterior), one located ventrally, and one spiracular nest located laterally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. During the larval period, the histoblasts remain quiescent and accumulate mass while arrested in G2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). At the onset of pupariation (0h After Puparium Formation - APF), a pulse of the steroid hormone ecdysone triggers the histoblasts to enter the cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. During this stage (prepupal stage) the histoblasts undergo three rapid synchronous cleavage (growthless) divisions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This first stage of cell proliferation occurs between 0-10h APF, with an average cell cycle time of ~3h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. At around 14h APF, the histoblasts begin an expansion phase where they undergo cell growth and an average of four cell divisions with a longer doubling time (~4.5h)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. During this phase, the histoblasts expand to replace the surrounding larval tissue until the fusion of the right and left side nests at the dorsal midline. The larval epithelial cells (LECs), which formed the larval epidermis, extrude basally from the epithelial layer and undergo apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. At around 24h APF, the histoblasts start to exit the cell cycle and by 30h APF most cells have stopped dividing, therefore growth termination occurs through an abrupt transition to cell cycle arrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Differentiation then takes place to form the adult abdominal epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The target tissue size (total surface the histoblasts must cover in each segment) is determined by the volume of the pupa at the end of the larval growth period. Thus, the fly abdomen is an ideal tissue to study growth compensation: we can alter starting primordium size without changing target tissue size by manipulating the number or size of histoblasts during the larval stages and observe how the cells adapt to this challenge. Using this approach, we show that the timing of proliferation arrest can change upon perturbing initial histoblast nest size: reduced histoblast number leads to delayed arrest, while increased number triggers earlier growth termination. This suggests that the histoblasts can sense tissue size and adjust the timing of growth termination to ensure the full occupancy of the abdomen surface is achieved.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Measuring growth dynamics during abdominal epidermis development</title><p id="P6">We previously created an image analysis pipeline to precisely track cells and quantify their division kinetics during abdominal epidermis growth based on imaging the junctional marker E-cad::GFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. To assess growth, volume measurements are also needed, therefore we established a method to track tissue volume as well as apical surface. We used Imaris to reconstruct the surface of the tissue (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">STAR Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A; Video S1</xref>). For the early prepupal stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) we expressed both a ubiquitous GFP and a red nuclear marker specifically in the histoblast nests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We followed the cleavage divisions until ~4h APF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S1</xref>) and observed that, as expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, tissue volume remains constant during this period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). Thus, global tissue growth rate during this period is close to zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Cells do undergo cleavage divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), leading to decreased cell size, with cells halving their size with each round of division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), which is reflected by a negative cell growth rate during this period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Next, we measured growth rates during the expansion phase, when the histoblasts divide and grow to cover the abdominal surface. We imaged both cell junctions with <italic>E-cad::mKate2</italic> and a ubiquitous GFP expressed specifically in the histoblasts for volume reconstruction from ~16h APF until ~34h APF (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">STAR Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>; Video S1). The emergence of the sensory organ precursor cells (SOPs) was used to temporally align our movies (STAR Methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D-F</xref>). During this period, the histoblasts transition from a pseudostratified columnar organisation to an unstratified cuboidal shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). We defined an anterior “no border region of interest” (noborder ROI) comprising complete lineages of anterior nest histoblasts that never contact the edge of the image frame. To calculate growth rates, we measured the volume of the noborder ROI throughout development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1G</xref>). Tissue growth rates during this period are initially high, then they level out for most of the duration of the expansion phase until they start to decrease at ~28h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1G</xref>, and S1H). The drop in tissue growth rate coincides with the time at which proliferation starts to decrease and cells transition to an arrested state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1G, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1I</xref>). At the cellular level, we observed that average cell volume remains largely constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1J</xref>) compared with the cleavage phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, in wild type animals, tissue growth starts at the transition between the cleavage and expansion divisions, before decaying as the cells enter cell cycle arrest.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>TOR inhibition reduces initial tissue size and leads to a delay in proliferation arrest</title><p id="P8">To address the ability of histoblast nests to compensate for alterations in initial tissue size, we devised experimental conditions that change histoblast number or size. We first reduced cell size by blocking TOR (target of rapamycin) signalling in the histoblasts. The TOR pathway is a conserved signalling cascade that drives cellular growth from yeast to mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Overexpression of the negative regulators TSC1 and TSC2 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1 and 2) in flies is sufficient to reduce cell growth by inhibiting the mTORC1 complex (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We blocked TOR signalling in the histoblasts by driving the expression of <italic>UAS-TSC1, UAS-TSC2</italic> transgenes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> from the embryonic stage using the <italic>esg</italic><sup><italic>NP1248</italic></sup><italic>-GAL4</italic> driver. While TOR signalling is active in control animals from 0h APF until 31h APF, as shown by the lack of expression of the <italic>unk</italic> reporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>), TSC1 and TSC2 expression in the histoblasts was able to inhibit TOR activity from 0h APF until ~21h APF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). From ~21h APF the activity of <italic>esg</italic><sup><italic>NP1248</italic></sup><italic>-GAL4</italic> driver decreases and TOR inhibition is relieved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">TOR inhibition in the histoblasts led to a reduction in tissue volume at 0h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) due to reduced cell size, while cell number was comparable to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-E</xref>). Thus, TOR signalling is not necessary for histoblast specification during embryogenesis but is required during the larval stages for histoblast cell growth. Tissue size upon TOR inhibition, although reduced, remained constant during the prepupal stage of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) with tissue growth rates close to zero as in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). However, TOR-inhibited cells largely failed to undergo cleavage divisions, maintaining a more stable volume than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C</xref>). Cell number therefore increased little in the first four hours of pupal development in contrast to controls where histoblasts divide twice during the same time span (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S2</xref>). Thus, TOR inhibition reduces cell volume growth during the larval stages and leads to a decrease in the number of early cleavage divisions during the first hours of pupal development.</p><p id="P10">Is TOR activity directly required for the cleavage divisions during the prepupal stage or do the cleavage divisions fail to occur because of reduced cell growth during the larval stages? To address this question, we performed temporally controlled TOR inhibition experiments with <italic>tub-GAL80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic> 30</sup> and used the adult abdominal phenotype as a readout. When TOR is inhibited continuously with the <italic>esg</italic><sup><italic>NP1248</italic></sup><italic>-GAL4</italic> (from embryonic stages until ~ 21h APF; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>), adult flies have a normal abdomen in terms of histoblast coverage (as visualised by the normal pattern of cuticle deposition), but the number of SOPs is reduced and spacing between them is uneven (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2D and S2E</xref>). Confining TOR inhibition from the embryonic stage to the end of the larval period results in similar adult abdominal defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F</xref>). In contrast, inhibition of TOR either from the end of larval development or during the expansion phase (from ~8-12h APF) results in a normal adult abdomen with no defects in either SOP number or pattern, although animals could not hatch, presumably because of TOR inhibition elsewhere in the animal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2H</xref>). These results suggest that the consequences of TOR inhibition on histoblast proliferation during the pupal stages are due to the absence of cell growth during larval development. Histoblasts need to accumulate Cyclin E (CycE) during the larval stages to be able to undergo the three fast cleavage divisions upon pupariation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. TOR signalling has been shown to affect CycE levels in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Inhibition of TOR in histoblasts might therefore prevent CycE accumulation during the larval period, thereby preventing rapid cleavage during the prepupal stage. In addition, TOR inhibition may impair cleavage by reducing cell volume to an extent where division is no longer possible.</p><p id="P11">We then assessed the consequences of TOR inhibition on histoblast expansion. As for wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>), we analysed the expansion phase upon inhibition of TOR signalling using long-term live imaging of cell junctions labelled with <italic>E-cad::GFP</italic>, followed by cell segmentation and tracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S2</xref>). Movies of the TOR-inhibited condition were temporally aligned to controls based on SOP emergence (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">STAR Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A, S3B</xref>). As a result of the reduction in cleavage divisions, expansion in TOR-inhibited animals starts with a lower cell number (~50 versus ~400 in controls at 16h APF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). We first examined the cell division rate (number of cell divisions per unit of time, relative to the total number of cells) from 16h APF onwards. In wild-type animals, the cell division rate shows an oscillatory behaviour with a ~4h period, with three peaks observed before starting to decrease at ~28h APF, and cell divisions stopping by ~32h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I, 2J</xref> and <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>). Upon TOR inhibition, while we still observed three oscillatory peaks in cell division rate, the final decrease in cell division rate was more gradual, with cell divisions persisting ~15h later than in control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2G, 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3C</xref>). Strikingly, while the cell cycle time (time between two divisions) is similar to wild-type cells until 28h APF, it increases up to 20h during the extended proliferation window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Is the timing of cell cycle exit affected by TOR inhibition? We computationally labelled cells as they performed their final cell division (arrested cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In wild-type animals, half of the cells are arrested at ~25h APF and after 28h APF nearly all newly created cells are arrested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1I and 2K</xref>). In the TOR-inhibited condition, cell cycle exit is considerably delayed, with half of the cells arrested at ~39h APF, and the transition to growth termination is slightly slower, as dividing cells persist until ~48h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3E-G</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To test whether the delay in cell cycle arrest correlates with a delay in covering the entire abdominal surface, we imaged the dorsal surface of the abdomen, since the replacement of the dorsal LECs occurs at the final stages of histoblast expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2K</xref>). In wild type animals, fusion of the histoblast nests at the dorsal midline occurs around 30-32h APF, consistent with previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. In TOR-inhibited animals, LEC replacement by the histoblasts was markedly delayed and continued beyond the normal time window until the histoblasts met at the midline, at ~41h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that histoblasts respond to spatial cues, delaying cell cycle exit when the abdominal segment surface has not been covered. Furthermore, we used laser ablations at 0h APF to confirm previous cauterisation experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> showing that histoblasts do not cross the dorsal midline or intersegmental boundaries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3H</xref>). This provides further evidence that histoblasts are able to sense and respect the spatial boundaries of their segment.</p><p id="P14">How is the number of divisions affected by TOR inhibition? Wild-type histoblasts undergo an average of 7 divisions during pupal development: three cleavage divisions and four expansion divisions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Only three of the expansion divisions can be live-imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), as the last cleavage and the first expansion division occur during large-scale morphogenetic movements including head eversion, which preclude continuous imaging between 4 and 16h APF. Upon TOR inhibition, the number of divisions before 16h APF was more than halved (~1.56 +/-0.5 compared with ~4.05 +/-0.3 divisions for controls during the same time period). However, we were able to observe more divisions during the expansion phase from 16h APF (~4.8 +/-0.8 divisions compared to ~2.9 +/- 0.55 in controls) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3I</xref>). Thus, TOR inhibition limits the number of cleavage divisions by reducing cell growth during the larval stages, but the histoblasts can compensate by delaying cell cycle exit and undergoing additional expansion divisions.</p><p id="P15">Is the delay in cell cycle exit sufficient to restore normal cell numbers in TOR-inhibited animals? To estimate the number of histoblasts in the anterior dorsal nest throughout the expansion phase, we extrapolated from cell numbers at 16h APF using the cell division rate information in wild-type and TOR-inhibited animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). This showed that, due to the much lower starting cell number and despite the extra rounds of expansion divisions, TOR-inhibited dorsal anterior nests only reached ~1400 cells, compared to ~3,000 for the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). As final abdominal size (estimated by measuring pupal volume) is similar to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3J</xref>), this suggests that the final abdominal epidermis is composed of fewer cells in TOR-inhibited than in wild-type animals. We observed an increase in average apical cell area in the TOR inhibition movies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>) suggesting that cells can cover a greater surface by increasing their apical surface. Finally, we also observed that cells from the ventral nest appear to be pulled into the imaging frame, also contributing to ensuring almost complete coverage of the abdominal surface by the histoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>; Video S2).</p><p id="P16">The increased apical area suggests that the histoblasts thin out in order to cover the necessary surface area in the TOR-inhibited conditions, prompting us to measure cell volume. Due to the decline in <italic>esg</italic><sup><italic>NP1248</italic></sup><italic>-GAL4</italic> expression after 21h APF, we could not measure volume by driving a cytoplasmic GFP in the TOR-inhibited animals as we had done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. We therefore used a <italic>sqh::GFP</italic> transgene to measure tissue height and calculated cell volume in the TOR inhibition condition and matching controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3K, S3L</xref>, and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">STAR methods</xref>). Cell volume was comparable to that of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). This suggests the histoblasts can indeed adopt a flatter morphology to compensate for reduced cell number. In summary, histoblasts can compensate for reduced initial primordium size by extending the length of proliferation temporal window and increasing cell area to maximise abdominal area coverage.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Reducing initial histoblast number delays the time of proliferation arrest</title><p id="P17">To independently test the idea that a reduction in histoblast nest size at the beginning of the expansion phase leads to a compensatory proliferative response, we used laser ablation to kill histoblasts at 0h APF (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">STAR methods</xref>). We eliminated both dorsal nests except one anterior nest cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). We also ablated all histoblasts from the neighbouring segments on both sides to prevent these cells from invading the analysed segment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>). We made sure the animals survived this treatment and the recovered adult animals showed a melanotic scar at the laser ablation site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Consistent with the characteristic three rounds of cleavage divisions during the initial hours of pupal development, we observed that the remaining nest was composed of 9 cells at 16h APF and the area occupied was strongly reduced when compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Video S3</xref>). The proliferation dynamics were comparable to those observed in the TOR experiment. Proliferation rates oscillated, and cell cycle times were initially similar to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). At around 30h APF, when proliferation in controls decline, the oscillations became less pronounced and cell cycle time increased up to ~9h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Cell division rates started to decrease at ~46h APF (18h later than in wild-type animals) with the last divisions taking place at ~52h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). As in the TOR experiment, the transition to cell cycle exit was considerably delayed and was more gradual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C, 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4D-F</xref>). Individual cells underwent more divisions from 16h APF (~7.2 +/- 1.3 divisions compared to ~2.9 +/- 0.55 in controls) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>), while a similar number of divisions occurred prior to the onset of the expansion phase (~3.2 divisions). Thus, cells compensate for reduced histoblast numbers by undergoing more divisions during the expansion phase. As in the TOR inhibition condition, anterior nest cell number extrapolation showed that the final cell number was reduced but apical cell area was increased when compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Together, our results show that starting the expansion phase with a smaller tissue, both upon ablation or by reducing cell size during larval development, leads to a delayed transition to cell cycle arrest and an increase in apical area.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Increasing histoblast nest size causes premature proliferation arrest</title><p id="P20">Having shown that reduced starting tissue size could delay cell cycle exit, we wished to test if increasing tissue size could have the opposite effect. Thus, we created larger tissues in an otherwise normal-sized segment by driving the expression of transgenes predicted to increase either cell number or cell size during the larval stages. We used the Gal80<sup>ts</sup> system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> to overexpress either String (Stg)/Cdc25 (a phosphatase that promotes G2/M cell cycle progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>), Yki<sup>3SA</sup> (a constitutively active form of the pro-growth transcriptional co-activator Yorkie<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>), or both, in the histoblasts during the larval stages (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">STAR Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). All the conditions tested gave rise to significantly larger tissues at the onset of metamorphosis (0h APF) and had little or no effect on animal size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B, 5C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A</xref>). While Stg overexpression increased cell number but reduced cell size, Yki<sup>3SA</sup> increased cell size without affecting cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Combining both Stg and Yki<sup>3SA</sup> expression increased cell number by a factor of ten-fold, while cell size, though decreased, was closer to the wild-type cell size than Stg overexpression alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>).</p><p id="P21">To decide which of these conditions to analyse further, we examined cell numbers and tissue area at 16h APF and found only minor changes upon driving Yki<sup>3SA</sup> or Stg expression alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5B-D</xref>). Moreover, upon driving Yki<sup>3SA</sup> expression, the cell division rate oscillated, with a similar cell cycle time and transition to arrest as control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5E-I</xref>). This suggests that cells compensate during late cleavage/early expansion to normalise tissue size and cell number, and we did not analyse these conditions further. In contrast, co-expression of both Yki<sup>3SA</sup> and Stg (Yki+Stg) elicited more pronounced phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>; Video S4). Cell division rate oscillated, with an initial cell cycle time longer than in wild-type movies, which progressively decreased to faster cycles than control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5G-H</xref>). However, we note that the final two temporal bins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref> where cells divided faster contain very few cells (9 and 2) as most had arrested by that time. The decay in the cell division rate occurred several hours earlier than control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I</xref>). Accordingly, cell cycle exit occurred earlier, as half of the cells were arrested at ~24.5h APF, compared with ~29h APF for wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5J-L</xref>). In this condition, histoblasts divided fewer times than wild-type cells. Comparing cell number at 0h APF (215 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>) and 14h APF, which marks the beginning of our expansion movie, (282 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5J</xref>) revealed that there were ~0.4 cleavage divisions in the Yki+Stg expression conditions, compared to the ~3 in controls. During our expansion imaging period, cells in the Yki+Stg animals underwent an average of 3.3 +/-0.97 divisions compared to 3.3 +/-0.80 divisions in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5K-N</xref>). However, we note that in the Yki+Stg animals, expansion started earlier than in the control judging by the temporal offset in SOP specification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S5I, J</xref>). In any case, counting the total number of divisions during the cleavage and expansion phases shows that, following larval Yki+Stg expression, the histoblasts undergo an average of 3.7 divisions instead of ~7 in the controls. Extrapolation of cell number for the anterior nest showed that there were more cells in the Yki+Stg animals than in wild-type, both at the onset of the expansion phase and at the end of tissue expansion, and cells showed a slightly increased apical cell area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5J</xref> and S5M). We also noticed an increase in the number of cells that are extruded from the epithelium upon Yki/Stg overexpression during the expansion phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5N</xref>). These results show that an increase in the initial cell number and size of the histoblast nests leads to premature proliferation arrest and therefore fewer divisions during the pupal stages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S8"><title>Abdominal histoblasts undergo compensatory proliferation</title><p id="P22">Here, we investigated the cellular mechanisms of compensatory growth by direct observation of this process in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> abdominal epidermis. Whether this tissue is capable of compensatory growth at all has been unclear. Early studies using cauterisation to kill histoblasts during larval development concluded to a weak/absent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> or “extensive” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> regenerative capacity based on the recovery of adult cuticle in partially cauterised segments. In contrast, a study using genetics to reduce the number of histoblasts specified during embryogenesis found no evidence for regulation of cell number<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. The authors used flies expressing 7 copies of the Bicoid (Bcd) morphogen, which reduced the number of histoblasts by ~38%. Rather than counting the histoblasts, the main assay used to measure the impact on final abdomen cell number was counting the sensory bristles on the dorsal cuticle, which was indeed reduced in the 7xBcd animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Our data suggest that, in animals where histoblast nest size is reduced prior to expansion, SOP selection is initiated at a time (~16-20h APF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>) when cell number is reduced, leading to fewer SOPs being selected and therefore a sparser sensory bristle pattern in adults. In agreement with this, SOP selection occurs in a very reproducible temporal window (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>) and reducing histoblast nest size by TOR inhibition during larval development leads to sparse sensory bristle distribution in the adult segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E, F</xref>). This suggests that counting SOPs is not a reliable proxy for histoblast number. Thus, we conclude that histoblasts are capable of partially regulating their proliferation capacity in response to cell number, allowing for correction of alterations in initial tissue size.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Cellular mechanisms of compensation</title><p id="P23">At present, there is limited understanding of the changes in growth kinetics that drive compensatory growth during development. For instance, thymidine incorporation in mouse embryos of reduced size (generated by removing one or two cells at the 4-cell stage) have suggested that compensation can happen both via cell cycle acceleration and divisions beyond the normal proliferative window<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Here, we have been able to extract precise growth compensation parameters in live animals. Upon reduction of histoblast nest size, either by preventing the histoblasts from growing during larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), or by partially ablating the nests at the onset of metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), we observe several compensation mechanisms. Most strikingly, in both scenarios the histoblasts can extend the length of their proliferation window by delaying growth termination by several hours. For example, when we ablate all but one cell in the anterior dorsal nest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), this cell and its progeny can undergo over 10 rounds of cell division during pupal development, compared with ~7 for control animals. If we force the histoblasts to divide during the larval stages when they are normally quiescent by expressing Yki+Stg, we can reduce the number of pupal divisions from ~7 to ~3.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, we did not observe any adjustment of cell cycle time during the normal proliferative window in response to perturbation. The histoblasts did not accelerate their divisions upon a starting tissue size reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), nor did they slow the cell cycle down when tissue size was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). This suggests that the regulatory mechanisms that compensate for histoblast nest size act primarily on the timing of cell cycle exit rather than cell cycle time (Figure 6). It is interesting to note that cell cycle time is largely stable during the expansion phase in control animals (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>), suggesting that physical or metabolic constraints may make it difficult for histoblasts to change their growth and division rates during the normal developmental growth window.</p><p id="P24">Delaying cell cycle exit is not sufficient to fully compensate for the cell number decrease upon TOR inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) and laser ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). In both cases, the histoblasts can increase their apical area to cover a larger surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H</xref>). In addition, we also observed that cells from the ventral histoblast nest appear to be pulled into the dorsal viewing area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movies S2 and S3</xref>). As cell volume is very similar between TOR-inhibited and control histoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>), increased apical area upon larval TOR inhibition is not due to a volume increase. Instead, we propose that LEC delamination subjects the reduced histoblast nests to tensile stress, which in turn increases their apical area. Indeed, LEC death has been reported to locally stretch border histoblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. It is less clear why average histoblast surface also increases upon increase in histoblast nest size by Yki+Stg overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5M</xref>). It is possible that the combination of slightly elevated whole pupal volume (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>), increased extrusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5N</xref>) and the fact that the abdomen surface appears more convoluted in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>, right panel) means that the target surface to be covered by histoblasts is larger than in controls, resulting in a larger apical area.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Regulatory inputs into histoblast numbers</title><p id="P25">Can studying compensatory growth inform us about the cues that control growth termination in a wild-type tissue? The ability of histoblasts to change the timing of cell cycle exit depending on starting tissue size suggests that they can sense either tissue volume, or the spatial boundaries of the abdominal segment. This type of tissue size sensing could take the form of a secreted molecule, such as a growth antagonist (chalone) that could stop proliferation once a critical tissue volume is reached<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Cell division can be influenced by geometric or mechanical constraints, since cells with a larger surface area or experiencing tensile stress are generally more likely to divide than cells with a smaller area or under compression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. However, this is unlikely to be the spatial signal in the abdominal epidermis, because there is no correlation between histoblast geometry and cell cycle time, and tensile stress does not decrease in this tissue during growth termination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.

It is therefore possible that these boundary cells act as spatial organisers of proliferation, either by preventing premature mixing of histoblasts from neighbouring segments, or by actively signalling to the histoblasts.</p><p id="P26">Although reduction in starting tissue size leads to a delay in cell cycle exit, the cell cycle progressively slows down as the histoblasts divide beyond their normal proliferative window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Thus, as development proceeds, histoblasts become less able to divide, suggesting a temporal input into growth termination. One possible mechanism may be limiting nutrient availability. During pupal life, the animal is not feeding and therefore relies on stores accumulated during larval stages to support metamorphosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. It is therefore conceivable that nutrients become scarce as pupal development proceeds, providing a temporal brake on histoblast proliferation.

However, in histoblasts, reduction of TOR activity during the expansion phase did not appear to affect abdominal segment size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting distinct mechanisms may be at play in this system.</p><p id="P27">Interestingly, although cell cycle time remains mostly constant during histoblast expansion (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>), we consistently observe a slight increase after 26h APF when the majority of cells have arrested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). Upon TOR inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>) or laser ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), cell cycle times closely mirror this increase, before further rising as cells proliferate long beyond the normal temporal window. This cell cycle slowdown in controls may therefore represent the temporal regulatory input starting to come into play before another (spatial) signal leads to cell cycle exit, consistent with the possibility that at least two signals are functioning redundantly to promote timely histoblast growth termination.

To count cell numbers for each timepoint, we used the Cell Counter ImageJ/Fiji Plugin (K. de Vos). For volume quantification of the histoblasts during the expansion phase (16h - 36h APF) we drove the expression of <italic>UAS-EGFP</italic> throughout development while imaging cell junctions with <italic>E-cad::mKate2</italic>.

This ROI only considers those cells we can follow during the entire movie and using the outline of the ROI, we removed the fluorescence signal from those cells that either leave the field of view later in the movie or that come into the field of view from the neighbouring segments. We overlaid the skeletonised image with the EGFP image to delete what is not part of the ROI. This was done for each timepoint separately using a custom-made ImageJ/Fiji macro.</p><p id="P40">In both early prepupal movies as well as later pupal movies, EGFP images were binarized and saved as individual timepoints. These images were then imported to Imaris 9.5.1 for surface processing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A; Video S1</xref>). In Imaris, the Surface tool was used to quantify tissue volume. The surface detail value used was 0.415<italic>μ</italic>m with absolute intensity used for thresholding. The lower limit threshold value was then manually adjusted. After generating the final surface, a step of manual processing was carried out (using the Edit tab) so that non-histoblast tissue expressing EGFP was excluded from the analysis (such as removing the underlying hemocytes). Using the Statistics tab in Imaris, we extracted the tissue volume values for each timepoint. We then calculated the average cell volume by dividing the total volume by the number of cells for each timepoint. Relative growth rate was calculated as the tissue/cell volume difference between two timepoints divided by the tissue/cell volume at the first time point, divided by the time difference between the two timepoints.</p><sec id="S25"><title><italic>sqh::GFP</italic> movies to extrapolate cell volume using tissue height</title><p id="P41">The <italic>E-cad::mKate2</italic> cell junction marker was used to quantify cell number, tissue area, and cell area.

We used the <italic>sqh::GFP</italic> images to quantify tissue height every hour. For each timepoint, we used six cross-sections along the dorso-ventral axis to measure the height of the histoblast nests. For consistency, the positions along the anterior-posterior axis of all cross-sections were the same, starting at y=300 until y=800, with 100 pixels distance between each one (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3J</xref>). For each cross-section, we measured the area and the width of the tissue. By dividing the area by the width, we calculate the average height for each cross-section. We obtained the height for each developmental time by averaging the height of the six cross-sections for that specific timepoint. We then calculated the average cell volume by multiplying the height by the average area for each timepoint.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Quantification of pupal volume</title><p id="P42">Pictures were taken with a Zeiss Discovery V20 stereo microscope.
