Recent theoretical suggestions have highlighted the usefulness of explicit structural representations that are fully divorced from sensory details for generalisation. Rodent work has suggested that abstraction of structure occurs gradually, over time, in cortex. However, direct evidence of such explicit relational representations in humans is scarce, and its relationship to consolidation mechanisms is underexplored. Here, we use a graph-learning paradigm to find such a relational map in the human medial prefrontal cortex. Importantly, this representation was absent early after learning but emerged on the time scale of days. These results shed new light on neural representations underlying the remarkable human ability to draw accurate inferences from little data.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Humans and other animals constantly find themselves in situations they have never experienced before. How does our brain manage to choose adaptive behaviors given this diversity of experiences? Luckily, our world is replete with statistical structure, and similar relationships hold across related experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Shepard, 1987</xref>). If the brain effectively extracts and organizes information about the statistical relationships between experiences - forming what is known as a “cognitive map” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Behrens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Tolman, 1948</xref>) - it can generalize knowledge from one experience to similar situations.</p><p id="P3">While cognitive maps may initially form for specific stimuli or environments, they can also support more abstract forms of learning. This allows for the generalization of knowledge across different situations that follow a similar structure. This type of abstraction has been described in various ways: as a “schema” in human behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bartlett, 1932</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Piaget, 1948</xref>) and memory research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Ghosh and Gilboa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Tse et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">2011</xref>); as “learning set” in animal learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Harlow, 1949</xref>); and as “transfer learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bozinovski and Fulgosi, 1976</xref>) and “meta-learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) in machine learning.</p><p id="P4">One particularly effective way of achieving this abstraction is by separating (or “factorizing”) the representation of the relational structure of the environment from its specific sensory details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Behrens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Whittington et al., 2020</xref>). A potential locus for such an abstracted representation is the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which has been implicated in recognising commonalities across experiences in the schema literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Baldassano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">El-Gaby et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gilboa and Marlatte, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">van Kesteren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Tse et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">2011</xref>) and using these for inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Zeithamova and Preston, 2010</xref>), as well as in concept learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kumaran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mack et al., 2020</xref>), structural generalisation of reinforcement learning problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Baram et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Samborska et al., 2022</xref>) and generalisation of spatial tasks across different paths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kaefer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Morrissey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Tang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Yu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In addition, a recent line of research, inspired by celebrated findings from rodent studies in spatial cognition, has shed new light on the relational and structural properties of mPFC codes. Like the entorhinal cortex, the human mPFC contains grid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Jacobs et al., 2013</xref>), which are active on a regular triangular lattice during spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, grid cells maintain their cell-to-cell activity covariance structure across different spatial environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Barry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Fyhn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting they encode the statistical relationships common to all spatial environments, irrespective of specific sensory details. Complementary theoretical work suggests grid cells represent an efficient compression of the transition structure of 2D environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Banino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Behrens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dordek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">George et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Mathis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Stachenfeld et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Whittington et al., 2020</xref>). Such a representation is highly useful for generalisation to novel tasks with the same 2D structure.</p><p id="P6">Notably, this phenomenon extends beyond spatial environments. A flurry of studies using a technique to indirectly index grid cell activity (hexadirectional coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Doeller et al., 2010</xref>)) suggests that the same brain network (broadly referred to as the “default mode network”) that displays “grid-like” activity during spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Doeller et al., 2010</xref>) also displays it during navigation to novel “locations” in a wide range of non-spatial and abstract 2D tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bongioanni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Constantinescu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Veselic et al., 2023</xref>). In most of these studies, the strongest grid-like signals emerge in the pregenual mPFC, suggesting this region encodes the 2D relational structure in these tasks. While these studies focused on 2D environments, theory suggests the 2D grid representation is merely a special case of abstract structural encoding applicable to a much wider range of task structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Whittington et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">2022</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The mPFC has also been implicated in a related, yet distinct literature on the consolidation of memories. Influential theoretical ideas suggest that during consolidation (i.e. on the time scale of days or weeks) cortex abstracts structural knowledge across multiple memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kumaran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>), with neural replay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Foster, 2017</xref>) playing a key role in the process. Recent additions to this theory suggest mechanisms by which replay can be tuned to balance the trade-off between memorisation and generalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Sun et al., 2023</xref>). The mPFC has emerged as an important area for this process of abstraction over multiple days. For example, mPFC activity in rats initially reflects specific perceptual features of learnt associations, and only later encodes generalisable relational features that are shared between associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Morrissey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Richards et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Tse et al., 2011</xref>). However, the extent to which similar dynamics apply in humans remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Tompary and Davachi, 2017</xref>), and a more precise understanding of the form of such abstract representations has remained elusive.</p><p id="P8">Here, we hypothesized that the mPFC abstracts an explicit relational representation of the environment over the course of multiple days. We used fMRI adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Barron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Grill-Spector and Malach, 2001</xref>) and representational similarity analysis (RSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Nili et al., 2014</xref>) to assess whether such an abstract map emerges after training participants extensively on two graph structures with the same underlying structure. Graphs were defined by the associations between objects. After training, we tested the representation of the two graphs in two scanning sessions separated in time by up to one week. The objects and the graphs were identical in both contexts, but pairwise distances between objects were decorrelated through the distribution of the objects on the two graphs. This allowed us to simultaneously test where in the human brain the currently task-relevant map and the currently task-irrelevant map are represented. Crucially, we were also able to test for an abstracted map representation which reflects the underlying graph structure, irrespective of the specific stimuli associated with a node.</p><p id="P9">We found that the medial temporal lobe represented the relevant and irrelevant graphs from the first scanning session, whereas mPFC represented this information in the later scanning session. Importantly, in addition to the two specific graphs, a representation of the relational structure that was independent of the specific stimulus identities emerged in the mPFC over time. This was corroborated in two fully independent analyses, demonstrating that mPFC slowly extracted an abstracted map that could presumably be rapidly transferred to facilitate learning in new, but similarly structured situations.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Subjects learn and flexibly switch between two cognitive maps</title><p id="P10">We designed a task to examine how the representation of abstract cognitive maps changes over on the timescale of days. 23 participants were extensively trained on the relationships between a set of objects, each forming a graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Importantly, the two graphs shared the same non-symmetric structure and differed only in terms of the distribution of objects across the graph’s nodes. Each object’s position on the blue graph thus corresponded to a unique object in the same position on the red graph. The objects were distributed such that pairwise distances between the objects were uncorrelated across the two graphs.</p><p id="P11">Participants performed different tasks online, aimed at teaching them the pairwise associations between objects as well as sequences through the graph (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). The underlying structure of the graph was not made explicit. Each graph was learned separately on two subsequent days to minimize interference. On a third day of training, participants repeated most of the tasks for both contexts to ensure that they learned to rapidly switch between graphs in a context-dependent manner. In all tasks, the relevant graph was indicated by the context, i.e. a red or blue background image (order counterbalanced across subjects).</p><p id="P12">After three subsequent days of learning the object relationships, we presented subjects with sequences of objects in the scanner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The first scanning session took place on the day after participants completed the training (day 4). The second scanning session took place between one day and one week after the first scanning session. The task in the scanner involved frequent context switches. The relevant context was always signaled by the same background color that subjects had learned to associate with a particular graph’s object distribution during the training procedure. On 12.5% of trials (once after each object), participants were asked to indicate by a button press which one of two presented objects could be reached in fewer steps from a preceding object on the currently relevant graph (<italic>choice</italic> trials). The purpose of this cover task was to keep participants’ attention focused on the embedding of each presented object within its graph structure.</p><p id="P13">Participants learned the graph structures very well, as demonstrated in a subset of participants (n = 19), who were asked to arrange both sets of objects relative to one another in an arena after the last scanning session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). The pairwise distances in this arrangement correlated strongly with the ‘true’ link distance matrix between pairs of objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, t<sub>18</sub> = 6.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for Graph 1, and t<sub>18</sub> = 6.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for Graph 2, based on Fisher-transformed correlation coefficients). Moreover, the correlation strengths between the two graph structures correlated with each other (r = 0.57, p = 0.01, based on Fisher-transformed correlation coefficients) and were not significantly different from each other (t<sub>18</sub> = 0.25, <italic>p</italic> = 0.81, based on Fisher-transformed correlation coefficients). These results suggest that participants encoded both graph structures equally well. Indeed, we could recover both graph structures by applying multi-dimensional scaling to the distance matrix averaged across subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">More importantly, participants also used their knowledge about the graph structures to solve the task in the scanner. Performance in the choice task was significantly above chance in both sessions (both p &lt; 0.001), with an improvement in performance from scanning session 1 to 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, t<sub>21</sub> = 2.09, p = 0.049). Across the two sessions performance in the choice task was highly correlated with performance in the post-scan arena task (r = 0.67, p = 0.002), suggesting that participants who had learned the graph structures particularly well benefitted the most from this knowledge in the scanner.</p><p id="P15">In a logistic mixed-effects model, with subject included as a random effect, the likelihood of choosing the left or right option was significantly influenced by the difference in distances between the target object and the objects on either side. The difference in distances on the relevant graph between the target object and the chosen object had a strong positive effect on the likelihood of choosing a given option (Coef = 0.747, SE = 0.031, z = 24.121, p &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). This suggests that participants were more likely to choose the option on the side that was closer to the target object on the relevant graph. A smaller, yet significant, effect was also observed for the difference in distances on the irrelevant graph between the target object and the two options (Coef = 0.067, SE = 0.024, z = 2.785, p = 0.005). This indicates that the irrelevant graph also had a measurable, though smaller, influence on decision-making compared to the relevant graph</p><p id="P16">In a mixed-effects model with subject included as a random effect, the distance between the target object and the chosen object on the relevant graph had a strong positive effect on response time (Coef = 3.602, SE = 0.126, z = 28.523, p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, the distance between the target object and the unchosen object on the relevant graph also had a significant positive effect on response time (Coef = 0.860, SE = 0.133, z = 6.444, p &lt; 0.001). These results indicate that the length of mental simulation on the relevant graph, both from the chosen and unchosen options to the target, contributed significantly to longer response times. There was also a modest positive effect of the distance between the target object and the chosen object on the irrelevant graph (Coef = 0.248, SE = 0.118, z = 2.090, p = 0.037), suggesting some influence of irrelevant graph knowledge on response times. However, the distance between the target object and the unchosen object on the irrelevant graph did not significantly affect response times (Coef = -0.112, SE = 0.120, z = -0.939, p = 0.348).</p><p id="P17">Next, we examined whether these effects of graph distances on response times in the scanner correlated with explicit knowledge of the graphs. We ran a separate regression for each participant (predicting, again, response times with the chosen and unchosen distances on the relevant and irrelevant graphs), and correlated across subjects the resulting parameter estimates with an index of performance in the arena task - the correlation coefficients between the arena distances and “true” distances. We found that both the distance to the chosen object and the distance to the unchosen object on the relevant graph had a stronger influence on response times for participants who performed better in the arena task (chosen: r = 0.61, p = 0.006; unchosen: r = 0.48, p = 0.04, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I, K</xref>). This suggests that participants with a better understanding of the graph structures used this knowledge more effectively to solve the choice task.</p><p id="P18">Notably, the effect of distance to the chosen object on the irrelevant graph was negatively correlated with arena task performance (r = -0.62, p = 0.005, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>), indicating that participants who knew the graph structures well were less distracted by irrelevant information. We found no significant correlation between performance in the arena task and the effect of unchosen distance on the irrelevant graph on response times, r = -0.33, p = 0.16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2L</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Together, these behavioral results suggest that participants had acquired and used structural knowledge about the relationships between objects to solve the cover task.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Representations of both the relevant and irrelevant maps in the MTL-mPFC circuit</title><p id="P20">To solve this context-dependent task, the brain must represent the object-embedded graph that is currently relevant in each trial. Multiple studies have shown that the MTL represents such associative graphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mark et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Schapiro et al., 2013</xref>) when these are task-relevant. Importantly, we have previously shown that MTL also represents such graphs even when learnt implicitly, and when subjects were engaged in a task for which the graph structure was irrelevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Garvert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Tacikowski et al., 2024</xref>). We thus hypothesised that the MTL might simultaneously represent both the currently relevant and irrelevant graphs.</p><p id="P21">To test this, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) repetition suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Grill-Spector and Malach, 2001</xref>) – a technique which relies on the assumption that the subsequent presentation of stimuli leads to a suppressed response that scales with the distance in the representational space where the stimuli are embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Barron et al., 2016</xref>). We reasoned that in regions encoding a map-like representation of the relevant graph, the degree of similarity in neural representation should decrease as a function of distance (number of edges) between items on this graph. This would suggest that on <italic>stay</italic> trials, where the context remains the same on consecutive trials, the amount of fMRI adaptation in response to a given object should scale with the distance to the immediately preceding object on the same graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). On the other hand, in regions encoding a map-like representation of the irrelevant graph, the amount of fMRI adaptation in response to the same object should scale with the distance to the immediately preceding object on the other (currently irrelevant) graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Based on this reasoning, we first looked for brain regions whose fMRI responses to each object increased as a linear function of the number of links from the preceding object on both the relevant and the irrelevant graphs. Since pairwise object distances were orthogonalized across the two graphs, we were able to look at their representation simultaneously, in the same GLM. Note that in all fMRI analyses we focused only on the object presentation trials, modelling out the choice catch trials.</p><p id="P22">We modelled the onset of objects on <italic>stay</italic> trials for each context separately from the onsets of objects on <italic>switch</italic> trials. We added two parametric modulators to each object onset regressor, one corresponding to the number of links between a given object and the previously presented object on the currently relevant graph, and one corresponding to the corresponding distance on the irrelevant graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). A contrast identifying both relevant and irrelevant distances on <italic>stay</italic> trials across both sessions identified a cluster in the left medial temporal lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A</xref>). This cluster survived family wise error (FWE) small-volume correction (SVC) within a bilateral entorhinal cortex/subiculum mask (mask from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Garvert et al., 2017</xref>) <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>, p = 0.03 corrected at peak level, peak t<sub>22</sub> = 4.39, [-24, -22, -28]), and trended towards significance when SVC was performed in a larger MTL mask comprising bilateral hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and entorhinal cortex (p = 0.053 corrected at peak level, peak t<sub>22</sub> = 4.94, [-26, -22, -28], mask from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>, see masks in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P23">When analyses were performed separately for the two scanning sessions, a similar cluster in the left MTL emerged as the cortical region with the strongest representation of both relevant and irrelevant distances in session 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, SVC at peak level in the larger mask of bilateral MTL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2b</xref>), p = 0.02, peak t<sub>22</sub> = 5.47, [-26, -22, -28]). We did not find any similar cluster in MTL in session 2 that survived SVC. However, within the cluster of the session 1 effect, the parameter estimates of both maps were still significant in session 2, (t<sub>21</sub> = 2.53, p = 0.02, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>), suggesting that the MTL represents both maps in both sessions.</p><p id="P24">When the analysis was restricted to session 2, a large cluster emerged in mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, whole-brain FWE-corrected on the cluster level, p = 0.01, [6 44 -8]). We did not find any cluster in mPFC for session 1, and session 1 parameter estimates extracted from an ROI based on the session 2 cluster were not significant (t<sub>21</sub> = 0.49, p = 0.62, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3C</xref>), suggesting this effect was absent in session 1. This suggests that the mPFC comes to represent relevant and irrelevant graph distances over time, possibly as a result of consolidation mechanisms occurring over multiple days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">van Kesteren et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Next, we tested for the behavioral relevance of these MTL-mPFC representations of the relevant and irrelevant graphs. Across subjects, we correlated the performance in the arena task with the parameter estimates in the MTL cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, parameter estimates averaged across both sessions) or the mPFC cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, parameter estimates from session 2). We found that the session 2 BOLD correlate of the irrelevant distances in mPFC predicted performance in the arena task (r = 0.55, p = 0.01 for graph 1 and r = 0.48, p = 0.04 for graph 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). No such relationship could be found for the session 2 mPFC representation of relevant distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) or for the MTL cluster. One interpretation of this result is that subjects who knew the graphs better might have actively suppressed the irrelevant graph – with the stronger mPFC irrelevant graph representation being an index to this suppression.</p><p id="P26">Interestingly, visual inspection of the parameter estimates from the MTL “both maps, both sessions” cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>) suggests that in session 2 there is a stronger representation of the irrelevant graph than the relevant graph, though this difference was not significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). We hypothesized that an active suppression of the irrelevant graph should be most prominent immediately after a context switch, when the recently relevant graph requires the most suppression. To explore whether this is indeed the case, we split the <italic>stay</italic> trials to either those immediately preceded by a <italic>switch</italic> trial, or those which were further away from a <italic>switch</italic> trial. A 2x2 ANOVA with the factors “relevance” and “distance from <italic>switch</italic>”, performed separately on parameter estimates from both sessions and in both the MTL and mPFC ROIs, revealed a significant interaction for the MTL cluster in session 2 (F<sub>1,21</sub> = 5.12, p = 0.03, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). This suggests that in session 2 the irrelevant graph representation in the MTL was stronger immediately after a switch – precisely when suppression of the recently relevant, but now irrelevant graph was most necessary.</p><p id="P27">Together, the results so far suggest that the MTL represents knowledge about the specific graph structures in both sessions, whereas this representation emerges in mPFC only in session 2. In both cases, relevant and irrelevant graphs are represented simultaneously, although irrelevant distances appear to be represented more strongly session 2, possibly reflecting behaviorally relevant active suppression of the irrelevant information.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>A generalisable abstract map in the mPFC</title><p id="P28">The medial prefrontal cortex, where knowledge about relevant and irrelevant object-embedding graphs emerges over time, is known to abstract the commonalities across experiences and represent schematic knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Baldassano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">El-Gaby et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gilboa and Marlatte, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Samborska et al., 2022</xref>).

Such abstract structure representations could be useful for transferring structural knowledge to new situations and thereby speed up learning.</p><p id="P29">In the context of our experiment, such structure-coding would suggest the presence of an abstract map that ignores the specific context a stimulus is presented in. To test for an abstract graph representation, we defined a cross-map distance as the distance between the position of the currently presented object on its map and the position of the preceding object on the other map on <italic>switch</italic> trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Such a cross-map suppression effect would only be expected in brain areas that represent structure explicitly, and separately from the stimuli themselves. Brain areas that encode the relationships between stimuli in a context-dependent manner would show the representation of the relevant or irrelevant maps, but no cross-map suppression effect.</p><p id="P30">A whole-brain analysis across sessions identified a significant cluster representing cross-map distances in mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, FWE-corrected on the cluster level, p = 0.003, [2, 42, 8]). This effect is driven by an emergence of a cross-map suppression effect in session 2: No cluster survives corrections for multiple comparisons when the analysis is restricted to session 1, whereas a strong cross-map suppression effect can be observed in mPFC in session 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, FWE-corrected on the cluster level, p &lt; 0.001, [2, 44, 8]). This is confirmed in an independent analysis where parameter estimates are extracted directly from a region-of-interest defined based on the existence of a relevant and irrelevant graph representation in <italic>stay</italic> trials in session 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Within this ROI we find a significant cross-map suppression effect in session 2 (t<sub>21</sub> = 2.1, p = 0.048), but not in session 1 (t<sub>21</sub> = -0.2, p = 0.85). While these indirect repetition suppression effects do not allow us to make any inference about the particular types of cells involved in this representation, it is notable that these cross-map suppression effects are stronger in those parts of mPFC that were shown to display grid-like coding of abstract relationships in session 2 (t<sub>21</sub> = 2.86, p = 0.01) but not in session 1 (t<sub>21</sub> = 0.09, p = 0.93, difference between session 2 and session 1: t<sub>21</sub> = 2.38, p = 0.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Constantinescu et al., 2016</xref>)).</p><p id="P31">If the mPFC reflects abstract structure knowledge rather than two separate graphs, then such a representation would additionally predict the presence of a position code, where objects that share the same position on the two graphs have a more similar representation to each other than to all other objects. Since position repeats on <italic>switch</italic> trials were very infrequent, this analysis cannot be performed using repetition suppression. Instead, we used representational similarity analysis (RSA), which enables us to compare the similarity of neural representations across voxels between conditions, using data from all non-choice trials (Figure 6A, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</xref>). We performed this analysis on the cortical surface to ensure that only adjacent cortical voxels are included together in the same searchlight.</p><p id="P32">In session 1, a whole-cortex searchlight analysis revealed no position code in any part of the brain. However, in session 2, various prefrontal clusters emerged, including an mPFC cluster that overlaps with the region where we found a cross-map suppression effect in session 2 (Figure 6B). To directly confirm that a cross-map suppression effect and a position code emerged in the same region of mPFC, we extracted parameter estimates for the cross-map suppression effect from a ROI defined based on a significant position code transformed back into volumetric MNI space (Figure 6C). We found that indeed in this region, no cross-map suppression effect was present in session 1 (t<sub>22</sub> = 0.92, p = 0.37), but an effect emerged in session 2 (t<sub>21</sub> = 2.65, p = 0.02). Notably, the fMRI suppression-based cross-map suppression effect and the multivariate position code measure very different aspects of the BOLD signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Barron et al., 2016</xref>). It is striking that both effects emerge in the same part of the mPFC, and in both cases only in session 2. Taken together, these converging results point to an abstract representation of task structure that emerges in mPFC in session 2, following consolidation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P33">Here, we used a graph-learning paradigm to investigate how abstract relational structures are represented in the brain and how these representations change over time. Participants learned two different graphs characterized by the same underlying associative structures, but a different distribution of stimuli. The retrieval of the graphs initially depended on the MTL, but over the course of several days became dependent on the prelimbic region of the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Takehara et al., 2003</xref>). By that point in time, an additional cross-map suppression effect as well as a position code emerged in the mPFC, pointing to the emergence of an abstract, stimulus-independent structural representation that was absent in session 1. Separating the representation of task structure from stimuli is useful, because it facilitates the generalisation of knowledge across environments that share the same statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Behrens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mark et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Whittington et al., 2020</xref>). If task knowledge is organised in such a factorised form, then solutions to new tasks do not have to be learnt afresh, they can instead be inferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Behrens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Mark et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P34">While the mPFC has been implicated in many human studies probing schematic and structural encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Baldassano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Baram et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Van Kesteren et al., 2010</xref>) as well as in the human cognitive maps literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Schapiro et al., 2013</xref>), to our knowledge this is the first time the changes in such an explicit abstract map following consolidation have been investigated. Our results suggest that knowledge about the graph structures continues to be processed after the first scan even in the absence of further training and becomes more abstract over time. This is in line with theories of systems consolidation positing that memories change qualitatively after acquisition, from an encoding of specific episodic information to the abstraction of statistical structure that is shared between episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Richards et al., 2014</xref>). In this way, the neocortex gradually builds semantic knowledge of the world in a process that can take many weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">O’Reilly and McClelland, 1994</xref>). In rodents, such consolidation effects in the mPFC manifest themselves in a gradual loss of selectivity for perceptual features characterizing specific stimuli and an increase in the representation of relational features that are shared between stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Morrissey et al., 2017</xref>). In humans, featural overlap between memories was represented in mPFC (as well as hippocampus) one week after, but not immediately after encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Tompary and Davachi, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Indeed, memory reactivation during sleep plays a critical role in extracting rules and identifying abstract patterns across experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Robertson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Stickgold and Walker, 2013</xref>). A potential mechanism that might be involved in this abstraction is neural replay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Foster, 2017</xref>), which in humans reorganises experiences according to pre-learnt structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Replay also contains abstract structural codes in addition to the sensory ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) and has been shown to be constrained by the structure of the task in a way that guides relational inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Schwartenbeck et al., 2023</xref>). Recent work suggests that the amount of replay of specific experiences depends on the reliability versus generalisability of the environment, thus balancing the trade-off between memory and generalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Sun et al., 2023</xref>). Future work might explore a direct relationship between replay and the structural mPFC representations such as those we find here.</p><p id="P36">It is worth noting that while the session 2 mPFC representation of the relevant and irrelevant maps on <italic>stay</italic> trials can be interpreted as the result of the same abstract representation we find on <italic>switch</italic> trials, we cannot rule out the possibility that the mPFC additionally represents the specific maps and their sensory details. This is reminiscent of recent findings in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">El-Gaby et al., 2023</xref>) where mPFC cells implemented an algorithm that instantaneously represents the entire sequence of future behavioural steps (and hence bound to the particularities of the current task at hand) in a manner that was flexible and reconfigurable between many tasks with the same structure (and hence inherently relational and abstract).</p><p id="P37">While not the focus of the current manuscript, it is worth noting the rapid context-switching task subjects experienced in the scanner can be related to other proposed functions of the prefrontal cortex, such as cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>). Indeed, the ventromedial PFC contain rich representations of context and its associated value of both relevant and irrelevant contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Moneta et al., 2023</xref>). However, we do not believe our effects of cross-map and position representations can be explained as cognitive control signals.</p><p id="P38">Another possible view on such context-switching tasks is through the lens of spatial cognition. In remapping experiments with rapid context switching (“teleporting”), the hippocampal representation rapidly flickers between the representations of both contexts, effectively implementing an inference process of the current context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Jezek et al., 2011</xref>). While our manuscript does not focus on the hippocampus, we note that our MTL effect (partly including hippocampus) of the relevant and irrelevant maps is compatible with such a remapping effect, as a representation of a relevant map (which is strong particularly in session 1, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>) is indeed what is expected from hippocampal remapping.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P39">Twenty-three volunteers (aged 18 – 32 years, mean age ± standard deviation 23.2 ± 3.8 years, 14 female) participated in this study.

(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure 2B</xref>). Activations in other brain regions were only considered significant at a level of p&lt;0.001 uncorrected if they survived whole-brain FWE correction at the cluster level (p&lt;0.05). While no areas survived this stringent correction for multiple comparisons, other regions are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> at an uncorrected threshold of p&lt;0.01 for completeness. While we used masks to correct for multiple comparisons in our ROI, all statistical parametric maps presented in the manuscript are unmasked. All the clusters used in the manuscripts for extraction of (independent) parameter estimates were obtained by thresholding at t=2.5.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Representational similarity analysis</title><p id="P61">Representational similarity analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</xref>) was performed on the surface in subject space. We first ran a GLM where we modelled the presentation of each object in one of the graphs as a different condition (without any distinction between <italic>stay</italic> or <italic>switch</italic> trials). We used Freesurfer on the T1 scans to create a gray matter surface map and then used a searchlight procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kriegeskorte et al., 2006</xref>) to compute representational dissimilarities for each coordinate on the surface. The searchlight size was defined such that each coordinate reflected the representational dissimilarity for up to 100 voxels within a 10 mm radius around it. Representational dissimilarity was computed as the Euclidian distances between voxel patterns after spatially whitening the data within the searchlight (i.e. the Mahalanobis distance, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Walther et al., 2016</xref>)). This was computed separately for each subject, session and block. To obtain one RDM per subject and session, RDMs were averaged across the four blocks. The average neural RDM was then related to each model RDM using Kendall’s tau-a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Nili et al., 2014</xref>)</p><p id="P62">Each whole-brain map coordinate [x,y] thus contained the correlation of the brain’s dissimilarity matrix with a model RDM when that coordinate is in the centre of the searchlight. To compute group statistics, we moved each map into the fsaverage space, smoothed the maps and ran PALM (Permutation Analysis of Linear Models), a tool that allows inference on the surface using permutation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Winkler et al., 2014</xref>). Results are considered significant if they survive FWE-correction at p = 0.05.</p><p id="P63">Model RDMs were a 34x34 matrix of ones, with zeros at positions that corresponded to the same position.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS199371-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d44aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>T.B. is supported by a Wellcome Principal Research Fellowship (219525/Z/19/Z), a Wellcome Collaborator award (214314/Z/18/Z), a JS McDonnell Foundation award (JSMF220020372), and by the Jean Francois and Marie-Laure de Clermont Tonerre Foundation.
