The Malaysian stalk-eyed fly (<italic>Teleopsis dalmanni)</italic> sex-ratio (SR) meiotic drive system is located within a series of large inversions on the X chromosome subject to low recombination and is associated with deleterious effects on fitness. Here we examine the metabolic effects of meiotic drive across male and female stalk-eyed flies. High-resolution O2k respirometry coupled with whole-organism respirometry were used to obtain mitochondrial function and metabolic rates. Complimentary assays on food consumption established downstream effects of metabolism on nutrient acquisition. The experiments demonstrate that individuals with SR meiotic drive elements have impaired mitochondrial function and reduced capacity for ATP synthesis, as shown by a lower respiratory control ratio and weaker contribution of Complex I to respiration. Drive individuals also exhibited an increased basal metabolic rate and consumed a greater amount of food than wild-type individuals. These findings show that the drive genotype imposes metabolic costs in both male and female hosts. The disruption in mitochondrial function likely leads to compensation via an increase in both basal metabolic rate and nutrient acquisition. A potential cause lies in the accumulation of deleterious mutations in the inversions on the X chromosome that house the meiotic drive, which are subject to weak natural selection. In females, the drive chromosome has a dominant effect, with a single copy causing substantial metabolic compromise. There was little evidence of male-specific metabolic costs, nor evidence of an accumulation of sexually antagonistic effects of drive chromosomes on female metabolism. These results suggest that direct metabolic costs from meiotic drive on spermatogenesis and from sexually antagonistic selection are relatively weak. This research provides new insight into the interplay between meiotic drive and metabolism, drawing attention to the broader physiological repercussions selfish genetic elements may have on their hosts.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Stalk-eyed fly</kwd><kwd>meiotic drive</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>respiration</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>Complex I</kwd><kwd>chromosome inversion</kwd><kwd>selfish genetic element</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Meiotic drivers are one of the most well-studied classes of selfish genetic elements that break Mendel’s law of equal segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Lindholm et al., 2016</xref>). They have been identified on the autosomes and the sex chromosomes—the latter being well-documented owing to the resulting bias in progeny sex ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Hurst et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Jaenike, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Sutter et al., 2015</xref>). Meiotic drive occurs via the preferential segregation toward the egg nucleus away from the polar bodies in females or through disabling non-carrier gametes post-meiotically in males to facilitate a transmission advantage of the drive allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Courret et al., 2019</xref>). This loss of sperm typically results in direct costs to the organism because of the dysfunction or loss of gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Price et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Sutter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Zanders et al., 2019</xref>). Fertility reduction is particularly strong under conditions of sperm competition, both in defensive and offensive roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Atlan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Price et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P3">A range of indirect organismal costs are associated with male meiotic drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Lindholm et al., 2016</xref>). Loss of viability has been demonstrated in a range of species, both in females homozygous and heterozygous for drive alleles, as well as in drive-carrying males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Curtsinger et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Dyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Finnegan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Larner et al., 2019</xref>). These costs are thought to originate from the notion that drivers tend to position within low-frequency chromosomal inversions or other genomic regions subject to reduced recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Jaenike, 2001</xref>), resulting in weak selection and the accumulation of a high deleterious mutational load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Berdan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kirkpatrick, 2010</xref>). In addition, the hemizygosity of the X chromosome means that recessive effects are selected more strongly in males than in females (both for and against) until homozygotes become more common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Carazo, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Gibson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Innocenti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Ruzicka et al., 2019</xref>). This is predicted to lead to the enrichment of sexually antagonistic alleles on driving X chromosomes that benefit male over female fitness, with the greatest loss to female fitness in homozygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Rydzewski et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The magnitude and direction of direct and indirect costs of meiotic drive and their associated inversions have rarely been subjected to explicit empirical investigation. A means to gauge these costs is to examine the effects on metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">David et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Shaar-Moshe et al., 2019</xref>). Metabolism and metabolic traits are fundamental to life history trait evolution, capturing the rate at which organisms transform and expend finite energy into growth, maintenance and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Jonsson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Larivée et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Sinclair, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, metabolism is a useful “intermediate phenotype”, positioned between the level of the genotype and traditionally measured morphological and behavioural traits that contribute to fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cameron et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Pettersen et al., 2018</xref>). Although the association of metabolic traits with fitness is inevitably complex, it can provide a clear indication of where physiological processes are compromised by genetic variants and are, therefore, likely to reduce fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Blackmer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Criscuolo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Konarzewski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Mueller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Pettersen et al., 2016</xref>). An advantage to studying metabolic traits is that they can be assessed in an equivalent manner in both sexes, allowing the investigation of sexual differences, which is key to the hypotheses investigated here.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we measure three metabolic-related traits to evaluate how meiotic drive directly in males and indirectly through its genomic architecture (through associated chromosomal inversions) in both sexes leads to costs linked to downstream consequences for fitness. These are investigated in the Malaysian stalk-eyed fly, <italic>Teleopsis dalmanni</italic>, which carries an X-linked meiotic drive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bradshaw et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cotton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Cotton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Finnegan, et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Meade et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Meade et al., 2019</xref>). This species is known for its extreme sexual dimorphism, in which males have greatly exaggerated eyespans that are subjected to strong female mate preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Burkhardt et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Wilkinson et al., 1998</xref>). Males that carry the meiotic drive X chromosome, known as <italic>Sex-Ratio</italic> or SR, cause the dysfunction of Y-bearing sperm and sire female-only broods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Atlan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Beckenbach, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Beckenbach, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Courret et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Larracuente et al., 2012</xref>). SR meiotic drive appears to be broadly stable across natural populations at a frequency of around 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Paczolt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Presgraves et al., 1997</xref>). It is also present in the sister species <italic>T. whitei,</italic> which suggests a common origin estimated at around 4 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Paczolt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Wilkinson et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p id="P6"><italic>T. dalmanni</italic> drive males curiously do not suffer from reduced fertility despite the destruction of half of their gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Meade et al., 2020</xref>). They pass on the same number of sperm per ejaculate as wild-type males and have equal fertility when in competition with wild-type males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bates et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Meade et al., 2019</xref>). This can be explained by the adaptive enlargement of testes in drive males, which is evident in the primordia of the adult fly testes upon eclosion from the pupal stage, the accelerated growth rates during early adult development, and the increased size of testes in sexually mature flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bradshaw et al., 2022</xref>). A number of other traits associated with the meiotic drive X chromosome are thought to be detrimental to fitness. Drive males have reduced eyespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Finnegan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Finnegan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Meade et al., 2020</xref>), smaller accessory glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Meade et al., 2020</xref>)—though this is not well established, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bradshaw et al., 2022</xref>)—and mate less frequently than wild-type males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Finnegan et al., 2019</xref>). Drive females do not have reduced eyespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cotton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Finnegan et al., 2021</xref>) but have lower fecundity compared to wild-type females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bates, 2023</xref>). Both sexes have reduced egg-to-adult viability when they carry the drive chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Finnegan et al., 2019</xref>). These phenotypes highlight the breadth of meiotic drive-induced costs, emphasising the need to investigate the underlying metabolic consequences of harbouring drive across both sexes.</p><p id="P7">Three diverse measures of metabolic function were assessed to examine the impact of meiotic drive on metabolic life history. Mitochondrial function was measured by monitoring oxygen consumption in thoracic tissue using an O2k-Fluorespirometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Gnaiger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Simard et al., 2018</xref>). Whole-organism resting metabolic rate was assayed through CO<sub>2</sub>, production measurements using a MAVEn-FT (Multiple Animal Versatile Energetics Flow-Through System, Sable Systems International, Las Vegas, NV). Finally, nutrient acquisition under resting conditions was assessed through the consumption of different diets using a CApillary FEeder (CAFE) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Ja et al., 2007</xref>). The primary aim was to compare flies carrying drive and wild-type chromosomes, as well as between heterozygous and homozygous females, to test the prediction of general deleterious effects associated with the drive X chromosome. The hypothesis that dysfunction caused by meiotic drive during spermatogenesis leads to direct metabolic consequences was tested by comparing the sexes, with the expectation that males would exhibit more pronounced effects. The hypothesis that there is an accumulation of sexually antagonistic effects linked to drive was tested in the same way but with the reverse expectation that female metabolism would be more strongly impacted.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods | materials"><label>2</label><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Stock Generation and Maintenance</title><p id="P8">The wild-type, standard (ST) stock was collected in 2005 from the Ulu Gombak Valley, Peninsular Malaysia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Cotton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Cotton et al., 2010</xref>).

Whole thoraces were dissected in 1.5 mL ice-cold MiR05 respirometry buffer (0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2.6H2O, 60 mM lactobionic Acid, 20 mM taurine, 10 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES, 110 mM D-sucrose, 1 g/L BSA, pH 7.1). The muscle fibres were lightly homogenised in 150 μL of MiR05, of which 50 μL were added in a calibrated O2k-Fluorespirometer (Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria) with 2 mL MiR05. The remaining homogenate was frozen and kept for subsequent protein content analysis using a QuantiPro BCA Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich).</p><p id="P10">Pyruvate (10mM) and malate (2mM) (Complex I substrates) were then added to the Oroboros sample chamber, and the LEAK state was recorded after 15–20 minutes.

Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (10mM) was added to assess mitochondrial membrane integrity, and samples with &gt;20% increased O<sub>2</sub> consumption were discarded. Glutamate (10mM), succinate (10mM), and glycerophosphate (10mM) were added sequentially, recording O<sub>2</sub> fluxes at each state. Maximum uncoupled respiration was determined using 0.5μM FFCP. Respiration was inhibited by adding rotenone (0.5 μM), followed by malonic acid (5mM), and antimycin A (2.5 μM), estimating the residual oxygen consumption (ROX). ROX was set as the baseline (O2 consumption = 0), and other states were compared to ROX-corrected states.

Individual flies (average age approximately 50 days post-eclosion) were weighed and then placed into metabolic chambers coupled to an external CO<sub>2</sub> analyser (LICOR 850; LI-COR, USA). Fly activity was measured via the presence of 3 infrared beams below each chamber, recording movement every time the beams were broken. The chambers (length: 3cm, diameter: 1.3cm) were large enough so that flies could move around but small enough that they could not undertake to exert behaviours such as flying or foraging. The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in each chamber was measured during airflow for 120 seconds at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. The system monitored 16 individual chambers consecutively, with three or four measurements for each chamber, over a 3-hour cycle.</p><p id="P14">The multiplexed configuration included 15 chambers containing flies and one chamber left empty as a control to confirm that there was no interference from extraneous variables.

Test individuals were placed individually in vials (20 mL) containing a base layer (6 mL) of 0.8% agar to provide a source of hydration with no caloric content. The top of the tube was secured with a sponge bung penetrated by a pipette tip cut to fit a capillary tube. Flies remained in their agar vials overnight. The following morning, a 20 μL glass capillary filled with the allocated dietary treatment was inserted into each individual vial (SI Figure 1). Dietary treatments used in this experiment were a mix of microbiology yeast extract and sugar, but all with a final concentration of 32.5 g/L. The three diet treatments used were high protein (1:1 yeast:sugar), low protein (1:2 yeast:sugar) and sugar alone (10% solution).

The physical distance between these marks was measured using digital callipers to obtain the volume of liquid consumed (μL) from the 20 μL capillary.

We provide evidence that drive flies exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, and this dysfunction is compensated via an increase in basal respiration rate. They also consume more food per unit of time across a range of diets, indicating further compensatory mechanisms to counteract their less efficient metabolism and a potential inability to sufficiently utilise nutrients. These results provide the first demonstration of how metabolic function can be corrupted by meiotic drive. All the markers of stress within the metabolic system occurred in females as well as males carrying the drive chromosome, despite the direct disruption of meiosis in stalk-eyed flies being limited to spermatogenesis. This strongly points to the genomic inversions on the driving X chromosome being linked to a raised mutational load, which is causing the range of metabolic costs measured.</p><p id="P30">Mitochondrial function was measured through high-resolution respirometry using an O2k-Fluorespirometer (Oroboros Instruments, Austria). This measures the flux through the electron transport chain during OXPHOS using a substrate-uncoupler-inhibitor titration protocol (see SI for details). Two aspects were found to be compromised. Individuals carrying meiotic drive had a lower respiratory control ratio (RCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Divakaruni et al., 2022</xref>). They also presented reduced Complex I substrate oxidation contribution to respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Complex I is the first and largest unit in the respiratory chain and the primary contributor to the proton motive force that facilitates ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Sharma et al., 2009</xref>). Other mitochondrial states tested were not found to differ between SR and ST individuals (SI Table 1). A possible cause of low RCR and Complex I dysfunction is mutations in the nuclear DNA encoding mitochondrial subunits or accessory proteins located within the driving X chromosome inversions. For example, several X-linked mutations associated with Complex I dysfunction have been characterised by various pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Fassone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Reinson et al., 2019</xref>), including the NDUFA1 gene implicated in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Fernandez-Moreira et al., 2007</xref>). These possibilities could be tested in future bioinformatic work comparing SR and wild-type sequence data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Reinhardt et al., 2023</xref>), specifically looking for evidence of disruption to coding sequences of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial function or for differential expression of nuclear and mitochondrial genes involved.</p><p id="P31">There were no sex differences in the RCR or Complex I measurements, but the sample size was not large, which limits the assurance of this result. However, it is noteworthy to mention that the number of samples tested in this experiment is typical of protocols used in this field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Gonçalves et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Nääv et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Pichaud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Rodríguez et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">2023</xref>). A potential shortcoming is that the O2k assessment was limited to female homozygotes, meaning that the degree of dominance of drive effects on mitochondrial activity in females cannot be discerned. This could be investigated as part of future work. Another area to look at is male reproductive tissues where the drive genes causing disruption of spermatogenesis are active (i.e. the testes and accessory glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Reinhardt et al., 2014</xref>)). These tissues are expected to show elevated dysfunction compared to thorax musculature due to the direct effect of drive, which might be measurable through mitochondrial deficits in RCR, Complex I or other elements of the respiratory chain. Previous studies in the <italic>t</italic> haplotype system in mice provide valuable parallels. Mutant <italic>t<sup>n</sup></italic> sperm show increased aerobic metabolism (exemplified by a reduced NADH/NAD ratio), which is thought to put them at a selective advantage because it increases motility, maturation and fertilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ginsberg et al., 1974</xref>). Our study used thoracic tissues, but future experiments on reproductive tissues would provide further insight. In some instances of sperm-killer drive, some drive sperm experience pleiotropic collateral damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Price et al., 2008</xref>). However, it was recently found that SR <italic>T. dalmanni</italic> males show no reduction or advantage in sperm competitiveness or paternity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bates, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bates et al., 2023</xref>). The most plausible explanation is the compensatory enlargement of SR male testes, with a concomitant equal sperm count per ejaculate when compared to wild-type males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Meade et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Meade et al., 2019</xref>). A further possibility that remains to be investigated is whether there are alterations to the metabolic rate of SR males. In contrast, female reproductive tissues are not expected to be differentially targeted compared with somatic tissues, as meiotic drive has no known downstream consequences for oogenesis in stalk-eyed flies.</p><p id="P32">The whole-organism metabolic rate of stalk-eyed flies was examined using a MAVEn-FT system, which takes repeated measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> production of resting flies over a 3-hour period. We found whole organism respiration to be higher in males than females and also higher in drive individuals within each sex. These findings suggest that less efficient mitochondrial function induces a compensatory elevated metabolic rate in drive individuals. Furthermore, drive heterozygotes and homozygotes were tested alongside wild-type homozygous females for metabolic rate, which demonstrated that the SR chromosome has a dominant effect on respiration, as females with a single SR chromosome produced as much CO<sub>2</sub> as those with two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Likewise, there was no difference between drive males and the two female genotypes carrying drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). These results are consistent with the notion that most of the metabolic costs arising are associated with the mutational load in the SR chromosome inversions, as was seen in direct measurements of mitochondrial activity. Similar increases in CO<sub>2</sub> production have been noted in other systems, like <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> when there is an incompatibility between the nucleus and the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bettinazzi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hoekstra et al., 2013</xref>). However, opposing results were found in mice, as females carrying the <italic>t</italic> locus meiotic drive system were found to exhibit a lower resting metabolic rate compared to wild-type mice in larger individuals (Lopes et al., 2019). In mice, a lower metabolic rate has been linked to increased longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Duarte et al., 2014</xref>). This association leads the authors to argue that reduced metabolism is an adaptation in drive females that compensates for the smaller litter sizes seen in <italic>t</italic> drive females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Sutter et al., 2015</xref>) by extending the number of litters that they sire during their lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Duarte et al., 2014</xref>). The decrease in metabolic rate with body size is not observed in males carrying the <italic>t</italic> locus, so it is not a direct consequence of drive; rather, it is a female-only phenomenon, which aligns with the adaptation hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Duarte et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P33">A final test of metabolic costs arising through meiotic drive measured food intake over a range of diets using the CAFE assay. Food consumption is a good proxy for metabolic-reliant phenotypes, given its involvement in fitness and lifespan across many species, including <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Camus et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Skorupa et al., 2008</xref>), and its association with metabolic rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Nicholls et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Roark et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Winwood-Smith et al., 2017</xref>). SR individuals consistently consumed more, with no difference between females and males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Consumption varied markedly with diet, and intake increased with greater amounts of protein in the diet provided. However, diet type had no impact on the difference between SR and wild-type flies. This suggests that metabolic deficiency amongst flies carrying drive chromosomes is compensated by greater food intake. Even though the value of different food sources varies with the reproductive demands of females and males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Camus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Reddiex et al., 2013</xref>), this was not observed in this assay. Typically, females prefer diets with greater protein content (for egg production), and, in contrast, males prefer carbohydrates to power male-male competition and sexual display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Jensen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kodric-Brown et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Maklakov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Wheeler, 1996</xref>). Even if this is the case in stalk-eyed flies, it did not follow through to cause differentiation of consumption in flies with drive chromosomes or across the sexes. Drive individuals did not show consumption modification in response to their mitochondrial dysfunction across different diets other than an overall increase in consumption. In addition, as before in the whole-organism respiration tests, there was no difference between female heterozygotes and homozygotes, indicating dominance of the dysfunction caused by meiotic drive. Nor did these two female genotypes differ in consumption compared to drive males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P34">Altogether, these results point to the preponderance of indirect mutational load costs being linked to meiotic drive in a sex-independent manner. This does not rule out the existence of direct effects of meiotic drive in males that reduce metabolic function, nor the possibility of selection for linked sexually antagonistic alleles that depress female metabolic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Rydzewski et al., 2016</xref>). What it suggests is that these effects are relatively less important and subsumed by the indirect mutational load held in the multiple inversions that cover almost all of the SR X chromosome in <italic>T. dalmanni</italic> and other examples of X-linked drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Jaenike, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Paczolt et al., 2017</xref>). Metabolic function measured in this study concerned somatic tissue, whole-organism respiration and dietary consumption. It may be that reproductive tissues where meiotic drive takes place (i.e. male testes) or gametogenesis in general (i.e. including ovarian tissue) have different metabolic responses reflecting the direct effect of meiotic drive genes or sexually antagonistic gene expression, respectively. This possibility suggests future work.</p></sec><sec id="S17" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P35">This research provides the first evidence of the range of metabolic costs associated with a meiotic drive system in stalk-eyed flies. The costs uncovered include mitochondrial dysfunction (lowered respiratory control ratio and reduced Complex I contributions to respiration), metabolic inefficiency (higher basal metabolic rate) and increased food consumption across a range of diets (varying in protein content). The latter two are likely to be compensatory mechanisms arising from mitochondrial dysfunction. The costs were of equal scale across the sexes even though the direct action of meiotic drive only manifests as a loss of gametes in male spermatogenesis. This supports the hypothesis of predominant indirect costs associated with meiotic drive. These are likely to arise from genes linked to meiotic drive on the X chromosome. The driving X chromosome contains a number of large genomic inversions, which restrict its recombination with the wild-type X chromosome. As the meiotic drive X chromosome is at low frequency in natural populations (~20%), it is subjected to weak selection and the accumulation of deleterious mutations which impact metabolic function. By comparing heterozygous and homozygous females with hemizygous males, the analysis found no evidence of predominant recessive effects in females as predicted by sexually antagonistic selection. Surprisingly, there was little evidence of greater metabolic deficits in males. While many life history phenotypes have been examined in the <italic>T. dalmanni</italic> system, future work will aim to strengthen what is known about metabolic phenotypes that potentially give rise to these traits. A further analysis of male reproductive tissues is needed to evaluate whether male-specific metabolic costs are evident where the meiotic drive genes themselves are active. Taken together, these results offer new insights into the metabolic and energetic underpinnings of harbouring meiotic drive systems.</p></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="extended-methods"><title>Extended Methods</title><sec id="S19"><title>Mitochondrial function measurement through high-resolution respirometry</title><sec id="S20"><title>Sample preparation</title><p id="P36">The preparation of <italic>T. dalmanni</italic> thoracic tissue for mitochondrial function was developed following previously published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Teulier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Simard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).
