Here, we present a Cas12a-based system that targets each gene with four sgRNAs to overcome these limitations, using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a tractable <italic>in vivo</italic> model. We show that multiplexed sgRNAs act synergistically to create deletions between target sites, substantially increasing the fraction of loss-of-function mutations. To systematically assess off-target effects, we developed a novel screening assay that visualizes CRISPR-induced chromosomal alterations in living animals. This enabled comprehensive screening of more than 2000 sgRNAs clustered in 525 quadruple arrays across 21 megabases of genomic DNA, revealing remarkably high on-target activity (100%, 82/82) and undetectable off-target cutting (0%, 0/443). Quantitative side-by-side comparisons with a current Cas9-based system targeting over 100 genes demonstrates that multiplexed Cas12a-mediated gene targeting achieves superior performance and reveals phenotypes missed by established methods. This highly efficient and specific system provides a framework for reliable functional genomics studies across diverse organisms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">CRISPR gene editing has significantly accelerated the functional annotation of genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Despite its transformative impact, several factors limit the efficiency of gene disruption through CRISPR nucleases. For example, suboptimal activity of sgRNAs or Cas proteins can impede the induction of DNA breaks and chromatin state and genetic variation can render target sites inaccessible. Moreover, repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) typically results in a spectrum of mutations that includes undesired repair outcomes retaining gene function, such as small inframe insertions or deletions (indels). As a result, CRISPR editing often produces genetic mosaics - populations of cells carrying different mutations or maintaining wild-type sequences. This severely compromises the sensitivity and robustness of functional gene discovery with CRISPR in multicellular organisms and cultured cells, presents a hurdle for the development of genetic control strategies for disease vectors, and limits its potential therapeutic application in cell and gene therapy.</p><p id="P4">A promising strategy to overcome these limitations is the simultaneous targeting of genes with multiple sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Here, additional sgRNAs can compensate for those that fail to mediate the desired outcome. However, for Cas9, the most widely used CRISPR nuclease, creating multiplexed arrays of more than two sgRNAs remains technically challenging due to their large size and repetitive nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Most current large-scale Cas9 sgRNA libraries thus employ only one or two sgRNAs per gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In contrast, Cas12a nuclease is guided solely by small crRNAs (hereafter sgRNAs) and can autonomously process compact arrays into individual sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). These properties allow Cas12a sgRNA arrays to be encoded on commercially available oligonucleotides, substantially facilitating generation of expression plasmids at scale. This has been harnessed for multiplex gene editing and transcriptome engineering in various contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), but whether higher-order multiplexing of sgRNAs targeting the same gene enhances the efficiency of gene disruption <italic>in vivo</italic> remains unclear.</p><p id="P5">A key challenge of CRISPR gene editing is the occurrence of off-target mutations. These arise when Cas nucleases cleave sites with imperfect homology to the sgRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). This concern is particularly acute for multiplexed editing, as the chance of unintended modifications increases with each additional sgRNA. Although computational tools can predict some off-target sites, their reliability is limited by poorly understood sgRNA-specific effects and sequence differences between reference and experimental genomes. However, methods for the unbiased, experimental detection of off-target effects in the genome of most animals are limited. Methods for the direct detection of induced DNA breaks have been described, but are not available for most species due to the absence of specialized tools like antibodies binding specific DSB repair proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Whole genome sequencing is broadly available, but its application for comprehensive off-target analysis across many sgRNAs is limited by cost. Moreover, since CRISPR-induced mutations and natural genetic variation are often indistinguishable, inferring causal relationships about off-target effects from sequencing data remains non-trivial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). Consequently, the off-target activity of CRISPR systems in many organisms remains unclear, as many studies evaluate activity at only a very small fraction of the genome or with a small number of sgRNAs or do not test for off-target cleavage at all.</p><p id="P6">Here, we describe a highly efficient gene targeting system that combines an enhanced variant of Cas12a with quadruple sgRNA arrays. When targeting sites in parallel, sgRNAs can act synergistically to induce deletions between target sites, generating mutations that are more likely to disrupt gene function. Direct comparisons with established Cas9-based methods demonstrate superior knockout efficiency of this system across diverse tissues and target genes. To comprehensively evaluate the specificity of multiplexed editing, we developed a novel assay that visualizes induced loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) in living animals. This approach enabled an unbiased assessment of nuclease activity with over 2,000 sgRNAs in 525 arrays across 21 megabases of the genome, revealing that Cas12a editing maintains high specificity even when using multiple sgRNAs simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Synergistic action of quadruple Cas12a<sup>+</sup> sgRNA arrays</title><p id="P7">We set out to implement and evaluate multiplexed Cas12a gene targeting in the tractable <italic>Drosophila</italic> model system. The short generation time of this organism enables comparisons across many conditions and replicates and the ability to encode nucleases and sgRNAs on stable, single copy transgenes in defined genomic landing sites eliminates variations in delivery efficiency or expression level as confounding factors of experimental results. We previously showed that a variant of <italic>Lachnospiraceae bacterium</italic> Cas12a with a D156R mutation (hereafter Cas12a<sup>+</sup>) functions with high efficiency in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and can process large sgRNA arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). To determine the optimal number of sgRNAs targeting the same gene, we developed a reporter assay using genomic insertions containing one to six copies of a sgRNA target sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Gene editing with ubiquitously expressed Cas12a<sup>+</sup> and single or multiplexed sgRNA target sites generated distinct editing outcomes in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) or the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Editing at single target sites primarily produced small indels, while targeting multiple sites progressively increased the frequency of larger deletions between sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, c</xref>). This highlights that sgRNA multiplexing offers benefits beyond functional redundancy, as sgRNAs act synergistically to induce larger deletions, which are particularly likely to constitute loss-of-function alleles.</p><p id="P8">We selected an intermediate number of four sgRNAs per gene for in-depth characterization to balance the benefits of multiplexing against potential drawbacks, which include excessive DNA damage and off-target effects. This choice is further supported by recent evidence that arrays consisting of more than 4 sgRNAs are no longer optimally processed by Cas12a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). We refer to our genetically encoded quadruple sgRNA system as HD12aCFD, following on from our earlier described HD_CFD Cas9 library, which expresses two sgRNAs per gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). To evaluate whether mutagenesis of endogenous genes with HD12aCFD sgRNA arrays and Cas12a<sup>+</sup> also results in a high proportion of larger deletions, we assayed the integrity of the target locus after mutagenesis and compared it to animals in which the same gene was targeted with Cas9 and HD_CFD sgRNA lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Mutagenesis with HD12aCFD sgRNA arrays resulted in a marked decrease in full length amplicons from 6 out of 8 target loci, an effect that was only observed at 1 locus following HD_CFD mediated gene targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). These experiments reveal that the HD12aCFD system produces a diverse set of repair outcomes dominated by large deletions, a feature expected to facilitate gene inactivation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Multiplexed gene targeting is well tolerated and spatially restricted</title><p id="P9">We then investigated potential adverse effects of using several sgRNAs to target the same gene. Since DSBs are detrimental to cell fitness, one concern is that inducing multiple breaks simultaneously could overwhelm the DNA damage response, leading to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). To assess this risk, we quantified the level of apoptosis following gene targeting with multiple sgRNAs. DSBs in either of two non-essential genes with Cas9 or Cas12a<sup>+</sup> caused a moderate increase in apoptotic cells in the wing disc epithelium, with comparable effects using either nuclease with two or four sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>). In contrast, targeting genes present on multiple chromosomes resulted in a marked increase in apoptotic cells, irrespective of sgRNAs number, and produced severe adult phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 1</xref>). These results indicate that while multiple DSBs in close proximity are well tolerated, induction of DNA breaks across different chromosomes is highly toxic.</p><p id="P10">Next, we tested whether multiplexed gene editing induces mutations in genes other than the intended target, so called off-target effects. We first focused on genes in direct proximity to the target gene, as large deletions extending beyond the target locus could lead to the disruption of neighboring genes. Such events would confound experimental results and would not be detected in PCR-based assays, as they would delete a primer binding site. Therefore, we directly tested for this possibility by analyzing four sgRNA arrays targeting genes located in direct vicinity, or intronic, to genes with well described visible phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 2</xref>). Gene targeting resulted in a diverse set of large deletions at the target locus, further corroborating the results described above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 2</xref>). Lines with target sites in close proximity (500-5000 bp) to the <italic>sepia</italic> (<italic>se</italic>), <italic>ebony</italic>, or <italic>forked</italic> genes yielded no phenotypes indicative of disruption of these adjacent genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 2</xref>). However, when targeting a site just 450 bp upstream of the <italic>se</italic> transcriptional start site, we detected a loss or reduction of <italic>se</italic> function in a small subset of flies (13%, N=141) with low penetrance. Collectively, these results show that multiplexed Cas12a<sup>+</sup> gene targeting produces deletions that rarely extend beyond the target locus, with measurable effects on neighboring functional elements occurring only when these are in immediate proximity to the target site.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Large-scale, unbiased off-target screening reveals high specificity</title><p id="P11">We next investigated whether multiplexed Cas12a<sup>+</sup> editing induces off-target effects distant from the target locus. A meaningful evaluation of the specificity of a new gene editing system requires testing of many sgRNA throughout large segments of the genome, but suitable methods for this task have not been described in most organisms. We therefore aimed to establish an high-throughput assay for unbiased detection of CRISPR nuclease activity across megabases of genomic DNA <italic>in vivo</italic>. We reasoned that visualizing loss of heterozygosity (LOH), a common repair outcome of CRISPR-induced chromosome breaks in diverse systems ranging from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), would be a suitable readout. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, LOH occurs primarily through mitotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>) and can be visualized with a heterozygous dosesensitive reporter, such as a transgene encoding a fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2b</xref>). In animals with one reporter inserted on chromosome arm 2L and another on 3R, targeting Cas12a<sup>+</sup> to 2L induces LOH specifically on 2L but not 3R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, d</xref>). Similarly, targeting 3R with a sgRNA array induced LOH only on that chromosome arm.</p><p id="P12">We established high-throughput LOH screening using a tissue-specific enhancer to restrict GFP expression to <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval wing and haltere imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref> and methods). This approach enables visualization of LOH in living animals with a conventional fluorescent stereoscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f, g</xref>). We used this system to screen for LOH of a reporter inserted at cytogenetic map position 22C on chromosome 2. Induction of DSBs within the 21.4 Mb region (16% of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome) between this insertion site and the centromere (the screening interval) are expected to trigger LOH of the reporter. Our screen analyzed over 8,000 imaginal discs using 525 HD12aCFD lines that collectively encode 2,197 unique sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). Remarkably, all 82 sgRNA lines targeting genes located within the screening interval resulted in robust LOH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>). Moreover, of the 443 lines targeting genes outside the screening interval, 427 showed no LOH and 16 had LOH only in isolated wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 2</xref>). The latter could reflect either low-level off-target activity within the screening interval or stochastic background LOH unrelated to CRISPR. Off-target effects should be reproducible as they are caused by sgRNA homology, while stochastic LOH occurs randomly. To distinguish between these possibilities we rescreened these lines with larger sample sizes. This revealed no reproducible LOH patterns, indicating these rare events are unrelated to CRISPR activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 3</xref>). The frequency of such events is consistent with previous reports on stochastic LOH in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). To determine how LOH scores correlate with mutation frequencies, we sequenced target sites of sgRNAs that produced low but reproducible LOH signals. This revealed that the sensitivity of our LOH screening approach is comparable to or exceeding that of conventional Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 4</xref>). In summary, visualizing LOH enabled us to screen for Cas12a<sup>+</sup> activity in combination with 525 sgRNA arrays across a 21.4 Mb interval of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome. This constituted to our knowledge the so far largest unbiased screen for nuclease activity <italic>in vivo</italic> and reveals both the robust activity and high specificity of multiplexed Cas12a mutagenesis.</p><p id="P13">Multiplexed Cas12a<sup>+</sup> gene targeting outperforms established Cas9-based methods We then evaluated whether the HD12aCFD system enhances knock-out efficiency <italic>in vivo</italic> compared to the current state-of-the-art. To enable this comparison, we developed a toolkit comprising optimized, inducible <italic>UAS-Cas12a<sup>+</sup></italic> transgenes and a whole-animal reporter system for nuclease activity mapping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Figure 5</xref>). Using this toolkit, we performed both ubiquitous and tissue-specific CRISPR mutagenesis of endogenous genes, comparing HD12aCFD sgRNA arrays to established Cas9 sgRNA lines through quantification of loss-of-function phenotypes. First, we compared the effectiveness of both systems by targeting <italic>white</italic> (<italic>w</italic>) in neuronal photoreceptors. While Cas9-mediated mutagenesis produced highly variable mosaics with 50 ± 26% (mean ± standard deviation) of the tissue retaining <italic>w</italic> expression, gene targeting with HD12aCFD resulted in highly penetrant <italic>w</italic> disruption (96 ± 5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, b</xref>). Next, we performed inducible mutagenesis of <italic>Notch</italic> and <italic>neuralized</italic> in adult intestinal stem cells. Both genes are known to control stem cell numbers by regulating cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). HD12aCFD-mediated targeting resulted in a more pronounced increase in dividing cells compared to Cas9 with sgRNAs pairs for both genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Furthermore, targeting <italic>smoothened</italic> specifically in the pouch region of wing imaginal disc epithelia resulted in near complete loss of Smo protein with a HD12aCFD line, but a significant number of cells retained Smo in flies with two sgRNAs and Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e, f</xref>). These results demonstrate that gene targeting with Cas12a<sup>+</sup> and multiplexed sgRNAs achieves superior gene disruption efficiency compared to established Cas9-based systems across diverse tissues. Additionally, Cas12a<sup>+</sup> activity can be effectively controlled in time and space, as phenotypic changes remained confined to the targeted regions - a precision that has been challenging to achieve with Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To more systematically assess HD12aCFD-mediated gene disruption efficiency, we used adult wing size as a quantitative phenotypic readout. We targeted 241 genes using conditional Cas12a<sup>+</sup> and HD12aCFD sgRNA arrays, performed parallel imaging of multiple wings per genotype, and trained a widely-used cell segmentation algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) for automated segmentation of wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Wing size remained largely unchanged when targeting negative control genes, but was strongly reduced upon disruption of known regulators of wing growth and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 6</xref>). We compared our results to Cas9-mediated mutagenesis for the 103 genes with existing sgRNA lines in the HD_CFD library. HD12aCFD targeting produced significantly stronger phenotypes for the majority of wing size regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3i</xref>). This included many genes known to be important for wing growth and morphogenesis, but also genes with previously unknown wing phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 6</xref>). For example, mutagenesis of <italic>trade embargo</italic> (<italic>trem</italic>) with HD12aCFD sgRNA arrays, but not HD_CFD sgRNA pairs, resulted in a specific and highly penetrant loss of wing veins in the wing posterior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 7</xref>). Perturbation of <italic>trem</italic> with additional sgRNAs and RNAi lines confirmed a role for <italic>trem</italic> in the wing, which had been missed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Together, these results establish Cas12a<sup>+</sup> with four sgRNAs as a superior system for generating loss-of-function alleles, achieving substantially higher knockout efficiency than established Cas9-based systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">In this study, we developed an improved CRISPR gene ablation system. Our approach combines Cas12a<sup>+</sup> and four arrayed sgRNAs targeting independent sites in each gene to overcome a general limitation of gene knockouts with CRISPR nucleases in multicellular systems - the generation of genetic mosaics that include cells with functional gene copies. Direct comparisons with current Cas9-based approaches demonstrate that this system not only increases knockout penetrance across diverse tissues, but also reveals phenotypes previously missed by conventional approaches. Importantly, systematic evaluation of potential limitations showed that the method maintains high specificity despite increased sgRNA multiplexing and is well tolerated <italic>in vivo</italic>, making it a robust platform for functional studies.</p><p id="P16">The superior performance of Cas12a<sup>+</sup> with quadruple sgRNA arrays stems from both redundant and synergistic effects of multiplexed targeting. Redundancy of sgRNAs ensures robust editing - as demonstrated by 100% activity of all 82 on-target arrays in our LOH assay - in contrast to established single and double Cas9 sgRNA libraries that typically include 10 - 20% inactive lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Additionally, multiplexed sgRNAs can act synergistically by creating deletions between target sites. While induction of such deletions require near-simultaneous DNA cutting and are rare with two sgRNAs, their frequency increases substantially when four sgRNAs targeting the same locus are used. Additionally, it is possible that differences in cleavage activity and kinetics between the used Cas9 and Cas12a variants influence overall performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Possible adverse effects of sgRNA multiplexing include toxicity from excessive DNA damage. Studies in mammalian cells have shown that cells with multiple target sites activate DNA damage checkpoints and are lost in pooled CRISPR screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). However, in these cases the gene copies are usually dispersed in the genome. We find that increasing sgRNA number from two to four at a single locus does not detectably enhance cell death. In contrast, targeting gene copies on multiple chromosomes, even with fewer total cut sites, significantly increases apoptosis and causes severe adult phenotypes. This suggests that the spatial distribution of cut sites, rather than their total number, is a major determinant of toxicity - possibly through the formation of chromosomal translocations when targeting multiple loci.</p><p id="P18">Multiplexing several sgRNAs could theoretically increase off-target effects. Because off-target activity varies widely between individual sgRNAs, meaningful characterization requires analysis of many guides. However, high-throughput assays to detect CRISPR activity at unknown genomic loci have been lacking. Our new method for visualizing LOH in living animals fills this technical gap. Since LOH is a widespread repair outcome of DSB repair in diploid organisms (29–31), this assay should be broadly applicable to other systems. Screening more than 2,000 sgRNAs in 525 arrays across 21 megabases of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome failed to detect any off-target activity. This confirms that the high specificity of Cas12a observed <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>) is maintained during <italic>in vivo</italic> multiplexed editing.</p><p id="P19"><bold><italic>Drosophila</italic></bold> was the first organism in which targeted gene editing was achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>) and has proven to be an excellent model for genome engineering approaches that later proved valuable in other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). This broad transferability stems from the fact that Cas proteins function effectively across different organisms, and that the mechanisms of DSB repair are highly conserved during evolution. The improved efficiency and high specificity of multiplexed Cas12a gene targeting therefore has implications beyond basic research applications. For example, current gene drive systems, which hold promise for controlling vector-borne diseases, are limited by the emergence of resistance alleles. Recent studies have demonstrated that sgRNA multiplexing can substantially delay resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) suggesting that our system could accelerate the development of more robust genetic tools for disease control. Ultimately, this work not only provides a blueprint for developing enhanced gene knockout systems across multicellular organisms, but also contributes to a broader toolkit for addressing both fundamental questions in biological research and pressing societal needs.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Plasmids</title><sec id="S9"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p id="P20">Plasmid cloning was performed using PCR amplicons generated with Q5 PCR polymerase (New England Biolabs).

Guides were designed against the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome release BDGP6.22, allowing only guides in coding sequences with less than 10 predicted off-targets of an edit distance larger than 2. For aligning crRNA target sites back to the reference genome bowtie was used in very-sensitive mode and the first 3 PAM distal bases were ignored. The PAM requirement was set to a 5’ adjacent TTTN. As basis for design served a list of ENSEMBL identifiers covering all protein coding genes in BDGP6.22. Raw, designed crRNA targets were then further processed in a custom R pipeline to yield optimized crRNA target pairs for combinatorial mutagenesis as follows.</p><p id="P30">The CLD output files were filtered according to the design criteria. In the following steps, relevant columns from the large CLD output table were selected. Everything irrelevant to the list of target genes was removed, and the ‘Number of Hits’ column was adjusted to represent off-target count by subtracting one count. After that, all sequences containing BbsI (GAAGAC) and BsaI (GGTCTC) restriction sites, non-unique crRNA targets, and crRNA targets adjacent to a TTTT PAM were removed. Additional selection criteria for the remaining pool of sgRNA designs were annotated as follows: the number of targeted protein-coding transcripts, whether the sgRNAs target the first half of the target gene, and the GC content of sgRNA sequences. Only those sgRNAs that hit at least max(#transcripts)-1 transcripts were kept, and the average gene expression for each transcript hit by a putative crRNA was annotated. Designs that unintentionally hit a coding sequence of a different gene than they were designed for were filtered. Further, small genes that are contained in overarching giant genes like <italic>kirre</italic>, <italic>Raf</italic>, or others were excluded. Each sgRNA was annotated on how many CDS it targets and if it targets in the first half of the target gene. To check the pool for sanity, the sgRNAs were written in GFF3 format. This file could then be loaded into an arbitrary genome browser. Next, 180 random pairs of sgRNAs were drawn for each gene and scored by optimizing pair distance, microhomology score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), exon expression, isoform coverage, off-target counts, GC content, and exon position relative to the transcript.

complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>. (<bold>b</bold>) Bulk editing outcomes assessed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from whole adult flies. In contrast to samples without nuclease (control; upper panel), targeting of the reporter results in amplicons of various sizes. Additional target sites produce more diverse editing outcomes, showing increased smaller amplicons and decreased amplicons of original length. Samples from three individual animals are shown for each genotype. (<bold>c</bold>) Individual alleles of the STAR reporter were isolated by germline transmission and identified by sequencing. Multiplexing of target sites results in frequent deletions between target sites. (<bold>d</bold>) Overview of the two systems used throughout most of this study. The HD_CFD system uses Cas9 nuclease and two sgRNA per gene, which are expressed from a tRNA vector, as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The HD12aCFD system uses Cas12a<sup>+</sup> and an array of four sgRNA per gene. (<bold>e</bold>) Bulk editing outcomes after mutagenesis of endogenous genes. The target locus was amplified by PCR using identical conditions and amplicons were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. Control samples express sgRNAs targeting another locus. CRISPR mutagenesis frequently leads to a diversification of PCR amplicons, an effect that is notably stronger with HD12aCFD for 6 of the 8 tested target genes.

Single locus sgRNAs target <italic>CG34367</italic>, while multi gene sgRNAs target <italic>yellow,</italic> which is present on all three chromosomes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 1</xref>). Scale bar: 40 μm. (<bold>g</bold>) Quantification of clDCP1-positive apoptotic area in the <italic>pdm2-Gal4</italic> expression domain. Points are individual samples, columns represent the mean and error bars the standard deviation. There is no significant (n.s.) difference whether gene targeting is performed with two sgRNAs and Cas9 or four sgRNA and Cas12a<sup>+</sup> (Welch Two Sample T-Test). (<bold>h</bold>) Schematic of the experimental setup to detect large, expansive deletions, which are difficult to detect by PCR based assays due to deletion of a primer binding site. Using proximal genes with visible phenotypes upon knockout allows detection though phenotyping. (<bold>i</bold>) Results from experiments as depicted in (h). Phenotypes indicative of expansive deletions are only detected in one line with target sites in very close proximity, suggesting deletions are largely defined to the target locus. Phenotypes are presented in Extendend Data Fig.2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201448-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>High-throughput screening reveals high on-target and undetectable off-target activity of multiplexed Cas12a<sup>+</sup> editing.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic illustrating mechanisms of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Crossover between homologous chromosomes results in mitotic recombination and copy number neutral (CN) LOH, leading to homozygous daughter cells (+/+ or -/-) from heterozygous parent cells (+/-). Large chromosomal deletions or chromotrypsis lead to copy number loss (CL) LOH. (<bold>b</bold>) CRISPR-induced LOH in larval wing imaginal discs. Tissues express Cas12a<sup>+</sup>, sgRNA arrays, and have a heterozygous <italic>mScarlet</italic> (<italic>mScar</italic>) transgene inserted on chromosome arm 2L. Left panel: sgRNAs targeting a different chromosome arm (3R) do not result in LOH. Right panel: sgRNAs targeting a locus between the <italic>mScar</italic> transgene and the centromere result in frequent LOH resulting in loss or gain of <italic>mScar</italic> expression. Scale bar: 50 μm. (<bold>c</bold>) Schematic of the dual-reporter genotype used in (d). Two different fluorophore transgenes (<italic>GFP</italic> on 2L and <italic>mScar</italic> on 3R) enable simultaneous detection of LOH on different chromosome arms. (<bold>d</bold>) CRISPR targeting induces chromosome arm-specific LOH. sgRNA arrays targeting <italic>Sfp24C1</italic> (2L) or <italic>CG5892</italic> (3R) result in LOH exclusively on their respective chromosome arms.

The <italic>GMR11F02</italic> enhancer allows highly selective expression of GFP in the pouch region of wing and haltere imaginal discs.

(<bold>g</bold>) Example of LOH in a wing disc of a living larva. LOH events are readily detected as clearly defined patches lacking GFP fluorescence. Scale bar: 50 μm. (<bold>h</bold>) High-throughput screening for LOH on chromosome arm 2L reveals high on-target and undetectable off-target activity. 8197 wing discs expressing Cas12a<sup>+</sup>, GFP encoded on 2L and one of 525 HD12aCFD sgRNA arrays were screened for LOH. All 82 HD12aCFD lines targeting 2L between GFP and the centromere resulted in LOH, demonstrating robust on-target activity. Lines targeting 2L without LOH phenotype had target sites distal to GFP. Importantly, 443 HD12aCFD lines targeting other chromosome arms showed no reproducible LOH, indicating absence of detectable off-target activity on 2L (16% of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome). Sporadic low-level LOH events were not reproducible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Data Fig. 2</xref>) and likely represent background rates.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201448-f002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Cas12a<sup>+</sup> and HD12aCFD arrays enhances gene knock-out efficiency compared to current Cas9-based systems.</title><p>(<bold>a-a”</bold>) The HD12aCFD system improves disruption of <italic>white</italic> (<italic>w</italic>) in the eye.
