Among the three known mammalian RyR isoforms, RyR1 is critical for muscle contraction and has been studied most extensively. The cytoplasm-exposed multidomain fragment of RyRs integrates multiple cellular signals that regulate channel gating and small deviations from the physiological open probability of RyRs leads to life-threatening diseases. While cryo-EM has been instrumental in revealing near-atomic details of RyR gating mechanisms, the open probability of RyR1 under cryo-EM conditions is notably lower than that observed in electrophysiological studies, complicating structural investigations of RyR1 gating modulation. Here, we present a cryo-EM study examining the open probability of RyR1 solubilized in CHAPS with varying lipid concentrations. We found that increasing lipid concentration from 0.001% to 0.05% raised the RyR1 open probability from 16 to 84%; however, RyR1 reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs remained closed. We modelled 72 lipid molecules in the map reconstructed at the highest lipid concentration. These findings demonstrate critical role of lipids in modulating RyR1 gating under cryo-EM conditions and suggest optimal lipid-mimetics for structural studies of RyR1 gating modulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Structural studies of ion channels are often performed on the detergent-solubilized proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Alternative systems include lipid nanodiscs, amphipols and since more recently lipid liposomes and native membranes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Typically, structural studies aim at determining the structures of the ion channels in several functional conformations such as closed, open, deactivated or primed states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. However, the physiological function of ion channels also involves fine regulation of the channel open probability which is modulated by interactions with soluble or membrane-embedded molecules (including proteins) or by changes in lipid membrane state including trans-membrane electrochemical potential and lipid composition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Such modulations can be studied using single-particle cryo-EM, which, in addition to resolving structures of functional conformations, provides particle counts for each conformation. From these counts, the relative occupancies of the conformations can be determined. The studies of channel gating based on cryo-EM data aim at establishing contributions from individual factors such as binding of small molecules and proteins, post-translational modifications, temperature, and pH to channel gating. Additionally, gating is modulated by lipid mimetics in a channel-specific manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are homo tetrameric Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with a molecular weight of around 2.2 MDa <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. They reside in the sarcoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) membrane where they mediate calcium signaling in an isoform-dependent manner <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Among three RyR isoforms found in mammals, RyR1 is primarily expressed in skeletal muscles, RyR2 in the heart, and RyR3 is expressed at low levels in various tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">RyR1 play a crucial role in excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling, thus Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from SR to cytoplasm through RyR1 triggers muscle contraction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Hence, precise control of RyR1 gating is essential for normal physiological function whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> leakage can lead to diseases such as malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease (CCD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The gating of RyR1 is regulated by both modulators and the membrane environment. While much research has been conducted on regulatory mechanisms of proteins and small molecules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, fewer studies have explored how membrane mimetics influence RyR1 open probability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Because even subtle changes in RyR1 gating leads to disease, understanding how individual factors, including membrane mimetics, finetune the open probability of RyR1 is essential.</p><p id="P5">Previous studies have observed that open probability of RyR1 derived from analysis of single particle cryo-EM data of detergent-solubilized RyR1 (˜50%) was about twice lower than nearly 100% open probability observed in single-channel recordings under otherwise identical conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Curiously, the open probability of RyR1 reconstituted into liposomes estimated by cryo-EM was still low (37% and 62%) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Our previous study based on H<sup>3</sup>-ryanodine binding assays indicated that a mixture of detergent CHAPS with lipids at various concentrations tunes open probability of RyR1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. This observation has not been verified using structural data and the origin of such a modulation remains unclear.</p><p id="P6">To further understand the modulation of open probability of RyR1 by lipid mimetics, we investigated the influence of lipids on RyR1 open probability using cryo-EM. We show that changing amount of lipids added to detergent-solubilized RyR1 modulates open fraction of RyR1 under cryo-EM conditions between 16 and 84%. The reconstructions obtained at high lipid concentration allowed us to build models of 18 lipid molecules per RyR1 protomer and visualize the details of RyR1-lipid interactions. Structural analysis suggests that lipids modulate gating by establishing a hydrophobic barrier between the transmembrane domain and the hydrophilic buffer.</p><p id="P7">These results indicate that the lipid concentration in the detergent micelles is a critical determinant of the channel open probability and must be thoroughly controlled in the experiments seeking to study modulation of RyR1.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>RyR1 structures with low and high concentration of lipids</title><p id="P8">Previous studies of RyR1 by cryo-EM utilized 0.001% of lipids (prior to protein concentrating) in the protein solution solubilized in 0.2-0.25% of CHAPS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Under these conditions, RyR1’s open probability estimated from the number of particles assigned to different conformations, was between 16<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> and 50%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Discussion</xref> for possible reasons of the discrepancy). Our previous biochemical studies indicated that open probability of solubilized RyR1 depends on the concentration of lipids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. To understand how amount of lipids in solubilized protein solution changes the structure and open probability of RyR1, we solved cryo-EM structures of the protein purified using RyR-specific nanobody Nb9657 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> and plunge frozen it in buffer containing 0.2% CHAPS and either 0.01% or 0.05% POPC (x10 and x50 fold higher lipid concentrations). The cryo-EM datasets were collected in the presence of 50 μM free Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 2 mM ATP, and 5 mM caffeine — conditions that stabilize the open state of RyR1 with Po of 0.93 in single-channel electrophysiological recordings <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.The elevated lipid concentration reduced contrast of RyR1 particles in cryo-EM micrographs, with the 0.05% POPC dataset exhibiting a more pronounced loss of contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a, b</xref>). Nonetheless, reconstructions of primed and open states were determined to resolution between 3.3 and 3.6 Å for both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs 1-2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) which further referred to as DT-0.05-primed, DT-0.05-open, DT-0.01-primed, and DT-0.01-open. Here DT indicates that the protein was solubilized in detergent. Bound Nb9657 and endogenous co-purified FKBP12 were well-resolved in the density maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). Both datasets were processed using the same protocol and the open probability estimated from the number of particles assigned to primed and open states was 67 and 84% for DT-0.01 and DT-0.05, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The fraction of open RyR1 particles is modulated by lipids</title><p id="P9">Two new datasets complement previously reported structures determined with 0.001% POPC (DT-0.001 data set), reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs (ND data set) and in POPC liposomes (LP data set). These 5 datasets were collected with RyR1 purified following similar protocol and using the same detergent and lipids, the channel was stabilized in open state using the same channel activators and data were processed using the same protocols as for the two datasets described above these data allow for comparison of open channel probability dependence on lipid mimetics.</p><p id="P10">We observe that lipid mimetics influence the fraction of particles in open channel conformation. The open probability of RyR1 solubilized in CHAPS is strongly modulated by lipids and increases from 16 to 67 and to 84% as lipid concentration grows from 0.001 to 0.01 and to 0.05% POPC, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Somewhat counter-intuitive observation was that in the lipid mimetics that is considered to better approximate lipid bilayer such as lipids nanodiscs and liposomes, open probabilitiy, Po, did not match values determined by electrophysiology. Thus, RyR1 reconstituted into the lipid liposomes is expected to be nearly fully open (Po &gt;90%) with activators used in the cryo-EM studies (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ATP, and caffeine) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Thus, for RyR1 reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs, 3D classification consistently failed to identify open conformation, suggesting that RyR1 remained fully closed. Open fraction of RyR1 reconstituted into lipid liposomes (62%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> was lower than that of DT-0.01 (67%) and DT-0.05 (84%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Lipid mimetics influence the channel gate diameter</title><p id="P11">Structural comparison of primed and open conformations shows that overall conformation of the primed and open states was similar in various lipid mimetic conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3a, b</xref>). However, closer structural analysis revealed that the gate diameters does slightly depend on the lipid mimetics. Thus, in the primed state, the Cα-Cα distance for gate residue I4937 was 11.2 Å for ND, 11.7 Å for all DT, and 12.2 Å for LP models. Different lipid mimetics introduced small but consistent changes in gate diameters for the open states too (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3 c, d</xref>). The Cα-Cα distances for gate residue I4937 were measured 17.5, 18.5, 19.1, and 18 Å for DT-0.001, DT-0.01, DT-0.05, and LP, respectively. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3c, d</xref>). These small changes in the gate diameter correlate with variations in the percentage of the particles in open conformation across the investigated lipid mimetics.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>A belt of ordered annular lipids is resolved at high lipid concentration</title><p id="P12">The map of DT-0.05-open resolved multiple elongated densities into which 72 lipids (18 per protomer named L0-L17) were modelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). At the same time, no density for ordered CHAPS molecules which are steroid derivatives with large flat structures composed of four fused rings clearly distinguishable from phospholipids, was observed despite high CHAPS concentration (molar ratios CHAPS: lipids were in the range 250:1 - 5:1). Even though DT-0.05-open map had lower resolution than the maps solved at lower lipid concentrations (DT-0.001-primed or ND-primed), the lipid densities were better defined and had unambiguous connectivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P13">The lipids were modeled as POPC, hence it was the only lipid added during the protein preparation. The modeled lipids cover nearly completely the concave regions of trans-membrane domain formed between the 4-helical voltage sensor-like helical bundles (S1-S4) arranged in a cross-like pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This is an improvement in comparison to the published RyR structures that typically include only two lipids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, while the structural model of closely related IP3R includes seven <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">The modelled lipids are organized in two layers around the surface of membrane embedded RyR1 region. The annular layer of lipids interacts directly with RyR1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>) and accounts for 13 lipids and lipids fragments. Among the lipids with modelled head groups, 3 are located on the luminal leaflet and 9 on the cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 a, c</xref>). The second layer of lipids contains 5 lipids and lipid fragments and as the 1<sup>st</sup> layer fills the concave surface of trans-membrane domain with 3 cytoplasmic and 2 luminal lipids (magenta in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The details of lipid-RyR1 interactions are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>. The annular lipids interact extensively with the protein vial hydrophobic interactions and several putative polar contacts with RyR1 amino acid residues located in the interface between hydrophobic and polar surfaces of the trans-membrane domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Lipids from the second layer, on the other hand, interact only with annular lipids except for L3 that forms a putative hydrogen-bond with Y4912 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To analyze details of lipid interactions with RyR1, we conducted a protein-ligand interaction analysis using the Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. In total, 49 residues per protomer interact with lipids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>), all are conserved between rabbit and human RyR1. Among these residues, mutations R4824C (R4825 in humans), A4845V (A4846 in humans), and F4859 deletion (F4860 in humans) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>) have been associated with Central Core Disease, whereas the mutation A4845V was linked to Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P17">To understand the role of lipids in stabilizing open RyR1 conformation, we compared the density of lipids between the maps obtained from detergent solubilized RyR1 prepared with different lipid concentrations and RyR1 reconstituted into nanodiscs. Due to the low resolution, maps from RyR1-LP and DT-0.001-open were not used in the analysis. When compared to DT-0.05-open map, the maps obtained at lower lipid concentrations had lipid densities in the same positions but were much weaker and more fragmented (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The cross-correlation values of the modeled lipids followed a similar trend as the density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Lipids in the first layer were conserved, except for L5, L12, L8 and L16 while density for the lipids in the second layer was too weak to model lipids reliably. This suggest that increasing lipid concentration leads to populating lipids in the weaker binding sites around the trans-membrane domain making consistently a lipid-bilayer-like structure between lobes formed by S1-S4 helical bundles.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Structural adaptations of lipid during primed to open conformational transition</title><p id="P18">The conformational changes in RyR1 trans-membrane domain during transition from closed/primed to open state include rotation of S1-S4 lobes by ˜2 degrees outwards and expansion of the cytoplasmic side of pore-forming S5-S6 helices with amplitude of around 3 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>). To understand the involvement of lipids in this transition and their possible role in stabilizing open state conformation, we compared the RyR1-lipid interactions between the DT-0.05-open state and DT-0.05-primed states. Most of the lipids and protein-lipid interactions are conserved between these states with exception of L4-5 and L11-13, L14-15, which might be less well resolved due to lower resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 a</xref>). Only minor structural rearrangements in lipids L2, L3, L7, L16, and L17 were observed. The lipid positions adapt to the altered membrane-exposed surface of the trans-membrane domain without global positional rearrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Open probability correlates with dimensions of the bilayer-mimicking belt</title><p id="P19">An additional insight into the properties of lipid bilayer mimetics was obtained from the analysis of the shape of the belt observed in the cryo-EM maps around membrane domain of RyR1. This hydrophobic belt originates from the lipid bilayer mimetics and reflects its geometry. We compared the sizes of the nanodiscs, micelles, and liposomes for nine density maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 a</xref>). For this analysis, the pixel size of the maps was calibrated, the maps were low pass filtered to resolution of 8 Å and the density levels were set to enclose identical volumes of the cytoplasmic domains of the RyR1 reconstructions.</p><p id="P20">The nanodisc belt had the smallest diameter of 142 Å (average value of three measurements, other diameters are calculated in the same way). For detergent-solubilized RyR1, the micelle sizes increased with lipid concentration from ˜149 Å at 0.001% to 159 Å at 0.05% POPC, respectively. The consistent density of liposome-reconstituted RyR1 had a diameter of ˜156 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In the open state, the size of the micelle increased by 5.8+/-4.2 Å. This is consistent with outward rotation of the voltage-sensor-like lobes with amplitude of ˜5 Å (diameter increase of the modeled region from 131 to 136 Å). As lipid concentration increased, the grooves between S1-S4 lobes were less pronounced and overall shape of the micelle became rounder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 a</xref>). This is consistent with binding of more lipids in the grooves as was described in the previous section. Taken together, these data indicate that the fraction of open RyR1 particles correlates with the size of the belt mimicking lipids bilayer. The LP datasets are likely less representative than lipid bilayer mimetics because lipid bilayer there is continuous, and the size of the belt reflects consistency of the liposome curvature rather than their physical dimensions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">Gating of ion channel is a stochastic process, thus, even in the closed state RyR1 shows rare transient spikes of conductivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Channel activators modulate frequency of conductivity spikes and their length <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Cryo-EM captures statistically averaged conformations which are expected to reflect the time-averages of open and closed channel states. There is an agreement between electrophysiology and cryo-EM regarding the existence of 2 principal channel conductivity states: closed pore that allows no current flow and open pore conformation in which hydrophobic gate made by side chains of I4937 is open to a well-defined diameter that facilitates ion flow with a certain resistance. Where cryo-EM data consistently disagree with electrophysiology for RyR1 is the channel open probability which consistently produced lower estimates from cryo-EM data than observed by single channel recordings.</p><p id="P23">Here we show that when RyR1 is solubilized in CHAPS, its open conformation can be modulated by lipids in a broad range. When lipid concentration is varied 50-fold between 0.001 and 0.05%, open probability of RyR1 increases from 16 to 84%. In this range the molar ratio between CHAPS molecules and POPC changes from 250:1 to 5:1 meaning that the starting point represents nearly pure CHAPS micelles whereas at high lipid concentration, about 20% of the molecules in a detergent micelle are POPC. At high lipid concentration, the open probability of RyR1 calculated from cryo-EM closely matches the open probability of RyR1 observed in the electrophysiological experiments with the same channel activators Po ˜0.96 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> suggesting that 5:1 CHAPS:POPC micelles provide a native-like functional environment for RyR1. It is worth noting that addition of lipids to detergent solution reduces the contrast of protein particles in the electron micrographs and therefore usually avoided during preparations of cryo-EM grids, but as we show here, it is desirable in specific cases like the studies of the open conformation of RyR1.</p><p id="P24">The properties of detergent micelles are very different from those of lipid bilayer. Detergent molecules are less hydrophobic, have different geometry, charge distribution and shape. Hydration of the detergent micelles is different from that of lipid bilayer. Therefore, it is not surprising that the free energies of the conformations associated with channel gating are different in lipid bilayer and in detergent micelles.</p><p id="P25">But what is the mechanism by which lipids stabilize the open conformation of RyR1 in detergent micelles? Cryo-EM structures suggest that addition of lipids alters structure of the primed state only slightly but the number of ordered lipids increases significantly. At high concentration of lipids, grooves between the voltage-sensor-like domains of RyR1 are filled with two layers of nearly complete bilayer-like lipids structure. These are also the regions where the largest conformational changes take place on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane domain around trans-membrane helices S5 and S6. Hence, these lipids provide very local native-like bilayer environment around the gate and may improve hydrophobicity of the micelle in these regions as well as create native-like local electrostatic potential. The size of the micelles also increases providing more hydrophobic environment to the trans-membrane domain as a whole which is also consistent with rendering the micelle more lipid bilayer like. Stabilization of the closed state at low lipid concentration in the CHAPS micelles is also consistent with the observation that at low lipid content the structures of the gate region are somewhat tighter in the primed and closed states than at high lipid concentration.</p><p id="P26">Our study compares 5 RyR1 structures all bound to a nanobody used for protein purification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Even though the nanobody was bound to Repeat12 domain at the periphery of the 270 Å wide cytoplasmic crown of RyR1, we cannot exclude a systematic effect of the nanobody on the open fraction of the channels, particularly because dantrolene and ARM210 bind to the overlapping sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. This, however, does not undermine our conclusions because all conditions apart from lipid mimetics were identical for all the compared structures.</p><p id="P27">It must be also noted that our study relied of miniaturized purification protocol that does not involve commonly used spin concentrators. This ensured accurate control of lipid concentration in the cryo-EM samples. Protein concentrating using porous-membrane-based spin concentrators, might lead to variability of the final detergent and lipid concentration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> and consequently to the variability of RyR1 open probability between preparations. The lipid and detergent concentrating effect may explain the inconsistent between our results (Po=16% at 0.001% POPC) and the study reported by de Georges at.al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> (Po=50%) that used spin concentrator during the last step of the protein preparation.</p><p id="P28">Intriguingly, reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs, RyR1 was expected to be in lipid bilayer like environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, however, the channel remained fully closed despite various attempts to open it.

To reduce aggregation of the reconstituted RyR1, we added 0.06% fluorinated octyl maltoside (fOM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. To open the channel, we attempted to remove fOM and to change the lipid composition of the nanodiscs (SoyPC, and a 1:1 mix of POPC and DLPC mixture <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> were tried), but the channel remained closed. We know however, that ryanodine does stabilize RyR1-ND in fully open state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> suggesting that RyR1-ND can be opened but requires a stronger agonist. Consistently, RyR1-ND had the smallest hydrophobic belt among the studied lipid mimetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The estimated size of the nanodisc of 142 Å is consistent with the expected diameter of MSP1E3D1-based nanodisc (120 Å to 160 Å <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>) and its shape suggests that the grooves between voltage-sensor-like domains are filled with lipids as would be expected for the nanodisc. Despite this, the ordered lipids were not well-resolved in the RyR1-ND cryo-EM map even though it res reconstructed to a higher resolution. We can hypothesize that in the nanodisc, the lipid belt constrained by MSP1E3D1 is too thin to mimic bulk of a lipid bilayer and lipid-MSP interaction propagates as a disorder in the grooves between voltage-sensor-like domains.</p><p id="P29">Occupancy of the open channel conformation of RyR1 reconstituted into lipid vesicles was in the range 37% and 62%, which is also lower than expected from single channel recordings and as previously discussed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> may depend on the lipid composition of liposomes and residual amounts of CHAPS in the reconstituted sample. Additionally, the high lipid bilayer curvature may contribute to different lipid pressure on the luminal and cytoplasmic sides of the membrane.</p><p id="P30">In summary, this report shows that open probability of RyR1 is highly sensitive to the lipid bilayer mimetics and must be thoroughly controlled during sample preparation for cryo-EM studies that investigate fine regulation of RyR1 gating by modulators.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Rabbit skeletal SR membranes isolation</title><p id="P31">The method used for SR membrane isolation here are adapted from a previously described protocol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>.
