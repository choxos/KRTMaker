The present study focuses on the metabolic profiling of cervical carcinoma using non-targeted metabolomics approach using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Our study identified over 100 metabolites in cervical tissue samples (both cancerous and adjacent normal) using HILIC and reversed-phase chromatography in the positive and negative ionization modes. The major metabolic alterations included changes in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and nicotinamide metabolism in a grade-dependent manner. Interestingly, metabolic differences between HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors included elevated arginine and proline metabolism, nicotinamide metabolism, and phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. We further validated our findings by analyzing transcriptomics datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to understand the expression patterns of the underlying genes involved in the dysregulated pathways. We observed that nicotinamide metabolism exhibits significant effects in lower-grade cervical cancers and specific HPV genotypes. We treated cervical cancer cell lines with niacinamide (NAM), an amide form of niacin, to evaluate its potential therapeutic efficacy. NAM treatment modulated NAD+ metabolism with key players such as CD38, PARP, NAMPT, and SIRT1, promoting apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation in cervical cancer cells. Importantly, the metabolic responses differed between the HPV-positive SiHa cells and HPV-negative C33A cells, reflecting distinct NAD+ metabolic adaptations. The study highlights the metabolic adaptation or shifts in cancer progression and provides insights into NAM’s molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential for precision medicine in cervical cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cervical Cancer</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>HPV</kwd><kwd>Nicotinamide</kwd><kwd>SIRT1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1.1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cervical carcinoma (CC) exhibits poor prognosis due to distant recurrence and metastasis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], Previous studies have established the fact that cervical cancer is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection resulting in p53 degradation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]·[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Cervical cancer predominantly spreads through lymphatic vessels and direct extension[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Primary treatment options include radical hysterectomy, radiotherapy, and cisplatin-based chemotherapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. However, careful consideration of specific treatment schemes is necessary based on the cancer types and HPV status. Despite these interventions, more than 30% of patients exhibit radio resistance, and the recurrence rate of early-stage cervical cancer exceeds 5% within 4.5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Additionally, the standard-of-care radiation therapy for locally advanced cervical cancer has remained unchanged for over three decades, resulting in stagnant clinical outcomes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].

In this report, we have characterized the metabolic profiling of cervical cancer patient biopsies using a nontargeted metabolic profiling strategy based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry which offers tremendous potential for clinical oncology by enabling the identification of cancer-related metabolites. We identified more than 100 different metabolites from the tissue metabolome in each category grade wise as well as in presence and absence of HPV infection. The primary metabolic aberrations in tumors tissues when compared to normal included changes in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and niacinamide (nicotinamide) metabolism. Further, niacinamide (NAM) treatment in cervical cancer cell lines, such as C33A and SiHa, modulated NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism by targeting key players like CD38, PARP, NAMPT, and SIRT1, inducing apoptosis and reducing proliferation, likely through effects on the EMT pathway. The distinct metabolic responses between HPV-positive and HPV-negative cell lines underscore the complexity of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism in cervical cancer. Thus, the study aims to assess targeted biochemical pathways linked to cervical cancer with a focus on high-resolution analysis.

In this study we examine the metabolic changes in a grade dependent and HPV occurrence in cervical tumor biopsies and further validate the predicted biomarker for early detection in cervical cancer cells. For the current study, we used a small cohort of cervical human cancer biopsies from Indian individuals with different grades (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Table 1</xref>). We initially verified the cancerous nature of these tissues by employing hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). The findings revealed varied H&amp;E staining patterns, alongside the presence of neoplastic cells exhibiting intense nuclear staining, suggestive of hyperproliferative cell presence. We isolated the genomic DNA to check the presence of HPV in the biopsy samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed degraded p53 or total absence of p53 protein specially in the HPV positive biopsies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b</xref>). It is a well-known fact that p53 is not in detectable expression in HPV positive tissue as it readily degraded by HPV. The absence of lower expression of p53 in HPV negative tissues could be due to frameshift or truncated mutation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], or negative regulation by MDM2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Further, to understand the metabolic changes, tumor biopsies were grouped into three categories, such as Grade 2, Grade 3 and normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). For each group 4 or more patient tumor biopsies were taken. We further categorized the entire cohort as HPV positive or HPV Negative biopsies. We observed that major portion of the changes occurred in the amino acid metabolisms including their derivatives in our cohort of cervical tumor tissues when compared the adjacent normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). Majority of the lipids of the class PC/LPC was observed to be dysregulated in the overall data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>Metabolic profiling of grade wise cervical cancer biopsies</title><p id="P5">Metabolic profiling displayed distinct profile separation between cancer and adjacent normal tissues as demonstrated by PLS-DA plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Furthermore, when plotted separately, there was also a clear segregation between healthy individuals and the two cancer grades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). 17 metabolites showed a statistically different fold change &gt; ±1.3 in normal vs. all cervical cancer tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). These metabolites are adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine 3’-monophosphate (3’AMP), dimethylarginine, 2-Phenylacetamide, tyrosine, phosphoethanolamine, choline, glutamic acid, urocanic acid, timonacic, proline, choline phosphate, N6-Isopentenyladenine, niacinamide, trimethoprim (TMP), hypoxanthine, 1-Myristoyl-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (MPPC) and adenosine-5’-diphosphate Di(monocyclohexylammonium) salt.</p><p id="P6">Analyzing the cervical cancer patients when divided into high- and low-grade indicates that 13 metabolites showed a statistically significant fold change ≥ ±1.3 when low grade patient tissues were compared with adjacent normal tissues. These were 3’AMP, ADP, O-arachidonoylcarnitine, phosphoethanolamine, glutathione, urocanic acid, palmitoyl thio-PC, timonacic, dimethylarginine, tyrosine, taurine, 2-Phenylacetamide, niacinamide and arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b, c</xref>). On comparison of higher-grade patient tissues with adjacent normal tissues, only 11 metabolites displayed statistically significant fold change such as ADP, adenosine 3’-monophosphate, leucine, 2-Phenylacetamide, N6-Isopentenyladenine, tyrosine, TMP, choline phosphate, dimethylarginine, glutamic acid and lactamide. The dysregulated metabolites shown are involved in various important enriched sets that are crucial for cell survival, proliferation and signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). Comparison of tissues between Grade 2 and Grade 3 mostly, revealed dysregulation of lipids such as phosphatidylcholines, and sphingomyelins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a</xref>). Clear segregation was observed among the different histological grades in PCA plot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3a</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We observed that several of these lipids were upregulated in the tumor biopsies. CAR 18:1 is significantly upregulated in grade 2 and grade 3 cancer samples compared to adjacent normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Increased levels of fatty acids like CAR 18:1 can provide cancer cells with energy and building blocks for membrane synthesis, supporting rapid proliferation and tumor growth.</p><p id="P8">Similarly, PC 14:0/14:0 (Phosphatidylcholine) and PC 38:6 (Phosphatidylcholine) show elevated levels in higher cancer grades. Phosphatidylcholines are major components of cell membranes, and their upregulation can facilitate the formation of new membrane structures required for rapid cell division and proliferation in cancer cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Palmitoyl Thio-PC derivative is significantly increased in grade 3 cancer samples, since it is like other phosphatidylcholines, it can contribute to membrane biogenesis and support the high proliferative rate of cancer cells. LPE 20:4/0:0 lysophospholipids was observed to accumulate in grade 3 cancers as they can promote cancer progression by modulating signaling pathways involved in cell growth, migration, and invasion, as well as contributing to membrane remodeling and lipid metabolism in cancer cells. CAR 4:0/3 CH/3-Hydroxybutyrylcarnitine is elevated in grade 3 cancer samples possibly to its role in the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria for energy production, which is essential for the high metabolic demands of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.3</label><title>Metabolic profiling of presence and absence of HPV in cervical cancer biopsies</title><p id="P9">We performed PCR to segregate the tumor samples based on HPV infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>). These groups were analyzed to study the differences in the metabolic alterations. Significant differences in the levels of niacinamide, xanthine, choline, and proline between normal and HPV-positive samples were observed, suggesting alterations in metabolic pathways related to these metabolites in HPV-associated cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). The heatmap demonstrate distinct metabolic profiles between normal and HPV-positive samples, with several metabolic pathways showing enrichment or depletion in HPV-positive samples and in HPV-positive samples compared to normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c, d</xref>). The metabolic pathways most enriched in HPV-positive samples include arginine and proline metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis, among others. Upregulation of lipids such as PC 38:6 (a phosphatidylcholine species) and CAR 18:1 (a fatty acyl) in HPV-positive samples, suggesting their alterations in lipid metabolism pathways in HPV-associated cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>). Notable lipid species such as SM 41:10/02 and PC O-43:8, exhibited differential expression in HPV positive tissues when compared to HPV negative tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2b</xref>). The Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) 2D score plot shows clustering based on latent variables (LV1 and LV2) among three groups, Normal, HPV Negative (HPVNeg), and HPV Positive (HPVPos) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>). The clustering indicates a clear separation of metabolic profiles between the three groups. Normal samples cluster distinctly from both HPV-negative and HPV-positive groups, while HPV-positive and HPV-negative samples share some partial overlap, suggesting differences in metabolic composition across these groups. PCA plot also highlights the distribution of HPV status across the samples, with partial overlap between the HPV positive and negative groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig.S3b</xref>). Pathway analysis in HPV-positive tissues shows enrichment in Phosphatidylethanolamine Biosynthesis and Phosphatidylcholine Biosynthesis, indicating altered phospholipid metabolism. Other enriched pathways include Nicotinate and Nicotinamide Metabolism and Arginine and Proline Metabolism. These suggest a shift in energy and redox metabolism in HPV-positive samples, possibly to support cancerous growth and maintain cellular redox balance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f</xref>, <bold>Top panel</bold>). Enriched pathways in HPV-negative samples include Purine Metabolism and Histidine Metabolism, which may indicate a focus on nucleotide synthesis and amino acid metabolism. Other pathways such as Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Tryptophan Biosynthesis, Nitrogen Metabolism, and Phenylalanine Metabolism are also highlighted, suggesting differences in amino acid and nitrogen metabolism compared to HPV-positive samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f</xref>, <bold>Below panel</bold>). Overall, the data suggests that HPV infection is associated with distinct metabolic reprogramming, particularly in pathways related to lipid metabolism, nucleotide synthesis, and energy production, potentially contributing to the proliferative and survival advantages of HPV-positive cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>2.4</label><title>Metabolic pathway analysis using transcriptomics GEO datasets</title><p id="P10">To obtain an overview of the underlying genes affecting these metabolic pathways, we retrieved microarray data from NCBI (Gene Expression Omnibus: GSE63514) and performed correlational analysis with our metabolomics data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 a-e</xref>). For metabolic pathway analysis using transcriptomics GEO datasets, we selected genes commonly involved in metabolic reprogramming of our respective enriched pathways from the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) Human Gene Set data. When we overlapped the transcriptomics data with the GSEA data, we observed that several genes affecting the major metabolic pathways were dysregulated, aligning with our metabolomics findings. Transcriptomics data exhibited metabolic pathway alterations in accordance with our data. We observed alteration in glutathione metabolism, which was also evident as GCLC shows upregulation, while GGT6 and GPX3 are downregulated, suggesting alterations in cellular redox balance. For Warburg effect genes such as PIK3CA, SLC2A1, and VEFA are upregulated, consistent with increased glycolysis in cancer cells. The upregulation of PIK3CA strongly supports the Warburg effect by promoting glycolytic metabolism and growth signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a,b</xref>). SLC2A1 encodes GLUT1, a glucose transporter that facilitates the entry of glucose into cells. Our data exhibited alteration in arginine and proline metabolism which is quite evident as ADC1 and GAM1 show downregulation, while MAOB is upregulated. Similarly, sphingolipid metabolism was shown affected due to significant upregulation of UGT8, while SMPD2 is downregulated, indicating changes in membrane lipid composition.</p><p id="P11">Interestingly, we observed a notable upregulation of CD38 in tumors samples, suggesting an increased capacity for NAD<sup>+</sup> generation and adenosine production potentially affecting the nicotinate and nicotinamide pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6 c,d</xref>). Further we checked for the expression and survival analysis of CD38 and NT5E (also known as CD73) genes across the cervical cancer (CESC) patients via Box plot and Kaplan-Meier survival plot using GEPIA2 as these genes affect the nicotinamide pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6e</xref>). These changes collectively point to a shift in NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism that may support the increased energy demands of more aggressive tumors.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><label>2.5</label><title>Nicotinamide as a potential biomarker</title><p id="P12">The effects of nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism were observed in both grade wise category as well as due to HPV genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, we validated the effect of the metabolite in HPV positive and negative cervical cancer cell lines to enhance its translational relevance. To directly demonstrate the effect of niacinamide on cervical cancer cells, we treated HPV positive SiHa and HPV negative C33A cells with different concentrations of NAM. IC50 of NAM was calculated with SiHa and C33A cell line as 36.36 mM and 40.01 mM respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). To analyse the CD38 expression, we treated C33A and SiHa cells with 40.1 mM and 36.6 mM NAM respectively. qPCR analysis revealed downregulation of CD38 in both cell lines. In SiHa, NAMPT was upregulated, while its levels remained unchanged in C33A. Additionally, PARP expression was downregulated in SiHa but upregulated in C33A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6f</xref>). qPCR analysis also revealed that Tfam (mitochondrial transcription factor A) was upregulated in SiHa cells following NAM treatment. FACS analysis revealed ~25% of cell apoptosis (both early and late combined) due to niacinamide treatment in SiHA cells compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7a</xref>). The effect was more pronounced in HPV negative cells, where ~37% of cell population exhibited apoptosis (both early and late combined). This observance was also in accordance with the increase in the expression of apoptotic marker BAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7b</xref>). To understand the mechanism behind NAM mediated apoptosis, we studied the expression of some of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Vimentin levels were reduced in C33A cells after 24h of NAM treatment compared to untreated controls suggesting NAM may inhibit EMT and metastatic potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7b</xref>). Similar effect was also observed in other EMT markers like beta-catenin; however, the effect was more pronounced in SiHa cells than C33A. Furthermore, TGF-β was downregulated in both cell lines after NAM treatment, indicating a potential mechanism through which NAM affects EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7c</xref>). NAM treatment also upregulated an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase, SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1) in SiHa cells. In addition, NAM treatment reduced phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) levels in both cell lines, while total AKT levels remained unchanged. The expression of c-Myc was also downregulated in both SiHa and C33A cells, further supporting NAM’s role in inhibiting pro-survival pathways and promoting apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 b,c</xref>). Similar observation was observed for wound healing assay, where the distance traveled by cells to close an artificial wound is measured. The data shows that NAM treatment for 24h significantly reduces the distance in both SiHa and C33A cells compared to untreated controls at 0h and 24h, suggesting NAM inhibits cell proliferation and wound healing capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7 d,e</xref>). Further a reduction in colony forming unit (CFU) absorbance was observed for both the cell lines treated with nicotinamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7f</xref>). This suggests that nicotinamide treatment may have inhibited cell growth or proliferation compared to untreated controls. Additionally, immunofluorescence analysis showed reduced expression of the proliferative marker, Ki67 in treated SiHa and C33A cells compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7g</xref>). The co-localization with DAPI staining indicated a decrease in cell proliferation in the treated groups, further confirming the impact of treatment on cellular growth dynamics. Thus, the data confirms the therapeutic potential of niacinamide especially in both HPV positive and negative cervical cancers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><label>3.0</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P13">Gene expression and cellular regulation often culminate in the production of metabolites, which are essential indicators of physiological and pathological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].

We noted a complex regulation of glutathione-related genes, suggesting a potential alteration in the tumor’s ability to manage oxidative stress. The upregulation of niacinamide is indicative of enhanced NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis, essential for glycolysis and metabolic pathways, which align with the Warburg effect seen in advanced cervical cancer.

NAM was significantly accumulated in Grade 2 cancer cells but not in Grade 3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This difference might be due to the regulation of the salvage pathway that recycles NAM to produce NAD<sup>+</sup>, a crucial cofactor involved in energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cell signalmg[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. Cancer cells can meet their increased NAD<sup>+</sup> demand through the de novo pathway (from tryptophan) or the more efficient salvage pathway[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. In early tumor progression, cancer cells may rely more on the salvage pathway, leading to higher NAM levels due to upregulation of enzymes like NAMPT. However, as the tumor progresses to Grade 3, cancer cells may shift towards other pathways for NAD<sup>+</sup> production, making the salvage pathway less important, resulting in lower NAM levels. Additionally, tumor microenvironment or epigenetic changes in Grade 3 cells may contribute to the differential regulation of the salvage pathway enzymes, affecting NAM levels.

Our findings also revealed that niacinamide (NAM) is involved in NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent in cervical cancer. NAM treatment induced apoptosis in both HPV-positive (SiHa) and HPV-negative (C33A) cervical cancer cells. NAM is the amide form of niacin, an essential nutrient obtained from dietary sources and supplements. Numerous studies have demonstrated that NAM may be a potential candidate as an anticancer agent in many cancer cell models, such as pancreatic cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>], chronic lymphocytic leukemia[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>], prostate carcinoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>], and breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]·[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Therefore, in our present study we investigated the <italic>in vitro</italic> effect of NAM on cell proliferation and apoptosis in human cervical cancer cells to explore its potential mechanism. Interestingly, NAM’s effects on key EMT markers, such as vimentin and beta-catenin, were more pronounced in SiHa cells. The basal levels of vimentin differed between the two cell lines. Notably, NAM treatment resulted in downregulation of TGF-β in both cell lines. TGF-β is known to play a crucial role in promoting EMT and enhancing the metastatic potential of cancer cells. Therefore, the reduction of TGF-β could contribute to NAM’s ability to inhibit EMT and, consequently, metastasis. This underscores the significance of TGF-β in the context of NAM-mediated effects on cancer progression. This anti-metastatic effect was further supported by scratch assays showing impaired cell migration in NAM-treated cells.</p><p id="P19">The study also highlighted key differences in NAM’s mechanism of action between SiHa and C33A cells. qPCR analysis revealed a downregulation of CD38 in both cell lines following NAM treatment. Interestingly NAM treatment also upregulated SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1), an NAD<sup>+</sup>- dependent deacetylase in SiHa cells. It requires NAD<sup>+</sup> as a cofactor for its enzymatic activity. NAM treated cells could increase NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, potentially supporting SIRT1 activity leading to CD38 inhibition. qPCR analysis also revealed that upregulation of TFAM in SiHa cells on NAM treatment. This upregulation of Tfam may indicate enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism, further supporting the notion that NAM could promote metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. The increase in TFAM could be linked to the observed upregulation of SIRT1, which has been shown to play a role in mitochondrial function and biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6f</xref>). NAMPT was upregulated in SiHa but remained unchanged in C33A, indicating differential regulation of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism. Additionally, PARP expression was downregulated in SiHa but upregulated in C33A, suggesting that NAM modulates NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism and DNA repair differently in these cell lines. The reduction of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) levels in both cell lines, while total AKT levels remained unchanged, and the downregulation of c-Myc further support NAM’s role in inhibiting pro-survival pathways and promoting apoptosis. Moreover, to evaluate the impact of NAM on cell proliferation, we examined Ki-67 expression, a well-established marker of cellular proliferation. NAM treatment led to a significant reduction in Ki-67 levels in both SiHa and C33A cells, indicating that NAM effectively inhibits cell proliferation in these cancer cell lines.</p><p id="P20">Thus, the study could provide valuable insights for developing targeted and personalized treatment strategies. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive view of the metabolic alterations in cervical cancer, offering potential therapeutic targets like NAM and pathways related to SIRT-1 and CD38 axis via the downregulation of EMT further supports the potential of NAM in inhibiting metastasis, making it a promising candidate for targeted therapy in cervical cancer.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="conclusions"><label>4.0</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P21">Our study provides a detailed metabolic profile of cervical cancer, highlighting key alterations that accompany grade specific and HPV induced carcinogenesis. The identification of over 100 dysregulated metabolites in tumor tissues, including niacinamide, arginine, and various lipid metabolites, underscores the extensive metabolic reprogramming that supports cancer cell survival, rapid division, and adaptation to the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, changes in nucleic acid synthesis, energy metabolism, and redox balance were observed, along with alterations in lipid composition that reflect increased energy demands and structural needs in higher-grade tumors. The distinct metabolic shifts seen in our study not only offer potential biomarkers for early detection but also reveal promising therapeutic targets. Niacinamide (NAM) emerged as a significant regulator of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism and oxidative stress management, with its role in reducing TGF-β and inhibiting EMT indicating its potential in hindering metastasis. The differential effects of NAM in HPV-positive and HPV-negative cell lines, such as the downregulation of CD38, upregulation of SIRT1, and modulation of EMT markers, further highlight its multifaceted role in cellular regulation. By elucidating the metabolic adaptations in cervical cancer, our findings support the potential of NAM and related pathways as candidates for targeted therapies. These insights into the SIRT1-CD38 axis, EMT inhibition, and differential NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism lay the groundwork for personalized therapeutic strategies, potentially enhancing the efficacy of treatments for cervical cancer. This study thus contributes to a growing understanding of how metabolic reprogramming shapes cancer progression and identifies metabolic interventions that could help curb cervical cancer proliferation and metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>5.0</label><title>Material and Method</title><sec id="S11"><label>5.1</label><title>Chemicals and Reagents</title><p id="P22">All chemicals and reagents utilized in this study were of high purity and sourced from either Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) or Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).

The study was approved by the Institutional ethics committee (IITB-IEC/2019/046), Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India (IIT Bombay) and Institutional ethics committee (AUUP/IEC/APR/2022/6) of Amity University Uttar Pradesh, India. The National Tumor Tissue Repository situated at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai India obtained informed consent from all tissue donors and all clinical investigation according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study involved 15 cervical cancer naïve tissues (11 tumor tissues and 4 adjacent non-cancerous tissues) between age 45-90 years. These cervical tissues were segregated grade wise as grade II and III as mentioned in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>. A minimum of four to five tissues per grade were selected for the study: however, in some grades. The sample size selection was based on several factors. In our cohort, we had only 4 number grade 2 samples and rest all were grade 3 samples. The table in the manuscript also shows a higher number of grade 3 cervical cancer samples compared to grade 2 samples. This reflects the tendency for cervical cancer to be detected more often at advanced stages, making earlier-stage samples rarer and more difficult to obtain in large numbers. Another key consideration in sample selection was the need to balance HPV positive and negative groups. The majority of the initial tissue samples were HPV positive, reflecting the high prevalence of HPV in cervical cancer cases. To create a more balanced comparison, we selected 11 cervical cancer samples that provided a relatively even distribution of HPV positive and negative cases. This careful selection allows for a more meaningful comparison between these two groups, despite the overall small sample size. All 11 cervical cancer samples used are from treatment-naive patients. These untreated samples are crucial for identifying potential early detection biomarkers, as they represent the natural molecular landscape of the disease before any therapeutic interventions. To address the limitations of the small sample size, we implemented rigorous statistical methods, extensive validation techniques, and also combine our data with publicly available dataset for meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><label>5.3</label><title>H&amp;E staining</title><p id="P24">The tissue sections underwent deparaffinization with a series of xylene washes, first with 100% xylene, followed by a mixture of xylene and ethanol in a 1:1 ratio.

The pathways shown include glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, amino acid metabolism (including phenylalanine, tyrosine, histidine, and arginine metabolism), and nucleotide metabolism. The schematic also highlights various enzymes and metabolic intermediates involved in these pathways, providing a comprehensive overview of the metabolic alterations observed in cervical cancer patients. Several metabolites seen dysregulated such as nicotinamide, a precursor of NAD<sup>+</sup>, which plays a crucial role in energy metabolism and is often dysregulated in cancer cells. Others like glutathione which is an important antioxidant molecule involved in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis, which can be dysregulated in cancer cells, Inosine, nucleoside involved in purine metabolism, which can be altered in cancer cells due to increased nucleotide synthesis demands.

Each panel corresponds to a different treatment concentration (0-85 mM) with niacinamide for cervical cancer cells, SiHa (top row) and C33A (bottom row). The data points are color-coded to represent different cell populations or subpopulations. Red color represents potentially viable or actively proliferating cells, green represents late apoptotic, or necrotic state and blue color representing early apoptotic cells. With increase in the niacinamide concentration increase in the apoptotic cells were observed. The effect for HPV negative C33A cell line was greater than SiHa cell line. b. Western blot analysis of EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) markers and apoptosis regulators. Expression levels of Vimentin, Beta-catenin, BAX (apoptosis regulator), and c-myc (oncogene) were measured in untreated (UT) and treated (T) C33A and SiHa cells. GAPDH serves as the loading control. c. Western blot analysis of key signaling proteins in C33A and SiHa cells. Levels of p53, SIRT1, total-Akt (T-Akt), phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), and TGF-β were analyzed before and after treatment (UT vs. T). GAPDH serves as the loading control. d.
