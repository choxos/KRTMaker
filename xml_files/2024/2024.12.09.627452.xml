Resistance to the few anthelmintic drugs is increasing. Here, we report a set of avocado fatty alcohols/acetates (AFAs) that exhibit nematocidal activity against four veterinary parasitic nematode species: <italic>Brugia pahangi</italic>, <italic>Teladorsagia circumcincta</italic> and <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic>, as well as a multidrug resistant strain (UGA) of <italic>Haemonchus contortus.</italic> AFA shows significant efficacy in <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> infected mice. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, AFA exposure affects all developmental stages, causing paralysis, impaired mitochondrial respiration, increased reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial damage. In embryos, AFAs penetrate the eggshell and induce rapid developmental arrest. Genetic and biochemical tests reveal that AFAs inhibit POD-2, encoding an acetyl CoA carboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in lipid biosynthesis. These results uncover a new anthelmintic class affecting lipid metabolism.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">More than 1.5 billion people are infected with helminth parasites, primarily affecting marginalized populations in low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Health Organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. These parasites are transmitted by skin-penetrating larvae or by eggs that are shed in human faeces and contaminate soil in areas where sanitation is poor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Helminth infections also have a devastating impact on companion animals, livestock production globally and are damaging to all major crops, causing huge economic losses estimated at over $80 billion per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Helminths compete with insects as the most evolutionarily successful animal clade on the planet, having colonized almost all known environments, including several extreme ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Parasitic helminths use animals or plants as their host, resulting in both direct and indirect negative impacts on public health, agricultural systems, and the ecology and conservation of wild species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Helminth infections are particularly challenging to treat without causing toxicity to mammalian hosts, due to strong similarities in their physiology and a multitude of mechanisms to block uptake, metabolize or expel exogenous poisons.</p><p id="P4">Despite the global challenges posed by animal and human helminth infections, the number of drugs used to treat them is limited to only a few chemical classes and target pathways. These include the benzimidazoles, targeting beta tubulin (e.g. albendazole); the macrocyclic lactones, targeting glutamate-gated chloride channels (e.g. ivermectin); the imidazothiazoles, targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (e.g. levamisole); the pyrazinoisoquinolones, targeting calcium channels (e.g. praziquantel); the salicylanilides, uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation (e.g. closantel); and piperazine, a GABA receptor agonist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. As drug resistance among parasitic helminths is on the rise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, new chemical classes with novel mechanisms of action are thus urgently needed to overcome the threat of resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Nature has been a valuable source of anthelmintic compounds, exemplified by the discovery in the 1970s of avermectin, a natural product of the soil bacterium <italic>Streptomyces avermitilis</italic>, and its widely used derivative ivermectin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In particular, plants have evolved a multiplicity of defense molecules against pathogens and therefore are a likely source of new, natural anti-nematode agents.</p><p id="P5">Direct high-throughput screening (HTS) of drugs for activity against parasitic helminths is challenging because their life cycle requires a developmental phase in the host, adding layers of complexity to the screening process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The free-living nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has already been established as a model for anthelmintic drug discovery due to its ease of laboratory culture, amenability to HTS for rapid whole-organism phenotypic screening, and the availability of extensive forward and reverse genetic methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Molecular genetic approaches, combined with chemical perturbation, provide a powerful toolbox for <italic>in vivo</italic> mode of action studies to identify molecular targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Moreover, parallel HTS across multiple species including <italic>Pristionchus pacificus</italic> could help identify candidates with broad-spectrum activity. Counter-screening for low toxicity in human cells can then help focus further efforts on potential lead compounds that are readily tolerated by humans.</p><p id="P6">Here, we describe a multispecies HTS approach using <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>P. pacificus</italic> to screen a commercial small molecule library containing FDA-approved drugs and natural products for potential broad-spectrum anthelmintic activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary data 1</xref>). Most molecules in this library are expected to be well tolerated in humans, which we confirmed by measuring toxicity in a human cell line. Among the bioactive compounds identified in the screen was a group of structurally similar 17-carbon fatty alcohol compounds present in extracts of the avocado <italic>Persea americana</italic>. We found that these compounds, which we collectively refer to as avocado-derived fatty alcohols/acetates (AFAs), elicit dose-dependent lethality in parasitic nematodes and target <italic>C. elegans</italic> POD-2, an acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) that is the rate limiting enzyme in lipid biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Novel class of anthelmintics</title><p id="P7">To identify new compounds with potential as anthelmintics, we screened a library of 2,300 small molecules containing FDA-approved drugs, other known bioactive compounds, and natural products (Spectrum Collection, MicroSource Discovery Systems, Inc.) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary data 1</xref>). Since parasitic nematodes are not amenable to high throughput screening (HTS) due to their complex life cycle, to identify potential broad-spectrum anthelmintics we looked for compounds that affect both of two distantly related free-living model species, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>P. pacificus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). To avoid non-specific cytotoxicity, especially in human cells, we additionally required low toxicity in U2-OS human bone osteosarcoma cells that we and others use routinely for image analysis due to their flattened morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">The primary screen was performed by treating synchronized L1 larvae with 10 μM compounds and incubating for 5-7 days (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary data 2</xref>) and resulted in the identification of a family of related compounds isolated from the avocado <italic>Persea americana</italic> that cause a variety of severe phenotypes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). These AFA compounds represent structurally similar 17-carbon fatty alcohols and their acetate variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>): <italic>avocadene</italic> ((2R,4R)-1,2,4-trihydroxyheptadec-16-ene), <italic>avocadyne</italic> ((2R,4R)-1,2,4-trihydroxyheptadec-16-yne), <italic>avocadene acetate</italic> ((2R,4R)-2,4-dihydroxyheptadec-16-en-1-yl acetate), <italic>avocadyne acetate</italic> ((2R,4R)-2,4-dihydroxyheptadec-16-yn-1-yl acetate), <italic>avocatin B</italic> (a mixture of avocadene and avocadyne), and <italic>avocatin A</italic> (a mixture of their respective acetate forms).</p><p id="P9">Nematodes are known to be highly resistant to harsh environmental conditions. Infective and adult stages are surrounded by a thick protective cuticle and embryos are protected by multiple layers that include a chitin layer, a vitelline layer and a chondroitin proteoglycan layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Using the model <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we asked if AFAs accumulate inside embryos or post-embryonic stages. Analysis of embryo and larval extracts by proton NMR revealed that both embryos and larvae contained significant amounts of AFAs following 10-20 μM treatments, as shown by the presence of the characteristic signals of the terminal olefinic group of avocadene acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). To characterize the activity profile of AFAs, we assayed them at different concentrations (from 1 μM to 100 μM) in liquid culture across <italic>C. elegans</italic> developmental stages, in 3 biological replicates (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and 4 technical replicates (<italic>n</italic> = 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). We found that all six of these (avocadene, avocadyne, their acetate forms, and the two mixtures avocatin A and B) yielded a concentration-dependent toxic effect on L1 larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), adult survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) and egg hatching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary movie 1, Supplementary movie 2</xref>). In contrast, two structurally related compounds, avocadenofuran and avocadynofuran, which contain a 17-carbon chain but differ in having a furan ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), showed no bioactivity in any of our assays at concentrations up to 100 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a-d</xref>). Comparison of LD<sub>50</sub> values showed that avocadene acetate, avocadyne acetate, and avocatin A exhibited similar potency and showed stronger effects than the non-acetate forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To further explore this class of compounds, we asked if related molecules would have similar effects. We found that two other purified molecules extracted from Avocado, persenone A ((2R,5E,12Z,15Z)-2-hydroxy-4-oxoheneicosa-5,12,15-trienyl acetate) and persin ((2R, 12Z,15Z)- 2-hydroxy-4-oxoheneicosa-12,15-dienyl acetate), as well as a fully saturated synthetic molecule, avocadane acetate ((2R,4R)-2,4-dihydroxyheptadecan-1-yl acetate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), had similar activities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Since persin and its derivatives are known to be toxic to animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, we focused on the novel AFAs we found in the screen.</p><p id="P11">The egg hatching assay was performed on harvested embryos, and we confirmed the presence of AFAs within treated embryos using NMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), demonstrating that these lipid alcohols and acetates can cross the eggshell barrier. To compare potency, we measured <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>P. pacificus</italic> egg hatching in the presence of avocadyne acetate or a selection of other anthelmintics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). We found that albendazole, mebendazole, and levamisole had no effect on egg hatching in either species; praziquantel (used to treat infections of the skin-penetrating worm <italic>Schistosoma</italic>) reduced egg hatching by 25% (<italic>n</italic> = 517; unpaired t-test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and by 90% (<italic>n</italic> = 416; unpaired t-test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) in <italic>P. pacificus</italic> at both 5 μM and 10 μM, and ivermectin decreased egg hatching by only 25% in both species (<italic>n</italic> = 594 and 751, respectively; unpaired t-test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, avocadyne acetate led to 100% inhibition of egg hatching in both worm models at 10 μM (<italic>n</italic> = 466 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>n</italic> = 447 in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>). AFAs thus show a rare ability among known anthelmintics to directly interfere with embryogenesis (independently of the maternal provisioning of fat molecules during oogenesis), which would be highly favorable for the treatment of parasitic nematodes.</p><p id="P12">Nematodes such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> can enter a dauer stage, during which they reduce their metabolism in order to adapt to harsh environments such as dryness, reduced nutrients, and altered temperature. The dauer stage is thought to resemble the infective L3 stages of many parasitic nematodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. To determine whether dauer larvae are also sensitive to AFAs, we treated dauers from both wild-type N2 (obtained by starvation) and the <italic>daf-2(m41)</italic> strain (which induces dauers at 25°C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> with avocadyne acetate for 48 h at 25°C, and found that it elicited lethality in N2 and <italic>daf-2(m41)</italic> dauer larvae with an LD<sub>50</sub> of 8.5 μM and 13.5 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>AFAs show a new mode of action</title><p id="P13">To test the effect of the AFA compounds on parasitic nematodes, we conducted assays in four veterinary parasites: <italic>H. contortus</italic>, <italic>T. circumcincta</italic>, <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> and <italic>B. pahangi</italic>. Avocatin B at both 10 μM and 50 μM induced strong larval lethality in all three parasitic species tested: <italic>H. contortus</italic>, <italic>T. circumcincta</italic>, and <italic>H. polygyrus</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 1</xref>). Furthermore, AFAs were also active in the multidrug resistant <italic>H. contortus</italic> UGA larvae and eggs at 10 μM and 50 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Importantly, avocatin A not only is effective against L3 and microfilarial stages, but also acts as macrofilaricidal, as it kills adult <italic>B. pahangi</italic> starting at 8-10 μM, with adult females being more sensitive than males (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). In <italic>H. contortus</italic>, while all six bioactive AFA compounds from the primary screen impaired egg hatching and caused larval lethality, the acetate forms elicited the strongest phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 1</xref>). Together with results from the primary screen, this analysis confirmed that the acetate forms induce the highest potency effect. Therefore, we performed the subsequent experiments using either avocadene acetate or avocatin A, which is a mix of the two acetate forms.</p><p id="P14">To test the possibility that AFAs represent a new class of anthelmintics, we screened them in <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants that are resistant to the known anthelmintics ivermectin/abamectin, levamisole, benzimidazoles and amino-acetonitrile derivative (AAD) monepantel. All mutant strains were susceptible to AFA toxicity at the same level as wild type N2 when treated at the L1 stage, indicating that AFA compounds act through a different mechanism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). To further characterize the mode of action of AFAs, we performed random mutagenesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> using ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS). Despite performing several large rounds of screening and testing the resistance of ~10 million genomes, we were unable to recover any strain with a reproducible level of resistance. The results of this forward genetic screen suggest either that evolving resistance to AFAs may require changes in multiple loci, or that their anthelmintic effects arise from physical damage to cellular structures.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>AFAs are active <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P15">To determine whether the anthelmintic effects of AFAs tested directly on nematodes would translate to an <italic>in vivo</italic> parasitic nematode system, we used mice infected by <italic>H. polygyrus</italic>, a model for gastrointestinal infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We tested the effect of Avocatin A on infected mice that were pre-inoculated and allowed to develop a high titer of infection for a week.

Adults displayed dose-dependent paralysis and inhibition of pharyngeal pumping within ~5 minutes of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). In embryos, acute treatment with 50 μM led to developmental arrest of all embryonic stages within ~30 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). To further characterize the paralysis, we measured oxygen consumption rates (OCR) in whole nematodes at the L4 stage, using a Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Basal OCR, a measure of baseline mitochondrial respiration, was significantly lower in worms treated with sub-lethal concentrations of avocadene acetate in comparison with DMSO controls (unpaired t-test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). We next measured maximal OCR in the presence of carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone (FCCP). FCCP is an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation that collapses the mitochondrial inner membrane proton gradient, which inhibits ATP synthesis and causes the electron transport chain to work at full capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.
