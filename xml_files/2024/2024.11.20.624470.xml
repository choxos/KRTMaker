neural processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In this study, we sought to elucidate the pathogenesis of progressive myoclonus epilepsy type 1 (EPM1), a disease caused by mutations in the <italic>CSTB</italic> gene, using cerebral organoids (COs) derived from EPM1 patient cells. The results demonstrate that EPM1 COs display increased electrophysiological activity and a disrupted excitatory/inhibitory balance. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of ventral EPM1-Cos revealed an abnormal specification of progenitor fate, with a shift toward dorsal neuron identities at the expense of inhibitory interneurons. In addition, pathological alterations in EV biogenesis and cargo were identified, including aberrant Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling, which may disrupt cortical patterning. These findings suggest that both intrinsic progenitor identity shifts and extrinsic EV-mediated signaling contribute to EPM1 pathology. Our study highlights potential therapeutic strategies mediated by EVs as a novel approach to mitigate disease progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cell fate</kwd><kwd>cerebral organoids</kwd><kwd>CSTB</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>extracellular vesicle</kwd><kwd>neurodevelopment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The extracellular space, encompassing the extracellular matrix (ECM), soluble molecules and extracellular vesicles (EVs), is critical for brain development, influencing cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Forero et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Long &amp; Huttner, 2022</xref>). A clear example of its importance is observed during cortical development, where both excitatory projection neurons (ENs) and inhibitory interneurons (INs) rely on cues from the extracellular environment to reach their proper locations within the cerebral cortex. ENs migrate radially from the dorsal pallium into the cortical plate, while INs are generated in the ventral telencephalon and migrate tangentially to the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Mar√≠n &amp; Rubenstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Silva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wichterle et al., 1999</xref>). Their migration is directed by a complex network of extracellular signals, including molecules and proteins secreted into the extracellular space via EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Amin &amp; Borrell, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Forero et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Pipicelli et al., 2023</xref>). Disruptions within the extracellular space can lead to significant neuronal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Long &amp; Huttner, 2019</xref>), which may interfere with proper neurodevelopment and contribute to a range of neurological conditions, including autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Klingler et al., 2021</xref>). Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy Type I (EPM1), while not directly classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder, shares common features of neuronal dysfunction often observed in such disorders. It is the most prevalent type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME), a group of inherited disorders marked by myoclonus, epilepsy, and progressive neurological decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Berkovic et al., 1986</xref>). EPM1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is primarily caused by biallelic mutations in the <italic>CSTB</italic> gene, which encodes Cystatin-B, a ubiquitous 98-amino-acid protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lalioti et al., 1997</xref>).The majority of EPM1 patients (‚àº90%) carry a 12-nucleotide repeat expansion mutation in the promoter region of the <italic>CSTB</italic> gene, leading to a drastic reduction in CSTB transcript and protein levels, with levels reduced to less than 10% of normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Joensuu et al., 2007</xref>). The clinical manifestations of EPM1 vary based on the genetic mutations. Patients with compound heterozygous mutations, involving the repeat expansion and a truncating null mutation, exhibit a severe form of the disease, characterized by earlier onset and accelerated progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Canafoglia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Koskenkorva et al., 2011</xref>). Homozygous patients with two null mutations present the most severe form, neonatal-onset progressive encephalopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Mancini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">O‚ÄôBrien et al., 2017</xref>). These variations highlight the crucial role of CSTB in normal brain development. CSTB was initially identified as an inhibitor of cysteine proteases, essential for the regulation of cellular proteostasis by protecting against proteases leaking from lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Turk &amp; Bode, 1991</xref>). Beyond this, CSTB protein has a proposed chaperone-like function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Rispoli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">≈Ωerovnik, 2022</xref>), and is also involved in various cellular processes, including modulating chromatin-associated proteolytic activity during neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Daura et al., 2022</xref>), interacting with cytoplasmic proteins related to growth and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Di Giaimo et al., 2002</xref>), mTOR signaling (Trstenjak-Prebanda et al., 2023), and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Polajnar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">≈Ωerovnik, 2024</xref>). CSTB also plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Di Giaimo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Gorski et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Penna et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pizzella et al., 2024</xref>). In CSTB knockout (<italic>Cstb</italic><sup><italic>‚àí/‚àí</italic></sup>) mice, which serve as a model for EPM1, early gene expression alterations in the cerebellum and granule neurons have been associated with early synaptic changes and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Joensuu et al., 2014</xref>). These alterations suggest disrupted synaptic maturation, with a particular emphasis on GABAergic signaling. Impaired GABAergic inhibition has been documented in EPM1 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Buzzi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Silvennoinen et al., 2023</xref>), who also exhibit EEG abnormalities and progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Canafoglia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Joensuu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kyllerman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Singh &amp; H√§m√§l√§inen, 2024</xref>). This underscores CSTB‚Äôs crucial role in maintaining neural function. Our previous research demonstrated that CSTB is not only essential for intracellular regulation but also secreted to instruct neighboring cells during neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Di Matteo et al., 2020</xref>). Functional CSTB levels influence the expansion of progenitor cells both intrinsically and extrinsically, and pathologically low CSTB leads to reduced recruitment of interneurons while driving premature differentiation of progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Di Matteo et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these findings highlight the multifaceted roles of CSTB in neural development and function.</p><p id="P3">Given that IN migration is altered in EPM1 and considering CSTB‚Äôs role in extracellular signaling, we hypothesize that these alterations could extend beyond migration, potentially affecting interneuron development itself. Aberrant CSTB signaling may therefore lead to broader defects in IN maturation and function, contributing to the overall pathology of EPM1. In this study, we employ human cerebral organoids (COs) generated from EPM1 patient lines (EPM1-COs) to model the disease. We show that EPM1-COs can recapitulate the pathologically altered electrophysiological properties observed in EPM1 patients. We then focus on ventrally patterned COs, which give rise to INs, and demonstrate that EPM1 ventral organoids exhibit altered patterning, leading to an impaired excitatory/inhibitory balance. Importantly, we propose that CSTB alters the extracellular environment through changes in the biogenesis and composition of EVs, particularly by modulating SHH levels within these vesicles. This altered SHH signaling via EVs is likely a critical factor in influencing neural differentiation and fate, thereby playing a significant role in the pathogenesis of EPM1.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Physiological alteration of neuronal activity in EPM1-COs is caused by changes in the neuronal fate</title><p id="P4">To investigate the mechanisms underlying the increased neuronal excitability and disrupted excitatory-inhibitory balance observed in EPM1, we generated cerebral organoids (COs) from two patient and two control induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) lines and cultured them for 8 months to probe their electrophysiological properties and assess whether this model could recapitulate the patient phenotype. We performed silicon probe extracellular recordings to reliably record from spontaneously firing neurons at several locations within a CO as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Di Matteo et al, 2024</xref>). Our findings revealed that 8-month-old EPM1-COs exhibit significantly higher electrophysiological activity compared to two control lines (CTRL-COs), as indicated by spike distribution and average spike number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S1A-F</xref>). Specifically, EPM1-COs showed a greater percentage of high-frequency spikes, defined as spikes with an inter-spike interval (ISI) below 500ms, compared to CTRL-COs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S1C</xref>). The observed hyperactivity in EPM1-COs may result from an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which is a common feature in epileptic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Sohal &amp; Rubenstein, 2019</xref>). To investigate this possibility, we examined the differentiation fate of unpatterned neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from patient or control cells. After eight weeks of differentiation, we found a significant increase in the number of excitatory marker-expressing neurons in EPM1 cultures, along with a corresponding decrease in inhibitory marker-expressing neurons compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E-H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S1E-F</xref>). These findings suggest that the hyperactivity observed in EPM1-COs could be driven by an imbalance in the production of neuronal subtypes, with a shift favoring excitatory over inhibitory neurons. To further validate these results, we generated neurons derived from both ventral (vNeurons) and dorsal (dNeurons) progenitors, dissociated from 30-day-old patterned EPM1- and CTRL-COs. Dorsally regionalized COs (dCOs) mimic the cellular architecture of the dorsal telencephalon, resulting in an enrichment of excitatory neurons. In contrast, ventrally regionalized COs (vCOs) resemble the ganglionic eminences, which predominantly give rise to inhibitory interneuron populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bagley et al., 2017</xref>). This approach allows us to directly compare the distinct neuronal subtypes influenced by regional patterning, providing insights into how EPM1 impacts both excitatory and inhibitory specification. In line with the previous results, vNeurons from ventrally patterned EPM1 cerebral organoids (EPM1-vCOs) exhibited a different proportion of GAD67-positive (inhibitory) and TBR1-positive (excitatory) neurons compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I, J, L, M</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S1G</xref>). Specifically, ventral EPM1 progenitors yielded fewer GAD67-positive neurons and more TBR1-positive neurons than controls, while dorsally derived progenitors did not exhibit significant differences in neuronal specification when compared to control NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I, K, L, N</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S1H</xref>).</p><p id="P5">To assess whether EPM1 vNeurons exhibited heightened neuronal activity driven by the altered differentiation of ventral progenitors, we employed Multi Electrode Arrays (MEA) analysis. For MEA recordings, we focused on the channel with the highest activity to record the spike activity and investigate potential alterations in the neuronal network properties. The analysis confirmed heightened neuronal activity in EPM1 patient-derived cultures after 10 weeks of differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S1I-J</xref>). When combining dorsal control cells with ventral EPM1 cells, EPM1 vNeurons exhibited markedly higher activity than their control counterparts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S1K-L</xref>). These findings suggest that ventral NPCs from EPM1 patients undergo an aberrant differentiation pathway, contributing to the altered electrophysiological properties observed in EPM1-COs.</p><p id="P6">Overall, these results suggest that the altered excitatory-inhibitory balance and increased neuronal activity in EPM1 -COs may be associated with the aberrant differentiation of ventral progenitors, leading to an imbalance that drives increased excitability in the neuronal network.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>EPM1 ventral progenitors and neurons change cell identity</title><p id="P7">Building on our observations of altered neuronal activity and disrupted cell fate decisions in EPM1-derived cells, we sought to further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes by analyzing the transcriptomic profiles of progenitors and their neuronal progeny. To this end, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on 40-day-old vCOs derived from EPM1 (EPM1-vCOs) and control (vCOs) lines. We selected day 40 as a critical time point for exploring the effects of CSTB protein dysregulation on neuronal differentiation and maturation. <italic>CSTB</italic> mRNA becomes detectable as early as day 16, but CSTB protein levels only emerge by day 40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Di Matteo et al., 2020</xref>). Following stringent quality control, we retained 10,972 high-quality cells across EPM1 and control ventral organoids. To visualize cellular heterogeneity, we integrated cells from vCOs (two control lines) and EPM1-vCOs (two patient lines), projecting them onto a two-dimensional UMAP space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S2A</xref>). The resulting clusters encompassed a wide array of cell types, including neural crest cells, neural progenitors (e.g., forebrain and striatal radial glia), and mature neurons. This dataset enabled us to interrogate the transcriptional similarities and differences between progenitors and neurons from both control and EPM1 origins.</p><p id="P8">We focused initially on the diversity within the progenitor population. Progenitors expressed classical markers, including <italic>SOX2, NES</italic>, and <italic>VIM</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S2B</xref>), and were further subdivided into five distinct subclusters: 'Progenitor,0' through 'Progenitor,4' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Notably, the frequencies of the Progenitor,0 and Progenitor,2 subclusters differed significantly between EPM1 and control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S2C</xref>), with Progenitor,0 being predominantly enriched in control cells, while Progenitor,2 was overrepresented in EPM1 cells. Interestingly, Progenitor,0 was characterized by the expression of medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) markers such as <italic>NKX2-1</italic> and <italic>SIX3</italic>, whereas Progenitor,2 exhibited dorsal progenitor marker <italic>PAX6</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-E</xref>). The Progenitor,1 and Progenitor,3 subclusters, meanwhile, displayed a combination of <italic>MEIS2</italic> and <italic>PAX6</italic>, markers commonly associated with the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence (dLGE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D-E</xref>). To corroborate our scRNA-seq findings, we performed immunofluorescence analysis, which confirmed a reduction in NKX2-1+ progenitors and an increase in MEIS2+ progenitors in EPM1-vCOs compared to control vCOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Further validation through immunostaining of dissociated cells from EPM1-vCOs reinforced the predominance of MEIS2+ progenitors in the EPM1 condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S2D</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Next, we characterized the neuronal populations, which expressed common neuronal markers such as <italic>DCX</italic> and <italic>MAP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S2E</xref>). We identified three subclusters: 'Neurons,0', 'Neurons,1', and 'Neurons,2' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). EPM1-derived cells were enriched in the Neurons,0 subcluster, while control-derived cells were predominantly present in the Neurons,1 subcluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S2F</xref>). Consistent with the progenitor data, the Neurons,0 subcluster was enriched for excitatory neuron markers, including <italic>THSD7A, CACNA2D1</italic>, and <italic>NEUROD1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I-L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S2G</xref>), while Neurons,1, primarily populated by control cells, expressed genes associated with inhibitory neurons, such as <italic>DLX1, DLX2</italic>, and <italic>GAD1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I-L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S2G</xref>). Immunofluorescence on 70-day-old vCOs further confirmed an increase in TBR1+ excitatory neurons in EPM1-vCOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>), whose expression is regulated by <italic>NEUROG2</italic> and the neurogenic transcription factor <italic>EOMES</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S2G</xref>). Additionally, consistent with the increased expression of dLGE progenitor markers‚Äîknown to give rise to medium spiny neurons‚Äîwe observed an enrichment of DARPP32+ striatal neurons in EPM1-vCOs by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S2H</xref>). These findings indicate that EPM1-vCOs exhibit altered patterning, with progenitors and neurons shifting from MGE to both dorsal and LGE fates, potentially contributing to the imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neural populations.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>EPM1 cells exert a dominant non-cell-autonomous effect on control cells</title><p id="P10">Based on our previous findings that CSTB is secreted and can remodel the extracellular environment, thereby influencing surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Di Matteo et al., 2020</xref>), we investigated whether altered levels of CSTB can affect cell fate in a non-cell-autonomous manner. We generated mosaic vCOs (mvCOs) containing GFP-labeled CTRL cells (mvCTRL) and non-labeled EPM1 cells (mvEPM1). Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on FACS sorted cells from 40-day-old mvCOs. The datasets from mvCTRL and mvEPM1 cells were integrated and cell diversity mapped with UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The identified cell types spanned dividing progenitors, progenitors, neurons and immune cells.</p><p id="P11">Strikingly scRNAseq data indicated that mvCTRL cells in close contact with mvEPM1 cells acquired features of the vEPM1 cells during neurodevelopment. Notably, the expression of the MGE progenitor marker NKX2.1 was dramatically decreased in cells from mvCOs compared to cells from vCOs regardless of their genotype, while the expression of LGE markers such as MEIS2 increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Accordingly, the neuronal output of mvCTRL cells was strongly affected by the pathological environment, with an increased expression of excitatory markers and a reduced expression of inhibitory markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref> and Appendix S3A). mvCTRL (GFP+), mvEPM1 (GFP-) and mixed (GFP+/-) ventricles were then analyzed by immunofluorescence on mvCOs at day 30. While CTRL ventricles contained NKX2.1+cells, the germinal zone of the mixed ventricles showed an identity closer to EPM1 ventricles, with a decreased number of NKX2.1+ ventricles and an increased number of MEIS2+ ventricles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-F</xref>).

To explore the extrinsic mechanisms underlying EPM1, we investigated how EVs could alter the extracellular environment and influence neighboring cells. We isolated a mixed population of small EVs, including both exosomes and small microvesicles (100-300 nm, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S4A</xref>), from the culture medium of vCOs and EPM1-vCOs using differential ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Forero et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Mathieu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Th√©ry et al., 2018</xref>). Immuno-electron microscopy confirmed the presence of CSTB within EVs, with some EVs also positive for the EV marker CD81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Interestingly, CSTB abundance in EVs changes during CO development with 2 peaks at d40 and at later stages of development together with other developmental markers like RELN and MAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">FIG. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Forero et al., 2024</xref>).

To explore this, we next aimed to investigate the biogenesis and secretion dynamics of EVs. We began by employing Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), a real-time technique used to measure the size and concentration of nanoparticles, such as EVs, by tracking their Brownian motion. NTA was employed to monitor EV secretion during the early stages of differentiation of NPCs into neurons. EPM1 young neurons (d5 to d12 of differentiation) secreted a lower amount of EVs with an average diameter of 115-165nm compared to CTRL cells and showed a trend toward larger diameter vesicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S4C</xref>). These findings prompted us to further examine EV secretion dynamics under EPM1 conditions. To achieve this, we employed live imaging of membrane fusion activity in both control and EPM1 neurons using TIRF microscopy. This was performed after overexpressing CD63-pHluorin, a tetraspanin-based pH-sensitive optical reporter that detects multivesicular body‚Äìplasma membrane (MVB-PM) fusion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Verweij et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). EPM1 neurons displayed a decreased number of fusion events per minute, indicating altered EV secretion in pathological conditions.</p><p id="P14">After identifying differences in EV secretion, we next investigated whether the protein cargo of EVs differed between control and EPM1 conditions. Using mass spectrometry, we profiled the protein content of EVs from CTRL (vEVs) and EPM1 (EPM1-vEVs), detecting 2,690 proteins for vEV1, 3,362 for vEV2, 2,805 for EPM1-vEV1, and 4,654 for EPM1-vEV2. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Th√©ry et al., 2018</xref>), standard EV markers (CD9, CD63, CD81, CD82, PDCD6IP, and TSG101) were present in all samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S4D</xref>), while negative markers such as ALB and AGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Th√©ry et al., 2018</xref>) were not detectable. We compared proteins secreted by each control and patient line to identify EPM1-specific vEV signatures, finding that control and EPM1-vEVs shared a large proportion of proteins (41.4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>). However, 3.4% of the total detected proteins (170) were unique to EPM1-vEVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>) and enriched for processes involved in cell trafficking from the ER to the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4E</xref>). Among the proteins unique to vEVs (0.8%, 41 proteins), no specific Gene Ontology (GO) terms were identified.</p><p id="P15">We then focused on differentially expressed proteins (DEP) between vEVs and EPM1-vEVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4F</xref>). GO term analysis of DEPs confirmed the accumulation of proteins involved in cell trafficking within EPM1-vEVs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S4E</xref>). In contrast, proteins depleted in EPM1-vEVs were associated with altered processes related to mRNA processing, nuclear pore localization, mitotic spindle formation, cytoskeletal organization, and axogenesis, all of which suggest pathological changes in gene expression, cell division, and neuronal maturation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S4E</xref>). As expected, CSTB was significantly downregulated in EPM1-vEVs.</p><p id="P16">Notably, many proteins altered in EPM1-vEVs are encoded by genes associated with human brain diseases, according to Disgenet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.disgenet.com/">www.disgenet.com</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Appendix Fig. S4F-G</xref>). Among the DEPs in EPM1-vEVs, we identified associations with epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, and brain malformations, underscoring the critical role of EV-mediated signaling in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><p id="P17">Among the differentially expressed proteins, SHH was significantly enriched in vEVs and emerged as a promising candidate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Notably, we previously identified SHH in EVs derived from ventrally regionalized organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Forero et al., 2024</xref>), further supporting its role in these structures. In the forebrain, SHH is primarily secreted from the prechordal plate and the ventral midline, including the notochord and floor plate. This signaling establishes a gradient that specifies the identity of neural progenitor cells along the dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ericson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Puelles &amp; Rubenstein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Rallu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Q. Xu et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the observed differences in EV composition could potentially explain the altered differentiation outcomes in progenitor identity. To test this hypothesis, we explored both short- and long-term effects of EVs on progenitor cells. For short-term effects, we treated NPCs with CTRL vEVs or EPM1-vEVs for 12 hours and analyzed their transcriptome through bulk RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4G</xref>). Compared to untreated NPCs, vEVs induced several transcriptomic changes, confirming the role of EVs in rapid cellular responses. Moreover, transcriptomic differences between vEV and EPM1-vEV-treated NPCs suggested that the altered protein cargo of EPM1-vEVs can indeed influence NPC transcripts quickly. Although the short-term exposure to EVs did not result in significant effects on the SHH pathway, we identified several changes associated with cell trafficking, as well as the regulation of WNT and BMP signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4G</xref>). This aligns with the understanding that lower levels of SHH allow the development of more dorsal structures by limiting the expression of ventralizing factors and permitting the action of dorsalizing signals like BMPs and WNTs. These findings suggest that EPM1-vEVs can impact the overall trafficking machinery, EV biogenesis, and contribute to the regulation of key signaling pathways involved in dorsal-ventral patterning.</p><p id="P19">We then examined long-term effects by comparing DEG between EPM1 and CTRL cells derived from vCOs or mvCOs, using single-cell RNA sequencing data. We performed pseudobulk RNA analyses to investigate whether general transcriptional differences could be attributed to non-cell-autonomous effect. In the vCOs we identified <italic>NKX2</italic>.<italic>1</italic> enriched in vCTRL progenitors while <italic>WNT3</italic> and <italic>WNT3A</italic> were enriched in vEPM1 progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4H</xref>).

Using brain organoids derived from iPSCs from EPM1 patients harboring mutations in the <italic>CSTB</italic> gene, we successfully recapitulated impaired electrophysiological activity, highlighting defects in the excitatory/inhibitory balance that likely contributes to the onset of epilepsy and other neurological symptoms. Previous studies have documented reduced GABAergic inhibition and cortical thinning in EPM1 patients and <italic>CSTB</italic> knockout mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Buzzi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Silvennoinen et al., 2023</xref>). Here we showed that low levels of CSTB in EPM1 result in intrinsic effects such as progenitor cell misspecification, and extrinsic effects, mediated by non-cell autonomous cues conveyed by EVs, which influence the neighboring cells. We propose that reduced GABAergic signaling depends on the pathological misspecification of progenitor cell fate, which led to an altered neuronal output characterized by an unexpected shift toward dorsal cortex and dLGE identities. Cell type-specific alterations in the ventral fate of progenitor cells during early development leading to fewer GABAergic neurons have also been described in other neurodegenerative disorders like Huntington‚Äôs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Galimberti et al., 2024</xref>). These common pathological features underscore the importance of investigating aspects of neurodevelopment in diseases not directly classified as a neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><p id="P21">Importantly, our study expands upon these findings by showing that these alterations arise from both intrinsic factors, and extrinsic influences, particularly through EVs, which can modulate neurogenic niche.</p><p id="P22">Interestingly, the unique protein content of EPM1-vEVs suggests a link between altered trafficking mechanisms and disease pathology. In EPM1 EVs, we identified many components of the TRAPP complex, which regulates vesicle tethering and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). Disruptions in TRAPP function may impair EV production and release, affecting cell communication in the developing brain, leading to defects in the delivery of proteins and lipids necessary for membrane biogenesis and vesicle formation. To further support our data, we demonstrated that EPM1 cells release fewer CD63+ EVs, which supports the disruption in the biogenesis and release of EVs. Overall, these data support the idea that EPM1 cells may have defects in the late stages of EV biogenesis or in the efficient release of these vesicles.</p><p id="P23">Among the proteins altered in EPM1 EVs, we identified sonic hedgehog (SHH), a key player in dorsoventral patterning. This highlights a potential mechanism by which EV-mediated signaling may contribute to the altered cortical patterning observed in EPM1. Low levels of SHH in EPM1-vEVs could drive progenitor cell fate changes. Indeed, human COs generated with a SHH protein gradient clearly show that dorsal (PAX6+, TBR2+, TBR1+) cerebral cortex-like tissue and DARPP32+ striatum-like tissue emerge in areas distal from the SHH source tissue, while MGE-like tissue is detected in proximal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cederquist et al., 2019</xref>). This finding highlights the importance of progenitor identity in maintaining cortical E/I balance and suggests that disruptions in this process may be a key driver of EPM1 pathology.</p><p id="P24">Although control vEVs contain SHH, the absence of this signaling in EPM1 cells may disrupt the gradient necessary for proper patterning, leading to a dominance of the pathological signals from EPM1-vEVs. This suggests that the SHH gradient is essential for maintaining normal cortical development, and its disruption in EPM1 could contribute to the observed phenotypic alterations. The observed changes in EV content, suggest that EVs may play a crucial role in progenitor specification and the subsequent disruption of cortical patterning in EPM1. This is consistent with recent findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Pipicelli et al.

The altered progenitor fate and the role of pathological EVs in disrupting cortical development highlight the complexity of EPM1 and underscores the need for continued research into the cellular and molecular underpinnings of this and related disorders.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>IPSCs culture</title><p id="P26">iPSCs were previously reprogrammed from 2 control lines of fibroblasts (Klaus et al., n.d.) and PBMCs origin (Di Matteo et al., 2020) and from 2 EPM1 patient lines (Di Matteo et al., 2020). iPSCs were cultured on Matrigel (Corning) coated plates (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) in mTesR1 basic medium supplemented with 1x mTesR1 supplement (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) at 37¬∞C, 5% CO2 and ambient oxygen level.

Briefly, the protein extract was loaded onto the centrifugal filter CO10 kDa (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), and detergent were removed by washing five times with 8M Urea (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) 50mM Tris (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) buffer. Proteins were reduced by adding 5mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (Bio-Rad, Canada) at 37degrees C for 1 hour in the dark. To remove the excess of DTT, the protein sample was washed three times with 8M Urea, 50mM Tris. Subsequently protein thiol groups were blocked with 10mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at RT for 45 min. Before proceeding with the enzymatic digestion, urea was removed by washing the protein suspension three times with 50mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, Spain). Proteins were digested first by Lys-C (Promega, USA) at RT for 2 hours, then by trypsin (Premium Grade, MS Approved, SERVA, Heidelberg, Germany) at RT, overnight, both enzymes were added at an enzyme-protein ratio of 1:50 (w/w). Peptides were recovered by centrifugation followed by two additional washes with 50mM ammonium bicarbonate and 0.5M NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, Swisserland). The two filtrates were combined, the recovered peptides were lyophilized under vacuum. Dried tryptic peptides were desalted using C18-tips (Thermo Scientific, Pierce, USA), following the manufacture instructions. Briefly, the peptides dissolved in 0.1%(v/v) formic acid (Thermo scientific, USA) were loaded onto the C18-tip and washed 10 times with 0.1 % (v/v) formic acid, subsequently the peptides were eluted by 95% (v/v) acetonitrile (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 0.1% (v/v) formic acid.

Eluting peptides were directly sprayed onto the timsTOF Pro (Bruker Daltonics). Peptides were loaded in buffer A (0.1% (v/v) formic acid) at 400 nl/min and percentage of buffer B (80% acetonitril, 0.1% formic acid) was ramped from 5% to 25% over 90 minutes followed by a ramp to 35% over 30 minutes then 58% over the next 5 minutes, 95% over the next 5 minutes and maintained at 95% for another 5 minutes. Data acquisition on the timsTOF Pro was performed using timsControl. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent PASEF mode with one survey TIMS-MS and ten PASEF MS/MS scans per acquisition cycle. Analysis was performed in a mass scan range from 100-1700 m/z and an ion mobility range from 1/K0 = 0.85 Vs cm-2 to 1.30 Vs cm-2 using equal ion accumulation and ramp time in the dual TIMS analyzer of 100 ms each at a spectra rate of 9.43 Hz. Suitable precursor ions for MS/MS analysis were isolated in a window of 2 Th for m/z &lt; 700 and 3 Th for m/z &gt; 700 by rapidly switching the quadrupole position in sync with the elution of precursors from the TIMS device. The collision energy was lowered as a function of ion mobility, starting from 45 eV for 1/K0 = 1.3 Vs cm-2 to 27eV for 0.85 Vs cm-2. Collision energies were interpolated linear between these two 1/K0 values and kept constant above or below these base points. Singly charged precursor ions were excluded with a polygon filter mask and further m/z and ion mobility information was used for ‚Äòdynamic exclusion‚Äô to avoid re-sequencing of precursors that reached a ‚Äòtarget value‚Äô of 14500 a.u. The ion mobility dimension was calibrated linearly using three ions from the Agilent ESI LC/MS tuning mix (m/z, 1/K0: 622.0289, 0.9848 Vs cm-2; 922.0097 Vs cm-2, 1.1895 Vs cm-2; 1221.9906 Vs cm-2, 1.3820 Vs cm-2).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Raw data analysis of MS measurements</title><p id="P47">Raw data were processed using the MaxQuant computational platform (version 1.6.17.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>) with standard settings applied for ion mobility data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Prianichnikov et al., 2020</xref>).

The analysis was conducted on a high-performance computing cluster, using 250 GB of memory and 32 CPU cores on a single node. The human reference genome, GRCh38 version 1.2.0, was used for reads alignment and transcriptome generation, with intronic reads included to capture nascent transcripts, and secondary alignments excluded.</p><p id="P51">Quality control (QC) and preprocessing of single-cell RNA-seq data were performed using Scanpy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>). Cells with low quality, such as those with a high proportion of mitochondrial reads or an abnormally low number of genes expressed, were removed to ensure the retention of high-quality data for further analysis.</p><p id="P52">To remove low-quality cells from the dataset, an outlier detection strategy was implemented based on key quality metrics. Cells were filtered using thresholds based on the median and median absolute deviation (MAD) of these metrics. Specifically, outliers were defined as cells where any of the following conditions were met: the total counts per cell (log1p_total_counts) deviated more than 5 MADs from the median, the number of genes expressed per cell (log1p_n_genes_by_counts) deviated more than 5 MADs from the median, or the percentage of counts in the top 20 most expressed genes (pct_counts_in_top_20_genes) deviated more than 5 MADs from the median.</p><p id="P53">Additionally, mitochondrial content was used to further identify and remove low-quality cells. Cells were considered outliers if the percentage of mitochondrial gene expression (pct_counts_mt) deviated more than 3 MADs from the median or exceeded a fixed threshold of 8%.</p><p id="P54">To identify and remove potential doublets from the dataset, the scDblFinder algorithm was used within the R environment, integrated into the Python workflow using rpy2. The raw count matrix was transferred from the Scanpy object into the R environment, where the scDblFinder package was used to classify cells as doublets or singlets. Specifically, the SingleCellExperiment framework was used to store the expression data, and doublets were identified using scDblFinder with a random seed set for reproducibility. Following this process, each cell was assigned a doublet score and a classification as either a doublet or singlet. Cells classified as doublets were excluded from the dataset before proceeding with downstream analyses, ensuring that only singlet cells were retained for further clustering and gene expression analysis.</p><p id="P55">Normalization was performed using the scran method to account for variations in library size. Size factors were computed for each cell using the computeSumFactors function, leveraging preliminary clustering to improve accuracy. The count matrix was then divided by these size factors, and a log1p transformation was applied to the normalized data. This scran-normalized data was stored in the adata.layers for downstream analyses. Highly variable genes were selected for downstream analysis using Scanpy‚Äôs highly_variable_genes function. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, and the top 30 principal components were used for neighborhood graph construction. To cluster the cells, the Leiden algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Traag et al., 2019</xref>) was employed using a resolution of 1. The neighborhood graph was constructed using the pp.neighbors function, and clustering was performed using tl.leiden. To visualize the clusters, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was performed with the tl.umap function in Scanpy. Clusters were visualized in two-dimensional space, and marker genes were used to assign cell types to the clusters. Differential gene expression analysis was performed between clusters using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to identify potential marker genes for each cell population. Cell types were also annotated using CellTypist. The pretrained model developing_Human_Brain.pkl was applied for automated cell type prediction, as described by Xu et al.

This automated annotation was run in parallel with marker gene-based manual annotation to ensure accuracy and consistency in cell type identification. Cells identified as fibroblasts through the automated annotation with CellTypist were excluded from the dataset to focus on other relevant cell populations. We retained a total of 10,972 cells for the ventral organoid experiments and 10,965 cells for the mosaic experiment. These high-quality cells were used for all subsequent analyses. Following this, batch effects were corrected, and datasets were integrated using Scanorama to ensure a harmonized view across different samples. The integration was performed to account for technical variations while preserving the biological variance of interest.</p><p id="P56">Pseudobulk RNA-seq analysis was performed by aggregating the counts of cells belonging to specific cell types into pseudo-replicates. Cells annotated as progenitors were selected, and counts from these cells were summed across pseudo-replicates. The resulting pseudobulk data were analyzed using the DESeq2 pipeline via the pyDESeq2 package. Differential expression analysis was conducted between different conditions, and the results were visualized using volcano plots to identify significantly up- and down-regulated genes.
