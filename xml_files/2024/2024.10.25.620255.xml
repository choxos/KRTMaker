Here, we report the biochemical characterization of <italic>Thermococcus kodakarensis</italic> Nat10 (TkNat10), an RNA acetyltransferase involved in archaeal thermotolerance. We demonstrate that TkNat10’s catalytic activity is critical for <italic>T. kodakarensis</italic> fitness at elevated temperatures. Unlike eukaryotic homologs, TkNat10 exhibits robust stand-alone activity, modifying diverse RNA substrates in a temperature, ATP, and acetyl-CoA-dependent manner. Transcriptome-wide analysis reveals TkNat10 preferentially modifies unstructured RNAs containing a 5’-CCG-3’ consensus sequence. Using a high-throughput mutagenesis approach, we define sequence and structural determinants of TkNat10 substrate recognition. We find TkNat10 can be engineered to use non-native acyl-CoA donors, providing insight into its cofactor specificity. Finally, we demonstrate TkNat10’s utility for site-specific acetylation of RNA oligonucleotides, enabling analysis of ac4C-dependent RNA-protein interactions. Our findings establish a framework for understanding archaeal RNA acetylation and a new tool for studying the functional consequences of ac4C in diverse RNA contexts.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Posttranscriptional modifications provide an evolutionary strategy to expand RNA function. One representative example is cytidine acetylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> In bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, the formation of N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) within RNA is catalyzed by the TmcA, Kre33, and Nat10 family of cytidine acetyltransferase enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The architecture of these proteins is highly homologous across all three kingdoms of life and comprises at a minimum an N-terminal helicase domain, a Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT), and an RNA-binding domain all joined within a single polypeptide scaffold ranging from ~600-1000 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P3">In bacteria, ac4C helps ensure accurate protein translation through the modification of a single substrate, the wobble position of initiator tRNA<sup>Met</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> Cytidine acetylation appears to also be highly controlled in eukaryotic organisms. Penetrant acetylation sites have thus far been validated within type II tRNA and 18S rRNA, where they have been implicated in tRNA stability and ribosome biogenesis, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> In contrast, archaea have demonstrated the potential for much more pervasive patterns of nucleic acid acetylation to exist. Applying nucleotide resolution ac4C sequencing as well as LC-MS to the archaeal hyperthermophiles <italic>Thermococcus kodakarensis</italic> and <italic>Pyrococcus furiosis</italic>, our group and others have detected hundreds of ac4C sites distributed across diverse coding and non-coding RNA substrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> In many substrates RNA acetylation was found to be directly proportional to growth temperature. This has led to the hypothesis that ac4C may aid fitness by increasing the robustness of RNA secondary structure at elevated temperature. Interestingly, in nearly all instances these sites occur at the central nucleobase of a 5’-C<bold><underline>C</underline></bold>G-3’ consensus sequence, the same motif that the human tRNA and rRNA sites are found within. How archaeal enzymes modify the same consensus sequence as eukaryotes – as well as the parameters of their vastly different substrate scope - remains to be established.</p><p id="P4">Despite much effort, biochemical studies of RNA cytidine acetyltransferase enzymes remain limited. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> TmcA has been the most extensively characterized, revealing key determinants of tRNA<sup>Met</sup> recognition, stand-alone ATPase activity, and a potential mechanism for communication between the helicase and GNAT active sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> Eukaryotic Nat10-type acetyltransferases require protein and short nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) adapters to efficiently modify their cellular tRNA and rRNA substates, and thus present a more challenging target for reconstitution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Our group and others have found sensitive radioactivity-based assays are necessary to detect the activity of reconstituted eukaryotic (fungal) Nat10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> Although these studies have provided valuable biochemical and structural insights, their technical nature makes it difficult to analyze a large number of substrates, while the limited turnover of eukaryotic enzymes prevents an obstacle to preparative applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> Archaeal enzymes often provide tractable model systems useful for understanding more challenging eukaryotic counterparts as well as powerful tools for biotechnology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> However, the reconstitution and functional properties of RNA acetyltransferases involved in archaeal thermotolerance are currently unknown.</p><p id="P5">Here we report the biochemical characterization of the sequence-specific RNA acetylation catalyst <italic>Thermococcus kodakarensis</italic> Nat10 (TkNat10). This enzyme exhibits stand-alone RNA cytidine acetyltransferase activity and is able to modify substrates in a temperature, ATP, and acetyl-CoA-dependent fashion. Profiling the transcriptome-wide modification of <italic>T. kodakarensis</italic> substrates reveals the recombinant enzyme reaction directs acetylation to different substrates than are modified in vivo. A next-generation sequencing assay demonstrates a requirement for a 5’-CCG-3’ consensus sequence and a preference for unstructured substrates that can be influenced by secondary mutations. Finally, we probe the cofactor tolerance of this enzyme and demonstrate its promiscuous activity can be harnessed for site-specific acetylation of non-native RNA substrates, enabling us to study how ac4C perturbs RNA-protein interactions in its biologically relevant 5’-C<bold><underline>C</underline></bold>G-3’ context. Our studies define the properties of a novel component of the archaeal thermotolerance program and provide a tool for studying the functional consequences of cytidine acetylation in diverse RNAs.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Expression and purification of recombinant TkNat10</title><p id="P6">The coding sequence of <italic>Thermococcus kodakarensis</italic> Nat10 (TK0754) was codon-optimized for <italic>E. coli</italic> expression, custom-synthesized (ATUM), and inserted into a bacterial expression vector with an N-terminal His and maltose binding protein (MBP) tag (His6-MBP-tev-TkNat10 WT; #24231-X02-566).

In contrast, the C7 mutation was more dominant, with ac4C deposition only being significantly restored by secondary A20 and U20 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, center, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S6B</xref>).</p><p id="P40">Given the apparent anti-correlation between modification and base-pairing, we expected disruption of additional base pairs within U20 variants would enable even more efficient enzyme catalysis. Instead, we observed several mutants in stem I whose effects dominated that of U20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, right, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S6C</xref>). One striking example came from analysis of position 9, whose mutation was uniformly associated with decreased modification of U20 helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, blue lines). In contrast, mutation of its pairing partner 16 increases acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>, orange lines). Since our design embeds <italic>H. sapiens</italic> helix 45 in a larger RNA to facilitate reverse transcription and PCR, we hypothesized co-mutation of U20 and position 9 could be driving formation of a new secondary structure in which helix 45 was disrupted, but the 5’-CCG-3’ substrate was fully base-paired with an upstream 5’-CGG-3’ in the scaffold sequence. In line with this view, in silico structural prediction indicates the A9/U20 mutant is capable of forming an alternative structure in which the 5’-CCG-3’ consensus is housed in a fully paired duplex (‘scaffolded consensus,’ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S7</xref>). The alternative structure is predicted to be destabilized by mutations in positions 15-17, 23, and 24 in the 3’-stem, potentially explaining the differential effects of mutating the two stems. Further supporting this view, when the modification rate of U20 double mutants is corelated with MFE we find that 5’-stem mutations follow a parabolic distribution, with acetylation of those that highly enforce (C7) or abrogate structure (A9, C9, and U9) disfavored (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S8</xref>, blue). This suggests that 5’-stem mutations that are overly destabilizing favor the alternative structure, a relatively poor substrate. In contrast, for 3’-stem mutations MFE and modification are linearly correlated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S8</xref>, green), as would be expected if TkNat10 displayed a straightforward preference for unstructured substrates. Analysis of modification and MFE among all single stem mutants and 3’-stem double mutants (592 data points) further confirms this anti-correlation of modification and negative free energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). This preference has some interesting parallels with SHAPE reagents,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> reactive chemicals which similarly report on RNA accessibility. Overall, these studies demonstrate the utility of ac4C-seq for high-throughput profiling of RNA acetyltransferase-substrate interactions and specify the 5’-CCG-3’ consensus and RNA secondary structure as important determinants and anti-determinants of in vitro modification by TkNat10.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Evaluating archaeal enzymes as a tool for sequence-specific RNA acetylation</title><p id="P41">A major challenge in the study of RNA cytidine acetylation has been a lack of methods to install ac4C into physiological consensus sequences. Recently, we reported a synthetic approach to address this obstacle which enabled the production of sequence-defined RNA oligomers harboring acetylation at specific positions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> One caveat to this approach is that it requires access to custom synthesized phosphoramidite building blocks and significant expertise with automated oligonucleotide synthesis. Considering this, we wondered whether the promiscuous activity of TkNat10 may be amenable to the acetylation of non-native substrates, providing a preparative route to RNAs containing the acetylated 5’-CCG-3’ consensus motif for functional studies. To test this, we incubated a short 10-mer RNA oligonucleotide containing a 5’-CCG-3’ sequence with TkNat10 and cofactors at 65 °C for 3 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). MALDI-TOF confirmed a +42 Da mass shift consistent with to the expected mass of acetylation, which was absent in the enzyme-free control reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p><p id="P42">Protein lysine acetyltransferases are able to use alternative acyl-CoA cofactors to catalyze formation of a wide range of acylations including propionylation and crotonylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> The ability of RNA acetyltransferases to catalyze similarly diverse acylations has not been explored. To evaluate TkNat10’s cofactor promiscuity we incubated enzyme with propionyl-CoA and ATP and analyzed modification of our short RNA oligonucleotide substrate by MALDI. Propionyl-CoA was chosen due to its relatively small footprint and known ability by many GNAT-containing protein acetyltransferases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> In contrast to acetyl-CoA, no modification as observed in the propionyl-CoA reaction, suggesting a strict requirement for the endogenous cofactor. To evaluate the molecular basis for this specificity we attempted to relax the specificity by enlarging the active site, expressing and purifying mutants in which Ser623 was mutated to a glycine either alone (S623G) or in combination with Trp635 (S623G/W635A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S9A</xref>). Analogous mutations have been shown to enable the GNAT histone acetyltransferase KAT2A to use biorthogonal azide and alkyne-containing acyl-CoAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> Analyzing reaction products by MALDI, we found the TkNat10 S623G was able to use propionyl-CoA as a substrate, with the propionylation reaction appearing to proceed to a lesser extent than acetylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S9B</xref>). Neither enzyme was able to use larger biorthogonal acyl-CoAs as cofactors, and the dual S623G/W635A mutant was completely inactive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S9C</xref>). These results indicate the strict specificity of cytidine acetyltransferases for acetyl-CoA and provide a mutational starting point for using these enzymes to study non-native N4-cytidine acylations.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Enzymatic modification enables analysis of ac4C-dependent RNA-protein interactions</title><p id="P43">Nucleobase modifications can act as potent regulators of RNA-protein interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> Previous studies have demonstrated that using in vitro transcription to homogenously replace cytidine with N4-acetylcytidine in synthetic mRNAs can alter the RNA-protein interactomes of these molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> However, this approach presents several caveats.

This substrate was incubated with TkNat10 and cofactors at 65 °C for 3 h and acetylation was verified by MALDI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Fig. S10</xref>). To test ac4C’s ability to affect recognition by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), we individually incubated two biotinylated RNAs – one with TkNat10-catalyzed ac4C and one without - with RAW 264.7 cell lysates, enriched over streptavidin, and analyzed the proteins captured by LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S3</xref>). Focusing on proteins identified by &gt;1 peptide, we identified 18 proteins whose capture was significantly impeded by ac4C (p-value <underline>&lt;</underline> 0.05, Log2 fold change <underline>&lt;</underline> -1) and 4 proteins whose capture was facilitated by ac4C. Interestingly, the majority of proteins whose capture was impeded by ac4C were RBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6D</xref>), while the majority of proteins whose capture was facilitated by ac4C have been identified as common contaminants in proteomics experiments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> One potential explanation for the latter observation is that RNA acetylation impedes RBP/resin interactions, which are then saturated by non-specific protein binding. Among the RBPs whose interaction is disrupted by ac4C are known PCBP1, PCBP2, and ZC3HAV1, all of which have demonstrated evidence of cytidine-dependent RNA-protein interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> The potential for ac4C to interfere cytidine-dependent protein binding is illustrated by modeling the modification into a crystal structure of RNA bound to PCBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6E</xref>). Our findings provide further evidence for the ability of cytidine acetylation to influence RNA interactomes and highlight archaeal cytidine acetyltransferase enzymes as a powerful tool for functional analysis of 5’-CCG-3’ acetylation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P45">Here we report the reconstitution, biochemical profiling, and functional application of a <italic>T. kodakarensis</italic> RNA acetyltransferase. Our studies shed light on unanswered questions around these catalysts, including the specific relevance of their acetyltransferase activity to archaeal fitness, their substrate and cofactor selectivity, and potential applications in preparative production of ac4C oligonucleotides. We demonstrate the utility of quantitative ac4C sequencing for high-throughput profiling of RNA acetyltransferase substrates. This study confirmed TkNat10’s preference for single-stranded RNA substrates, suggesting a potential application of this enzyme as a structural probe. Finally, we show this promiscuous catalyst can be applied to N4-acetylate the 5’-CCG-3’ consensus motif short RNA oligonucleotide contexts and use this to examine the impact of site-specific ac4C on RNA-protein interactions.</p><p id="P46">Our results also highlight features warranting further investigation. One surprising result was the apparent incongruity between the preferred cellular versus biochemical targets of TkNat10. Applying an identical ac4C sequencing method, we found that in cells rRNA and tRNAs are the most highly modified targets of the enzyme,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> while in biochemical experiments unstructured RNA substrates are preferred. Several factors may contribute to this observation. First, our assay conditions undoubtedly present different concentrations of cofactors and ions than the endogenous intracellular environment of <italic>T. kodakarensis</italic>. Along similar lines, our recombinant enzyme preparations were applied to a deproteinized <italic>T. kodakarensis</italic> transcriptome, which is expected to have a large impact on the presentation of rRNA substrates. Perhaps the most intriguing hypothesis for this dissimilarity may come from consideration of eukaryotic RNA acetylation, where short nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and protein adapters are used to guide ac4C to specific sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> Archaea have equivalent sno-like RNA (sRNA) mechanisms which help carry out modifications such as 2’-O-methylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> Future studies aiming to define the input of sRNAs as well as other proteins into archaeal ac4C deposition should help to better understand this phenomenon. TkNat10’s preference for unfolded substrates is also interesting in light of recent studies indicating ac4C can serve to enforce RNA secondary structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> This could conceivably allow the stand-alone enzyme to perform a sentinel function by sensing unfolded RNAs and installing a modification to promote folding and – potentially - fitness. Testing this hypothesis will benefit from additional research exploring ac4C’s capacity to function as an RNA structure switch, which should in turn be facilitated by the enzymatic modification strategies described here.</p><p id="P47">It is also important to specify some limitations of our study and future work that may help address them. Our high-throughput studies explored TkNat10’s activity within the context of only two hairpin substrates and used MFE as a simple proxy for RNA structure. Integrating analysis of more diverse substrates structure probing data could provide a more comprehensive understanding of archaeal RNA acetyltransferase activity and guide future applications. A barrier faced in our biochemical characterization was the requirement for heating, which hindered application of conventional coupled enzyme techniques to determine kinetic constants for TkNat10. We anticipate this may be remedied in the future by using stop-point assays in combination with highly specific and sensitive tools for acetyl-CoA or CoA detection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> Finally, while we were able to demonstrate near stoichiometric enzymatic modification of a short RNA oligonucleotide, TkNat10’s utility as a tool for site-specific RNA acetylation is currently limited to contexts where a consensus motif exists. Efforts to broaden the substrate selectivity of this enzyme may benefit from directed evolution strategies capable of converting modifications into functional changes in RNA or protein activity, examples of which have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> Overall, our studies provide new insights into the biochemistry of a highly conserved enzyme family and a foundation for studying the role of site-specific RNA acetylation in biology, therapeutics, and disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Table S1</label><media xlink:href="EMS199694-supplement-Table_S1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d107aAcDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Table S2</label><media xlink:href="EMS199694-supplement-Table_S2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d107aAcDcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Table S3</label><media xlink:href="EMS199694-supplement-Table_S3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d107aAcDdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Table S4</label><media xlink:href="EMS199694-supplement-Table_S4.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d107aAcDeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supporting Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS199694-supplement-Supporting_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d107aAcDfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ronald Holewinski and Thorkell Andresson (Protein Characterization Laboratory, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research) for LC/MS/MS and proteomic analysis.

(D) Circular arc plot depicting interaction of secondary mutations with C1, C7, and U20 mutations. Interaction scores were calculated from difference in summed % CCG conversion for parent and double mutant across three conditions (3 h 55 °C, 3 h 65 °C, and 5 h 65 °C). The width and intensity of each arc is scaled to the strength of the interaction, with mutations that stimulate ac4C modification in orange and those that reduce it in blue.

(E) Simplified schematic indicating the potential for 18S helix 45 mutation to form alternative RNA structures by interacting with scaffolding RNA. Left: The expected helix 45 surrogate forms and is predictably modulated by single mutations and double mutants in the 3’ stem. Right: When weakened helix 45 variants (e.g. U20) acquire a second mutation in the 5’ stem – particularly at position 9 – they favor an alternative structure in which the consensus sequence becomes fully paired with an upstream sequence, reducing susceptibility to TkNat10 modification.

The misincorporation is derived from incubation of TkNat10 and cofactors with RNA at 3 h 65 °C.
