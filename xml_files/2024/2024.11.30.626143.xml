However, over 500 non-proteogenic amino acids exist in nature that can get misincorporated into proteins. Canavanine is an antimetabolite of L-arginine, with which it shares high chemical similarity. It can be utilized by bacteria such as <italic>Pseudomonas canavaninivorans</italic> in the legume rhizome as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen. However, canavanine is also incorporated in proteins of this bacterium as its arginyl-tRNA synthetase loads tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> with both canavanine and arginine. The recently discovered canavanyl-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> deacetylase (CtdA) removes canavanine from misloaded tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> and thereby prevents its incorporation in proteins. CtdA is the first enzyme known to edit tRNA mischarged with a non-proteinogenic amino acid. We have elucidated its crystal structure to 1.5 Å resolution and studied its active site using site-directed mutagenesis. We found that CtdA is a small monomeric enzyme that presents a central, deep cavity that predictably constitutes the canavanine binding site and a positively charged surface area that likely coordinates the CCA-3’ tRNA attachment sequence. The stand-alone, trans-editing CtdA is distantly related to the B3/B4 cis-editing domains of the large multi-subunit enzyme Phenylalanine tRNA synthetase (PheRS). Our comparative study reveals that CdtA and B3/B4 domains from bacterial and archeal/eukaryotic origin are three subclasses of a same conserved 3D-fold that differ in type-specific indels, which distinctly shape the substrate binding cleft of these proteins. We propose a unifying nomenclature of secondary structure elements for this 3D-fold. In CtdA, residues E191, Y104, N105 and E118 prove to be relevant for catalysis, of which N105 is conserved in bacterial B3/B4 domains. No other shared residues of catalytic relevance could be identified across enzymes of this class, so that a shared mechanism of catalysis appears unlikely in these editing enzymes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>Site directed mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>tRNA-editing</kwd><kwd>Indel-mediated fold evolution</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Ensuring translational fidelity is a crucial task in all domains of life as misincorporation of incorrect amino acids into proteins can drastically reduce organismal fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bacher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mohler et al., 2017</xref>). Generally, faulty proteins reduce fitness through three phenomena: (i) loss of protein function, (ii) gain of protein toxicity and (iii) clean-up costs of erroneous proteins that can overload the turn-over machinery of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Drummond &amp; Wilke, 2009</xref>). Translational mistakes can either happen at the ribosome during decoding and polypeptide formation or earlier, during amino acid activation and tRNA charging. The latter process is mediated by aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetase (aaRS) enzymes. Typically, aaRSs are specific for the charging of a single proteinogenic amino acid onto its cognate tRNA, which is remarkable considering the vast number of other proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids that exist in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Fichtner et al., 2017</xref>). To ensure translational accuracy, aaRS enzymes have developed a so-called ‘double-sieve’ mechanism that ensures correct amino acid charging. Here, a first active site within the enzyme activates and transfers the correct amino acid onto its tRNA, while a second, editing active site does proofreading and hydrolyzes incorrectly loaded aminoacyl-tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Rubio Gomez &amp; Ibba, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Jani &amp; Pappachan, 2022</xref>). Approximately half of all aaRSs are known to rely on such <italic>cis</italic>-editing to efficiently load tRNA with cognate amino acids instead of structurally similar, non-cognate ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Rubio Gomez &amp; Ibba, 2020</xref>). In addition, a third ‘sieve’ mechanism has been discovered in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes that is performed by autonomous editing enzymes, which catalyze the in-<italic>trans</italic> editing of mischarged tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Jani &amp; Pappachan, 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P3">A total of 23 aaRSs are known to date, one for each of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids (except for lysine, for which there are two) plus pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) and phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase (SepRS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Rubio Gomez &amp; Ibba, 2020</xref>). In contrast, the number of freestanding trans-editing enzymes identified to date is more limited, currently including Ser-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> (which edits Ser loaded onto a Thr specific tRNA), Ser/Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> (AlaX), D-aa-tRNA<sup>aa</sup> (DTD), Cys-tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> (Ybak), Ala/Cys-tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> (ProXp-X) and other less specific ProXp variants that deacylate a variety of mischarged tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Jani &amp; Pappachan, 2022</xref>). At exception of DTD, standalone trans-editing enzymes share sequence conservation with the cis-editing domains of the corresponding aaRS enzyme whose mischarged amino acids they correct for; namely, Ser-tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> relates to the N2 domain of ThrRS, the AlaX trans-editing enzymes relate to the C-terminal domain of AlaRS, and Ybak and ProXp enzymes relate to the INS domain of ProRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Jani &amp; Pappachan, 2022</xref>). Recently, we have identified a canavanyl-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> deacetylase (CtdA) as a standalone editing enzyme that constitutes the first example of trans-editing enzyme with similarity to the <italic>cis</italic>-editing B3/B4 domain of the large beta subunit of Phenylalanine-tRNA-synthetases (PheRS), which corrects for mischarged tyrosyl-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hauth et al., 2023</xref>). This relation is unexpected as CtdA specifically hydrolyzes the non-proteinogenic arginine antimetabolite canavanine from tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>, which differs notably from the phenyl-/tyrosyl- substrates processed by PheRS. Canavanine (δ-oxa-arginine) and arginine differ only in a single atom substitution (atom δO instead of δC) in the lateral side chain. CtdA is found in bacteria that encounter canavanine in their natural habitat, often originating from leguminous plants. The enzyme enables the bacteria to circumvent canavanine intoxication caused by the misincorporation of this non-proteinaceous aminoacid into proteins in lieu of arginine. Thus, CtdA is also the first example to date of a non-proteinogenic editing enzyme.</p><p id="P4">PheRS is the aaRS enzyme best characterized at the molecular level so far. Three types of PhRS enzymes are currently known: bacterial (αβ)2-PheRS, eukaryotic/archaeal cytosolic (αβ)2-PheRS, and mitochondrial α-PheRS (α and β referring here to subunit composition). Three-dimensional structures of PheRS representatives from these three classes are available: namely, the cytosolic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Finarov et al., 2010</xref>) and mitochondrial enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Klipcan et al., 2012</xref>) from <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and the cytosolic PheRS from <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Sharma et al., 2021</xref>) among eukaryotes; PheRS from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baidin et al., 2021</xref>) and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Michalska et al., 2021</xref>) among bacteria; and the enzyme from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Moor et al., 2006</xref>) in archaea. In addition, an N-terminal fragment of the beta subunit of PheRS from the archaeon <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic> has also been characterized structurally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Sasaki et al., 2006</xref>). PheRS enzymes diverge significantly in primary sequence, domain composition and subunit organization, but crystal structures have revealed that their editing B3/B4 domains share a similar fold that carries sequence insertions characteristic of every PheRS type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Sasaki et al., 2006</xref>), where the editing pocket of the archaeal/eukaryotic domains differs drastically from that of their bacterial counterparts at the sequence and structure level. This divergence has made it difficult to establish whether the same catalytic mechanism is shared by these <italic>cis</italic>-editing domains.</p><p id="P5">In this work, we have structurally characterized CtdA, a distant homologue of the B3/B4 domain class that discriminates between the proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids arginine and canavanine, respectively. Specifically, we have solved the crystal structure of CtdA from <italic>Pseudomonas canavaninivorans</italic>, modelled the binding of the substrate canavanine, tested single mutation variants of CtdA to identify residues relevant for substrate binding or catalysis, and performed sequence and structure comparisons of CtdA and homologous B3/B4 editing domains from PheRS enzymes. Our findings suggest that the folds of CtdA and B3/B4 domains from PheRS share a closely conserved central scaffold, but have diverged evolutionarily via indels that define the topography of their substrate binding sites. Common catalytic residues across CtdA and B3/B4 domains could not be detected, so that the possible existence of a shared mechanism of catalysis remains unclear.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CtdA is a small monomeric enzyme with an α/β fold</title><p id="P6">The atomic structure of CtdA from <italic>Pseudomonas canavaninivorans</italic> has been elucidated to 1.50 Å resolution using X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Two essentially identical molecular copies of CtdA (RMSD<sub>Cα</sub>=0.32 Å for all 231 Cα atoms in the protein chain) are present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal form obtained in this study. An analysis of the molecular interface in the crystallographic dimer using PISA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Krissinel &amp; Henrick, 2007</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa</ext-link>) suggested the dimer not to be physiological, but resulting from packing in the crystal lattice. This conclusion was supported by data from size-exclusion chromatography that indicated the presence in solution of a protein species with a molecular mass of ∼25.2 kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig S1</xref>). This agrees excellently with the molecular mass of CtdA calculated from its amino acid sequence (25.0 kDa). Taken together, this data suggested that CtdA is monomeric in solution.</p><p id="P7">The 3D-fold of CtdA consists of seven alpha helices and eight beta strands that fold into a central four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (formed by strands β1, β2, β7 and β8), which is capped by an apical β-rich domain at one side and packs against a bundle of three α-helices (α2, α3 and αIS1a) on its other face. An α-hairpin-like structure (formed by helices αIS1b and αIS1c) packs orthogonally against the helical bundle and central β-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>) (the nomenclature of secondary structure elements is described later below). The overall fold resembles that of domains B3/B4 in PheRS, with the apical β-rich domain sharing structural similarity with domain B4 and the central β-sheet and its flanking α-helical bundle with domain B3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Identification of the substrate binding site in CtdA</title><p id="P8">To identify the substrate binding site in CtdA, we performed an analysis of its surface topography. This revealed a deep cavity on the protein surface, centrally located in the fold, whose entrance is surrounded by a number of positively charged residues (K73, R76, K86, R87, R90, R167, R168, R172, R178) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). The cavity itself is largely lined up by hydrophobic residues (W158, W169, W187, I189) and contains negative charges at its deepest end (contributed by residues E118 and E191) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). Predictably, it accommodates the canavanyl-moiety of the substrate. The positively charged surrounding of the cavity likely mediates the binding of the negatively charged tRNA backbone, specifically the CCA-3’ sequence. This sequence is conserved at the 3’ end of all mature tRNA molecules and functions as the site of amino acid attachment. This sequence is important for the recognition of tRNA by enzymes. Large, multi-subunit PheRS enzymes have a large substrate binding interface and provide many opportunities for determinants of substrate specificity, so that their B3/B4 editing domains are not highly dependent on reading the tRNA sequence directly. On the contrary, in the small standalone CtdA, recognition and reading of the tRNA moiety is predictably critical to establish that the non-proteinogenic canavanine has been wrongly attached to tRNA.</p><p id="P9">In order to confirm that the identified cavity could accommodate the aminoacyl rest of the liganded tRNA and to get insights into essential substrate-binding amino acids, we performed co-crystallization as well as crystal soaking trials of CtdA with canavanine, arginine, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> or a synthetic RNA hairpin loop mimicking the tRNA CCA-3’ sequence. Unfortunately, these efforts were unsuccessful and a liganded CtdA structure could not be obtained. Thus, we performed instead <italic>in silico</italic> ligand docking studies of canavanine into the identified surface cavity using AutoDock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Trott et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). The resulting model revealed a canavanine molecule in extended conformation bound into the cavity, confirming that the dimensions of the cavity are suitable to accommodate the canavanyl moiety of the canavanyl-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> substrate. It further suggested that the negatively charged glutamate residues at the deep end of the cavity likely coordinate the positively charged guanidinium group of canavanine. Interestingly, the model also indicated that residue C166 might interact with atom δO in canavanine, thereby potentially playing a role in the discrimination between the highly similar canavanyl- and arginyl- substrates by the enzyme. To bring support to the hypothesis that CtdA binds differently to these substrates, we attempted to measure experimentally CtdA’s affinity for canavanine and arginine. However, our efforts to quantitate the binding of these ligands to CtdA using microscale thermophoresis were unsuccessful. The result led support to the view that CtdA has low affinity for the free amino acids and that engagement of the tRNA moiety by the cluster of positively charged residues must play an important role in the productive binding of the substrate.</p><p id="P10">Building on these structural and bioinformatics results, we aimed next to confirm functionally relevant residues playing a role in catalysis or substrate binding. For this, we first sought and investigated CtdA-related sequences to confirm the conservation of residues lining the predicted canavanyl-binding cavity in CtdA or areas around the cavity potentially co-localizing with the canavanyl-ribose ester bond to be excised. A sequence similarity search using BLAST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>) revealed 7 sequences with high similarity (∼66-30% seq. id.) to CtdA from <italic>P. canavaninivorans</italic> in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig S2</xref>). The high similarity suggests that also those proteins might display canavanyl-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> deacylase activity. All sequences identified were from bacterial organisms, including pathogens such as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, suggesting that this activity might be more widely spread among bacteria present in soil or animal digestive tracts (environments where legumes are present) than previously anticipated. In the sequences of those putative CtdA enzymes, residues suggested by crystal structures to be of significance to substrate binding (E118, C166, E191) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>) or predicted to colocalize with the canavanyl-ribose ester bond in the substrate bound state (Y104, N105, S108; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>) were strictly conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig S2</xref>). As strict conservation might point to functional significance, we set to test the contribution of these residues to catalysis. For this, we used site directed mutagenesis to generate single point mutants of CtdA for the following residue exchanges (designed based on structural tolerance predicted using FoldX; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Schymkowitz et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig S3</xref>): S80A, Y104F, N105D, S108A, E118Q, C166G, E191V. We then tested the performance of the CtdA mutated variants in canavanyl-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> editing <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). To assess editing activity, tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> was first canavanylated using an arginyl-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>-synthesase as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hauth et al., 2023</xref>). Then, canavanyl-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup> was incubated with the mutated CtdA variants. Various residue exchanges impacted editing activity strongly. For the exchanges E191V, Y104F, N105D, E118Q, after a 10 minute incubation time the percentage of canavanylated tRNA within the samples was similar to the no enzyme control samples, indicating that the mutation had abolished CtdA catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). Mutants C166G, S080A and S108A still yielded editing activity, with S080A showing no difference to the wild-type enzyme. This result suggested that the negative charges at the deep end of the binding cavity, E191 and E118, are individually required for successful substrate binding and/or catalysis and that, similarly, residues N105 and Y104 predictably in the proximity of the canavanly-ribose junction are catalytically important. Conceivably, residues Y104 and N105 might form part of the catalytic oxyanion hole known to be required for the stabilization of the catalytic intermediate in hydrolase-mediated reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bauer et al., 2020</xref>). Residue G117, which binds the hydroxyl group of canavanine in the docked model and is part of the sequence VGGEN, could also be part of the oxyanion hole. The participation of Y104 and/or G117 in oxyanion formation in CtdA would be in agreement with known oxyanion hole signature motifs (GX-, GGGX- and Y- motifs) in α/β-hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bauer et al., 2020</xref>). On the contrary, activity data show that residue C166 does not appear to play a deterministic role in the binding or catalysis of canavanyl-tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>. Therefore, its significance in the discriminatory catalysis of canavanyl- versus arginyl-ester hydrolysis by CtdA remains uncertain.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The CtdA fold has evolved via indels</title><p id="P11">Next, we aimed to understand the relation of CtdA and B3/B4 domain homologues. For this, we first performed a structural search of available 3D-structures using DALI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Holm, 2022</xref>), which confirmed that CtdA shares close structural similarity with the β-subunit of PheRS enzymes. The result showed that CtdA relates to (in order of similarity) the B3/B4 domains of PheRS from <italic>Pseudomonas aeuriginosa</italic> (PDB entry 4P71; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abibi et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Eschericha coli</italic> (3PCO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mermershtain et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (6P8T; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Baidin et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>Staphylococcus haemolyticus</italic> (2RHQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Evdokimov et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (7DB7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic> (2CXI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Sasaki et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (2IY5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Moor et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> (7BY6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Sharma et al., 2021</xref>), and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (3L4G; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Finarov et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, CtdA shows a modestly closer similarity to the bacterial versus the archeal/eukaryotic B3/B4 domain types.</p><p id="P12">Following, we performed a structural comparison of CtdA with the B3/B4 homologues so-identified. The comparison revealed that CtdA and B3/B4 domains share a common structural core scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>), but that three indels at three different topological positions in the fold determine fold subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). Indels in B3/B4 domains had been previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Sasaki et al., 2006</xref>). By defining a unifying nomenclature for this enzyme class, where secondary structure elements within the shared core fold are numbered sequentially and the prefix IS is used to refer to elements in insertion sequences, we found that the first indel (insertion sequence 1; IS1) occurs between strand β1 and helix α2, the second indel (insertion sequence 2; IS2) between strands β5 and β6, and the third indel (insertion sequence 3; IS3) between strand β7 and helix α3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). CtdA contains a single indel, IS1, while bacterial B3/B4 domains contain IS1 and IS3, and the archeal/eukaryotic type has IS2 (in this type, a short, single helical turn sequence that constitutes an N-terminal extension to helix α2 part of the common fold is found in IS1). In CtdA, IS1 is a 64-residue long sequence (notably longer than that of bacterial B3/B4 domains) that folds into three α-helices (helices α-IS1a, α-IS1b, α-IS1c). These form an L-shaped structure, where helix α-I1Sa lies perpendicular to helices α-IS1b and α-IS1c that form an α-hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). In bacteria B3/B4 domains, IS1 is short and folds into a single α-helix (α-IS1a) that is structurally equivalent to that of CtdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). Remarkably, both indels IS2 in archeal/eukaryotic B3/B4 domains and IS3 in bacterial B3/B4 domains fold into an α-hairpin that, although contributed by different topological parts of the protein chain, localize to the same topographical region of the 3D-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). This locus of the fold is approximately coincident with that occupied by the α-hairpin in indel IS1 in CtdA. Hence, in all cases indels fold against the shared fold scaffold and the same region of the surface topography of these enzymes is sculpted by indels - specifically, this is the surface surrounding the substrate binding site. In CtdA, the indel sequence is rich in positively charged residues and forms the entry to the aminoacyl-binding cavity, predictably playing a role in coordinating the CCA-3’ ribonucleotide moiety of the substrate. In the B3/B4 domain from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic>, IS3 also contains positively charged residues that interact with tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Moor et al., 2006</xref>). However, in B3/B4 domains features indicative of tRNA binding are less prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>), possibly because in the larger PheRS enzymes correct tRNA binding and orientation is dictated by multiple interactions across the fold, so that this role does not critically reside on the B3/B4 domain, which instead might have evolved to optimize its interactions with other domains within the enzyme. Taken together, these findings suggest that indels have directed the evolution of substrate binding in this class of enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Conservation of catalytic features is restricted to asparagine 105 in the oxyanion hole</title><p id="P13">Finally, we asked whether CtdA might share a general catalytic mechanism with B3/B4 domains from PheRS enzymes. To address this question, we performed a structure-based sequence alignment of CtdA and the B3/B4 domains listed above and studied sequence conservation to reveal potentially shared catalysis residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). We found that despite their close fold conservation, CtdA and B3/B4 domains share very low levels of sequence identity (ranging from 11.6% to 6.7%) or similarity (25.6-19.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). There is no discernible conservation of catalytic motifs across all groups, including residue candidates for coordinating the oxyanion and positioning the ribose ester to be cleaved. Thus, it cannot be established whether editing enzymes of this class share the same catalytic mechanism. Interestingly, CtdA is more similar to bacterial B3/B4 domains, with which it shares the strictly conserved residue N105 (CtdA numbering). In the <italic>E. coli</italic> PheRS editing site, this residue -and the preceding threonine rest- was proposed to coordinate the nucleophilic water molecule that attacks the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Ling et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mermershtain et al. 2011</xref>). Our mutagenesis data indicate that residues Y104 and N105 in CtdA are also catalytically important (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>) and the crystal structure shows that these residues, contributed by helix α2 from the shared core fold, likely localize to the proximity of the canavanyl-ribose junction. Thus, it could be speculated that the asparagine residue is part of a shared catalytic mechanism across CtdA and bacterial B3/B4 editing domains. Conserved catalytic features beyond that residue are not observed. In the B3/B4 domain from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic>, residue E334 has been attributed a crucial role in the recognition of the Tyr aminoacyl moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kotik-Kogan et al., 2005</xref>), while in the B3/B4 domain from <italic>E.coli</italic> three residues H265A and E334 have been described to be essential for catalysis as their mutation reduced editing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Ling et al., 2007</xref>). None of these residues, or others considered to be functionally relevant (annotated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>) are conserved in CtdA. They are also largely not conserved across B3/B4 domains of PheRS enzymes from bacterial and archeal/eukaryotic origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). Thus, further studies will be required to conclude on whether this enzyme class shares a catalytic mechanism.</p><p id="P14">The 3D-structures of B3/B4 domains from PheRS proteins were obtained from the PDB entries with entry code indicated in brackets.

Moreover, CtdA is the first trans-editing enzyme identified to act on a non-proteinogenic substrate, the arginine-like canavanine. Its relation to the editing domains of PheRS enzymes, which acts on tyrosyl-/phenyl-rests, is thus unexpected. The elucidation of the crystal structure of CtdA reveals that CdtA and B3/B4 domains from bacterial and archeal/eukaryotic origin constitute three subclasses of a same conserved 3D-fold that differ in the presence of type-specific indels. Even though sequence conservation across the subtypes is very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>), the conserved part of the 3D-fold is remarkably similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>). In all cases, a cavity between domains B3 and B4 (or the corresponding parts in CtdA) forms the binding site for the aminoacyl rest. The entrance to this cavity is shaped by an α-hairpin formation originating from the indel sequences, which although contributed by different parts of the protein chain localize to the same locus in the 3D-fold. In CtdA, this α-hairpin -part of the single, long indel IS1-contains positively charged residues that could contribute to the binding and recognition of the tRNA stem.</p><p id="P16">Despite their structural similarity, no conserved residues across these three subclasses of editing enzymes can be identified that suggest the same catalytic mechanism. For bacterial PheRS and archaeal ThrRS cis-editing domains, the editing mechanism has been proposed to follow substrate-assisted catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Ling et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Hussain et al., 2010</xref>). There, either the 2’OH or the 3’OH of the tRNAs A76 base is involved in the activation of a catalytic water molecule that is positioned within the editing site, which in turn makes a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate. The function of those editing domains, therefore, appears to be the acceleration of the spontaneous hydrolysis of aa-tRNA by several orders of magnitude. In CtdA, a similar mechanism seems possible. <italic>In silico</italic> modelling of canavanine binding into the active site suggests that canavanine can be accommodated in the predicted binding pocket. Mutagenesis of two negatively charged residues at the deep end of the binding cavity (E118 and E191) showed both residues to be required for enzymatic activity. Further, we found residues Y104 and N105, which predictably are in proximity of the canavanyl-ribose junction, to be both also catalytically important. This finding is in agreement with previous reports on the B3/B4 domain of <italic>E. coli</italic> PheRS that proposed the two equivalent residues (T, N) to coordinate the nucleophilic water molecule that attacks the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Ling et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mermershtain et al. 2011</xref>). The strict conservation of the asparagine residue across bacterial B3/B4 domains and CtdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>) supports its importance for editing catalysis and hints at an ancestral relation of CtdA and the bacterial subclass of B3/B4 editing domains, which is supported by the closer sequence and structural relation between these two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). Furthermore, in this study we identify a number of enzymes that share high sequence conservation with CtdA, all being of bacterial origin and pointing to the potential spread of CtdA across bacteria in canavanine-rich habitats. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain co-structures of CtdA in complex with substrates and, thus, we could not clarify the structural basis for the high degree of canavanine/arginine substrate discrimination observed in CtdA. The pKa values of the guanidino groups of canavanine and arginine differ drastically (7.0 vs 13.8, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Boyar et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Fitch et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, in addition to the 5-oxa-substitution, the changed protonation state of the guanidine group in these compounds could also serve CtdA as a means to differentiate between canavanine- and arginine-loaded tRNAs. Future studies will be required to reveal the molecular basis of substrate discrimination and editing activity by CtdA.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>CtdA overexpression and purification</title><p id="P17">CtdA from <italic>Pseudomonas canavaninivorans</italic> (NCBI MBJ2347151.1) was overexpressed and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hauth et al., 2023</xref>).

Within the B3 homology domains, dark gold indicates the long indel sequence (residues 31-95) unique to CtdA; <bold>B</bold>. Surface representation of CtdA coloured according to Coulomb’s electrostatic potential (red: - 10 kcal/mol*e, blue: 10 kcal/mol*e). A central, deep cavity surrounded by positive electrostatic potential is here predicted to constitute the substrate binding site of CtdA; <bold>C</bold>. Close-up of the central cavity predicted to constitute the canavanine binding site of CtdA. Enzyme residues lining the central cavity are shown and annotated. The cavity is represented by its electrostatic surface. A canavanine molecule, docked using AutoDock (Trott et al., 2010), is depicted. All groups are coloured according to atomic composition, where: C, light gray; N, blue; O, red; S, yellow. To ease identification, in canavanine, C atoms are coloured green.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201655-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Site-directed mutagenesis studies of active site candidate residues in CtdA</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Candidate active site residues in CtdA and their location relative to the predicted binding site for the canavanyl-rest (canavanine is shown in green; details as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>).

Comparative overview of CtdA and B3/B4 domains of known structure shown in the same orientation. A selected set of representatives that show conserved features within their respective group is shown here for simplicity. For each structure, a ribbon representation (<italic>upper</italic>), a surface representation coloured according to electrostatic potential (red: -10 kcal/mol*e, blue: 10 kcal/mol*e) (<italic>middle</italic>), and a topology diagram (<italic>bottom</italic>) are shown. Colour-coding throughout is as in B., except for topology diagrams, where to ease comparative visualization the common core is depicted in grey and shown using a constant representation across scaffolds. Secondary structure elements are named according to their structural type and numerical order along the conserved fold or using the prefix IS if they belong to insertion sequences specific to enzyme subclass.
