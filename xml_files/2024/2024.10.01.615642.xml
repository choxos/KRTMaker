To ensure equal chromosome segregation, sister chromatids must achieve biorientation. The conserved kinase Aurora B phosphorylates outer kinetochore proteins on attachments lacking tension, allowing re-establishment of new connections until biorientation is achieved. Aurora B localizes to the centromere as part of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), but the underlying recruitment pathways can be eliminated without disrupting biorientation. It therefore remains unclear how the kinase operates during error correction. Here, we identify the conserved Spc105/Kre28 complex as an outer kinetochore receptor of the Aurora kinase Ipl1 and its activator Sli15 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We show that mutations in the helix bundle domain of Spc105/Kre28 impair mitotic error correction, resembling the effects of <italic>ipl1</italic> or <italic>sli15</italic> mutants. The defects can be suppressed by artificial recruitment of Ipl1. In biochemical experiments Ipl1/Sli15 directly associates with Spc105/Kre28, and a conserved segment in the Sli15 central domain is crucially involved in the binding mechanism. These results have important implications for the mechanism of tension-dependent error correction during chromosome biorientation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chromosome biorientation</kwd><kwd>error correction</kwd><kwd>chromosomal passenger complex</kwd><kwd>KMN network</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis depends on the physical interaction between highly dynamic microtubules of the mitotic spindle and kinetochores which assemble on centromeric DNA of each sister chromatid. Kinetochores are megadalton-sized proteinaceous structures consisting of multiple subcomplexes which fulfill different functions and assemble in a hierarchical manner. The constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) is the main constituent of the inner kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dendooven <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Pesenti <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Yatskevich <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>) which is recruited to centromeres through the interaction of the Mif2<sup>CENP-C</sup> subunit with centromeric nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kato <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Xiao <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). The CCAN consecutively recruits subcomplexes of the outer kinetochore generally termed as KMN network which consists of the Spc105<sup>Knl1</sup>/Kre28<sup>Zwint</sup> complex, Mtw1 complex (Mtw1, Dsn1, Nnf1, Nsl1) and Ndc80 complex (Ndc80, Nuf2, Spc24, Spc25) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Polley <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Yatskevich <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>). In this context, the Mtw1 complex serves as scaffold which connects the other KMN subcomplexes with the inner kinetochore by direct association with Mif2<sup>CENP-C</sup> and Ame1<sup>CENP-U</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dimitrova <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Hornung <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Musacchio &amp; Desai, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Petrovic <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Weir <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). The highly elongated Ndc80 complex is the main microtubule receptor of the kinetochore which binds to the mitotic spindle through the calponin homology (CH) domains at the N-termini of the Ndc80 and Nuf2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Ciferri <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Wei <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Wilson-Kubalek <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). The Ndc80/Nuf2 head also recruits the checkpoint kinase Mps1 to the kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Parnell <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Pleuger <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zahm &amp; Harrison, 2024</xref>). The RWD domains of the Spc24 and Spc25 subunits connect the Ndc80 complex with the Mtw1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dimitrova <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Malvezzi <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Petrovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the Mtw1 complex recruits Spc105<sup>Knl1</sup>/Kre28<sup>Zwint</sup> to the kinetochore, even though the molecular mechanisms differ between mammals and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ghodgaonkar-Steger <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Petrovic <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Roy <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). It has been well established that Spc105<sup>Knl1</sup> plays a crucial role as a signaling platform for the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) after phosphorylation of MELT repeats by the conserved kinase Mps1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">London <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Shepperd <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Yamagishi <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, Spc105<sup>Knl1</sup> is required for recruitment of different protein phosphatases which are involved in SAC silencing and modulation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Meadows <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Nijenhuis <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Rosenberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). In contrast, relatively little is known about Kre28<sup>Zwint</sup> (also referred to as YDR532C according to its systematic name). Kre28 was identified as budding yeast homolog of the metazoan protein Zwint (Zeste White interacting protein) due its sequence similarity and, similar to Zwint, Kre28 forms a complex with Spc105<sup>Knl1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Pagliuca <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). In contrast to mammalian cells, where the tandem RWD domains of Knl1 directly associate with the Mtw1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Petrovic <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Kre28 itself binds to the Mtw1 complex and by this recruits Spc105<sup>Knl1</sup> to the kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ghodgaonkar-Steger <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Roy <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Both, the interaction with Spc105<sup>Knl1</sup> and with the Mtw1 complex is mediated by coiled-coil elements in the central region of Kre28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ghodgaonkar-Steger <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Roy <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, the C-terminus of Kre28 (residues 299-386) forms an RWD domain whose function is unknown so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Tromer <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Kre28 is essential for viability of yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Pagliuca <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). However, it is unclear whether this is just a consequence of loss of Spc105<sup>Knl1</sup> from kinetochores or whether Kre28<sup>Zwint</sup> has additional essential functions. For instance, it was proposed that Spc105<sup>Knl1</sup>/Kre28<sup>Zwint</sup> might be required for kinetochore localization of different microtubule-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Pagliuca <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The conserved protein kinase Ipl1<sup>Aurora B</sup> is an essential part of the error correction machinery which phosphorylates outer kinetochore substrates in order to release kinetochore-microtubule attachments that lack tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Tanaka &amp; Zhang, 2022</xref>). Ipl1<sup>Aurora B</sup> acts in a complex with Sli15<sup>INCENP</sup>, Bir1<sup>Survivin</sup> and Nbl1<sup>Borealin</sup>, together termed as chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). The N-terminal CEN box of Sli15<sup>INCENP</sup> associates with Bir1<sup>Survivin</sup> and Nbl1<sup>Borealin</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jeyaprakash <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) whereas its C-terminal IN box binds to the kinase domain of Ipl1<sup>Aurora B</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Sessa <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). The CPC is targeted to the inner and kinetochore-proximal centromere by different mechanisms which depend on the haspin kinase, the Bub1 kinase and Sgo1/Sgo2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hindriksen <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). However, different studies have demonstrated that inner and kinetochore-proximal centromere localization of Ipl1<sup>Aurora B</sup> is dispensable for establishment of biorientation. For instance, an N-terminal deletion of Sli15, preventing inner centromere recruitment of the CPC through Bir1, still supports the formation of bioriented attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Campbell &amp; Desai, 2013</xref>), suggesting that additional mechanisms can target the CPC to the kinetochore. Indeed, two recent studies identified the inner kinetochore COMA complex as a Bir1-independent Ipl1/Sli15 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Fischbock-Halwachs <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">García-Rodríguez <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Furthermore, studies in human cells have also suggested the existence of an additional pool of Aurora B at the kinetochore, which might be relevant for the phosphorylation of outer kinetochore proteins such as components of the KMN network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Broad <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hadders <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In this study, we provide a detailed molecular analysis of the KMN subunit Kre28<sup>Zwint</sup>. We identified a conserved Zwint helix in Kre28 whose lack leads to fatal chromosome segregation defects when cells are forced to reform their spindle apparatus after nocodazole washout. Artificial recruitment of Ipl1 to the outer kinetochore is sufficient to suppress this phenotype. Using protein biochemistry, we demonstrate that Spc105<sup>Knl1</sup>/Kre28<sup>Zwint</sup> can directly recruit Ipl1<sup>Aurora B</sup>/Sli15<sup>INCENP</sup> <italic>in vitro</italic> and that a conserved segment of the Sli15 central domain is involved in the binding mechanism. Thus, we have identified Spc105/Kre28 as the elusive outer kinetochore receptor of Ipl1.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Characterization of novel mutant alleles in the outer kinetochore subunit Kre28<sup>Zwint</sup></title><p id="P5">To gain insight into the organization of Spc105/Kre28 we performed AF2 structure predictions using the C-terminal part of Spc105 (omitting the disordered residues 1-489) and full-length Kre28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The model shows that the Spc105/Kre28 heterodimer is formed via two interfaces: At the C-terminus of Kre28 a single RWD domain (residues 299-385) is paired with the N-RWD domain of Spc105. Together with short alpha-helical segments just preceding these RWD domains, this part resembles heterodimeric RWD domain arrangements found in other kinetochore subunits like Spc24/Spc25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Schmitzberger &amp; Harrison, 2012</xref>). The N-terminal parts, on the other hand, engage into a helical bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This is in agreement with previous studies that have established that Kre28 associates with Spc105 mainly via coiled-coil segments formed by residues 127-201 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Roy <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), while another segment (229-259) is required for binding to the Mtw1 complex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ghodgaonkar-Steger <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Deletion of these segments is incompatible with KMN assembly and yields lethal phenotypes in yeast. Interestingly, multiple sequence alignments show that an alpha-helical segment preceding the first Kre28 coiled-coil domain (residues 77-113, hereafter referred to as the Zwint helix) is among the most conserved segments of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). By contrast, the C-terminus is not well conserved and human Zwint, for example, lacks an RWD domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Tromer <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To analyze the contribution of Zwint helix and RWD domain to Kre28 function in cells, we replaced the endogenous <italic>KRE28</italic> gene with Flag-tagged wildtype or mutant alleles in diploid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Interestingly, serial dilution assays of the haploid strains revealed that <italic>kre28</italic><sup><italic>ΔZwint</italic></sup> mutants fully supported growth at 30 °C, but were inviable in the presence of the microtubule-depolymerizing drug benomyl and additionally displayed cold sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). By contrast the deletion of the C-terminal RWD domain of Kre28 did not cause a growth phenotype. We found that not only the complete removal of the Zwint helix, but also selected smaller deletions or point mutations of conserved residues caused benomyl hypersensitivity. The most pronounced phenotypes were obtained for truncations eliminating the c-terminal part of the helix spanning residues 103-113, as well as for point mutations in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure EV1 A-D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The <italic>kre28</italic><sup><italic>ΔZwint</italic></sup> mutant is defective in mitotic error correction of kinetochore-microtubule attachments</title><p id="P7">The pronounced benomyl hypersensitivity of the <italic>kre28</italic><sup><italic>ΔZwint</italic></sup> mutant may be caused by a defect in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) or a different problem with chromosome segregation.

The <italic>kre28</italic><sup><italic>ΔZwint</italic></sup> allele described in this study can be used to reveal additional aspects of Spc105/Kre28 function. We show that one of its effects is a selective reduction of Spc105/Kre28 at the kinetochore without affecting the levels of Ndc80 and Mtw1 complexes. It is therefore much more selective than more penetrant perturbations. For example, a depletion or reduction of human Knl1 by RNAi strongly affects the levels of additional outer kinetochore components such as Ndc80/Hec1 as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Caldas <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Desai <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), making it difficult to delineate a specific function. We note that the observed Spc105/Kre28 reduction in metaphase cells is moderate and does not lead to impaired spindle assembly checkpoint activity, as the mutant cells are fully capable of arresting in nocodazole. In addition, they show normal levels of Sgo1 recruitment to the kinetochore in prometaphase, suggesting sufficient Bub1 activity at the kinetochore. We currently cannot provide a precise molecular explanation for why the mutations in the Kre28 helical bundle may reduce the affinity of Spc105/Kre28 for Ndc80c/Mtw1c, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Even though AlphaFold2 models predict multiple possible conformations of KMN, they do not show a binding interface within KMN that would include the Kre28 Zwint helix.

KMN containing either Kre28<sup>WT</sup> or Kre28<sup>ΔZwint</sup> was purified from Sf9 insect cells and immobilized on M2 anti-Flag beads. Recombinant Ipl1/Sli15 was added to test for its binding to KMN. Proteins were eluted from beads by addition of 3xFlag peptide. Input and pull down samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining or western blot to detect 6xHis-tagged Sli15.</p><p>D: Pull down assay to test for binding of Ipl1/Sli15 to Spc105/Kre28 or Mtw1c/Ndc80c. Either Spc105/Kre28 or Mtw1c in combination with Ndc80c were purified from Sf9 insect cells and immobilized on M2 anti-Flag beads. Recombinant Ipl1/Sli15 was added to test for its binding to the immobilized proteins. Proteins bound to the beads were finally eluted with 3xFlag peptide and input and pull down samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining or western blot to detect 6xHis-tagged Sli15.

Spc105/Kre28 was purified from Sf9 insect cells and immobilized on M2 anti-Flag beads. Prior to addition to the loaded beads, recombinant Ipl1/Sli15 was <italic>in vitro</italic> autophosphorylated (+ATP), dephosphorylated by λ phosphatase or left untreated. After incubation with the immobilized Spc105/Kre28, bound proteins were eluted from the beads using 3xFlag peptide and input and pull down samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining or western blot to detect 6xHis-Sli15. The mobility of Ipl1 and Sli15 during SDS-PAGE depends on their phosphorylation status. LC and HC mark the light and heavy chains of the M2 anti-Flag antibody. Asterisk denotes potential proteolysis product of full-length Spc105.</p><p>F: <italic>In vivo</italic> proximity-biotinylation experiment using Spc105-TurboID and different Flag-tagged potential interactors. Yeast lysates were prepared from the indicated strains and subjected to a Streptavidin affinity purification to isolate biotinylated proteins. Note that Kre28 and Sli15 are only detected in pull downs from strains that also express Spc105-TurboID. The major endogenously biotinylated proteins Acc1, Pyc1/2 or Arc1 enriched in in the Streptavidin pull down are indicated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199187-f005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry analysis of the KMN-Ipl1/Sli15 assembly</title><p>A: Schematic illustration of Sli15 and Ipl1.
