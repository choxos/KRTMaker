We previously showed that LCFA degradation impedes oxidative protein folding in the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> envelope, an issue that arises due to the insufficiency of ubiquinone, a lipid-soluble electron carrier in the electron transport chain (ETC). To maintain redox homeostasis, <italic>E. coli</italic> activates the CpxAR two-component system; however, the nature of feedback imparted by this envelope stress response (ESR) remained unknown. Here, we show that contrary to the well-recognized remedial mode of Cpx restoring envelope integrity by upregulating protein quality control factors, in LCFA-grown cells, it uses a preventive measure to maintain homeostasis. Cpx increases ubiquinone availability for oxidative protein folding by suppressing LCFA metabolism and directly increasing ubiquinone levels. Further, rather than using its conventional mode of imparting regulation via CpxR working as a transcriptional regulator, during LCFA metabolism, Cpx mainly uses its non-coding arm to counteract envelope redox stress. The Cpx-regulated small RNA CpxQ represses <italic>fad</italic> genes involved in LCFA transport and β-oxidation, downregulates components of glyoxylate shunt, gluconeogenesis, and ETC, and increases ubiquinone content. Corroborating with its role in repressing LCFA metabolism and maintaining redox homeostasis, CpxQ overexpression impairs growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> in LCFAs and CpxQ deletion renders LCFA-grown <italic>E. coli</italic> hypersensitive to a thiol agent. Our foremost work studying the interconnection between LCFA metabolism, redox stress, and ESR in <italic>E. coli</italic> provides a rationale for investigating similar networks in other LCFA-utilizing bacteria.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>β-oxidation</kwd><kwd>Cpx</kwd><kwd>CpxQ</kwd><kwd>disulfide bond formation</kwd><kwd>ubiquinone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Classification</title><kwd>Major-Biological Sciences</kwd><kwd>Minor-Microbiology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) are carboxylic acids with a linear aliphatic chain of 12–20 carbon atoms. As energy-rich nutrients, the role of LCFAs in supporting bacterial survival and infectivity is well-exemplified by the upregulation of LCFA degradation pathway in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium, and <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> during infection and the reduced virulence of their mutants defective in LCFA utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Most of our knowledge of the LCFA catabolic pathway is derived from studies in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Briefly, the Fad (fatty <underline>a</underline>cid <underline>d</underline>egradation) proteins transport and activate exogenous LCFAs to acyl<sub>(n)</sub>-CoA, and via β-oxidation degrade them to acetyl-CoA, which then enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and glyoxylate cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). During aerobic metabolism, reduced cofactors produced in the β-oxidation and TCA cycle are oxidized in the electron transport chain (ETC) by respiratory dehydrogenases, and the electrons are transferred to ubiquinone, a lipid-soluble electron carrier. The reduced form of ubiquinone, ubiquinol, in turn, donates electrons to molecular oxygen via terminal oxidases. During electron transfer through ETC, proton motive force is generated, which is then used by ATP synthase to drive ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Because LCFAs are non-fermentable carbon sources, TCA and glyoxylate cycles, and gluconeogenesis are critical for the generation of metabolite precursors for growth, and a functional ETC is crucial for energy generation by oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, LCFA metabolism is largely known to be regulated at a transcriptional level. The direct transcriptional regulation on aerobic <italic>fad</italic> genes is mainly via the three systems: (i) repression by FadR, relieved by binding of acyl<sub>(n)</sub>-CoA, (ii) repression by ArcBA two-component system under anaerobic conditions, and (iii) activation by the cyclic AMP-cyclic AMP receptor protein (cAMP-CRP) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Besides <italic>fad</italic> genes, ArcBA and cAMP-CRP also directly regulate several components of TCA and glyoxylate cycles, gluconeogenesis, and ETC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Contrary to the transcriptional control, relatively little is known about the post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>fad</italic> genes by small RNAs (sRNAs). Amongst Fad components, only FadL, the outer membrane transporter of LCFAs, and FadE, the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase of β-oxidation are known to be regulated by sRNAs. FadL is repressed by RybB, whereas FadE is activated by DsrA and ArcZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). The sRNAs, FnrS, GcvB, GlnZ, RybB, RyhB, SgrS, and Spf regulate a few components of the TCA cycle, gluconeogenesis, and ETC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Although LCFA metabolism has been studied in great detail in <italic>E. coli</italic> since the 1960s, its interconnection with other cellular processes remained largely unknown. We recently uncovered a novel link between LCFA metabolism and the redox state of the envelope, a multilayered compartment surrounding the cytoplasm, which protects the cell from environmental stresses and is the site for myriad functions critical for growth and viability. Briefly, a comparative analysis of our dataset obtained from a high-throughput genetic screen of the <italic>E. coli</italic> gene deletion library on oleate (C18:1 cis-9 LCFA) with similar datasets available for other non-fermentable carbon sources revealed a maximal requirement of ubiquinone for growth in LCFAs. We showed that the increased requirement of ubiquinone in LCFAs is to rapidly transfer a large number of electrons derived from its metabolism and thus decrease the formation of reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Besides shuttling electrons derived from metabolism, ubiquinone plays a pivotal role in re-oxidizing the disulfide bond (DSB)-forming machinery (DsbA-DsbB), which forms DSBs in secreted proteins in the oxidizing environment of the periplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). We showed that in LCFA-utilizing cells, there is a gradual increase in load on the DSB-forming machinery with increasing cell density, with a maximal load at entry into the stationary phase. Importantly, the hallmarks of inadequate DSB formation are prevented in cells exogenously provided with ubiquinone. Taken together, our work suggested that an increased electron flow in the ETC during LCFA metabolism titrates ubiquinone, limiting its availability for DSB formation, thereby compromising envelope redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In <italic>E. coli</italic>, ~300 secreted proteins are predicted to have DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Several of these involved in diverse biological processes are reported to depend on DsbA-DsbB for correct folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Therefore, to ensure cellular integrity, bacteria must monitor the envelope redox status and elicit an appropriate response when disturbances occur. Amongst the five committed envelope stress response (ESR) systems in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which sense problems in the envelope and reprogram transcription to counteract stress, we identified the CpxAR two-component system as the major ESR activated by LCFAs in the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). When cells encounter envelope stress, the inner-membrane sensor kinase CpxA, auto-phosphorylates and then phosphorylates the cytoplasmic response regulator CpxR, which, in turn, directs the transcription of its target genes involved in mitigating stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). A well-documented mechanism by which Cpx restores envelope homeostasis is by upregulating envelope-localized protein folding and degrading factors that manage damaged proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Because compromised DSB formation in LCFA-grown cells will result in the accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins, Cpx might restore envelope homeostasis by repairing/clearing out these proteins. However, our previous observation that ubiquinone accumulates in LCFA-utilizing cells in a CpxR-dependent manner suggested that an effective mechanism for restoring envelope redox homeostasis would be to facilitate DSB formation by increasing the oxidizing power of the ETC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Besides directly upregulating ubiquinone, it is plausible that Cpx also increases ubiquinone availability for DSB formation by downregulating components of the LCFA metabolic pathway that feed electrons into the ETC, an aspect that has not been examined.</p><p id="P6">Here, we investigated the global regulation mediated by Cpx during LCFA metabolism by performing RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) of wild-type (WT) <italic>E. coli</italic> and its isogenic Δ<italic>cpxR</italic> strain grown in LCFAs. We found that CpxR downregulates several processes critical for the generation of reduced cofactors, metabolites, and energy during LCFA metabolism, and uses CpxQ sRNA to mediate its effect-CpxQ downregulates various <italic>fad</italic> genes involved in β-oxidation likely by increasing the pool of apo-FadR (not bound to acyl<sub>(n)</sub>-CoA), a consequence of CpxQ-mediated repression of the outer-membrane LCFA transporter, FadL, and also downregulates few components of the glyoxylate shunt, gluconeogenesis, and ETC. We further probed the regulation of ubiquinone by Cpx in LCFA-grown cells, and here again, observed that CpxR increases ubiquinone levels post-transcriptionally via sRNAs-CpxQ stabilizes OmrA in LCFA-grown cells and both sRNAs are required for ubiquinone accumulation. Corroborating with its role as a repressor of LCFA metabolism, CpxQ overexpression prevented growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> in LCFAs, and supporting its role in maintaining redox homeostasis, CpxQ deletion rendered LCFA-grown <italic>E. coli</italic> hypersensitive to a thiol agent. Collectively, our work identified CpxR as a global regulator that manages envelope redox stress in LCFA-grown cells by downregulating LCFA metabolism and increasing ubiquinone content mainly via the sRNA CpxQ.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Transcriptomics reveals Cpx as a global regulator of LCFA metabolism</title><p id="P7">To enable a holistic view of Cpx regulation during LCFA metabolism, we performed RNA-Seq for <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 (henceforth referred to as WT) and its isogenic Δ<italic>cpxR</italic> strains cultured in buffered tryptone broth (TBK) supplemented with either oleate (TBK-Ole) or with detergent Brij-58 used for solubilizing oleate (TBK-Brij) in the stationary phase. Because we previously showed that the Cpx pathway is activated in LCFA-grown <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 in the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), here, using a chromosomal <italic>cpxP</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> transcriptional reporter (<italic>cpxP</italic> is a <italic>bona fide</italic> Cpx regulon member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>)), we first validated Cpx activation in the stationary phase in LCFA-grown <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 as well. Whereas the expression of <italic>cpxP</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> was similar in cells grown in TBK-Brij and TBK-Ole in the exponential phase (time point T1), there was a ~4-fold increase in <italic>cpxP</italic> expression in TBK-Ole compared to TBK-Brij in the stationary phase (time point T2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs S2A and B</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Using reads obtained from RNA-Seq, we performed differential expression analysis, followed by gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify pathways that are enriched in TBK-Ole compared to TBK-Brij and that are regulated by CpxR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary datasets S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figs S3 and S4</xref>). Before probing deeper into these datasets, we validated the robustness of our RNA-Seq and our statistical approach. Notably, GSEA for WT cultured in TBK-Brij and TBK-Ole highlighted enrichment of LCFA transport and β-oxidation (FDR q value: 0%), critical for the utilization of LCFAs as an energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Additionally, TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt (FDR q value &lt;0.4%), gluconeogenesis (FDR q value: 7.7%) and multiple pathways for electron transfer activity (FDR q value &lt;6%), pathways critical for the generation of reduced cofactors, metabolites, and energy during LCFA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), were also significantly enriched. In differential expression analysis, the components of the above pathways were mainly upregulated in TBK-Ole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary datasets S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">A comparison of GSEA datasets of WT and Δ<italic>cpxR</italic> in TBK-Ole highlighted CpxR-dependent enrichment of almost all pathways involved in LCFA metabolism; LCFA transport and β-oxidation (FDR q value: 0.2%), TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt (FDR q value &lt;4%), gluconeogenesis (FDR q value: 0.2%), multiple pathways for electron transfer activity (FDR q value &lt;3%), and ATP biosynthesis (FDR q value: 0%). In particular, in differential expression analysis, components of these pathways were mainly negatively regulated by CpxR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary datasets S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S1</xref>). These data suggested CpxR as a global repressor of LCFA metabolism and encouraged us to gain further insights into its regulation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cpx downregulates <italic>fad</italic> genes involved in LCFA transport and β-oxidation</title><p id="P10">Cpx was shown to modulate the TCA cycle and ETC in <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 and enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (EPEC), and to directly repress the <italic>nuo</italic> and <italic>cyo</italic> operons in EPEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>); however, its effects during growth in LCFAs were unknown. We, therefore, performed an in-depth investigation of Cpx-mediated regulation of <italic>fad</italic> genes, specific to LCFA utilization. Using a chromosomal transcriptional reporter where <italic>lacZ</italic> was fused downstream of the ~1000 bp <italic>cis</italic>-acting element of <italic>fadE</italic> (<italic>fadE</italic><sub>1000</sub>-<italic>lacZ</italic>), we previously showed that FadE is induced in LCFA-grown cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).

Except for <italic>fadB</italic> and <italic>fadA</italic>, which are part of an operon, all other <italic>fad</italic> genes are scattered on the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), raising the possibility that CpxR modulates <italic>fad</italic> genes via a common regulator. A likely candidate is FadR, the LCFA-specific direct transcriptional repressor of <italic>fad</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>); CpxR might transcriptionally induce <italic>fadR</italic> increasing FadR protein levels such that acyl<sub>(n)</sub>-CoA becomes limiting to relieve its repression on <italic>fad</italic> genes. Although in the RNA-Seq data, we observed a ~1.4-fold increase in <italic>fadR</italic> expression in TBK-Ole, compared to TBK-Brij, this increase was CpxR-independent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary dataset S1</xref>).

These data suggested that either (i) CpxR regulates a transcriptional regulator other than FadR that must regulate <italic>fad</italic> genes or (ii) CpxR mediates post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>fad</italic> genes.</p><p id="P12">CpxR is known to regulate at least five sRNAs either directly (CyaR, CpxQ, and RprA) or indirectly (OmrA and OmrB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>); any of these might have a role in Cpx-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>fad</italic> genes. We first investigated which of the five CpxR-regulated sRNAs are induced in LCFA-grown cells. Transcriptional reporter assays with chromosomal <italic>lacZ</italic> fusions of the <italic>cis</italic>-acting element of each sRNA as well as qRT-PCR revealed that all five sRNAs are induced in TBK-Ole-grown cells (~2 to 6-fold) specifically in the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S6A-C</xref>). However, only the transcriptional induction of CpxQ was completely CpxR-dependent; whereas fold-induction of CyaR, OmrA, and OmrB in TBK-Ole compared to TBK-Brij was similar in WT and Δ<italic>cpxR</italic> strains, and RprA expression was reduced to the same extent in TBK-Brij and TBK-Ole upon <italic>cpxR</italic> deletion indicating that a regulator other than CpxR induces RprA in TBK-Ole, CpxQ expression was completely abolished in a Δ<italic>cpxR</italic> strain in both TBK-Brij and TBK-Ole (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Fig S6D</xref>).

Our proposal is strengthened by the observation that the regulation of <italic>fad</italic> genes by CpxR/CpxQ is via FadR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3A and B</xref>). The control of FadR activity via CpxR/CpxQ-mediated repression of FadL likely enables FadR to simultaneously integrate information of LCFA availability and envelope stress caused by its utilization.

Further, the transcriptome of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> cultured in LCFAs showed increased expression of genes related to reductive stress as well as high expression from the intergenic regions, suggesting a link between redox stress and sRNA-mediated control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). It would be exciting to investigate whether sRNAs play a role in governing envelope redox balance during LCFA metabolism in these pathogens. The incorporation of sRNAs as an integral part of the LCFA-induced ESRs would provide a fast response to the stimulus and quick recovery after the removal of the stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Strains, plasmids, and primers</title><p id="P28">The strains and plasmids, and primers used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Tables S3 and S4</xref>, respectively. <italic>E. coli</italic> BW25113 was used as the WT strain for various assays.

position="float"><caption><title>Significance Statement</title></caption><p>Long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) are energy-rich nutrients for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>; however, their utilization hampers disulfide bond (DSB) formation in secreted proteins, an essential process that occurs in the envelope compartment. Here, we show that an envelope stress response manipulates LCFA metabolism in <italic>E. coli</italic> and uses a small RNA (sRNA) to restore homeostasis. Several bacteria with a huge impact on human health use host-derived LCFAs during infection. Because many virulence factors require DSB formation, the present study offers a basis to examine whether sRNAs play a role in governing envelope redox balance during LCFA metabolism in pathogens. The sRNA-mediated control is likely an ideal strategy both for rapid response to and quick recovery from LCFA-induced stress.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CpxR downregulates LCFA metabolism in the stationary phase.</title><p><italic>A)</italic> Heatmap for comparison of gene expression in four different samples WT_TBK-Brij, Δ<italic>cpxR</italic>_TBK-Brij, WT_TBK-Ole, and Δ<italic>cpxR</italic>_TBK-Ole, for various LCFA-related pathways enriched in GSEA, using normalized values provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S1</xref>.
