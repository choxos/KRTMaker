Among the immune cell populations, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exhibited the highest ChAdOx1 transduction levels. pDC-derived IFN-α was critical for humoral responses, but production of antigen in pDCs was dispensable. Furthermore, IL-6 enhanced humoral responses in both IFN-α-dependent and independent manners, indicating intricate signaling interplay. IFN-α and IL-6 also regulated the function of vaccine-activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, including T<sub>FH</sub>.

Several adenovirus vector vaccines were introduced against SARS-CoV-2, with effectiveness in inducing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and protecting from COVID-19 disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Voysey <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Halperin <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Sadoff <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). However, despite the successful deployment of this vaccine, mechanistic understanding of the factors governing the humoral responses to adenovirus vector vaccines is still lacking, with most studies focused on using the technology to induce cellular immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Provine and Klenerman, 2022</xref>). Thus, there is a major gap in our understanding of this vaccine platform.</p><p id="P5">Beyond a few select studies, little is known about the regulation of humoral immunity to the transgene antigen cargo of adenoviral vector vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Provine and Klenerman, 2022</xref>). Protection against COVID-19 is associated with the production of IgG antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2, which requires the development of antigen-specific plasma cells and memory B cells from germinal centers in lymph nodes. In the germinal center (GC) reaction, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and particularly follicular helper T cells (T<sub>FH</sub>) play an important role in providing costimulatory signaling to B cells. The induction of antibodies towards the transgene of Ad vaccines is known to be primarily driven by GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Foster <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), requiring CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Provine <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) and specifically T<sub>FH</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Foster <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P6">However, less is known about the innate signals that initiate the GC responses to adenoviral vaccines. Innate immune responses can modulate the GC response and outcomes, with innate immune phenotypes being associated with adaptive immune response outcomes to other vaccine platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Fourati <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hagan <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). For adenoviral vaccines, TLR4 signaling has been shown to promote antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). One study has found that induction of antibodies against the adenovirus viral particle itself is dependent on type I interferon, which regulated multiple steps of B cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Zhu, Huang and Yang, 2007</xref>). However, it is unclear if similar signals regulate the immune response to the transgene antigen. A recent study in NHPs found a correlation between type I IFN levels and antibody titers against a SARS-CoV-2 spike transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">He <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), suggesting an association. Direct experimental validation is required, and more generally, a broad survey of critical innate immune pathways is needed to unravel the biology of these vaccines.</p><p id="P7">To investigate the role of these innate-adaptive immune cell interactions in modulating humoral responses, it is critical to model these processes occurring at the site of vaccine responses – secondary lymphoid tissues. A recently described in vitro human lymphoid tissue organoid model utilizing tonsil tissue has shown utility for investigating the regulation of human B cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Wagar <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kastenschmidt <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Yin <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Mitul <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Providing a model for studying both antibody and cellular biology in an antigen-specific manner, the system has been used quite heavily to study vaccine responses to influenza A virus vaccines. The manipulability of the model has allowed description of the role for specific cell types in live-attenuated influenza virus vaccine responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Wagar <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), and differential roles for memory or naive B cell populations based on live-attenuated or inactivated vaccine formulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kastenschmidt <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). It has been demonstrated that adenoviral vector induced antibody responses can be measured, but no specific investigation of the regulation of these responses was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Wagar <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Thus, this organoid model has promise for unravelling pathways regulating adenoviral vector induced humoral responses.</p><p id="P8">We utilized this human in vitro tonsil organoid model to investigate the processes that regulate the induction of T cell, B cell and antibody responses to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. The tonsil organoid system demonstrated cellular, humoral and innate responses to adenovirus vaccines, presenting a viable model for mechanistic studies. We discovered that plasmacytoid dendritic cells modulate the humoral response to adenovirus vector vaccines, mainly through secretion of type 1 IFN. Type 1 IFN augments antibody production through modulating both innate and adaptive responses, both directly and indirectly through IL-6 induction. These two cytokines also worked in concert to regulate the phenotype and function of vaccine-activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Adenovirus vector vaccines induce humoral responses in tonsil organoid cultures</title><p id="P9">Our first aim was to validate that the tonsil organoid culture system could robustly model humoral responses to adenovirus vector vaccines. To achieve this, we stimulated tonsil organoid cultures with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 over 14 days of culture (experimental schematic in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). Viability and cell recovery remained consistent over the culture period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To validate that the system could induce specific antibody production in response to vaccine stimulation, anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG was measured in the culture supernatants. Anti-S1 IgG production was very low (&lt;10 ng/mL) or undetectable in unstimulated cultures from 18/22 post-pandemic donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Peculiarly, in the post-pandemic donors that produced anti-S1 IgG when unstimulated, ChAdOx1 stimulation suppressed specific antibody production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). Given their unsuitability for addressing the research question, these samples were excluded from subsequent analyses. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 stimulation induced robust S1-specific antibody responses in the majority of post-pandemic donors (n=13/16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Stimulation of tonsils collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (“pre-pandemic”) did not induce S1-specific IgG production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). To test for non-specific IgG induction by the ChAdOx1 vector, ChAdOx1 GFP was used as a control. ChAdOx1 GFP did not induce anti-S1 IgG production in any of the 4 post- and 2 pre-pandemic donors tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We hypothesized that the lack of S1-specific antibodies in pre-pandemic donors might reflect insufficient time in the culture for class-switching to occur. Thus, we examined IgM production as an earlier product of naive B cell activation. In contrast to IgG production, anti-S1 IgM was produced in both post- and pre-pandemic donors in a variable manner across two experiment batches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The high variability between technical replicates suggests that specific IgM production in the model is stochastic, possibly depending on the presence in the culture well of S1-specific naïve B cells, which are present at low frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Feldman <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P12">After validating antibody production upon stimulation, we measured B cell activation using flow cytometry. We compared B cell subsets based on IgD and CD38 expression as naïve and activation markers, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sanz <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 decreased the percentage of IgD<sup>+</sup> B cells and increased CD38 expression on B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Overall, the most striking change was an increase in IgD-CD38<sup>++</sup> B cells, a population commonly identified as antibody secreting cells (ASCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sanz <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), which encompasses both plasmablasts and plasma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D-E</xref>). This population had higher CD27 expression compared to other subsets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>), in line with previous observations for ASCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Sanz <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). A similar increase in IgD-CD38<sup>++</sup> B cells was observed for ChAdOx1 GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>), but did not induce S1-specific antibody production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Next, we identified antigen-specific B cells using fluorescently-labelled S1 tetramers. Post-pandemic donors showed a clear population of S1-specific B cells, while pre-pandemic donors did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F-G</xref>). In post-pandemic donors, the S1-specific B cells were mainly composed of switched memory (IgD-IgM-) B cells compared to the bulk B cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). The percentage of S1-specific B cells decreased with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F</xref>), possibly due to activated cells downregulating their B cell receptors (BCR) as they differentiate into ASCs. However, S1-specific cells were detectable, and were highly activated in response to stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I-J</xref>). These findings suggest that S1-specific IgG production, but not IgM production, in response to stimulation is associated with detectable S1-specific memory B cells. Most importantly, the combination of these data gave us high confidence in the utility of the model for probing pathways regulating ChAdOx1-induced humoral immunity.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) contribute to the early response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 through antigen expression and cytokine secretion</title><p id="P14">Next, we investigated the early innate response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in the tonsil organoid model after 24 hours in culture. As S1-specific IgG production was only consistently induced in organoids from post-pandemic donors, only these donors were used for mechanistic studies. We focused on identifying the cells that are transduced and activated by ChAdOx1. To identify cells transduced by the vector, we measured cells expressing either the S1 spike peptide (for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) or GFP (ChAdOx1 GFP) by flow cytometry. No significant changes in the tonsil cell compositions were observed with freeze-thawing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). Following exposure, all cells showed an increase in transgene-expressing cells, with varying frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>). The highest transduction rates were seen for dendritic cells (DCs), especially plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The number of pDCs decreased with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 stimulation, likely due to death following transduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). Both ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and ChAdOx1 GFP demonstrated similar patterns of transduction, with higher detection rates for GFP, likely due to ease of detecting GFP expression. Monocytes were highly transduced (66-100%) but were not included in subsequent analyses as their scarcity in tonsil made quantification unreliable (0-5 cells/well). Conventional DCs (cDCs) and CD45<sup>-</sup>cells (presumably fibroblasts) were also transduced with some efficiency (mean % positive for each group). This pattern of transduction is highly consistent with what has been reported in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Provine <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Despite having the highest transduction efficiency, pDCs only contributed a small fraction of total transduced cells (6.5%), due to the relatively small size of the pDC population in the culture (~1% of all cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). By contrast, B cells were the main contributor of transduced cells despite very low transduction rates due to the high frequency of B cells in the culture system (~65% of all cells).</p><p id="P16">We next evaluated immune activation through the expression of PD-L1 and CD80. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 stimulation upregulated PD-L1 expression on all cell populations, while CD80 was only induced on pDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-D</xref>). Other than pDCs, most immune cell types had much higher PD-L1 expression rates than their transduction rates, suggesting indirect activation of non-transduced cells, likely through cytokines.</p><p id="P17">We measured ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induced cytokine secretion at 24 hours. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induced production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-α, TNF, IFN-γ, and IL-6, with the greatest induction of IFN-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). The induced cytokines are consistent with previous studies on patient samples and PBMC stimulation using ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>pDCs modulate the humoral response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, primarily through type 1 IFN</title><p id="P18">Given the high transduction and activation of pDCs as well as the IFN-α induced, we hypothesized that pDCs were an important early immune modulator of response to adenovirus vector vaccines. Thus, we performed the organoid culture with pDC depletion (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">methods</xref>). The depletion process removed 98.6-99.9% of pDCs, while the percentage of other cells remained stable except for a slight increase of CD45<sup>-</sup>cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>).</p><p id="P19">pDC-depletion dramatically impaired S1-specific IgG induction in all responsive donors, confirming the modulatory function of pDCs on antibody production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In accordance with the decreased antibody production, both bulk and S1-specific B cell activation was also dampened by pDC-depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-C</xref>). pDC-depletion did not significantly affect the overall antigen availability as shown by the total frequency of transduced cells in the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) nor did it alter transduction rates for other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, early activation of other immune cells (cDCs, B cells, T cells), as assessed by PD-L1 expression, decreased with pDC-depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). There was minimal impact on CD80 expression, as no cells showed clear induction of CD80 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). As expected, pDC-depletion dramatically reduced levels of IFN-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). However, it also resulted in a reduction of the other induced pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IFN-γ, and IL-6. These results demonstrate that pDCs are critical modulators of the humoral responses to adenovirus vectors.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>IFN-α is the main mediator of pDC-mediated modulation of the humoral response</title><p id="P20">To investigate whether the effect of pDCs on the humoral response was mediated by type 1 IFN, as a source of antigen, or both, we investigated the effect of blocking type 1 IFN on the culture. Type 1 IFN blockade was sufficient to phenocopy pDC-depletion, significantly reducing S1-specific IgG secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) and bulk B cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and S1-specific B cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) in all donors.</p><p id="P21">With regards to innate responses, blocking type 1 IFN increased the overall number of transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). The increase appears to be mediated by a particular increase in pDC transduction rates and a modest increase for B cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A</xref>). Interestingly, despite increased transduction rates, PD-L1 expression on most cell types decreased with type 1 IFN blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). This suggests that upregulation of surface PD-L1 expression is mediated by autocrine type 1 IFN and that transduction alone is insufficient to activate the pDCs. Induction of TNF, IFN-γ and IL-6 were marginally but consistently decreased with type 1 IFN blockade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4B</xref>), again similar to pDC depletion.</p><p id="P22">While these data clearly supported a model where pDC-derived IFN-α is important for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19-induced humoral responses, it was unclear if pDC-derived antigen was also important. To investigated this, we determined if addition of exogenous IFN-α was sufficient to rescue pDC-depleted cultures. Adding exogenous recombinant IFN-α to pDC-depleted cultures restored S1-specific IgG antibody secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>) and B cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G-H</xref>). Adding IFN-α without ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 stimulation caused B cell activation (CD38<sup>++</sup>) but no anti-S1 IgG secretion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>), further confirming that the cognate antigen is required for specific antibody secretion. IFN-α supplementation did not affect overall percentage of transduced cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4D</xref>).</p><p id="P23">While cognate antigen is critical for ChAdOx1-stimulation of humoral responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), these results suggest that pDCs do not modulate these responses by producing cognate antigen. Instead, they promote humoral responses primarily by producing IFN-α.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>pDC-derived type 1 IFN augments the humoral response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 partially by stimulating IL-6 production</title><p id="P24">Depletion of pDCs reduced IL-6 levels in the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>), and type 1 IFN supplementation of pDC-depleted cultures also restored the induction of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). IL-6 is a known modulator of B cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Vazquez, Catalan-Dibene and Zlotnik, 2015</xref>). Thus, we sought to investigate if pDCs modulated ChAdOx1-induced humoral immunity through IL-6 as an intermediary signal. First, we tested whether IL-6 regulated humoral responses to ChAdOx1. Blockade of IL-6 signaling using anti-IL-6R antibodies significantly, but partially, decreased S1-specific IgG production across all donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). There was a trend of decreased B cell activation as well, although this did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P25">As monocytes are one of the best described sources of IL-6 (Aarden <italic>et al</italic>., 1987), but are essentially absent in tonsils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>), we next sought to determine the cellular source of IL-6. Thus, we performed intracellular staining of IL-6 at 24 hours after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 stimulation. With the exception of pDCs, most cell types produced IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Although the percentage of IL-6-producing B cells is low as a proportion of total B cells, given the high frequency of B cells in the culture, B cells comprise most of the IL-6-producing cells. Consistent with the flow cytometry analysis, isolated B cells produced IL-6 in response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). However, B cell-depleted cultures also produced substantial IL-6, suggesting that non-B cell populations are also a source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Interestingly, despite both cultures producing IL-6, there were major differences in the level of IFN-α in the cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). B cell-depleted cultures had high levels of IFN-α production (consistent with the presence of pDCs) and there was a strong correlation between IFN-α levels and IL-6 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). By contrast, despite producing substantial IL-6, the purified B cell culture had negligible induction of IFN-α (&lt;10 pg/mL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>), and thus IL-6 and IFN-α levels were unsurprisingly not related (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). These findings suggest that both B cells and innate cells contribute to IL-6 induction by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, but through type 1 IFN-independent and -dependent mechanisms, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Type 1 IFN and IL-6 augment the cellular response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, including for follicular helper T (T<sub>FH</sub>) cells</title><p id="P26">Another important factor that could modulate humoral responses is the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response. Thus, we sought to examine T cell activation in response to the vaccine. In the tonsil organoid model, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation (CD40L<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-B</xref>). ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induced production of IFN-γ, TNF, and IL-2, as measured by intracellular cytokine staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>). Thus, we could assess the activation and effector function of spike-specific T cells in response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.</p><p id="P27">Given that type I IFN and IL-6 modulated humoral responses, we sought to determine if these pathways also modulated the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response. Although blocking type 1 IFN or IL-6 signaling did not affect the frequency of CD69<sup>+</sup>CD40L<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>), both treatments decreased cytokine production by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). This suggests that type 1 IFN and IL-6 both play a role in augmenting the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell effector response stimulated by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.</p><p id="P28">One particularly important CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset in promoting B cell responses are follicular helper T (T<sub>FH</sub>) cells, which regulate germinal center reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Crotty, 2014</xref>). We identified these cells by gating for PD-1<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). IL-6R blockade reduced the percentage of T<sub>FH</sub> cells both in unstimulated and stimulated wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A-B</xref>). This finding is likely due to the requirement of IL-6 to maintain the T<sub>FH</sub> phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Korn and Hiltensperger, 2021</xref>). However, with regards to function, blocking IL-6 signaling only resulted in a modest decrease in TNF-producing T<sub>FH</sub> and even a modest increase of CD40L<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>+</sup> T<sub>FH</sub> cells, suggesting less of an effect on T<sub>FH</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C-D</xref>). Conversely, blocking type 1 IFN did not affect the number of T<sub>FH</sub> cells, but had a strong inhibitory effect on both IFN-γ and TNF production by T<sub>FH</sub> cells. When examining activated T<sub>FH</sub> as a percentage of total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, both treatments resulted in decreased frequencies of cytokine-producing T<sub>FH</sub> cells in the culture and no change in the percentage of CD40L<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>+</sup> T<sub>FH</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E-F</xref>). Overall, these data show that IL-6 and type 1 IFN both modulate T<sub>FH</sub> activation through different mechanisms: through maintaining T<sub>FH</sub> phenotype and augmenting cytokine production, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">In this study we have validated the use of an in vitro human tonsil organoid system for studying the humoral responses to adenovirus vector vaccines. We could study vaccine antigen-specific antibody production and B and T cell activation, as well as bulk B cell activation, which allows the investigation of the mechanisms underlying these responses. Our findings demonstrate the central role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in modulating humoral responses, primarily through type 1 IFN and indirectly through driving IL-6 signaling. Type 1 IFN and IL-6 also modulate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, including T<sub>FH</sub> cell responses, providing other potential mechanisms that regulate humoral responses to adenoviral vaccines. We summarize these findings in our model (Figure 8).</p><p id="P30">The in vitro tonsil organoid model has mainly been previously utilized for investigating responses to influenza vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kastenschmidt <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Yin <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Mitul <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Although previous studies focused on influenza vaccines, it has been shown that adenoviral vectors can induce antibody responses in the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Wagar <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). We investigated further the cell-cell interactions and signaling modulating this humoral response and extended these investigations into the regulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell, and specifically T<sub>FH</sub> cell, responses. Through using the system, we could model adaptive immune responses to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 within lymphoid tissue and probe into mechanisms regulating these responses. Through combining cell depletions and cytokine blockade/supplementation, we could investigate intricate signaling interplay between different cells and cytokines, which revealed a critical pDC–IFN-α–IL-6 signaling axis. We believe this robustly validates the use of this model for studying entirely new classes of vaccines.</p><p id="P31">An important consideration with experimental models is identifying the aspects of the actual process that it captures. Our culture system appears to efficiently model a recall/boost response to adenoviral vectors rather than a “prime” response given that reliable detection of specific IgG antibody production requires pre-existing S1-specific B cells. However, IgM production could be measured but was stochastic likely due to limited frequency of naive B cells in the culture well. As such, our system appears to more robustly model a booster vaccination response in a previously exposed individual rather than a priming vaccination. The initial paper published on the model demonstrated priming of naive B cell responses either by using larger culture wells or specifically enriching for naive B cells, increasing the overall number of naïve B cells in the system as well as the chances of having antigen-specific naïve B cells in the culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Wagar <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). These parameters should be considered when designing and implementing this organoid model.</p><p id="P32">With our system, we discovered that pDCs are central modulators of humoral responses to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. The role of pDCs has rarely been discussed in the context of humoral responses to adenovirus vector responses. A clinical study reported that the number of pDCs in blood are negatively correlated with antibody responses to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Ryan <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). Elevated pDC frequency in the blood might indicate lower recruitment into lymph nodes after vaccination, supporting the role of pDCs in adenovirus vector humoral responses generated in SLOs. A previous study using the tonsil organoid model also reported a sharp decrease in humoral responses towards LAIV with pDC-depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Wagar <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), suggesting that pDCs may also play a role in responses to multiple vaccine platforms.</p><p id="P33">Our findings show type 1 IFN as the main mediator of pDCs’ effect on humoral responses. A study in NHPs previously showed a correlation between type 1 IFN and spike-specific humoral responses induced by Ad26.COV2.S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">He <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), and we have now directly demonstrated a mechanistic link with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Previous studies testing an adenovirus vector vaccine against foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) in mice reported higher humoral and cellular responses when including porcine IFN-α in the construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Su <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Duan <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Type 1 IFNs are known to support B cell activation and differentiation into plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bekeredjian-Ding <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Previous studies also report the role of type 1 IFN in augmenting humoral responses to other vaccine modalities including LAIV and MVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jego <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aljurayyan <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Zhong <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>), suggesting that this effect applies for humoral responses in general.</p><p id="P34">In addition to directly activating B cells, type 1 IFN also augmented humoral responses through promoting IL-6 secretion. In vivo studies in mice and hepatitis C patients receiving recombinant pegylated IFN-α injections show that type 1 IFN enhances production of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ito <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Murray <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Historically named B-cell stimulatory factor-2, IL-6 is known to promote survival, expansion, and maturation of B cells to become plasmablasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Rose-John, Winthrop and Calabrese, 2017</xref>). This is supported by several clinical studies reporting decreased humoral responses to mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with anti-IL-6R treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Tobudic <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Schiff <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Type 1 IFN and IL-6 also modulate bulk CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and T<sub>FH</sub> responses in our experimental model. Type 1 IFN promotes Bcl6 expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Nakayamada <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), but is inadequate to induce complete T<sub>FH</sub> differentiation. Full T<sub>FH</sub> commitment requires other cytokines, including IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Harker <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). As type 1 IFN itself augments IL-6 secretion, it appears that type 1 IFN and IL-6 synergize to induce T<sub>FH</sub> differentiation and activation in response to adenovirus vaccination, in turn promoting T-dependent B cell responses. Other than direct effect on T cells, type 1 IFN may also modulate cDCs to promote T<sub>FH</sub> differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Dahlgren <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Studies of adenoviral FMDV vaccines in mice reported that including type 1 IFN in the construct enhanced both induction and activation of T<sub>FH</sub> cells as well as the antibody production against the transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Su <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Duan <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Besides their cytokine production, pDCs may also contribute to humoral responses through producing target antigens. Given their efficient transduction by ChAdOx1, it is possible that pDCs can present antigens to T cells or provide antigens to B cells for the GC reaction. Several studies have reported that pDC subsets can contribute to antigen presentation to T cells, either by directly presenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alculumbre <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) or by transferring antigens to cDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Rogers <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Fu <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Our data suggests that their production of type 1 IFN is their major mode of action in this model, given the near complete restoration of antibody production in pDC-depleted cultures by recombinant IFN-α supplementation. Nonetheless, the decrease in antibody production with type 1 IFN blockade was milder than pDC-depletion, which suggests that antigen production may still form a minor part of pDCs’ role in the humoral response to adenovirus vectors.</p><p id="P37">The tonsil organoid system provides an in vitro model for studying vaccine responses with cells derived from human SLO tissue that resembles lymph nodes closer than peripheral blood culture models. However, as specialized SLOs that are constantly exposed to pathogens in the oral tract, tonsils would still have differences with lymph nodes, and this unique biology may be particularly relevant when considering mucosal vaccination. The pathology prompting the removal of the tonsils may also affect the responses in the system, as evidenced by several donors that produced S1-specific antibody responses at baseline (and were thus excluded from analysis).</p><p id="P38">Using the in vitro tonsil organoid model, we were able to demonstrate humoral and cellular responses to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. The system appears to model recall responses, which would be applicable to booster vaccinations. We discovered that pDCs modulate humoral responses to adenoviral vector vaccines, primarily through type 1 IFN. Type 1 IFN augmented IL-6 production, which also modulated humoral responses. Both type 1 IFN and IL-6 promoted CD4<sup>+</sup> T and T<sub>FH</sub> responses to the transgene, possibly partially linking cellular and humoral immunity. The system provides great potential for mechanistic studies on vaccine responses.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Tonsil tissue collection &amp; processing</title><p id="P39">Whole human tonsils were collected from January 2022 to October 2023 from adult or pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy for sleep apnea or any other indication for elective tonsillectomy.

Brefeldin A was added to cultures at 16-20 hours before harvest to enhance intracellular cytokine detection. Cells were harvested, washed, and incubated in the surface staining cocktail as described above. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized by being incubated in BD Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) for 20 minutes at 4°C. Fixed cells were incubated with the intracellular staining cocktail for 30 minutes at 4°C and washed twice before running the samples in the flow cytometer. Flow cytometry was done using BD LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer or BD LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Cytokine measurements</title><p id="P49">Cytokine levels were measured from culture media supernatants harvested 24 hours after plating using LegendPlex™ Human Inflammation Panel 1 (Biolegend), per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, supernatants were incubated with detection beads coated with antibodies against the panel cytokines for two hours. Beads were then incubated with biotinylated detection antibodies and subsequently with PE-conjugated streptavidin. Beads are then detected through flow cytometry (BD LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer), then converted back to cytokine concentrations using Qognit software (Biolegend).</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="P50">Analysis of flow cytometry data was performed using FlowJo version 10.8.1. Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism version 9. Comparison of different donor groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>) were done using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Paired samples (comparison of different treatments for matched/pairs donors) were done using Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test (for two groups) or using Friedman test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test (for three groups). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figures 5F-G</xref>, comparisons were only made between unstimulated and stimulated groups separately for each treatment.
