Antifungal treatment options are few and many have narrow therapeutic margins and potentially serious side effects. In recent years, there are growing numbers of reports of antifungal resistance. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective models to study fungal pathogenesis and test antifungal therapies in the respiratory system. Here, we present a novel <italic>ex-vivo</italic> model using precision-cut lung slices in an air-liquid interface platform to evaluate lung tissue responses to fungal infection and antifungal treatment. Readouts assessed were lactate dehydrogenase for tissue damage, release of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, CXCL1), and histology for confirmation of hyphal invasion. Overall, the PCLS-ALI model is a promising approach for understanding lung tissue responses to fungal infections, which fulfils the reduction and refinement components of the 3Rs guiding principles for ethical use of experimental animals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pulmonary Aspergillosis</kwd><kwd><italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic></kwd><kwd>Precision-cut lung slices</kwd><kwd>PCLS</kwd><kwd>air-liquid interface</kwd><kwd>ALI</kwd><kwd>antifungals</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>3Rs principles</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Pulmonary aspergillosis (PA) is primarily caused by <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (<italic>Af</italic>) which is found ubiquitously in the air and easily reaches the lower respiratory tract. Those with high susceptibility to PA can be broadly categorized within two groups, first those with dysfunctional immune systems including immunodeficiency, immunosuppression, or hypersensitivity and, secondly, those with structural lung disease such as bronchiectasis or pulmonary cavitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). PA is strongly associated with neutropenia, which makes patients with cancer more susceptible to this infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Most antifungal drugs routinely used clinically, including Amphotericin B (AmB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) and the triazoles, have toxic side effects. These issues, together with increasing reports of antifungal resistant strains of <italic>Af</italic>, both clinical and environmental, highlight a need for models or the investigation of antifungal drugs in a respiratory setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). To experimentally replicate immunosuppression and generate a PA animal model, pharmacological immunosuppression is typically used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). However, these models are time consuming, use large numbers of animals, can expose animals to repeated procedures over long periods of time, and lack the diverse remodelling of lung tissue seen in human pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) have been used since the late 1980s, when Placke and Fisher optimised the infusion of low-melting point agarose into the lungs, allowing their slicing without damaging the structural organization of the tissue. PCLS have been shown to be suitable for several downstream applications investigating immune responses including flow cytometry, microscopy, quantification of cytokine and chemokine release, and RNA isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Recently, this <italic>ex-vivo</italic> model has enabled the study of viral and bacterial infections and the efficacy of new drugs on a larger scale compared to <italic>in-vivo</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Nonetheless, to our knowledge, respiratory fungal pathogens have not been tested using this model.</p><p id="P3">Air-liquid interface (ALI) models have been widely utilised for investigating processes that occur in the lung between epithelial layers and immune cells. The principle is to provide two environments in one cell culture model, with a layer submerged in medium and another layer exposed to air to simulate some of the histological conditions involved in gas exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Additionally, it is suggested that ALI models are superior to traditional submerged cultures of cells since they better replicate the conditions involved in surfactant production and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). ALI models have proven valuable to test toxicity of substances and drugs, as well as the delivery of aerosolized substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). This model has been successfully tested using cell lines and primary cells, mainly focused on a respiratory epithelium model; nonetheless, co-culture systems that include macrophages, dendritic cells and endothelial cells have also been employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In the context of <italic>Af</italic> infection, the ALI model offers an additional benefit by modelling the interface where fungal invasion occurs. Most infection models, either <italic>in-vitro</italic> or <italic>ex-vivo</italic>, submerge cells or tissue in culture medium, requiring the submersion of the pathogen tested. This is an additional limitation when working with <italic>Af</italic>, since it adapts efficiently to the nutrients available and its behaviour can vary significantly accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Here we describe the design and performance of a system that combines PCLS and ALI models to create a novel, physiologically relevant, <italic>ex-vivo</italic> model for the study of lung respiratory fungal infections, which simultaneously complies with the principles of the 3Rs for humane animal research, reducing the number of experimental animals in comparison with conventional approaches.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ethics and animal use</title><p id="P6">All mouse work was carried out following the Animal [Scientific Procedures] Act 1986.

These adaptations are not exclusively dependent on nutrients, but also on conditions like pH and temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Transcriptome analysis has shown that <italic>Af</italic> changes with hypoxia by increasing the metabolism of polysaccharides, amino acids, metal ion transport, nitrogen and glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) and these strategies seem to lead to enhanced invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). An <italic>in-vivo</italic> model would require many experimental animals to control these parameters and <italic>ex-vivo</italic> models rely on submersion of tissue and fungi into culture medium, eliminating the air-liquid interface which has been shown to have immunological relevance. Immune responses to <italic>Af</italic> are mediated by alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells. Pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), like galactomannan and β-1,3-glucan, trigger initial inflammatory responses, the release of chemokines, cytokines, and promote cell migration to clear the fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Air-liquid interface has been shown to contribute significantly to epithelial cells function, enhancing surfactant, mucus production and modulating cytokines release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p><p id="P31">To generate lung discs as homogeneous as possible, we applied the standard protocol of Placke et al. filling the lungs of C57BL/6J mice with 2% agarose. After the agarose solidified, the lungs were collected from the thoracic cavity, and immediately sliced. The functional residual capacity in a mouse is 0.25 mL, and we infused agarose to reach the total lung capacity of 1 mL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), therefore pulmonary tissue represents only 25% of the final sample’s volume. For that reason, we included an overnight incubation step at 37°C before punching the lung discs. By removing the agarose, the lung slices become more compact, provide more tissue per volume of sample, and increases homogeneity between slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Schematic 1</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Technically, an <italic>ex-vivo</italic> model based on PCLS implies variability in the proportions of the cellular components between lung discs. Minor histological differences can be expected based on the location of the lung from which the slice has been obtained. The closer the slice is to the hilum, the larger the calibre of the vessels and the airway. However, mouse lungs provide an advantage for this model, since the airway inside the lung parenchyma lacks cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), increasing uniformity between lung discs. However, perfect homogeneity between lung discs is impossible and variations could produce differences in the rate of nutrients consumption and medium acidification. Nonetheless, after 48 hours, one lung disc increases medium Abs at 415 nm on 59% (0.149) in comparison to medium only (0.094), keeping margin of error close to 5% (5.96% for CI=95%).</p><p id="P33">AmB showed an important immunomodulatory effect that agrees with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Although, the effect on TNF-α did not reveal significant differences between conditions, a strong, dose-dependent increase in IL-1β was found. An interesting finding was the significant lower levels of CXCL1 from infected lung discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 F G H</xref>). Although the causes are not known, FBS has been shown to increase CXCL1 release in PCLS and some authors suggest to use serum-free media to avoid it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>); however, this approach reduces inflammatory cytokine responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).</p><p id="P34">AmB showed no effect on CXCL1 release on uninfected tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4 C</xref>) but had a dose-dependent effect to restore the release of CXCL1 by PCLS. This suggests that <italic>Af</italic> modulates directly CXCL1 responses. Further experiments are needed to elucidate the underlining mechanisms, with possible explanations including <italic>Af</italic> consuming the serum in the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) reducing the stimulating factor for CXCL1 release. Alternatively, <italic>Af</italic> could reduce CXCL1 concentration through the activity of proteinases, that hydrolyse proteins.</p><p id="P35">Further analysis can be performed to study the variability of the cellular components between lung discs using flow cytometry. It has been shown that the proportion of some cell types, such as alveolar macrophages, can vary significantly between slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Whether the variability reported of different ratios of alveolar macrophages influences TNF-α and IL-1β responses is not known and needs to be clarified. We decided to set a 48-hour time-point to ensure hyphal growth and confirm that this model enables infiltration into the tissue. Nonetheless, a limitation in this model is the difficulty to design a kinetic assessment of cytokine release, since large volumes of supernatant cannot be removed at multiple time-points from a single well.</p><p id="P36">Overall, the PCLS-ALI model reduces and refines the use of experimental animals for the investigation of pulmonary tissue immune responses, tissue damage, fungal invasiveness, and drug testing.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Prof. Cecilia Johansson from the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, for her expertise and assistance.
