They coexist in the ocean with cyanophages, viruses that infect cyanobacteria. Cyanophages carry many auxiliary metabolic genes acquired from their hosts that are thought to redirect host metabolism for the phage’s benefit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.

However, the benefit of the cyanophage-encoded NblA for the cyanophage and the broader impact on the host are unknown. Here, using a recently developed genetic manipulation system for cyanophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, we reveal that cyanophage NblA significantly accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other photosynthetic proteins and reduces host photosynthetic light harvesting efficiency. Furthermore, metagenomic analysis revealed that cyanophages carrying <italic>nblA</italic> are widespread in the oceans and compose 35% and 65% of oceanic T7-like cyanophages in the surface and deep photic zones, respectively. Our results show a large benefit of the <italic>nblA</italic> gene to the cyanophage while exerting a negative effect on the host photosynthetic apparatus and host photosynthesis.

Cyanobacteria capture and funnel solar energy through their PBSs towards the photosynthetic reaction centers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> where the primary energy conversion reactions of photosynthesis occur. Typical PBSs of marine <italic>Synechococcus</italic> are built of multiple subunits that absorb light at different wavelengths, including an allophycocyanin (APC) core and peripheral rods composed of disks of different phycobiliproteins, phycocyanin (PC) and phycoerythrin I and II proteins (PEI, PEII) as well as linker proteins that connect rod subunits to each other and to the core and attach the PBS to the thylakoid membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.

The <italic>nblA</italic> gene codes for a proteolysis adaptor protein found in multiple cyanophage families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and is particularly prevalent in T7-like cyanophages (family <italic>Autographiviridae</italic>). In nutrient deprived cyanobacteria, the cyanobacterial NblA is responsible for inducing degradation of the PBS complex, resulting in clear loss of pigmentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Here, we use S-TIP37, a typical T7-like cyanophage isolated from the Red Sea that infects the open ocean <italic>Synechococcus</italic> sp. strain WH8109<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, as our model system to study cyanophage-encoded <italic>nblA</italic>. We began by examining whether the cyanophage <italic>nblA</italic> gene is transcribed and translated during the infection process. We found high <italic>nblA</italic> transcript and protein levels from two hours post-infection onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). This expression pattern was distinct to that of a host copy of the <italic>nblA</italic> gene which displayed fairly consistent transcript and protein levels throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). The phage <italic>nblA</italic> expression pattern was similar to that of the phage DNA polymerase gene, and is thus expressed with phage genes involved in DNA metabolism and replication and prior to virion morphogenesis genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Next, we assessed the influence of the <italic>nblA</italic> gene on cyanophage infection. For this we constructed <italic>nblA</italic> cyanophage deletion mutants (Δ<italic>nblA</italic>) using the REEP approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S5">Methods</xref>). Infection of the host with the Δ<italic>nblA</italic> mutant phage revealed visibly less pigmentation loss than when the host cells were infected with the wild-type (WT) phage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), indicating a clear phenotype for the Δ<italic>nblA</italic> mutant during infection.</p><p id="P5">To investigate the importance of the cyanophage NblA to the infection process, we performed phage growth curve experiments. The Δ<italic>nblA</italic> mutant demonstrated a substantially longer latent period (the period of infection prior to the first release of phage progeny from the cells) of 10 h compared to the 3 h latent period of the WT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In addition, synthesis of phage proteins increased with time during infection with the WT phage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Data File 1</xref>), whereas most phage protein production ceased after 3 h during infection with the Δ<italic>nblA</italic> mutant with significantly fewer virion morphogenesis proteins produced in the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). These findings suggest a direct link between phage protein production and NblA expression and indicate that NblA is advantageous to the WT phage. Since cyanobacterial NblAs are known to degrade PBSs during nutrient stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, and to release amino acids critical for cell survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. we hypothesize that the phage NblA has a similar role during infection but that the release of amino acids is used for building new virions.</p><p id="P6">To verify that the observed phenotype is a result of the lack of the <italic>nblA</italic> gene, we performed a rescue experiment. This was achieved by infecting <italic>Synechococcus</italic> sp. strain WH8109 cells that were ectopically expressing the cyanophage <italic>nblA</italic> gene under an inducible expression system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> with the Δ<italic>nblA</italic> mutant phage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Indeed, such expression of the cyanophage NblA restored the timing of infection to that found for the WT cyanophage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These findings confirm that the <italic>nblA</italic> gene plays an important function in cyanophage infection.</p><p id="P7">Cyanophage NblA would be expected to impact host photosynthesis if it directs PBS degradation. PBSs transfer energy to the photochemical reaction centers of the photosystems (PSI or PSII)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Therefore, we measured the functional efficiency of PSII light utilization using fluorescence (at room temperature) as an indicator. The effective PSII absorption cross-sectional area was calculated after exciting at the most peripheral disks of the PBS, PEII (495 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). While uninfected cells maintained a steady PSII cross-sectional area, infection with both the WT and Δ<italic>nblA</italic> mutant phages resulted in a considerable decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Notably, this decline during infection with the Δ<italic>nblA</italic> mutant occurred with a delay of 4 h relative to infection with the WT cyanophage. This delay translates into a 50% longer period in which photosynthetic efficiency remained unaffected during infection with the Δ<italic>nblA</italic> mutant. These findings indicate that the cyanophage NblA has a substantial negative impact on the host’s functional efficiency of photosynthetic light utilization during infection. This diminished photosynthetic performance could be attributed to targeted PBS degradation, accelerated cell lysis, or a combination of both factors.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Cyanophage NblA causes degradation of host PBS</title><p id="P8">Cyanobacterial NblAs are known to be involved in PBS degradation. To assess whether the cyanophage NblA has a similar effect on host PBS integrity, we monitored whole-cell fluorescence emission spectra as a measure of the energy transfer pathway from the PBS to PSII. Samples collected at different time points were excited at the peripheral PEII disk of the PBS and the corresponding fluorescence emission spectra were measured. Infection with the WT cyanophage led to a rapid and substantial decrease in the chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> (Chl) peak with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). This decline was first obvious at 3-h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), prior to the onset of cell lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, infection by the Δ<italic>nblA</italic> knockout cyanophage led to a more gradual decrease in Chl fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 2a</xref>). These findings indicate that energy transfer from PE to Chl was rapidly interrupted during infection with the WT phage, but considerably less so with the Δ<italic>nblA</italic> mutant phage.</p><p id="P9">Whole-cell absorbance spectra and proteomic analysis provide a means to assess the levels of host PBS subunits during infection. At 12 hours post-infection, we observed a flattening of both PEI and PEII absorbance peaks, as a result of infection by the WT cyanophage. A less prominent decrease in these peaks was observed during infection with the Δ<italic>nblA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), suggestive of NblA degradation of the PE proteins. Proteomic analysis during infection with the WT phage revealed lower levels of the α subunits of PEII, PEI and PC rods (CpeA, MpeA and RpcA respectively), as well as two rod linker proteins (MpeC and MpeE) relative to infection with the Δ<italic>nblA</italic> mutant at 4-h post-infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl. Data File 3</xref>). In contrast, three linker proteins closer to the core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> that connect PC to APC and both PC and APC to the thylakoid membrane (ApcC, CpcG1, CpcG2) and one rod linker protein (CpeC) had higher protein levels during infection with the WT relative to the Δ<italic>nblA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Data File 1</xref>) which may be indicative of compensation by the host to a reduction in active PBSs. Combined, these findings provide further evidence for the role of cyanophage NblA in PBS disassembly and degradation.</p><p id="P10">Next, we wished to determine the fate of the antenna complex during infection. To achieve this, we isolated PBSs from host cells infected with WT and Δ<italic>nblA</italic> cyanophages six hours post-infection and compared them to those in uninfected cells. Fractionation of PBSs from uninfected cells on a sucrose gradient followed by fluorescence spectra analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>) allowed us to differentiate between assembled (lower, high density, pink bands) and disassembled complexes (upper, low density, orange bands) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). While intact and disassembled PBSs were apparent in uninfected host cells, only disassembled PBSs were present in cells infected by the WT cyanophage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Cells infected by the Δ<italic>nblA</italic> mutant cyanophage were composed of both intact and degraded PBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>), indicative of only partial PBS disassembly.</p><p id="P11">The combined findings above are consistent with a role for NblA in disassembly and degradation of the PBS during infection with the WT cyanophage. However, these findings could also be due, at least partially, to the beginning of cell lysis from 4-h onwards during infection with the WT phage. To more directly assess the impact of phage NblA on host PBSs without the confounding myriad effects of phage infection, we measured whole cell fluorescence spectra in host cells ectopically expressing the phage NblA (without infection). These measurements yielded a decline in the energy transfer from PE to Chl, seen by a reduction in the Chl fluorescence peak after excitation at PEII, relative to cells without induction of NblA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2d</xref>). Furthermore, ectopic expression of the phage NblA resulted in a reduction in the PEI and PEII absorbance peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). These results are similar to those found during infection with the WT phage (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a to 2d and Fig. 2b to 2e</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest a clear effect of the cyanophage NblA on energy transfer from PE to Chl and in degradation of the host antenna complexes.</p><p id="P12">We used ectopic expression of cyanophage NblA in host cells to determine whether it could restore PBS disassembly during infection with the Δ<italic>nblA</italic> cyanophage mutant. Indeed, NblA expression led to a decrease in the Chl fluorescence peak when excited at the peripheral PEII, declining to levels similar to those during infection with the WT cyanophage by 3-4-h post-infection (right panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Note that the partial decline in Chl fluorescence at 4-h post-infection in the control treatment without induction (left panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>) is likely caused by leaky expression in this inducible system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. These findings confirm that cyanophage NblA interrupts energy transfer from PE to Chl, consistent with a role in PBS disassembly and degradation during infection.</p><p id="P13">Next, we assessed the protein targets of the cyanophage NblA protein by following the production of new protein cleavages in host cells ectopically expressing the viral NblA. For this, we analyzed proteins with newly produced N-termini using mass spectrometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> at 24 and 48 h post-induction (at which time maximum protein induction occurs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>). Many new cleavages were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Among these, 79 proteins were cleaved exclusively upon viral NblA overexpression, with 32 and 59 newly cleaved proteins detected at 24 and 48 hours post-induction, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl. Data File 3</xref>). At 24 h post-induction, these cleaved proteins included two phycobiliproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>); the peripheral PEII disk α subunit (MpeA), and the ApcE linker responsible for energy transfer from the APC core to the chlorophylls of the photosynthetic reaction centers in the thylakoid membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. At 48 h post-induction, the vast majority of new proteolytic cleavages were of phycobilisome subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). These included the same three PEII, PEI and PC rod disk α subunits that displayed low levels during infection with the WT phage (MpeA, CpeA and RpcA) (see above) as well as the two PE rod disk β subunits (MpeB and CpeB) and two linker proteins connecting between disks in the rods (CpeC, CpeE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl. Data File 3</xref>). These proteolytic cleavages spanned almost all PBS rod proteins, but not PBS core proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). These results provide further evidence that the cyanophage NblA protein leads to the degradation and disassembly of the cyanobacterial PBS antenna complex. They also suggest that the cyanophage NblA directs disassembly in a stepwise fashion, initially to disconnect the host PBS from the thylakoid membrane, and to degrade peripheral PEII disks, followed by cleavage of the more internal PEI and PC disks. This is similar to the process known for cyanobacterial NblA during nutrient stress in which PBS degradation begins at the peripheral rod disks and moves inwards towards the PBS core<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">To our surprise, ectopic expression of the cyanophage NblA led to proteolytic processing of additional photosynthesis-related proteins beyond PBS proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl. Data File 3</xref>). These include those related to PSI (PsaC, PsaK), the PSII oxygen evolution complex (PsbO, PbsU), and carbon fixation (CcmK2, CsoS2). This suggests that the cyanophage NblA negatively impacts host photosynthesis through the proteolytic degradation not only of PBS components but also of reaction center proteins and proteins needed for carbon fixation. Moreover, a set of proteins with functions other than those related to photosynthesis were also cleaved as a result of expression of the cyanophage NblA. These include proteins involved in translation, with the majority of cleavages being in ribosomal proteins at 24 h post-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). In addition, translation initiation and elongation factors were also cleaved 48 h post-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl. Data File 3</xref>). Other key cellular proteins cleaved include proteins involved in carbon metabolism, a subunit of the cellular RNA polymerase (RpoC2), the cell division protein FtsZ, as well as porin and transporter proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Suppl. Data File 3</xref>). It is not known whether host NblA proteins also direct the degradation of these proteins. Cleavage of these proteins would thus disrupt multiple cellular processes during infection, in addition to those involved in photosynthesis.</p><p id="P15">In freshwater cyanobacteria, NblA proteins function by binding to PBS subunits as well as to the ClpC chaperone responsible for recruiting the protease that induces proteolytic degradation of the PBS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Since proteolytic enzymes often have preferred cleavage sites, this motivated us to investigate cleavage sites after ectopic expression of the cyanophage NblA in the <italic>Synechococcus</italic> host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). At 24 h post-induction, we detected cleavages primarily between asparagine (N) and serine (S) residues, while at 48 h post-induction an additional cleavage site was detected between lysine (K) and arginine (R) residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>), providing an explanation for the additional cleaved proteins at 48 h post-induction. This could be a result of NblA recruiting different proteases or that the different substrates are cleaved by the same proteolytic system (presumably the Clp protease complex) that has broad cleavage specificity. Combined, these results suggest that the native cyanophage NblA functions to induce the cleavage of a suite of PBS and photosynthesis-related proteins as well as of other key cellular processes during infection with the WT phage.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Cyanophage <italic>nblA</italic> is common in the oceans</title><p id="P16">T7-like cyanophages are very abundant in the oceans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.

These <italic>nblA</italic> genes are consistently located downstream of the exonuclease gene and frequently have up to a 110-nt overlap with it. <italic>nblA</italic> genes of the second type are restricted to some P-RSP2-like cyanophages (designated here as clade D) and are located downstream of an HNH endonuclease gene. Neither <italic>nblA</italic> gene type was found in the genomes of cyanophages from the newly discovered clade C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).

The differences in the amino acid sequences of the two <italic>nblA</italic> gene types, their location in the phage genomes, and their non-overlapping distribution among the cyanophage clades, suggest that the <italic>nblA</italic> gene has been acquired at least twice during T7-like cyanophage evolution.</p><p id="P18">It is noteworthy that the general distribution of the dominant <italic>nblA</italic> type in T7-like cyanophages parallels that for the <italic>psbA</italic> gene (coding for the PSII reaction center protein D1).

Cyanophages belonging to clades B and C dominated the global oceans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, while clade A and D phages were relatively rare. The vast majority of cyanophages from clade B possess the <italic>nblA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), with ~72% of those at the surface, and 89% of those deeper in the photic zone at the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM), carrying the gene. The proportion of <italic>nblA</italic>-encoding cyanophages among the less abundant clade A group was much lower, averaging ~24% at the surface and 10% at the DCM. In accordance with the distribution of the <italic>nblA</italic> genes in complete genomes described above, none of the clade C and D cyanophages had <italic>nblA</italic> genes downstream of the exonuclease gene. Since the <italic>nblA</italic> gene is located in a different genomic position in the relatively rare clade D, our quantification method could not be applied to them. Overall ~35% and 65% of the T7-like cyanophages (from clades A, B and C) coded for the <italic>nblA</italic> gene in the surface and at the DCM, respectively. These findings indicate that <italic>nblA</italic> is widespread amongst the abundant clade B cyanophages both at the surface and deeper in the photic zone.</p><p id="P21">T7-like cyanophages from clade B that code for the <italic>nblA</italic> gene infect picocyanobacteria with the PBS antenna (marine <italic>Synechococcus</italic> lineages) or without PBS (<italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).

NblA of the phages infecting <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic> would be expected to direct the degradation of other proteins.

As such, more of the cyanobacterial cell’s resources will be bound up in the photosynthetic apparatus at depth. Thus, we expect that the ability of cyanophages to degrade photosynthetic apparatus deep in the photic zone would provide a considerable advantage for the release of amino acids for use in cyanophage progeny production and may explain why relatively more clade B cyanophages at depth carry the <italic>nblA</italic> gene.</p><p id="P23">Clade B cyanophages are considerably more abundant deeper in the photic zone than at the surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. This, together with the higher incidence of <italic>nblA</italic>-genes among them, indicates that on a global scale, <italic>nblA</italic>-encoding cyanophages vastly outnumber the <italic>nblA</italic>-less members of this dominant clade. These findings suggest that cyanophage NblA-induced degradation of host PBS and other photosynthesis-related proteins described above, is very common among marine T7-like cyanophages in the photic zone in general and in the deeper layers of the sunlit ocean in particular.</p></sec><sec id="S4" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p id="P24">Auxiliary metabolic genes in viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> are a widespread phenomenon, especially in marine cyanophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.
