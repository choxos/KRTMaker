Defence traits are generally considered to be costly for the plant as they divert resources away from growth and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Züst <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Züst &amp; Agrawal 2017</xref>). While resource-based allocation costs can be context-dependent and not always apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Koricheva 2002</xref>), it is nonetheless clear that plant investment in defence must be substantial. For example, total investment in defensive glucosinolate production by <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> was estimated to be at least 15% of all photosynthetic energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bekaert <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). In line with these theoretical predictions, well-defended genotypes of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> with high glucosinolate concentrations and trichome densities had lower fruit numbers compared to less-defended genotypes when grown in a field experiment where herbivores had been artificially removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Mauricio &amp; Rausher 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Mauricio 1998</xref>). Similarly, knockout mutants of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> with abolished accumulation of aliphatic and indole glucosinolates, or with abolished trichome production showed increased growth relative to wildtype plants, suggesting that these knockout mutants could benefit from defence-related cost savings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Züst <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Costs of defence also can explain patterns in allocation of defences within individual plants as described by the Optimal Defence Theory (ODT). If defence is costly and resources are limited, plants are expected to allocate most of their defences to tissues that are most valuable for fitness, e.g., their youngest leaves for vegetative plants, and their flowers and seeds for reproductive plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">McKey 1974</xref>). The ODT has been extensively tested and validated, with many studies finding the highest concentration of chemicals found in high-value younger tissues, regardless of the type of defence or experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Traw &amp; Feeny 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">McCall &amp; Fordyce 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Keith &amp; Mitchell-Olds 2017</xref>). Consistent with the ODT, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accumulates the highest levels of glucosinolates in its youngest leaves, followed by a relocation of glucosinolates to flowers and seeds after the initiation of flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Brown <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Despite their substantial investment in defence and its optimised distribution, most plants are nonetheless susceptible to specialist herbivores with evolved tolerance mechanisms against these defences. For example, plants in the Brassicaceae are commonly attacked by a diverse community of insect herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bidart-Bouzat &amp; Kliebenstein 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mertens <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>), many of which have specialized adaptations against the glucosinolate defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Winde &amp; Wittstock 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jeschke <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). Potentially in response to this specialist threat, plants in the diverse Brassicaceae genus <italic>Erysimum</italic> evolved the ability to produce cardenolides as a ‘second line’ of chemical defence, and co-express them with the ancestrally conserved glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Züst <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">2020</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Glucosinolates are secondary metabolites found in all members of the Brassicaceae, functioning by enzyme-mediated release of highly reactive isothiocyanates and related toxic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Halkier &amp; Gershenzon 2006</xref>). In contrast, cardenolides sporadically occur across twelve botanical families and function as specific inhibitors of animal Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, resulting in impaired nerve signal transduction and herbivore paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Agrawal <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>). Importantly, specialized herbivore adaptations for coping with cardenolides are unrelated to glucosinolate tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Agrawal <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>), suggesting that Brassicaceae herbivores had no pre-adaptations for coping with cardenolides when these compounds first evolved in the <italic>Erysimum</italic> system approximately 2-5 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Züst <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Cardenolides are potent defences against many herbivores, but likely carry substantial metabolic cost as well. In the common milkweed <italic>Asclepias syriaca</italic>, the best-studied cardenolide system, foliar cardenolide concentrations are negatively correlated with early plant growth across a set of natural genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Züst <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). Furthermore, constitutive and induced concentrations generally show negative correlations across multiple milkweed species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Agrawal &amp; Hastings 2019</xref>), suggesting the existence of allocation-based limitations to cardenolide expression. Across the <italic>Erysimum</italic> genus, ancestral glucosinolates and novel cardenolides are co-expressed in most species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Züst <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>), likely imposing substantial metabolic costs on the plants. Interestingly, while glucosinolates are at least partially inducible by exogenous jasmonic acid application in most <italic>Erysimum</italic> species, cardenolides are only expressed constitutively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Züst <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>). Their co-expression and differential regulation by herbivore cues thus strongly suggest that the two chemical defences evolved in response to distinct evolutionary drivers, serve distinct functions, and may show distinct within-plant allocation patterns.</p><p id="P11">Here we examine the within-plant distribution of the main defensive traits of the annual plant <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> and test their effects on <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> as one of the main remaining <italic>Erysimum</italic> herbivores. When given free choice, larvae of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> preferentially feed on the lowest leaves while avoiding the uppermost, youngest leaves on the plant. We hypothesized that the glucosinolate-resistant <italic>P. xylostella</italic> is deterred by cardenolides, which according to ODT we expected to be highest in the youngest leaves.</p><p id="P12">We first performed a detailed profiling of within-plant differences in concentrations of glucosinolates and cardenolides on four-week and six-week-old plants to capture the peak vegetative and early reproductive growth stages, and further related these to trichome density and leaf nutrient content. We then performed a series of choice and performance experiments, first confirming 1) <italic>P. xylostella</italic> preference by releasing caterpillars on whole plants, followed by quantification of the location of damage. Next, we compared this preference to 2) performance when caterpillars were caged to leaves of four age classes (approximated by vertical position within the plant). To further isolate potential mechanisms in caterpillar preference and performance, we also tested 3) caterpillar choice and performance on <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> leaf discs cut from leaves of four age classes to exclude the effects of plant architecture. Finally, we tested 4) caterpillar choice and performance on broccoli leaf discs painted either with crude extracts from <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> leaves from four age classes, or with pure defence compounds at corresponding concentrations, to evaluate the effects of leaf metabolites in isolation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Plant and insect material</title><p id="P13">Seeds of <italic>Erysimum cheiranthoides</italic> accession ‘Elbtalaue’ (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center accession CS29250, National Plant Germplasm System accession PI 691911) were used for all experiments. The seeds for this accession had originally been collected in Germany and had been propagated by self-fertilization for 7-8 generations in a greenhouse. We also used one CRISPR/Cas9 knockout mutant with fully abolished cardenolide production, but intact glucosinolate production in the same genetic background, allowing us to further test the mechanistic role of cardenolides in herbivore feeding preference (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center accession CS29906, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Younkin <italic>et al</italic>. 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P14">For germination of experimental plants, seeds of <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> were soaked in water and kept at 4 °C for three days to break dormancy. Then, three soaked seeds were placed on the soil of pots (7 × 7 × 8 cm) filled with a 1:1 mixture of washed sand and peat-based planting substrate (Einheitserde, Patzer Erden GmbH, Germany). Pots were covered with transparent plastic hoods and placed in a growth chamber (16:8 h light: dark, 23 °C, 60% RH). After one week, hoods and extra seedlings were removed to leave only one seedling per pot. Plants were grown in the growth chamber for a total of three weeks and then moved to a greenhouse (natural light supplemented artificially to 16 h light, 23 °C). Plants were grown in the greenhouse for an additional 1 or 3 weeks, resulting in four-week or six-week-old plants, respectively. Six-week-old plants had initiated flower bud production, but no plants were flowering at the time of experiments. For all assays requiring leaves of age classes, we counted all leaves on a plant and then marked leaves at the 20th, 40th, 60th and 80th percentile along the tip-to-base axis of each plant, labelling them as age classes L4 (lowest/oldest) to L1 (highest/youngest).</p><p id="P15">An inbred laboratory strain of <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> was used for all herbivore experiments (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary methods</xref> for rearing details). To set up batches of caterpillars for experiments, we either used fresh (laid within the last 24h) or refrigerated eggs to set up additional diet cups and performed experiments with caterpillars in the L2 or L3 stage 8-10 days later (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>1</label><title>Plant traits</title><sec id="S5"><label>1.1</label><title>Sample collection and plant secondary metabolite quantification</title><p id="P16">To quantify variation in chemical profiles within plants, we sampled leaves of four age classes on six four-week and six-week-old plants each. To account for potential additional variation within leaves, we sampled each leaf at 2-6 positions by cutting out small leaf discs (5 mm diameter; 2 plant ages x 6 replicates x 4 leaf ages x 6 sampling positions = 213 discs). Each disc was added to a 2 mL screw-cap vial containing 50 μL 70% MeOH with three internal standards (ouabain, digitoxin, and sinigrin, 2 ug/mL each), and four 3 mm steel beads. Leaf discs were extracted on a FastPrep shaker (MP Biomedicals, France) at 6.5 m/s for 10 sec, followed by centrifugation at 2×10<sup>4</sup> g for 5 min and 4 °C. We transferred 40 μL supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube and centrifuged this sample a second time at 2×10<sup>4</sup> g for 5 min and 4°C to ensure the absence of any particles. Finally, 30 μL of the twice-centrifuged supernatant were transferred to a glass vial fitted with a glass micro insert for analysis by UPLC-MS.</p><p id="P17">The relative abundance and richness of cardenolides were analysed by UPLC-MS, using a Vanquish™ Horizon UHPLC System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) coupled to a timsTOF Pro mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Plant extracts were separated on an Acquity Premier CSH C18 2.1 x 100 mm column with 1.7 μm pore size (Waters, USA), maintained at 40°C. For detection of cardenolides, 1 μL of the extract was injected and separated at a constant flow rate of 0.55 mL/min with a gradient as follows: 0-4.5 min from 15% to 65% B, 4.5-4.7 from 65% to 100% B, followed by a 1.5 min wash phase at 100% B and 1.7 min reconditioning at 15% B. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ionization mode at 4,000 V capillary voltage and 500 V endplate offset with an N2 nebulizer pressure of 2.8 bar and dry gas flow of 8 min at 220 °C. Spectra were acquired in the mass range from m/z 50 to 2,000 at ca. 20,000 resolution (m/z 622) and a 1.5 Hz rate.</p><p id="P18">The mass analyser was calibrated at the beginning of each LC run using a 10 mM solution of sodium formate that was injected using a 6-port-valve with a 20 μL loop, giving a mass accuracy below two ppm. We putatively identified cardenolides by their exact mass, fragments, and retention times, and we then integrated peak areas of characteristic mass signals for relative quantification of compounds across all samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p><p id="P19">For absolute quantification of cardenolides, a subset of five plant samples spanning the full range of cardenolide concentrations were re-analysed by HPLC-UV-MS on an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC system (Agilent, Switzerland) with UV detection, coupled to an Agilent InfinityLab LC/MSD single quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization.</p><p id="P20">Samples were separated on an InfinityLab Poroshell EC-C18 3 x 150 mm column with 2.7 μm pore size (Agilent, Switzerland). The column was maintained at 40 °C and injections of 5 μL were eluted at a constant flow rate of 0.5 mL/min with a gradient of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) as follows: 0-16 min from 20% to 28% B, 16-21 min from 28% to 65% B, 21-22.5 min from 65% to 100% B, followed by a 5 min wash phase at 100% B, and 7.5 min reconditioning at 20% B. Cardenolides were quantified using the UV signal at 220 nm, and identified by matching UV peaks to corresponding mass signals monitored using single ion recording. UV peak areas of quantified cardenolides were converted to absolute concentrations using a digitoxin concentration series (20, 100, 200, 300 μg/mL), assuming equivalent UV absorption by equimolar amounts of cardenolides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Züst <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>). We then used the concentrations of cardenolides determined by UV signals in the re-analysed samples to convert MS peak areas into absolute concentrations for all samples and compounds.</p><p id="P21">Glucosinolates were first identified and quantified by UPLC-MS using an equivalent method as for cardenolides, with the mass spectrometer operating in negative ionization mode. However, due to higher concentrations and stronger ionization of glucosinolate compounds, we experienced substantial issues with detector saturation. We therefore only relied on quantification by UV and re-analysed a complete set of samples (2 samples per plant/leaf age = 96 samples) by HPLC-UV-MS. Samples were separated on an InfinityLab Poroshell CS-C18 3 x 100 mm column with 2.7 μm pore size (Agilent, Switzerland). The column was maintained at 40 °C and injections of 3 μL were eluted at a constant flow rate of 0.5 mL/min with a gradient of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) as follows: 0-7 min from 2% to 30% B, 7-10 min from 30% to 45% B, 10-10.5 min from 45% to 100% B, followed by a 4.5 min wash phase at 100% B, and 5 min reconditioning at 2% B. Glucosinolates were quantified using the UV signal at 229 nm, and identified by matching UV peaks to corresponding mass signals monitored using single ion recording (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). UV peak areas of quantified glucosinolates were adjusted by published response factors to account for differences in compound-specific absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Grosser &amp; van Dam 2017</xref>) and then converted to concentrations using a sinigrin concentration series (5, 25, 50, 100, 200 μg/mL).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>1.2</label><title>Trichome quantification</title><p id="P22">We quantified trichomes on the leaves of three six-week-old <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> plants. Leaves of four age classes were marked on each plant as above. For each marked leaf, we acquired high-resolution images of the abaxial and adaxial side using an Emspira 3 digital microscope (Leica Microsystems, Switzerland). Trichomes were then counted on a defined area using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Schneider <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>) to quantify trichome densities.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><label>1.3</label><title>Macronutrient determination</title><p id="P23">Nutrient content was quantified from a separate set of 18 six-week-old plants. Leaves of four age classes were marked as above, and the marked leaf and one adjacent leaf were harvested, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and later freeze-dried for 48h. Leaves from three plants were pooled to ensure sufficient material for all assays, leaving six biological replicates. Soluble sugar and starch concentration of leaves was determined enzymatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Velterop &amp; Vos 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Smith &amp; Zeeman 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Machado <italic>et al</italic>. 2013</xref>). Dried leaves were broken up and 10 mg of leaf material per biological replicate was added to a 2 mL screw-cap tube with three steel beads and ground on a FastPrep shaker at 6.5 m/s for 10 sec. Next, we added 500 μL 80% (v/v) EtOH (Fisher Chemical) to each tube, followed by incubation on a thermomixer at 78 °C for 15 min and 800 rpm, and centrifugation at 2×10<sup>4</sup> g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to a new tube, and the precipitated pellet was re-extracted with 500 μL 50% (v/v) EtOH (Fisher Chemical). Supernatants were combined and used for sugar determination, while the remaining pellet was used for starch determination.</p><p id="P24">For starch digestion, we added 1 mL of ddH2O to each sample tube to suspend the remaining pellet. We pipetted 100 μL of this suspension to individual wells of a 2 mL deep well plate. As a control for the starch digestion reaction, we included six wells of pure starch (Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland) at different concentrations on each deep plate (100 μL of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.6, 2.4, and 3 mg of starch in 500 μL ddH2O). We then added 500 μL of a fructose solution (55 mg fructose in 250 mL water) to all wells containing sample or starch suspensions to serve as an internal standard. We closed the plates tightly with a sealing mat and wrapped them in aluminium foil before autoclaving them for 1h. After the plates had cooled to room temperature, we added 500 μL of a digestive enzyme solution to each well, consisting of 50 mL of a 50 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.5 (Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland), 1.35 mL amyloglucosidase (1.9 U/reaction, Roche, Switzerland) and 12 μL α-amylase (3 U/reaction, Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland). Plates were then shaken and incubated overnight at 37 °C.</p><p id="P25">Glucose, fructose, sucrose, and glucose from digested starch were determined by a spectrophotometer using the absorption of NADPH that is produced from the enzymatic conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate. We prepared a master mix consisting of 20 mL 50 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland) with 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland) at pH 7, 12 mg NADP (Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland), 20 mg ATP (Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland) and 20 μL glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.14 U/reaction, Roche, Switzerland). We combined 200 μL master mix and 25 μL of sample in wells of a 96-well microplate and recorded NADPH baseline absorbance at 340 nm. We then sequentially added a series of enzyme solutions to quantify the different sugars. First, we added 5 μL hexokinase (40 μL in 600 μL HEPES buffer, 0.5 U/reaction, Roche, Switzerland) to convert glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (and fructose to fructose-6-phosphate). Second, we added 5 μL phosphoglucoisomerase (40 μL in 600 μL HEPES buffer, 1.2 U/reaction, Roche, Switzerland) to convert fructose-6-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate. Finally, we added 5 μL of invertase (48 mg in 600 μL HEPES buffer, 120 U/reaction, Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland) to convert sucrose into glucose and fructose. After each addition of an enzyme, we monitored absorbance at 340 nm until a stable state was reached. We quantified all sugars relative to a glucose concentration curve (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mM) which was included on each microplate.</p><p id="P26">Total protein content of the same leaves was quantified using a protocol by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Clissold et al.

In brief, total proteins were extracted from 10 mg freeze-dried plant powder using 0.5 mL 0.1M NaOH with sonication for 30 min and heating in 90°C water bath for 15 min. After centrifugation and transfer of supernatants to a new tube, extraction was repeated with 0.3 mL 0.1M NaOH. The two supernatants were pooled and neutralized using 13 μL 6M HCl, after which we precipitated proteins using 90 μL trichloroacetic acid (100% w/v, Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland). After removal and discarding of supernatants, the remaining protein pellets were resuspended in 1 mL 0.1M NaOH and diluted 1/20 with water. We determined protein concentrations from three technical replicates using QuickStart™ Bradford Dye (BioRad, Switzerland) by quantifying absorbance at 595 nm on a photospectrometer.

At four weeks of age, plants were near peak vegetative growth and showed a relatively homogeneous distribution of defensive chemicals across their leaves, even though some compounds, including the most abundant cardenolide and glucosinolate, already showed a clear gradient of increasing concentrations from base to tip. Two weeks later, six-week-old plants had begun shifting to reproductive growth, indicated by the initiation of flower buds. Consequently, base-to-tip gradients strengthened in most defensive traits, both due to decreasing concentrations in oldest leaves and substantial increases in the youngest leaves.</p><p id="P47">Corresponding to the gradients in defence, we found a gradient in foliar protein concentrations of six-week-old plants, with youngest leaves containing nearly twice as much protein as the oldest leaves. In C3 plants, the photosynthesis-involved enzyme rubisco accounts for up to 65% of soluble leaf proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Ellis 1979</xref>), thus younger leaves on <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> not only contain a substantial fraction of total plant nitrogen, but likely also represent the most efficient photosynthetic tissues. The relative value of leaves is continuously changing throughout plant development, but the youngest leaves are generally considered to be the most valuable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Harper 1989</xref>). Younger leaves tend to be positioned highest within a plant’s canopy where they are least affected by self-shading, and young leaves usually have the highest photosynthetic rates of all leaves on a plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bielczynski <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). In consequence, the loss of younger leaves is generally more detrimental for plant fitness than loss of older leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Barto &amp; Cipollini 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P48">Leaf value is further determined by the growth stage of the plant, particularly for annual plants which are limited to a single vegetation period. For these plants, theoretical models predict an abrupt and complete shift from vegetative to reproductive growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cohen 1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">1976</xref>), which matches experimental findings of strong reductions in vegetative growth of annual plants after initiation of flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Guilbaud <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>). Whereas a plant in its vegetative growth phase can relatively easily replace lost leaf tissue, any leaves lost on a flowering plant are thus expected to have substantially more severe fitness costs. Indeed, young leaves on <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants at the transition to flowering were found to be the most valuable for seed production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Barto &amp; Cipollini 2005</xref>). Taken together, our results thus match the predictions of ODT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">McKey 1974</xref>), with a weaker gradient in defence allocation for vegetative four-week-old plants, which then transitioned to a very steep defence gradient corresponding to the increasing value of younger leaves in early-reproductive six-week-old plants.</p><p id="P49">Gradients in defence were particularly apparent in six-week-old plants due to the significant reduction of defence concentrations in older leaves. This reduction in defence was accompanied by substantial changes in carbohydrate content, where we found the oldest leaves to have depleted starch reserves but still contain high concentrations of soluble monosaccharides. High concentrations of free sugars are a characteristic trait of senescing leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Wingler &amp; Roitsch 2008</xref>), and indeed, low protein content and an observed lack of green colouration of the oldest leaves on six-week-old plants suggests that these leaves were in the process of nutrient re-mobilization and senescence. The very low concentration of defensive compounds thus was most likely the result of re-mobilization and transport as well. Glucosinolates are known to be substantially decreased in senescing leaves of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Brown <italic>et al</italic>. 2003</xref>), and there is active transport of these compounds via the phloem from mature leaves to inflorescences and fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Brudenell <italic>et al</italic>. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Chen <italic>et al</italic>. 2001</xref>). Cardenolides have likewise shown to be transported from mature leaves to other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Alani <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>), with our results suggesting almost complete re-mobilization of these compounds during leaf senescence as a potential cost saving strategy.</p><p id="P50">Larvae of the diamondback moth <italic>P. xylostella</italic> remain one of a small set of herbivores that continue to feed on <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> under natural conditions, despite the plant’s novel cardenolide defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Mertens <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Wang <italic>et al</italic>. 2023</xref>).

Caterpillars crawling back up the plant would therefore first encounter the lower leaves and may choose to feed there for convenience rather than preference. However, at least for six-week-old plants, we could confirm preference for and increased performance on older leaves using both no-choice assays on whole plants and choice assays on detached leaves.</p><p id="P51">Given the low protein concentrations of older <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> leaves, the observed preference for and improved performance on older leaves is unlikely a result of nutritional quality.

We therefore expected caterpillar preference and performance to be directly affected by the substantially increased levels of defensive traits in younger leaves. In leaves of <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic>, we found concentrations of cardenolides and glucosinolates to co-vary with trichome density, thus a separation of effects in natural plants is challenging. By using a novel <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> CRISPR/Cas9 knockout mutant that lacks cardenolides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Younkin <italic>et al</italic>. 2024</xref>), we attempted to causally link the observed herbivore preference to cardenolide concentrations, but surprisingly, herbivore preference for older leaves was unaffected by the removal of these defences. In further support of this negative result, addition of the defences to broccoli leaf discs, either by applying crude solvent extracts from young leaves, or even pure compounds at concentrations found in young leaves, failed to repel feeding by <italic>P. xylostella</italic>.

While trichomes on leaves of <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic> were considered to be an unlikely factor in resistance against <italic>P. xylostella</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Puentes &amp; Ågren 2013</xref>), trichomes of <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> are substantially more dense and might therefore be more relevant. With the development of new CRISPR/Cas9 mutants, causal evaluation of glucosinolates, myrosinase activity, and trichomes in the defence of <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> may be feasible soon. In the meantime, it is clear that <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> co-expresses several measurable and perhaps additional unmeasured traits to form an elaborate defence syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Agrawal &amp; Fishbein 2006</xref>), with its highest expression in the youngest, most valuable leaves.</p><p id="P56">Cardenolides are potent chemical defences in other plant systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Agrawal <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>), and in <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> they are causally linked to the complete avoidance of the plant by several herbivore species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Younkin <italic>et al</italic>. 2024</xref>). As part of its defence syndrome, <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic> co-expresses cardenolide compounds with glucosinolates and trichomes, and appears to accurately tailor expression of the novel defence to match the relative value of different organs, including an eventual re-mobilization of these defences to floral tissues and seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Alani <italic>et al</italic>. 2021</xref>). Interestingly, we discovered distinct patterns in the regulation of individual cardenolide compounds, which match the compound-specific regulation of glucosinolate compounds during plant maturation and flowering in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Strauss <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>). While we currently lack an understanding of the importance of structural variation among cardenolides of <italic>E. cheiranthoides</italic>, evidence from other plant systems suggests that such variation may indeed be adaptive against some herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Petschenka <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P57">In conclusion, we found that within-plant variation of a novel chemical defence mirrors that of other chemical and physical traits to prioritize defence of the most valuable plant tissues. Concerted expression and regulation of multiple costly defences within-plant thus provides additional evidence for the non-redundancy of these traits in plant defence. Even though cardenolides may not be an effective defence against all herbivore species, these compounds nonetheless appear to be important components of a carefully regulated plant defence system that provides protection against a diverse community of herbivores.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Methods</label><media xlink:href="EMS199836-supplement-Supplementary_Methods.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d5aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Broti Biswas and Laura Dällenbach for help with insect rearing and insect assays, and Rayko Jonas and Markus Meierhofer for help with plant production for experiments.
