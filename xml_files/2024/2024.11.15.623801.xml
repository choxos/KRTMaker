Its sparse intrinsic synaptic connectivity allows long-range projections to modulate its activity. Some of these projections arise from the cerebral cortex, which is known to influence feeding. However, the functional and anatomical organization of cortico-hypothalamic pathways have remained poorly studied. We used anatomical and optogenetic mapping to show that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is the strongest cortical input source to the LH, followed by a lateral associative region including the insular cortex (IC), and the ventral subiculum. Input from the mPFC and IC had markedly different synaptic dynamics and were integrated supralinearly. IC input surpassed that of the mPFC in a subpopulation of highly excitable dorsal LH neurons which had a strong h-current. Input from the mPFC showed selective targeting to LH neurons which project back to the mPFC, suggesting the existence of a direct feedback loop. Overall, these results identify a direct prefrontal hypothalamic pathway which is poised to dominate rapid cortical control of hypothalamic activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is a crucial regulator of arousal, energy balance, and motivated behaviours such as feeding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Given the sparse local synaptic connectivity within the LH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, external inputs can strongly influence the firing rates of LH neurons, particularly at rapid behavioural timescales. One important set of direct inputs arises from the cerebral cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.

These and experimentally induced cortical effects on feeding are likely mediated, at least in part, through direct projections to the LH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, which is a key controller of food consumption <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.

To understand the mechanisms underlying cortical control of hypothalamic feeding networks, we set out to study the circuit architecture of cortico-hypothalamic pathways using a combination of retrograde tracing and channelrhodopsin assisted circuit mapping <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">We found that cortical output neurons were in the pyramidal layer of the subiculum and in layers 5 and 6 of associative cortices, and had an excitatory effect on LH neurons that was monosynaptic. The mPFC innervated the highest proportion of LH neurons, followed by the IC, ventral subiculum (vSub), ectorhinal cortex (ECT), and dorsal subiculum (dSub). To find out how LH neurons integrate input across time and across cortical pathways, we assessed the effect of stimulus trains and used dual channel optogenetics to probe the mPFC and IC pathways simultaneously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Unlike the mPFC pathway, the IC pathway exhibited synaptic facilitation and targeted a more defined dorsolateral population within the LH. Interestingly, we observed supralinear integration in a subset of LH neurons that receive input from both of these cortical sources. In addition, a subpopulation of highly excitable dorsal LH neurons preferentially received IC rather than mPFC input, while mPFC input was preferentially targeted at LH neurons which send axons to the PFC.</p><p id="P6">Our results reveal shared features across cortico-hypothalamic pathways, such as monosynaptic excitation originating from pyramidal neurons, and distinct characteristics like synaptic dynamics and selective targeting of specific LH subpopulations. This lays the groundwork for future studies into control of motivated behaviours, such as feeding, by cortical circuits.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Retrograde tracing identifies cortical populations as potential sources of hypothalamic input</title><p id="P7">To explore which cortical populations project to the LH, we used the retrograde tracer Cholera Toxin Subunit-B (CTb) conjugated to Alexa Fluorophore (647 or 555). We injected small quantities (30 nl) into the LH (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for injection coordinates and details), and harvested brains 7-10 days later to assess ipsilateral retrograde labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-B</xref>; N = 3). We observed substantial retrograde labelling in several brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 C-L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Our primary focus was on cortical populations, however for comparative purposes, we analysed key subcortical regions known to project to the LH, finding dense labelling in the amygdala (AMY; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>), nucleus accumbens (NAc; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>) and lateral septum (LS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Within the isocortex, extensive labelling was observed in the mPFC, predominantly in the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) areas, with sparser labelling in the anterior cingulate (AC) area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). As the overall population of labelled neurons in the cortex was continuous across anatomical boundaries and adjacent coronal sections, we generated a 3D rendering from one hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1L</xref>). From the mPFC, the labelled population extended ventrally into the olfactory cortex, including the taenia tecta (TT) and dorsal peduncular area (DP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C&amp;I</xref>), and caudally into the LS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The labelled population also continued laterally from the IL, DP and TT into orbital areas (ORB; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>), extending further into the claustrum (CLA) and the IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-E, H</xref>), and caudally to the ECT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F-G</xref>). Labelling in all neocortical regions was primarily restricted to layers 5 and 6, which is comprised mostly of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Additionally, dense labelling was detected in the hippocampal formation, with neurons observed in the pyramidal layer of the dorsal subiculum (dSub), extending ventrally to include the ventral subiculum (vSub) and the CA1 situated between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The density of labelling in IL and the PL was comparable to that observed in the LS, suggesting that neocortical inputs to the LH may be as substantial as inputs from traditionally recognized subcortical input hubs like the LS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Divergent cortical inputs to the LH: mPFC dominance and specialized features of IC inputs</title><p id="P11">Retrograde tracers are taken up at axons terminating in the injected area but also by (damaged) fibres <italic>en passage</italic>.

To confirm functional synaptic inputs from the anatomically identified cortico-hypothalamic pathways, we performed channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM; <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>). We injected 100 nl of AAV1-hSyn-ChR2-YFP into one cortical region at a time, allowing for photostimulation of their axon terminals within the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for injection coordinates and details).</p><p id="P12">We recorded excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in response to cortical inputs from the mPFC, IC, ECT, dSub, and vSub in LH neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). The IC extends along the rostrocaudal axis and is typically divided into anterior (aIC) and posterior (pIC) regions, each with distinct projection patterns <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Based on previous tracing results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>), we targeted caudal aIC and rostral pIC with separate injections and performed an additional multi-injection across the rostrocaudal extent to encompass the full projection population (-IC-; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2B-E</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To assess whether responses were monosynaptic, we applied tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Any optically evoked EPSP persisting in the presence of TTX and 4-AP is attributed to direct activation of ChR2 at the presynaptic terminal, rather than disynaptic input. All tested postsynaptic responses persisted with TTX and 4-AP (mPFC: n=9/9; IC: n=6/6; vSub: n=4/4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>).

Although TTX+4-AP typically reduces response efficacy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, some studies have also reported increases under similar conditions in other circuits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.

Anterograde tracing showed that dSub axons were primarily localized in the fornix, consistent with potential retrograde tracer take-up by fibres of passage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3D</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Stimulation of mPFC terminals resulted in larger EPSP amplitudes to the first pulse of 10Hz trains compared to the IC (U<sub>mPFC-IC</sub> = 1611, adj-p = 0.025) and specifically the aIC (U<sub>mPFC-aIC</sub> = 1362, adj-p = 0.016, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). However, while the amplitude to the first EPSP was larger for mPFC input, no difference between regions was observed when considering the maximum EPSP amplitude from the train (χ2 (6, n = 85) = 10.54, p = 0.104; not shown). No differences were observed in EPSP latency across cortical injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>; χ<sup>2</sup> (6, n = 84) = 11.47, p = 0.075).</p><p id="P16">Responses to these inputs displayed distinct synaptic dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). The paired-pulse ratio (EPSP5/EPSP1) was higher for IC and aIC inputs compared to mPFC inputs, indicating facilitation of responses to insular inputs (U<sub>mPFC-aIC</sub> = 1063, adj-p = 0.014; U<sub>mPFC-IC</sub> = 1207, adj-p = 0.017; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H-I</xref>).

However, mPFC axons occupied a larger overall area compared to IC axons (F (1, 20) = 57.91, p &lt; 0.001), which were more restricted to a specialized domain located dorsally (F (1, 20) = 5.40, p = 0.031) and laterally (F (1, 20) = 25.74, p &lt; 0.001) relative to mPFC fibres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4E</xref>). These findings suggest that different cortical regions contribute uniquely to LH innervation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>A subpopulation of LH neurons receives convergent mPFC and IC inputs and integrates them supralinearly</title><p id="P18">Given the differences in anatomical organization between mPFC and IC fibres and their synaptic dynamics, we next asked if they innervate distinct LH neurons. To investigate this, we used a dual-channel optogenetics strategy where each cortical area expressed either the blue-shifted opsin Chronos or the red-shifted ChrimsonR, which can be independently activated by separate light wavelengths <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Chronos is activated by blue (470 nm) light, while ChrimsonR responds to red (590 nm) light but can also be excited by 470 nm light at higher intensities. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a 470 nm light power range that reliably excites Chronos but not ChrimsonR.</p><p id="P19">To validate this approach, we first injected ChrimsonR and Chronos into separate animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> for injection coordinates and details). We recorded AP firing in ChrimsonR- or Chronos-expressing neurons at the injection site in response to 470 nm and 590 nm stimulation across a range of light intensities. As expected, 590 nm light stimulation evoked APs in ChrimsonR-expressing neurons but not in those expressing Chronos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B-D</xref>). However, the 470 nm irradiance required to achieve 95-100% firing probability in Chronos-expressing neurons also induced APs in ChrimsonR expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B &amp; E</xref>), as well as EPSCs in LH neurons in animals only expressing ChrimsonR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5F-J</xref>). Despite some Chronos-expressing neurons firing at lower light intensities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C-E</xref>), the selective activation range without triggering ChrimsonR was suboptimal, with a firing probability of only 83% (± 16% SEM). Notably, lower intensity 470 nm light still induced small EPSCs in the LH of ChrimsonR animals with up to 25% probability. Therefore, we used a high 470 nm irradiance and sequential photostimulation to desensitize ChrimsonR with a 250 ms 590 nm pulse prior to 470 nm light stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5K-L</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">We then injected ChrimsonR and Chronos into the mPFC and IC, reversing the injection sites in separate experiments to control for opsin-related effects on synaptic dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Bilateral injections were made at multiple locations in the mPFC and IC to ensure coverage of the projection populations. Using the desensitization strategy, ChrimsonR-mediated responses to blue light were suppressed while preserving the postsynaptic responses to Chronos, enabling categorization of LH neurons as responsive exclusively to ChrimsonR, Chronos, both opsins, or neither (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B-D</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Most neurons received input from the mPFC, either exclusively or in combination with IC inputs (n=36/45; 80%). 33.3% of neurons (15/45) integrated inputs from both mPFC and IC, while 46.7% (21/45) received input exclusively from the mPFC, and 8.9% (4/45) received input exclusively from the IC. The occurrence of cells with both mPFC and IC inputs did not significantly differ from a chance overlap (χ<sup>2</sup> (3, n = 45) = 0.02, p = 0.880), consistent with independent targeting by mPFC and IC inputs.</p><p id="P22">We compared EPSC parameters using generalized linear mixed-effects models, controlling for the effects of opsin type (Chronos vs. ChrimsonR), injection site (mPFC vs. IC), and their interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E-H</xref>). EPSCs evoked by mPFC stimulation exhibited significantly larger amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>; F(1, 86) = 4.02, p = 0.048), shorter latencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>; F(1, 51) = 7.13, p = 0.010), and faster rise times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref>; F(1, 49) = 4.07, p=0.029) compared to those evoked by IC stimulation.

To do this, we compared the summed separate responses to mPFC and IC stimulation to the response to simultaneous dual-colour stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>). If the inputs are integrated linearly, the response to simultaneous stimulation should equal the sum of the separate responses, resulting in a ratio (Dual stimulation / Sum) of 1 while supralinear integration would yield a ratio greater than 1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.

There was no significant difference in the proportion of sEPSCs smaller than the oEPSCs between both neuron types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6H</xref>). The similarity in amplitude between oEPSCs and sEPSCs is consistent with a sparse synaptic distribution, suggesting that, although cortical inputs in the LH are abundant, they likely involve only a limited number of synapses. Notably, there was considerable variability in oEPSC amplitude and relative strength across neurons, potentially reflecting cell-specific differences in cortical input strength, which could be modulated by learning processes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">Together, these findings indicate that LH neurons are distinctly sensitive to cortical inputs, integrating them based on a preference independent of overall excitatory drive but reflected in their intrinsic properties: IC-preferring neurons in the dorsal LH exhibit increased excitability due a stronger voltage sag and PIR, which can lead to burst firing output <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>mPFC, but not IC, projections preferentially target reciprocally connected LH neurons</title><p id="P29">The LH projects to various downstream and upstream targets, and previous tracing work has suggested the LH is connected reciprocally with most of these targets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.

In addition, our findings suggest that mPFC inputs arise from a pool of neurons comparable in density to well-known subcortical inputs from the LS.</p><p id="P34">Anatomical connections from mPFC, IC and vSub have been verified previously across unrelated electrophysiological studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. In this study we confirmed one new pathway from ECT and showed that the anatomically labelled pathway from dSub is functionally extremely weak and likely formed mostly of fibres of passage. Importantly, we were able to compare the synaptic strength, axonal distribution, innervation density and synaptic dynamics among these pathways. When compared to inputs from the mPFC the inputs from the IC, particularly aIC, had more facilitating dynamics. This suggests that while mPFC inputs are initially powerful, IC inputs require higher frequencies. In addition, we showed that while mPFC and IC inputs are summed supralinearly in a subpopulation of neurons, neurons are differentially sensitive to each cortical channel. Input sensitivity correlated with other cellular properties suggesting the following: IC-preferring cells have elevated excitability, and strongly mPFC-recipient cells tend to project back to the mPFC.</p><sec id="S9"><title>Local integration of monosynaptic excitatory input from the mPFC and the IC</title><p id="P35">We observed monosynaptic EPSPs consistent with the distribution of cortico-hypothalamic projections neurons in layers 5/6, which is comprised mostly of excitatory pyramidal tract and cortico-thalamic pyramidal neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Cortical projections are also known to reach the LH indirectly via GABAergic input from subcortical structures such as LS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, CeA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> and the NAc <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>, which are thought to integrate various cortical inputs prior to relaying information to the LH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. Our findings, for the first time, show that LH cells can integrate direct excitatory input from the mPFC and IC locally. These inputs sum supralinearly, meaning that, when temporally aligned, their combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual contributions. Together, these findings suggest that the fastest way the cortex can influence behaviours through the LH is by exciting LH neurons. This mechanism may account for rapid sensory responses of LH neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. The supralinear integration also implies that synchronized mPFC and IC activity could robustly drive LH neurons. Future in vivo studies should investigate whether these inputs are synchronized during behaviour and examine how the LH integrates these with inhibitory subcortical inputs. Clarifying these interactions will shed light on the broader significance of cortical and subcortical influences on LH function.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Novel insights into the organization of cortico-hypothalamic circuits</title><p id="P36">mPFC and IC inputs to the LH displayed distinct synaptic dynamics and innervated partially overlapping domains, suggesting functional specialization of these circuits.

These IC-preferring neurons had elevated excitability through a hyperpolarization-activated transient current (Ih) and post-inhibitory rebound depolarization. The Ih current may allow these cells to fire bursts in vivo, potentially enabling rhythmic firing patterns <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Moreover, post-inhibitory rebound makes these neurons particularly responsive after subcortical inhibition, possibly from topographically colocalized inputs from the central amygdala <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>, which could modulate their activity depending on timing.</p><p id="P38">Unlike IC axons, mPFC axons were indiscriminately distributed and formed synapses with most LH neurons. Innervated LH neurons had mixed intrinsic characteristics consistent with multiple cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. There was also marked variance in EPSP amplitude among mPFC recipient cells. While some of this response variability may stem from technical factors, such as detection limitations in distal dendrites, EPSP amplitude is also known to be actively regulated in specific subpopulations in response to conditions like cocaine exposure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>, high fat diet <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>, and stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Our findings are consistent with recent work showing that mPFC inputs are non-selective for several canonical LH subtypes including MCH, Orx, GABA and vGLUT2 neurons, but can modulate specific subpopulations under behaviourally relevant conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. It is therefore likely that specialized ensembles of target-specific mPFC→LH projection neurons are required to activate specific behaviours. This complicates interpretation of average activity recording data such as fibre photometry in the mPFC→LH population and may obscure distinct behavioural contributions in opto- or chemogenetic manipulation experiments.</p><p id="P39">Specialized ensembles may be reflected in the projection target of LH neurons. Our combined retrograde and anterograde experiment revealed that strongly mPFC-recipient cells tended to project back to the mPFC, suggesting a direct feedback mechanism.
