Here, we characterize the mechanisms that drive the formation of these structures and their function in gene regulation in a lymphoid-to-myeloid differentiation system. Based on analyses at base-pair resolution, we demonstrate a close correlation between binding of regulatory proteins, formation of chromatin interactions, and gene expression. Integration of single-allele topologies and computational modeling shows that tissue-specific gene loci are organized into chromatin hubs, characterized by cooperative interactions between multiple enhancers, promoters, and CTCF-binding sites. Depletion of CTCF strongly impairs the formation of these structures, but has mild effects on gene expression, which can be explained by rewired enhancer-promoter interactions. This demonstrates an instructive role for enhancer-promoter interactions in gene regulation that is independent of cooperative interactions in chromatin hubs. Together, these results contribute to a mechanistic understanding of the structure-function relationship of the genome during cellular differentiation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Precise spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression during differentiation and development is dependent on the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of the genome, which include enhancers and promoters. Active enhancers recruit transcription factors and coactivators, which stimulate assembly and activation of the transcription machinery at gene promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Since mammalian enhancers can be separated by large genomic distances from their target gene promoters, enhancers interact with promoters in three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structures to activate gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Interactions between enhancers and promoters predominantly occur within Topologically Associating Domains (TADs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. TADs are relatively insulated regions of the genome that are demarcated by CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) and formed by loop extrusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. During this process, Cohesin complexes reel in the chromatin fiber and thereby form progressively larger loops, until they encounter CTCF molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Although the general importance of loop extrusion for gene regulation remains unclear, it has been shown that loop extrusion contributes to the formation and specificity of (long-range) enhancer-promoter interactions in some contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. In addition, affinity between transcription factors and coactivators bound at enhancers and promoters is thought to have a role in the formation of specific interactions between these elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that these interactions form in the context of (phase-separated) nuclear condensates, which are dependent on multivalent interactions between the intrinsically disordered regions of transcription factors, coactivators and/or RNA molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>; this model remains debated, however, as it is difficult to test <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Although our understanding of the 3D structures into which the genome is organized has advanced over the last decades, the relationship between genome structure and function remains unclear. In particular, it is incompletely understood when and how enhancer-promoter interactions form during cellular differentiation and how they influence gene expression. The structure-function relationship of the genome has been studied in several developmental contexts, including early embryonic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, lineage specification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, limb development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, erythroid differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, neuronal differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, cardiac differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, macrophage differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, adipocyte differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, epidermal differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, and cellular reprogramming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. These studies have identified both instructive enhancer-promoters interactions, which co-occur with active gene expression, and permissive interactions, which are formed prior to gene activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. However, since these studies are based on relatively low-resolution analysis of interactions between enhancers and promoters and do not take their 3D configuration in higher-order structures into consideration, the precise relationship between enhancer-promoter interactions and gene activation, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms, remain poorly understood. In addition, it is not clear whether permissive, pre-formed interactions represent a distinct mode of enhancer-mediated gene activation or reflect instructive enhancer-promoter interactions that are dependent on subtle changes during cellular differentiation that cannot be detected with low-resolution analyses. Importantly, it has recently been demonstrated that small changes in genome structure can have a big effect of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. A better understanding of the structure-function relationship of the genome during cellular differentiation therefore requires analysis at very high resolution and sensitivity. In addition, the integration of perturbations during differentiation could facilitate causal inference and identification of the molecular mechanisms involved.</p><p id="P4">The analysis of enhancer-promoter interactions in the above-mentioned studies is based on Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) techniques, which rely on digestion and subsequent proximity ligation of crosslinked chromatin to detect spatial proximity between DNA sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. The resolution of 3C predominantly depends on the digestion and sequencing strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. By combining digestion with micrococcal nuclease (MNase), which cuts the genome largely independent of DNA sequence, with deep, targeted sequencing of multiplexed viewpoints of interest, the recently developed Micro-Capture-C (MCC) method supports 3C analysis at single base-pair resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Despite their superior resolution, MCC data cannot resolve how <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements interact together in higher-order 3D chromatin structures, because MCC is based on the detection of pair-wise interactions in a cell population and therefore cannot distinguish simultaneous, cooperative interactions in individual cells from mutually exclusive interactions that occur independently in different cells. 3D relationships between multiple <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements can be disentangled by multi-way 3C techniques, in which multiple interactions derived from individual alleles are captured within (relatively) long sequencing reads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, and by ligation-free techniques based on physical separation and labeling of crosslinked chromatin interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Among these, the Tri-C method provides an effective approach to study multi-way enhancer-promoter interactions during cellular differentiation, since it allows for targeted analysis of multiplexed viewpoints of interest at a relatively high resolution (&gt;500 bp)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. So far, Tri-C and other targeted multi-way techniques have only been used to study a few genetic loci and have not been combined with perturbations of regulatory proteins to study the mechanisms underlying multi-way chromatin interactions. In addition, neither MCC nor Tri-C have been applied throughout subsequent stages of differentiation and development.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we characterize the structure-function relationship of the genome during lymphoid-to-myeloid differentiation in detail. To this end, we combine analysis of nascent gene expression, chromatin accessibility, binding of regulatory proteins, and chromatin interactions detected by MCC and Tri-C. Integrative analyses of these data show the dynamic formation and dissolution of pair-wise and cooperative multi-way interactions between enhancers, promoters and CBSs during cellular differentiation. Further experiments after auxin-induced CTCF depletion and computational modeling show that CTCF is not required for the formation of pair-wise enhancer-promoter interactions, but essential for the formation of chromatin hubs during cellular differentiation. CTCF depletion therefore allows us to separate the function of pair-wise enhancer-promoter interactions and chromatin hubs. With this approach, we demonstrate that gene regulation during cellular differentiation is instructed by pair-wise enhancer-promoter interactions, but not dependent on cooperative interactions between multiple enhancers and promoters in CTCF-dependent chromatin hubs. Together, these results provide important new insights into the relationship between genome structure and function during cellular differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Chromatin architecture through lymphoid-to-myeloid differentiation</title><p id="P6">To study the structure-function relationship of the genome, we characterized several structural and functional genomic features during a lymphoid-to-myeloid differentiation trajectory. To this end, we used a B-cell leukemia cell line (BLaER1) that can be efficiently converted into functional induced macrophages (iMacs) by exogenous expression of the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) over the course of 168 h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Characterization of this system by qPCR and FACS shows that cellular differentiation occurs synchronously and completely, with &gt;90% of B-cells converting into iMacs over the differentiation course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Previous studies have analyzed nascent RNA synthesis by TT-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>; chromatin accessibility by ATAC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>; the distribution of H3K27ac and CTCF by ChIP-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>; and genome organization by Hi-C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> during BLaER1 differentiation. We complemented these data by mapping the binding profiles of Mediator and Cohesin using an optimized ChIPmentation protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 72 h, and 96 h after differentiation induction (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>; later timepoints were omitted, as iMacs are quiescent). In addition, we generated base-pair resolution MCC interaction profiles from the viewpoints of 53 B-cell-specific and iMac-specific gene promoters at 0 h, 24 h, and 96 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1c-e</xref>, and <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>).</p><p id="P7">Integration of these high-resolution data provides insight into the timing of regulatory events and their relationship during cellular differentiation. The <italic>TRIB1</italic> locus, which encodes an ubiquitin ligase adapter protein with a critical role in macrophage differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, provides a representative example of a locus that is activated during BLaER1 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). Our data show that the activation of <italic>TRIB1</italic> is associated with a gradual increase in accessibility and occupancy of H3K27ac, Mediator, and Cohesin at regulatory regions, whereas CTCF binding is generally more stable. As previously described, we observe strong Cohesin accumulation at CBSs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> and slightly weaker Cohesin enrichment at Mediator-bound sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. In addition, we observe changes in the structural conformation of the locus during differentiation, which involve a gradual increase in chromatin interactions between the <italic>TRIB1</italic> promoter and putative enhancer elements, CBSs, and other promoters in a ∼600 kb TAD. The high-resolution and punctate nature of the MCC data facilitate systematic calling of chromatin interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Quantification of these interactions across the targeted loci shows that the described interaction pattern for the <italic>TRIB1</italic> locus is characteristic for upregulated loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The <italic>MYB</italic> oncogene locus, which encodes a B-cell-associated transcription factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, provides a representative example of a locus that is de-activated during BLaER1 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>). Downregulation of <italic>MYB</italic> is associated with a reduction in chromatin accessibility, H3K27ac, and Mediator and Cohesin binding at putative enhancer elements in the ∼400 kb TAD. The interactions between the <italic>MYB</italic> promoter and these decommissioned elements gradually decrease as the cells transition into iMacs. Systematic quantification of chromatin interactions across the targeted loci shows a similar pattern for other downregulated loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). However, in contrast to upregulated loci, we do not observe consistent changes in promoter interactions with CBSs and other promoters in downregulated loci during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The <italic>TRIB1</italic> and <italic>MYB</italic> interaction patterns suggest that the temporal dynamics of gaining and losing Mediator and Cohesin binding at enhancer elements correspond closely to the strengthening and weakening of enhancer-promoter interactions over the course of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). Quantification of these patterns across all targeted loci shows a strong correlation between differential binding levels of Mediator and Cohesin and enhancer-promoter interaction frequencies, signified by correlation coefficients of 0.81 and 0.85, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h,i</xref>). Interestingly, we find that H3K27ac and enhancer RNA (eRNA) levels, which are more commonly used as proxies for enhancer activity, have a weaker correlation with enhancer-promoter interactions, with coefficients of 0.59 and 0.50, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1f,g</xref>). This might be explained by a lower precision and dynamic range of H3K27ac as compared to Mediator and Cohesin binding and technical challenges in robustly identifying eRNA levels.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Interaction patterns across classes of <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements</title><p id="P10">Many of the gene promoters that we targeted for MCC analysis have a CBS within 5 kb. It has previously been suggested that such promoter-proximal CBSs (ppCBSs) promote long-range enhancer-promoter communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. However, the interaction patterns of ppCBSs have not been described, as they cannot be distinguished from those of promoters by most 3C techniques. Since MCC supports base-pair resolution analysis, we leveraged this approach to compare the interaction profiles from the viewpoints of promoters and ppCBSs (if present) in the targeted loci over the course of lymphoid-to-myeloid differentiation. In addition, we generated interaction profiles from the viewpoint of CBSs located at the boundaries of TADs (bCBSs) in all selected loci.</p><p id="P11">The <italic>NFKBIZ</italic> locus, which encodes a regulator of NF-κB signaling that has a role in controlling macrophage functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>, provides a representative example of an upregulated locus with distinct interaction patterns for the promoter, ppCBS, and bCBS viewpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>); the <italic>ARL4C</italic> locus, which is highly expressed in B-cells, provides a representative example of a downregulated locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2a,b</xref>). In the <italic>NFKBIZ</italic> locus, we observe the gradual formation of relatively long-range enhancer-promoter interactions during differentiation. To investigate the relationship between the presence of a ppCBS and long-range enhancer-promoter communication, we compared the distance distribution of enhancers interacting with gene promoters with and without a ppCBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2c</xref>). This analysis confirms that promoters with a ppCBS form interactions with enhancers over larger distances compared to promoters without a ppCBS. In addition, we compared the frequencies of long-range (&gt;150 kb) enhancer-promoter interactions to enhancer-promoter interactions across all distances in loci with and without a ppCBS over the differentiation course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). This analysis shows that genes without a ppCBS form stronger interactions with enhancers overall compared to genes with a ppCBS. These interactions are present to some degree in B-cells and further strengthen over the differentiation course. In contrast, the loci containing ppCBSs form stronger long-range interactions, which are not pre-established and form specifically during differentiation.</p><p id="P12">The interaction profiles from the ppCBS viewpoint in the <italic>NFKBIZ</italic> locus show that the ppCBS forms interactions with the enhancers in the region, although these are weaker compared to the promoter viewpoint, and with other CBSs in the region, which are stronger compared to the promoter viewpoint. The bCBS viewpoint most strongly interacts with the CBSs at the other TAD boundary, but also forms weak interactions with the enhancers and promoters in the region. These interactions all gradually increase over the differentiation course. Systematic quantification of chromatin interactions in the targeted loci shows a similar pattern across the upregulated loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>) and the reverse in the downregulated loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2d,e</xref>). Comparison of these data to the interaction patterns of gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>) shows that promoter interactions are generally more dynamic over the differentiation course compared to ppCBS and especially bCBS interactions. For a more direct comparison of interaction patterns across the classes of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, we calculated changes in the relative proportions of interactions over the differentiation course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2f</xref>). This comparison shows that enhancers interact more strongly with ppCBSs than with bCBSs, which suggests that ppCBSs may have a direct role in bringing enhancers in the vicinity of gene promoters. In addition, these analyses indicate that promoters, ppCBSs, and bCBSs interact promiscuously with active <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements within TADs, although they do have distinct preferences for specific types of elements. The common feature at these <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements is enrichment of Cohesin, suggesting a role for loop extrusion in mediating these interactions. In line with this hypothesis, we find that differential Cohesin binding correlates well with the interaction frequencies between CBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g,h</xref>), with coefficients of 0.6. These correlations are lower compared to enhancer-promoter interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>), which may be explained by the larger dynamic range in interactions between enhancers and promoters through differentiation compared to CBSs. Of note, we find that CBS interaction frequencies correlate better with Cohesin binding than with CTCF binding itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2g,h</xref>), which is in agreement with the more constitutive binding patterns of CTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1c,d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Dynamic chromatin hub formation and dissolution during differentiation</title><p id="P13">The MCC data show complex interaction patterns involving multiple promoters, enhancers, and CBSs in the targeted regions. However, since MCC is based on the detection of pair-wise interactions, these data cannot resolve how these elements interact together in higher-order 3D chromatin structures. To analyze 3D interactions between <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, we used the Tri-C technique to measure multi-way interactions in the 53 targeted regions of interest. Tri-C uses the restriction enzyme <italic>Nla</italic>III for chromatin digestion and requires the restriction fragments at the targeted viewpoints to be relatively small (&lt;300 bp) to facilitate efficient detection of multiple interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. To assess multi-way enhancer-promoter interactions, we therefore targeted enhancers instead of promoters, as this provides more flexibility to select suitable viewpoints. In addition to enhancers, we targeted bCBSs in the selected regions. The Tri-C interactions are represented in viewpoint-specific contact matrices, in which the frequencies with which two additional chromatin fragments are captured jointly with the viewpoint are plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Mutually exclusive interactions are depleted from these matrices, whereas preferential simultaneous interactions between <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements in higher-order structures are visible as enrichments at the intersections between these elements. Note that these matrices typically show strong signals along the proximity-excluded region at the viewpoint, which represent viewpoint-proximal interactions throughout the targeted region. Since regions in close linear proximity are expected to form strong interactions, these stripe patterns do not represent specific higher-order chromatin conformations.</p><p id="P14">The <italic>CCR1</italic> locus, which encodes a chemokine receptor that is highly expressed in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, and the <italic>RAG2</italic> locus, which encodes an enzyme involved in VDJ recombination in B-cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>, provide representative examples of the establishment and dissolution of higher-order chromatin structures through lymphoid-to-myeloid differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b-e</xref>). At the <italic>CCR1</italic> locus, we observe the formation of a hub structure, characterized by simultaneous interactions between the enhancer viewpoint, the <italic>CCR1</italic> promoter, and other enhancer clusters in the region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <bold>top matrix, cyan circles</bold>). Interestingly, we observe that the CBSs in the region are also included in these hubs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <bold>top matrix, magenta circles</bold>). The contact matrices from the viewpoint of the CBS at the downstream boundary of the <italic>CCR1</italic> TAD confirm the cooperative interactions between the promoter, enhancers, and CBSs in chromatin hubs in the <italic>CCR1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <bold>bottom matrix, magenta circles</bold>). Both the enhancer and the CBS viewpoint in the <italic>CCR1</italic> locus show that these chromatin hubs form gradually over the differentiation course. Tri-C data in the <italic>NFKBIZ</italic> and <italic>TRIB1</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>) and quantification of the multi-way chromatin interactions across all upregulated loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f,g</xref>) show a similar pattern of gradual chromatin hub formation. Analysis of the CBS contact matrices across the targeted loci shows that these are characterized by distinct interaction foci as well as stripes that emanate from CBSs throughout the region and likely represent active loop extrusion by Cohesin molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>).

In absence of CTCF, the formation of cooperative interactions between the targeted enhancers and other <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in the region is impaired. Unsurprisingly, cooperative interactions that involve a CBS are most strongly reduced. However, interestingly, cooperative interactions involving only enhancers and promoters are also notably decreased. It is important to note that the loss of these interactions is unlikely to reflect changes in the distribution of the pair-wise interactions with the targeted enhancer viewpoint, since the MCC data show that enhancer-promoter interactions remain relatively stable (and in some cases even increase) after CTCF depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b-e</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We used molecular dynamics simulations of 3D chromatin folding in the <italic>CCR1</italic>, <italic>NFKBIZ</italic>, and <italic>TRIB1</italic> loci to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of CTCF depletion. We built on our existing modeling framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup> to model a 2 Mbp region around each of these three genes. From these models, we extracted multi-way interactions with the same enhancers that were used as Tri-C viewpoints and produced contact matrices that closely resemble the experimental Tri-C results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5a-c</xref>). In presence of CTCF, the targeted enhancers engage in multi-way interactions involving both their cognate gene promoter and other enhancers, as well as CBSs. Removal of CTCF from the models fully reproduces the impairment of chromatin hub formation across these loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-f</xref>). Our models therefore allow us to investigate the underlying mechanisms by interrogating the distribution and net flow of extruding Cohesin molecules in the three loci. Consistent with the Cohesin ChIPmentation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e,i</xref>), the model shows that Cohesin accumulates strongly at CBSs and weakly at active enhancers and promoters in control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d-f</xref>, <bold>bottom panels, green tracks</bold>). In absence of strong CTCF-bound insulation sites, Cohesin flows more freely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d-f</xref>, <bold>bottom panels, orange tracks</bold>), which results in a marked reduction of Cohesin clustering to essentially only pair-wise interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g-i</xref>). These analyses therefore suggest that in absence of relatively long-lived CTCF residence at CBSs, the spatiotemporal clustering of Cohesin changes such that the formation of higher-order chromatin hubs is no longer supported. Importantly, the other upregulated loci show similar patterns as the <italic>CCR1</italic>, <italic>NFKBIZ</italic>, and <italic>TRIB1</italic> loci.

This suggests that basic contacts between enhancers and promoters (in the form of pair-wise interactions) are more relevant for gene regulation than their cooperative interactions within chromatin hubs. To further explore the relationship between pair-wise enhancer-promoter interactions and gene expression, we computed a total enhancer-promoter interaction score for the targeted gene promoters based on the MCC data through lymphoid-to-myeloid differentiation. Interestingly, we find that changes in enhancer-promoter interactions correlate very well with changes in gene expression over the differentiation course, with a coefficient of 0.82 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>). Integration of the accessibility of the gene promoters further increases this correlation, to a coefficient of 0.87 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6g</xref>).

We find that interactions between promoters, enhancers and CBSs gradually form and dissolve in up- and downregulated gene loci during differentiation. For enhancer-promoter interactions, we find that their frequencies correlate very well with changes in the levels of Mediator and Cohesin binding at these elements. This is consistent with previous studies which have suggested a role for Mediator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup> and Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup> in the formation of enhancer-promoter interactions. Analysis of single-allele multi-way interactions shows that the selected up- and downregulated gene loci are characterized by cooperative interactions between multiple enhancers and promoters, which gradually form and dissolve over the differentiation course. This indicates that enhancer-promoter hubs, which had so far only been described at high-resolution in a few selected loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, are a common structural property of tissue-specific gene loci. Consistent with previous analyses based on multi-way 3C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> and imaging expriments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>, we also observe cooperative interactions between multiple CBSs, which likely reflect stacking of CBS-anchored loops into rosette structures. Notably, we also observe multi-way interactions involving enhancers, promoters, and CBSs, which is consistent with the promiscuous interaction patterns detected by MCC. This indicates the existence of chromatin hubs involving simultaneous interactions between all classes of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. To better understand the role of CTCF in the formation of these hubs, we investigate the effects of CTCF depletion over the differentiation course. Interestingly, we observe that depletion of CTCF leads to a strong reduction in cooperative interactions in chromatin hubs, regardless of whether these interactions directly involve a CBS. This shows that CTCF-dependent interactions provide a scaffold that is required for the formation of cooperative enhancer-promoter interactions in chromatin hubs.</p><p id="P23">In contrast to the impact of CTCF depletion on chromatin hubs, we observe that depletion of CTCF does not strongly affect pair-wise enhancer-promoter interactions. CTCF depletion therefore allows us to decouple the function of chromatin hubs and pair-wise enhancer-promoter interactions in the regulation of gene expression during cellular differentiation. Consistent with previous CTCF perturbation studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>, we do not observe widespread mis-regulation of gene expression in absence of CTCF. In most of the regions in which chromatin hubs are lost, gene expression is not significantly affected. In contrast, gene loci with significant changes in gene expression are characterized by changes in pair-wise enhancer-promoter interactions after CTCF depletion. This indicates that pair-wise enhancer-promoter interactions have an important role in gene regulation, which is not dependent on their cooperative interactions in chromatin hubs. In agreement with our observations in the CTCF depletion experiments, we also show that changes in pair-wise enhancer-promoter interaction frequencies are strongly correlated with changes in gene expression during differentiation. Of note, the correlation coefficients that we obtain are much higher than in previous studies, which might be explained by the high resolution of our data. Since our data do not reveal any instances of pre-formed, permissive interactions, we conclude that pair-wise enhancer-promoter interactions have an instructive role in gene regulation during lymphoid-to-myeloid differentiation.</p><p id="P24">The observation that cooperative interactions in chromatin hubs are strongly reduced in absence of CTCF without a consistent effect on gene expression indicates that these hubs do not have a function in gene regulation. Consistent with a recent pre-print based on imaging experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>, our data therefore suggest that enhancer cooperativity is not strictly dependent on simultaneous action of enhancers at a gene promoter. Although not directly tested in our study, this may have implications for the theory that transcriptional activation is dependent on the recruitment of a critical concentration of transcription factors and coactivators by clustered <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements in nuclear condensates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>. However, it is important to note that our conclusions mostly pertain to cooperativity between enhancer clusters in a locus, since the resolution of Tri-C is not sufficient to distinguish closely spaced enhancer elements within individual enhancer clusters. It is therefore possible that higher-resolution data and/or methods that are not dependent on proximity ligation uncover cooperative interactions that are CTCF-independent.</p><p id="P25">Without a clear function in gene regulation, it is not obvious why CTCF-dependent chromatin hubs exist. Computational modelling of our data indicates that cooperative interactions between CBSs form as a result of Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. A relatively high density of extruding Cohesin molecules and relatively stable stalling of Cohesin at CBSs are in principle sufficient to explain the clustering of CBSs at the bases of multiple extruded loops, consistent with previously described rosette structures and CTCF clusters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>.

This may therefore lead to clustering of enhancers and promoters with the CBS anchors. However, since Cohesin stalling at enhancers and promoters is less stable compared to CBSs, Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion may not lead to strong clustering of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in absence of the relatively stable CTCF-mediated interactions. Our model therefore suggests that chromatin hubs form as a result of the strong boundary function of CBSs during loop extrusion. Despite the minor general role of CTCF in gene regulation, it has been shown that CTCF boundaries are critical for context-specific regulation of important gene loci and that their perturbation can have severe consequences for development and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref></sup>. It is therefore plausible that clustering of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements in chromatin hubs arises as a by-product of strong loop extrusion boundaries, which primarily function to regulate the specificity of enhancer-promoter communication.</p><p id="P26">The development of innovative technologies to map genome architecture has led to an increasingly better understanding of the dynamic 3D structures into which the genome is organized. While some of these structures may be critical for nuclear functions, such as transcription, replication and DNA repair, other structural features may more simply reflect the processes required to compact and organize the genome in the cell nucleus. A remaining challenge therefore lies in distinguishing these two possibilities and relating genome structure to function. By combining a dynamic differentiation system, protein perturbation, and high-resolution pair-wise and multi-way analyses of chromatin interactions, our study decouples the function of pair-wise enhancer-promoter interactions from their higher-order clustering in chromatin hubs in the regulation of gene expression. Further developments in technologies to map and perturb structural and functional features of the genome will allow for more detailed dissections of their cause-consequence relationships across biological contexts in the future.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P27">BLaER1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> and BLaER1-CTCF-mAID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, 31870025), supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, 10270106), 25 mM HEPES (Fisher Scientific, 15-630-080) and 2% GlutaMAX Supplement (Thermo Scientific, 35050038), at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

After conforming the quality of the RNA with an RNA ScreenTape (Agilent, 5067-5576), reverse transcription was performed with Maxima Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoScientific, EP0741) with random hexamer primers. qPCR was performed with the SYBR Select Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, 4472908) using previously validated primer sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>.

After sequence alignment with Bowtie 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref></sup>, BAM files from all replicates were merged. Since capture-oligonucleotide-mediated enrichment is performed in a single hybridization reaction containing all multiplexed samples, the capture efficiency of each viewpoint is similar across samples; interactions profiles from the same viewpoint are therefore comparable across samples. To make the interaction profiles of the different viewpoints comparable, the interaction profiles were normalized for an equal number of interactions on the chromosome containing the viewpoint to correct for potential variation in the enrichment efficiency of the different capture oligonucleotides. Statistical comparisons between samples were made per viewpoint and therefore not influenced by potential variability between viewpoints. Peaks were called with MACS2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref></sup> (v.2.1.2), using a q-value of 0.05 and without building a shifting model. Prior to peak annotation, the called peaks were filtered to exclude peaks outside a ± 2 Mb region surrounding the viewpoint and within ± 1 kb of the viewpoint. MCC peaks were annotated as CTCF-binding sites, promoters or enhancers based on their overlap with relevant genomic features. CTCF-binding sites were defined by overlap with CTCF ChIP-seq peaks. Promoters were defined by overlap with ATAC-seq peaks located within ± 500 bp of the transcription start site of an expressed gene. In the remaining peaks, enhancers were defined by their overlap with H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks. To quantify MCC interaction frequencies, MCC bigWig tracks were imported into R (v.4.2.0) and the coverage values per base-pair over MCC peaks were extracted using the R package rtracklayer (v. 1.56.1). The interaction frequency of every MCC peak was measured by calculating the average of the highest 70% of base-pair bigWig coverage values. Similarly, the occupancy of SMC1A, MED26, and CTCF at annotated MCC peaks was quantified by extracting the coverage information from the corresponding bigWig files and calculating the average of the highest 70% of base-pair coverage values across the MCC peaks.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Analysis of Capture-C and Tri-C data</title><p id="P35">Capture-C and Tri-C data were analyzed using the CapCruncher pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref></sup> (v.0.2.3) in capture mode (hg38 genome assembly).

These reads were used to calculate multi-way interaction counts between reporter fragments for each viewpoint. Contact matrices in which multiple 3-way interactions were calculated from reads containing more than 3 reporters did not show any qualitative differences compared to contact matrices in which only a single 3-way interaction per read was included. All detected 3-way interactions were therefore included in the contact matrices to boost the complexity of the data. The interaction counts were binned in 1500 – 4000 bp bins and corrected for the number of restriction fragments present in each bin. The matrices were further normalized for the total multi-way interaction counts within a 2 Mb region (which was corrected for the number of restriction fragments present in the region) surrounding the viewpoint. To quantify the interaction frequencies between two regions of interest (ROIs), a 3X3 binning matrix surrounding the pair of ROIs was extracted from the normalized contact matrices and averaged.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Analysis of ChIPmentation data</title><p id="P36">ChIPmentation data were analyzed with the NGseqBasic pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> (hg38 genome assembly).

Changes in interaction frequencies and different signals at corresponding MCC peaks were calculated at 24h and 96h relative to the baseline at 0h. To correlate pair-wise enhancer-promoter interaction frequencies and gene expression levels, a total enhancer-promoter interaction score was defined for every targeted promoter as the sum of the signal of the enhancer peaks in the MCC interaction profiles. For all targeted loci, changes in gene expression levels, total enhancer-promoter interaction scores, and the products of the total enhancer-promoter interaction scores and promoter accessibility, based on TT-seq, MCC, and ATAC-seq data, were calculated. Changes at 24 h and 96 h were calculated relative to the baseline at 0 h.
