Either peripheral or central administration of OT suppresses food intake through reductions in meal size. However, pharmacological approaches do not differentiate whether observed effects are mediated by OT neurons located in the PVH or in the SON. To address this, we targeted OT neuron-specific designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in either the PVH or SON in rats, thus allowing for evaluation of food intake following selective activation of OT neurons separately in each nucleus. Results revealed that DREADDs-mediated excitation of PVH OT neurons reduced consumption of both standard chow and a high fat high sugar diet (HFHS) via reductions in meal size. On the contrary, SON OT neuron activation had the opposite effect by increasing both standard chow and liquid sucrose consumption, with the former effect mediated by an increase in meal size. To further examine the physiological role of OT neurons in eating behavior, a viral-mediated approach was used to silence synaptic transmission of OT neurons separately in either the PVH or SON. Results from these studies revealed that PVH OT neuron silencing significantly increased consumption of HFHS by increasing meal size whereas SON OT neuron silencing reduced chow consumption by decreasing meal size. Collectively these data reveal that PVH and SON OT neurons differentially modulate food intake by either increasing or decreasing satiation signaling, respectively.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd><kwd>oxytocin</kwd><kwd>satiety</kwd><kwd>brainstem</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Oxytocin (OT) is a nine amino-acid neuropeptide produced predominantly within the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. OT mediates a diverse set of functions both through its actions following release from the posterior pituitary into the periphery as a hormone, as well as through neuropeptide OT signaling within the central nervous system where oxytocin receptors (OTRs) are expressed widely throughout the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. OT acts on a G-protein coupled OTR to impact a wide range of behaviors, including social behavior, reproduction, stress, and food intake control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. With regards to its function in regulating appetite and food consumption, OT has been shown to be a potent anorexigenic signal that reduces food intake across species when administered both centrally and in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Pharmacological studies have identified OT’s reduction of food intake to be driven by its role in boosting satiation signals coming into the hindbrain from the gut, leading to earlier meal termination and reduced meal size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Studies in both rodents and humans have demonstrated that these effects are even stronger in overweight and obese individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. For these reasons OT has been identified as an exciting potential therapy for the treatment of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P3">Our knowledge of the role of OT in appetite and food intake control comes predominantly from pharmacological studies that utilize the administration of exogenous OT centrally or into the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. While these approaches are clinically relevant and are informative for understanding the role of specific populations of OTRs in eating behavior, pharmacological studies do not offer insights into the function of hypothalamic OT neurons that release OT along with other neurotransmitters. This is a critical gap as evidence has shown that PVH and SON OT neuron subpopulations have different morphological compositions, different OT and neurotransmitter release dynamics, and these subpopulations have both distinct and overlapping monosynaptic inputs and projections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Given that the brainstem is a potent site of action for OT pharmacology-mediated meal size reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], and that PVH but not SON OT neurons project directly to the brainstem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], we hypothesized that PVH and SON neurons may play distinct roles in modulating feeding behavior, with the PVH subpopulation yielding more potent anorexigenic action than the SON subpopulation. Here we utilized both gain-of-function (viral-mediated chemogenetic activation) and loss-of-function (synaptic transmission silencing) approaches to investigate the role of the PVH and SON OT neuron subpopulations, separately and together, in the control of feeding behavior. Given that OTR pharmacological studies identify macronutrient-dependent responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], we examined effects on consumption of standard chow, a high-fat and high-sugar diet, and liquid sucrose separately.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials &amp; Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animals</title><p id="P4">Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN; PND &gt;60; 320-450 g at the start of the experiment) were individually housed in a temperature-controlled vivarium with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access (except where noted) to water and food (LabDiet 5001, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO) on a 12h:12h reverse light/dark cycle.

Cannula were affixed to the skull as previously described using jeweler’s screws and dental cement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Following a week of recovery, the optimal injector tip length for infusion into the LV was determined by injecting 5-Thio-D-Glucose (5-TG) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO) into the LV and measuring change in blood glucose. Rats were mildly food restricted before 5-TG testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].

However, OT pharmacological studies fail to mimic physiological OT release patterns from OT-producing neurons in the hypothalamus. Further, the extent to which OT neuron subpopulations in the PVH and SON differentially impact feeding behavior is unknown. Here we sought to explore the individual contributions of these different OT neuron subpopulations on modulating food intake control using site-specific viral-mediated chemogenetic activation and synaptic silencing approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Results revealed that PVH OT neuron activation significantly decreased food intake on a standard chow diet through a reduction in meal size, while having no significant effect on consumption of liquid sucrose or at high-fat sucrose-enriched palatable diet (HFHS). Consistent with these gain-of-function results, chronic silencing of synaptic transmission from PVH OT neurons resulted in an increase in HFHS intake during the early nocturnal feeding period through an increase in average meal size. Taken together, these findings support a role for PVH OT neurons in reducing food intake by enhancing the efficacy of within-meal vagus nerve-mediated satiation signals to terminate a meal. These findings agree with previous pharmacological studies supporting an anorexigenic role for OT signaling, especially in the hindbrain [7; 13]. Recent OT neuron connection mapping analyses in rodents show that PVH OT neurons have dense projections to the hindbrain, including to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) comprised of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), the area postrema (AP), and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. DVC neurons, particularly in the NTS, express OTRs that have been shown to decrease food intake when activated by direct OT administration [12; 13; 22]. Thus, our collective results from targeting PVH OT neurons are consistent with previous pharmacological and neuroanatomical studies that suggest that PVH OT neurons amplify satiation signals to decrease meal size via DVC projections.</p><p id="P29">Surprisingly, activation of SON OT neurons resulted in a significant increase in chow intake via elevated meal size. SON OT neuron activation also increased consumption of liquid sucrose, although these results were mediated by an increase in meal frequency. In support of these findings, SON OT neuron silencing significantly reduced chow intake and meal size during the early nocturnal feeding period, indicating that SON OT neurons may play an endogenous role in promoting food intake by enhancing meal size during periods of active eating. While these finding differs from most previous studies that solely identify an anorexigenic role for OTR signaling [7; 18], recent results from our lab reveal that OT administration into the dorsal subregion of the hippocampus, a region critical for both food intake control and social memory, can increase food intake under conditions where food is consumed with a familiar conspecific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Further, our study identified an endogenous role for hippocampus OTR signaling in promoting prosocial eating, as targeted hippocampal OTR viral-mediated knockdown eliminated the social facilitation of eating effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Future studies are needed to determine whether SON vs. PVH OT neurons differentially engage the hippocampus, and whether these subpopulations differ with regards to mediating interactions between food intake and social factors. Given that very few or no OT-immunoreactive axons are not present in the dorsal CA1 hippocampus [20; 30; 38], it is likely that OT neurons engage hippocampal OTRs through volume transmission – that is, humoral-like “bulk flow” transmission of peptides through release into cerebral spinal fluid and/or the brain interstitial space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p><p id="P30">The bidirectional differences in the effects of these two hypothalamic OT neuron subpopulations on caloric consumption might be explained by differences in their morphology, anatomical inputs and outputs, mechanisms of OT transmission, and/or OTR properties of downstream targets. For example, OT neurons within the PVH and SON are predominantly categorized into two main types, magnocellular and parvocellular (preautonomic) neurons, though recent studies argue that there may be four distinct types based on genetic profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Magnocellular OT neurons from both hypothalamic nuclei innervate various forebrain areas and release OT into the blood via the posterior pituitary. They contain many large dense core vesicles (LDCV) and have been shown to release OT somato-dendritically as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. While these magnocellular OT neurons are present in both subpopulations, in the PVH but not the SON there are also a small number (at least in rats) of parvocellular OT neurons that do not possess connections to the neurohypophysis, but instead connect directly to brainstem, midbrain, and forebrain targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. While parvocellular OT neurons in rats are thought to make up only a small percentage of all OT neurons, their projection targets are numerous and they have been shown to act as regulators of magnocellular OT neuron activity as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Consistent with parvocellular OT neurons being present only in the PVH, OT PVH and SON neurons differ with regards to their projection profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. One characteristic feature of the PVH is that it forms reciprocal connections sending outputs to most of the regions it receives input from, which could allow for extrahypothalamic OTR-expressing neurons to tune OT neuron activity depending on behavior context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. An exception to this is the hindbrain which sends relatively little input to the PVH, yet receives dense output into the DVC from PVH OT neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], which as mentioned above may drive PVH OT neurons’ anorexigenic effects. Unlike PVH OT neurons, however, SON OT neurons appear not to send any outputs to the hindbrain. Thus, while the PVH and SON receive inputs from mostly similar regions, SON OT neurons have relatively fewer outputs that represent a subset of those targeted by the PVH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. For this reason, the SON OT neurons have been thought to predominantly function in peripheral neuroendocrine signaling. While more research is required to confirm, it may be that PVH parvocellular OT neurons reduce meal size via brainstem projections, whereas SON magnocellular OT neurons have the opposite effect, potentially mediated by peripheral OT release.</p><p id="P31">Both PVH and SON project into the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Contained within the LHA are neurons that produce melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), a potent orexigenic neuropeptide [45; 46]. Interactions between OT and MCH systems have been established, with OT neurons expressing MCH receptors, as well as 60% of MCH neurons expressing OTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Studies in slice preparations have shown that OT, and selective OTR agonists result in the excitation of MCH neurons, to a greater degree than other GABAergic neurons within the LHA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Meanwhile MCH injected into the PVH has been shown to increase feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. However, the extent to which OT and MCH interact to influence feeding behavior has not been directly investigated. One possibility is that these two OT neuron subpopulations target different cells within the LHA, with SON but not PVH OT neurons engaging MCH neurons to promote food intake.</p><p id="P32">In addition to differences in OT cell types and projection targets for PVH vs. SON OT neurons, the bidirectional effects on food intake could be mediated by differences in downstream OTR dynamics. While there is only one OTR, it is a G-protein coupled receptor that shows heterogeneity in that it can be associated with excitatory as well as inhibitory G-proteins depending on the cell in which it is expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Moreover, OTRs are also expressed on a wide range of cell types including GABAergic interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>], glutamatergic pyramidal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>], and other neuroendocrine cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. This heterogeneity in OTR signaling mechanism and cell-type expression could allow for OT to mediate a wide range of effects, including in a bidirectional manner depending upon the behavioral and physiological context.</p><p id="P33">One limitation of this study is the exclusion of females. In our lab we have recently identified varying effects of OT administration on food intake depending on estrus cycle stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Additionally, there are known sex differences in feeding behavior, OT production, and central OTR expression, with estrus cycle stage altering OTR expression levels in cycling females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. For these reasons females were excluded for initial studies, though this represents an important area of follow-up investigation to confirm whether or not the differential roles of PVH and SON OT neurons in regulating feeding behavior are sex-specific. Another limitation of the current study involves the technical difficulty to separately target and distinguish roles of parvocellular vs. magnocellular OT neurons within the PVH subpopulation. Use of the OT promoter targets both cell types without the ability to select between them. The ability to differentially target OT neurons based on cell type would be informative with regards to understanding the complex dynamics of hypothalamic OT neuron signaling between subpopulations. Finally, present findings should be considered with regards to the involvement of the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system, as this neuropeptide is closely related to OT (evolutionarily diverged from a combined gene) and there has been shown to be substantial cross talk between OT and AVP systems/receptors [57; 58]. While OT binds to OTR with a higher affinity than to AVP receptors, the chemogenetic activation to potentially supraphysiological levels could result in off-target effects in the AVP system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. The use of a selective OTR antagonist in future studies combined with the OTp chemogenetic approach could help to ensure these effects are indeed mediated by the OTR.</p><p id="P">In conclusion, our results demonstrate that separate hypothalamic OT neuron populations in the PVH and SON exert opposing influences on food intake control, serving to decrease and increase meal size, respectively. These effects are likely mediated by differences in projection targets of these subpopulations, as well as by different release dynamics mediated by different cell types (e.g., parvocellular OT neurons are exclusively in PVH). PVH OT neurons likely engage classic anorexigenic pathways in the hindbrain while SON OT neurons may have connections with orexigenic systems in the LHA MCH system, and potentially may promote food intake via unknown orexigenic peripheral signaling pathways. Overall, the current results should be taken into consideration with regards to OT-based targets for clinical obesity treatment, as OT’s endogenous role in regulating feeding behavior may be more complex than previously considered to be.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS200766-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d61aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Kanoski Lab undergraduate research assistants for their support with the behavioral experiments as well as all funding sources.</p><sec id="S18"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the following grants:</p><p>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases: DK118402, and DK104897 (to S.E.K.), F31DK137484 (to J.J.R.)</p><p>Postdoctoral Ruth L.
