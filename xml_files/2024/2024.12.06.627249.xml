CXCR4 is known to form oligomers, but the potential functional relevance in malignancies remain elusive. Using a newly established nanobody-based BRET method, we demonstrate that oligomerization of endogenous CXCR4 on lymphoid cancer cell lines correlates with enhanced expression levels. Specific disruption of CXCR4 oligomers reduced basal cell migration and pro-survival signaling via changes in the phosphoproteome, indicating the existence of basal CXCR4-oligomer-mediated signaling. Oligomer disruption also inhibited growth of primary CLL 3D spheroids and sensitized primary malignant cells to clinically used Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax. Given its limited efficacy in some patients and the ability to develop resistance, sensitizing malignant B-cells to venetoclax is of clinical relevance. Taken together, we established a new, non-canonical and critical role for CXCR4 oligomers in lymphoid neoplasms and demonstrated that selective targeting thereof has clinical potential.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Leukemia</kwd><kwd>CXCR4</kwd><kwd>Receptor Oligomerization</kwd><kwd>Drug Sensitization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Classification</title><kwd>Biological Sciences</kwd><kwd>Pharmacology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The treatment landscape of B cell malignancies like chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has undergone significant transformations after the introduction of effective oral targeted therapies such as BTK-, PI3K- and Bcl-2 inhibitors (Venetoclax) and next-generation anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Nevertheless, the unresponsiveness of some patients, along with acquired resistance and the nearly universal subsequent relapse of the disease, underscores the ongoing need for a potentially curative treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is overexpressed in many human cancers, including lymphoid neoplasms. In these disease states, CXCR4 induces signaling that promotes tumor survival and metastasis upon activation by its endogenous ligand CXCL12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). In CLL, CXCR4 was shown to promote a protective tumor microenvironment by allowing migration into the lymph node and altering the behavior of adjacent cells to support tumor survival and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). CXCR4 signaling also drives the retention of malignant cells in the bone marrow, thereby protecting these cells from chemotoxic stress, and targeted therapies administered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). These observations support a central critical role for CXCR4 signaling in the biology of lymphoid neoplasms and positions CXCR4 as an important drug target to treat such diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P3">CXCR4 belongs to the class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Since GPCRs regulate numerous (patho-)physiological processes and are highly amenable to drug intervention, they represent a major class of drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Although classically perceived as monomeric signaling units, GPCRs are increasingly recognized to exist and signal as dimers or as higher-order oligomeric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). For example, it is well-established that the functionality of class C GPCRs is critically dependent on the formation of homo- and heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). In contrast, the role of oligomerization in regulating receptor function and influencing downstream signaling outcomes remains unclear for the larger class A GPCR family. Some class A GPCRs appear to form transient dimers and higher-order oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). However, the physiological roles of such complexes remain poorly understood to date.</p><p id="P4">A large body of evidence indicates that CXCR4 is capable of forming dimers and higher-order oligomers (i.e., clusters of three or more receptors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Upon recombinant overexpression to levels mimicking an oncogenic setting, CXCR4 exists almost exclusively as dimers or higher-order oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). In malignant lymphocytic T-cells, CXCR4 mainly resides in higher-order oligomers while it is largely monomeric in primary healthy T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), thus suggesting that CXCR4 oligomers exist and contribute to malignancy. Moreover, CXCL12-mediated migration of CXCR4-expressing T-cells was reported to be dependent on enhanced higher-order oligomer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), illustrating that CXCR4 oligomerization impacts receptor function. However, it remains to be clarified whether CXCR4 oligomerization drives malignancy. Additionally, it is important to investigate which specific pro- tumorigenic effects of CXCR4 are associated with signaling pathways unique to receptor oligomerization.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we set out to investigate the malignant potential of CXCR4 oligomerization. Using nanobody-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) single-molecule imaging, we studied CXCR4 oligomerization in a panel of lymphoid neoplasm cell lines and primary cultures. Using mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, we assessed signaling downstream of CXCR4 oligomers. Specific changes at the phosphosite level led us to uncover basal migration, spheroid growth and cell survival as phenotypic consequences of basal CXCR4 oligomer-mediated signaling. Moreover, the attenuation of these phenotypes obtained by pharmacologically disrupting CXCR4 oligomers suggests that such clusters can serve as a novel therapeutic target with clinical potential.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Detection of endogenous CXCR4 oligomers using nanobody-based BRET approach</title><p id="P6">Oligomerization of CXCR4 has been extensively studied in heterologous expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). To investigate whether this also occurs in a native setting, we developed a method for the detection of untagged GPCR oligomers in living cells. Such analysis requires a detection molecule that binds to CXCR4 with high affinity, without altering the basal oligomeric state of the receptor or its basal receptor signaling. One of the previously selected CXCR4-binding nanobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), VUN415, displayed such properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). To allow the detection of CXCR4 clusters by BRET, VUN415 was either genetically fused to NanoLuciferase (NanoLuc, Nluc) or conjugated to a fluorescent dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Close proximity of two or more receptors enables BRET between nanobody donor and acceptor constructs bound to different CXCR4 protomers, thereby providing information about the relative receptor oligomeric state. Indeed, increasing equimolar concentrations of the two nanobody fusion constructs led to a concentration-dependent, saturable increase in nanobody binding on CXCR4-overexpressing HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>), as well as an increase in BRET ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). This detection was CXCR4 specific, as no binding of the probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>), and therefore no BRET, was observed in CHO-K1 or CRISPR Cas9 CXCR4-knockout HEK293T cells, which both lack CXCR4 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). In addition, no BRET was observed in these CXCR4<sup>negative</sup> models when using a fixed saturating nanobody concentration with varying donor:acceptor probe ratios (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C, S1D</xref>). No BRET signals were observed when VUN415-ATTO565 was replaced by unlabeled VUN415 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate our BRET approach is highly specific, quantitative and can be used effectively to monitor the oligomerisation status of CXCR4 in subsequent mechanistic experiments.</p><p id="P7">Dimerization and higher-order oligomerization of proteins can be artificially induced through fusion to FK506-binding protein (FKBP) domains and subsequent chemical crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). At low expression levels where CXCR4 is expected to be predominantly monomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), a robust increase in nanobody oligomerization BRET was observed upon stimulation with crosslinker AP20187 for FKBP-tagged CXCR4 and not for the untagged receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). This shows that increased BRET values observed with our nanobody-based BRET approach is a consequence of receptor oligomerization. To verify that CXCR4 oligomerization depends on its expression level, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), an ecdysone-inducible CXCR4 expression construct was generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Stimulation with ecdysone agonist tebufenozide indeed led to a concentration-dependent increase in CXCR4 expression, as well as nanobody-based oligomerization BRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>).</p><p id="P8">After the initial validation of the nanobody-BRET approach in HEK293T cells, we assessed the existence of endogenous CXCR4 oligomers. We focused on lymphoid neoplasms as enhanced CXCR4 levels are considered to play a prominent pathological role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Using the Namalwa Burkitt lymphoma cell line as a proof-of-concept, we observed a robust increase in BRET signal in cells treated with CXCR4 detection nanobodies, whereas no BRET occurred when combining VUN415-Nluc with a fluorescently labeled nanobody against the highly expressed integrin β1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). The lack of BRET for the integrin β1 control was not due to a lack of nanobody binding, as clear concentration-dependent binding to Namalwa cells was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>). Hence, our nanobody-based BRET approach specifically showed the presence of heterologously and endogenously expressed CXCR4 oligomers.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Enhanced oligomerization of endogenous CXCR4 on lymphoid cancer cell lines</title><p id="P9">Subsequently, we assessed whether CXCR4 oligomerization is associated with elevated expression of endogenous receptors on cancer cells. First, concentration-response curves for nanobody-based oligomerization detection were generated for a small selection of lymphoid cancer cell lines with varying CXCR4 expression levels and disease subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6</xref>). In the CLL cell line MEC-1 with very low CXCR4 expression, no oligomerization BRET signal was detected, confirming specificity of the BRET assay for cells other than the HEK293T CXCR4 CRISPR Cas9 KO and CHO-K1 cells. We observed concentration-dependent increases in BRET signal for CXCR4<sup>low</sup> RPC1-WM1 (Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia) cells and CXCR4<sup>high</sup> Z-138 (mantle cell lymphoma, MCL) cells, with similar BRET50 but much higher BRET<sub>max</sub> values for the latter. Although different plate reader gain settings were used between cell lines, this did not affect the transformed BRET<sub>max</sub> values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>), and can therefore be considered to accurately reflect relative oligomerization levels. Out of a large and diverse panel of lymphoid neoplasms, oligomeric complexity of endogenous CXCR4 generally correlated to the receptor expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Notably, some cell lines exhibited higher oligomeric complexity than expected based on their expression level, including cell lines PGA-1, L363 and CII. These deviations could be explained by other factors influencing oligomeric complexity, including membrane lipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Of the tested cell lines, Z-138 stood out as the cell line with the highest level of CXCR4 oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6</xref>). To further investigate the link between receptor expression and oligomerization, we tested the effects of genetic manipulations of CXCR4 expression on CXCR4 oligomerization. Doxycycline-inducible expression of CXCR4 enhanced its oligomeric state in RPC1-WM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8A</xref>) and MEC-1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8C</xref>), whereas siRNA-mediated silencing of CXCR4 caused a marked reduction of endogenous receptor oligomerization in Z-138 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S8B</xref>) and Namalwa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8D</xref>). These data effectively demonstrate that CXCR4 expression is an important driver of receptor oligomerization in endogenous systems.</p><p id="P11">To validate the BRET-based findings of endogenous CXCR4 oligomerization, we employed dSTORM single-molecule imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), using AlexaFluor™ 647-conjugated VUN415 (VUN415-AF647), on CHO-K1 (CXCR4<sup>negative</sup>) and Z-138 (CXCR4<sup>high</sup>) cells. To assess the specificity of VUN415-AF647, samples were incubated with an excess of CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, which is known to displace VUN415 but does not affect CXCR4 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9A, S9B</xref>). VUN415 can be competed off by small molecule CXCR4 binding compound AMD3100. Z-138 cells contained specific localized events as demonstrated by their elevated number compared to the corresponding non-specifc localized events in the AMD3100-treated sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Next, we performed a statistical cluster analysis based on Ripley’s K function, Voronoi segmentation and localization output to analyze the CXCR4 cluster stoichiometry on Z-138 cells. Voronoi segmentation was applied to the obtained spatial distribution patterns of the localized events and compared to random distributions generated by Monte-Carlo simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). Z-138 cells showed significant clustering of CXCR4 receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). The average CXCR4 cluster diameter was 49 ± 39 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Cluster stoichiometry analysis showed a large population of higher-order CXCR4 oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>).

Previously, we have shown that the minor pocket-binding small molecules IT1t, as well as the N-terminus-binding nanobody VUN401, can disrupt CXCR4 oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Because two completely different types of molecules (small molecule and nanobody) are able to exert similar effects on CXCR4 oligomers and associated downstream signaling, we wondered whether other CXCR4 ligands displayed a similar mode of action. The identification of other, different, oligomer disruptors would reduce the chance that the phenotypic observations can be contributed to aspecific IT1t and VUN401 effects. First, we evaluated the effects of clinical candidates AMD070 (AMD11070, mavorixafor) and TG-0054 (burixafor) on CXCR4 oligomerization by assessing changes in BRET between Rluc- and YFP-tagged CXCR4 in HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and Spatial-intensity Distribution Analysis (SpiDA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). In both assays, AMD070, and the controls IT1t and VUN401 reduced the amount of CXCR4 oligomers, whereas TG-0054 did not.</p><p id="P14">As IT1t interfered with VUN415 binding to CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S10</xref>), VUN415 can not be used to monitor endogenous modulation of CXCR4 clustering by IT1t. Fortunately, out of a panel of different CXCR4 binding nanobodies, VUN416 binding was unaffected by IT1t (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>) and did not modulate CXCR4 oligomerization itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). This makes VUN416 a suitable candidate to be engineered into a BRET sensor for the assessment of the effects of IT1t on endogenous CXCR4 oligomers. A mix of VUN416-NanoLuc and VUN416-ATTO565 was able to detect endogenous CXCR4 oligomers in Z-138 cells, the lymphoid cancer cell line with the highest CXCR4 oligomeric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). More importantly, while IT1t did not affect the binding of these probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10B</xref>), it completely abolished the oligomer BRET values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Fortunately, AMD070 did not affect the CXCR4 binding of oligomer detection nanobody VUN415 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10C</xref>), allowing the probing of endogenous oligomer disruption by this ligand. Without affecting the binding of the detection nanobodies, AMD070 indeed partially reduced the endogenous CXCR4 oligomers in Z-138 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3F</xref>). This indicates that the oligomer-disrupting activity of IT1t and to a smaller extend AMD070 is also apparent in highly CXCR4 expressin Z-138 cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>CXCR4 oligomers drive basal cell migration and anti-apoptotic signaling in MCL cells</title><p id="P15">To investigate the functional consequences of CXCR4 oligomerization, we first examined the effect of CXCR4 monomerizing small molecule IT1t and nanobody VUN401 on the phosphoproteome of Z-138 cells. Because these cells display the largest CXCR4 oligomerization status, we expect to find the largest changes in protein phosphorylation upon CXCR4-oligomer disruption in these cells. By phospho-enrichment, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), we identified a total of 15,563 phosphopeptides (purity &gt;80%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). This enabled highly sensitive and specific quantifications to be performed across &gt;15,000 phosphosites (localization probability &gt;0.75; Class I), and between cells treated with cluster-disrupting agents and untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S11</xref>). Extensive coverage of the phosphoproteome enabled an unbiased and deep characterization of phosphorylation events following CXCR4 cluster disruption, which we subsequently used as a proxy to decipher cellular impact and molecular consequences of interfering with CXCR4 cluster formation.</p><p id="P16">We found that disruption of CXCR4 oligomers changed phosphosites of cell migration mediators, such as the Rac1 effector protein serine/threonine-protein kinase PAK2, GTPase-activating protein DOCK7 and several cytoskeleton rearranging proteins. These phosphoproteins, known to regulate cell migration and reorganizing cytoskeleton, are significantly changed in the signaling pathway regulated by Rho GTPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11C</xref>). Previously, CXCL12-induced formation of CXCR4 higher-order oligomers has been reported to be essential for sensing chemokine gradients and promoting directed migration of malignant T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that high levels of CXCR4 oligomers might instigate basal signaling towards cell migration. We performed a live-cell imaging experiment, where a consistent proportion of the control-treated cells (5-10%) showed significant basal cell migration during a 4 hour period. Monomerizing ligands IT1t and VUN401 impaired the basal cell migration of this population significantly, whereas non-monomerizing ligands AMD3100 and VUN415 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). When analyzing the trajectories, both IT1t and VUN401 impaired the average migration speed of the highly migratory Z-138 cell population significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). IT1t showed a significant inhibition of the average traveled distance, whereas VUN401 showed a similar trend (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S12</xref>). Collectively, these results highlight a role for CXCR4 oligomers in constitutive cell migration, which can be modulated by oligomer disruptors.</p><p id="P17">To elucidate other CXCR4 clustering-dependent phenotypes, we performed pathway analyses to identify processes similarly affected by IT1t and VUN401 treatment. Of notable interest was the shared positive regulation of the apoptotic process by both IT1t and VUN401 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), exemplified by the regulation of a large cluster of phosphosites controlling apoptotic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Due to the annotated functions of these phosphorylation sites in regulating apoptosis, and considering the large cluster of coherently regulated phosphosites pointing towards apoptosis, we examined cell viability in more detail. CXCR4 oligomer disruption by IT1t, AMD070 an to a lesser extent VUN401, but not by the non-cluster disrupting molecules AMD3100 and TG-0054, impaired cell viability in the MCL cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3, Fig. S13</xref>). Although this data hints towards a protective role for basal CXCR4-oligomer-mediated signaling in these cells, the observed effects were marginal.</p><p id="P18">Therefore, we tested whether CXCR4-monomerization would increase the sensitivity of Z-138 cells to cell death. venetoclax, a selective Bcl-2 inhibitor, is a cell-death-inducing agent that is approved for CLL and AML patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Co-treatment of Z-138 cells with monomerizing ligands IT1t and, to a lesser extent, VUN401 enhanced the sensitivity for venetoclax-induced cell death, as determined by measuring cell metabolic activity with a resazurin assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>, data normalized to no venetoclax condition for each CXCR4 molecule to emphasize potentiation, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). The effect of IT1t could be blocked by a saturating concentration of the IT1t-competitor and other CXCR4 binder AMD3100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>), indicating that the effect is CXCR4-specific. Dual concentration-response curves of venetoclax and IT1t revealed a dose-dependent enhancement in the sensitivity of Z-138 cells for venetoclax-induced cell death that saturated at 10 μM IT1t (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14A</xref>). As an alternative approach to disrupt CXCR4 oligomers, we lowered the CXCR4 expresssion by a partial knockdown of CXCR4, which also showed venetoclax sensitization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5F</xref>). Moreover, the IT1t effect was strongly impaired upon CXCR4 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14B</xref>).</p><p id="P19">In a viability assay by FACS, AMD070 sensitized cells to venetoclax-induced cell death to a lesser smaller extent than IT1t, which corresponds well to its partial oligomer disruption disrupting capability. AMD3100 and the non-monomerizing small molecule TG-0054 did not show sensitization. Sensitization of venetoclax-induced cell death by IT1t was also observed in JEKO-1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S15B and Table S3</xref>). Using the Bliss independence model, a synergistic nature was observed for the enhancement of venetoclax-induced cell death of Z-138 cells by IT1t and, to a lesser extent, VUN401 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S15A</xref>). Pre-incubation with the pan-caspase inhibitor qVD-OPH reduced the observed sensitization, suggesting the involvement of caspases in this process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S15B</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that CXCR4 clustering promotes anti-apoptotic signaling and associated phenotypes in lymphoid cancer cell lines, which can be targeted using CXCR4-monomerizing ligands.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Disruption of CXCR4 oligomerization sensitizes to cell death and inhibits spheroid growth in primary CLL and MCL cultures</title><p id="P20">Finally, we investigated the significance of CXCR4 clusters in patient-derived primary CLL and MCL cells. Using our nanobody-BRET approach, native CXCR4 oligomers could also be detected on primary cells from five CLL patients and two MCL patients. Also on these primary cells, the BRET values that indicate native CXCR4 oligomers, could be almost completely disrupted by IT1t (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>), similar to the results obtained with cell lines. More importantly, also in these primary CLL cultures, IT1t, but not the non-monomerizing ligand AMD3100, potentiated the effect of venetoclax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Given the importance of CXCR4 in lymph node retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) and the CXCR4 oligomer-driven migration we observed, we tested the effects of CXCR4 ligands in a 3D lymph node-mimicking CLL model derived from patient peripheral blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>).

Taken together, our data indicate that CXCR4 oligomers also contribute to pro-survival signaling in CLL patient-derived cultures and that specific disruption of such oligomers is a promising therapeutic outlook.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">Despite major improvements in the treatment of B cell lymphoid neoplasms, many patients still experience relapsing disease that becomes more aggressive with each recurrence, characterized by acquired resistance and impaired clinical outcome. Hence, there is a need for novel therapeutic interventions, preferably targeting other signaling pathways with other modes of action. In this work, we have uncovered that CXCR4 oligomers exist on many B cell lymphoid cancer cells. Also, our data indicates that such oligomers can induce oncogenic signaling and that inhibiting this signaling through oligomer disruption represents a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CLL, MCL and other B cell lymphoid neoplasms.</p><p id="P23">High expression of CXCR4 is known to correlate with tumor growth, invasion, relapse and therapeutic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). For example, in CLL patients, high CXCR4 expression is associated with reduced progression-free survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). The signaling output of GPCRs, such as CXCR4, is generally evaluated in the context of agonist stimulation. For instance, there is ample evidence that supports the cancerous role of CXCL12-mediated migration and pro-survival signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). However, apart from agonist-driven receptor activation, constitutive GPCR signaling exists and, in the case of CXCR4 signaling, has been reported to promote the growth and survival of acute myeloid leukemia <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Moreover, colon cancer cells require CXCR4 expression but not ligand-induced signaling capacity for chemotherapy resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Our findings indicate that the high oligomeric state of CXCR4 in lymphoid cancer cells induces constitutive pro-survival signaling and basal migration. Similarly, the constitutive activity of breast tumor kinase and the adhesion GPCR GPR64 accelerates cell migration and thereby contributes to tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Constitutive receptor oligomerization-driven signaling has been observed for other GPCRs, as exemplified by the requirement of CCR7 oligomer formation for the interaction with and activation of tyrosine kinase Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). The CXCR4 oligomerization-driven basal cell migration, likely contributing to the invasive and metastatic properties associated with this receptor, might be particularly important for cells that are not exposed to a CXCL12 gradient.</p><p id="P24">Most studies focusing on GPCR oligomerization and modulation were performed in heterologous expression systems, which may differ from endogenous systems. For instance, the M<sub>1</sub>R antagonist pirenzepine promotes oligomerization of transfected M<sub>1</sub>R receptors but prevents the formation of endogenous oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Employing our nanobody-based tools, we report the pharmacological disruption of endogenous CXCR4 oligomers for the first time. AMD070 partially disrupted CXCR4 oligomers in lymphoid cancer cells, while IT1t appeared to induce a fully monomeric receptor state. This was slightly different in heterologous expression systems, where equal oligomer-disrupting efficacies were observed for these two small molecules. These data highlight the importance of studying oligomerization in a native context.</p><p id="P25">We have tested several small molecules for their ability to disrupt CXCR4 oligomers. Of these, AMD3100, an antagonist lacking oligomer-disrupting properties, is used clinically for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). In addition, the partial cluster disruptor AMD070 has recently been approved for the treatment of WHIM syndrome, demonstrating that antagonizing CXCR4 is clinically safe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). In contrast to AMD3100 and TG-0054, we found that AMD070, IT1t, and nanobody VUN401 disrupted CXCR4 oligomers and inhibited downstream signaling towards cell survival and migration. The effects of IT1t could theoretically also be attributed to its ability to inhibit basal CXCR4-mediated Gα<sub>i/o</sub> signaling. However, VUN401 and AMD070 do not inhibit basal CXCR4-mediated Gα<sub>i/o</sub> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and IT1t and VUN401 showed similar effects on anti-apoptotic and cell migration signaling networks in our studies. This suggests inhibition of CXCR4 oligomerization to be the underlying mechanism rather than inhibition of basal Gα<sub>i/o</sub> activation.</p><p id="P26">In our venetoclax sensitization experiments and CLL patient-derived 3D spheroid model, the full monomerizing ligand IT1t was more potent and efficacious than the partial cluster disruptor AMD070. This implies that the extent to which CXCR4 oligomers can be disrupted may impact the therapeutic outcome, at least in lymphoid neoplasms. In these pathologies, high efficacy cluster disruptors would be the most attractive candidates for the therapeutic targeting of CXCR4. As expression is a primary driver of CXCR4 oligomerization, pharmacological intervention with cluster disruptors would specifically target malignant cells that overexpress CXCR4. This would create an added layer of selectivity for targeted therapy in cancer. Our approach could be expanded to other GPCRs, like P2Y2 receptors, which are highly expressed in pancreatic cancer and form clusters that can be pharmacologcically disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>).</p><p id="P27">The pathological role of CXCR4 oligomerization described in this study may extend beyond the context of lymphoid neoplasms. Previously, IT1t but not AMD3100 was shown to inhibit TLR7-mediated type I interferon signaling in plasmacytoid dendritic cells from systemic lupus erythematosus patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Moreover, IT1t inhibited early metastases in an <italic>in vivo</italic> breast cancer zebrafish model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). Although future studies are required to investigate whether these phenotypes can be (fully) ascribed to the oligomer-disruptive effects of IT1t, this added capacity may prove beneficial over inhibiting CXCL12-induced Gα<sub>i/o</sub> signaling by antagonizing compounds like AMD3100. The therapeutic potential of inhibiting CXCR4 oligomer-mediated basal signaling might also be extended towards other CXCR4 overexpressing cancer types. Since disruption of CXCR4-oligomers inhibited multiple hallmarks, it is not unlikely that cluster disruption can result in the potentiation of other commonly used cell-death-inducing agents.</p><p id="P28">Taken together, this study demonstrates the existence of native CXCR4 oligomers in lymphoid neoplasms and CXCR4 oligomer-driven signaling with pathophysiological importance.

Culture plates were placed in an IncuCyte live-cell imager (Essen Biosciences) in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Scans were taken every 5 h using the single spheroid assay for live-cell analysis application and 4x magnification. Spheroid area was quantified using IncuCyte software as a proxy for spheroid growth. Corresponding step-by-step protocols were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>).</p><p id="P62">After culture, spheroids were resuspended and disintegrated to ensure proper antibody staining. Cells were incubated with monoclonal antibodies for surface staining for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were stained with antibodies against CD4 (AF700-labeled OK-T4, 56-0048-82, eBioscience), CD8 (PE-Cy7-labeled RPA-T8, 25-0088-42, eBioscience), CD19 (APC-labeled HIB19, 555415, BD Biosciences) and CD5 (PerCP-eF710-labeled UCHT2, 46-0059-42, eBioscience) for gaiting and with anti- CD25 (PE-conjugated clone M-A251, 555432, BD Biosciences) and Fixable Viability Dye eFluor™ 780 (ThermoFisher, 65-0865-14) to measure T cell activation and viability. Samples were measured on a Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).

statement</title></caption><p>Class A GPCRs, including the chemokine receptor CXCR4, can form oligomers, but their functional relevance remains poorly understood. This study provides evidence for the role of basal CXCR4 oligomers in lymphoid neoplasms, where they drive pro-survival signaling, migration, and tumor growth. We use a novel nanobody-based BRET method to demonstrate that endogenous CXCR4 constitutively oligomerizes in lymphoid cancer cells, correlating with receptor expression levels. Pharmacological disruption of these oligomers reduces tumor- associated signaling, impairs spheroid growth, and sensitizes patient-derived malignant cells to the apoptosis-inducing drug Venetoclax. Since CXCR4 is frequently overexpressed and potentially clustered in various malignancies, this work offers broader implications for enhancing treatment efficacy, overcoming drug resistance, and potentially reducing side effects across multiple cancer types.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Detection of endogenous CXCR4 oligomers using nanobody-based BRET.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Schematics and results for the nanobody-based nanoBRET method to detect receptor oligomerization in CXCR4-overexpressing HEK293T, CHO-K1 and HEK293T CXCR4 CRISPR-Cas9 KO cells.
