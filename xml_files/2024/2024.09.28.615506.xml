The functional reconstitution of transmembrane in liposomes can be challenging, especially, if the hydrophobic thickness of the protein does not match the thickness of the surrounding lipid bilayer. During the reconstitution procedure Such hydrophobic mismatch causes low yields and protein aggregation, which are exacerbated in sterol-rich membranes featuring low membrane compressibility. Here, we explore new approaches to reversibly tune membrane sterol contents proteoliposomes after their formation. Both cholesterol delivery and extraction are mediated by methyl-β-cyclodextrin in a dialysis setting, which maintains (proteo)liposomes in a confined compartment. This makes it possible to reversibly tune the cholesterol level without losing membrane material simply by placing the dialysis cassette in a new bath containing either empty or cholesterol-loaded methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Cholesterol delivery and removal is monitored with the solvatochromic probe C-Laurdan, which reports on lipid packing. Using Förster-resonance energy transfer, we show that cholesterol delivery to proteoliposomes induces the oligomerization of a membrane property sensor, while the subsequent removal of cholesterol demonstrates the full reversibility. We propose that tuning membrane compressibility by methyl-β-cyclodextrin-meditated cholesterol delivery and removal in a dialysis setup provides a new handle to study its impact on membrane protein structure, function, and dynamics.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Biological membranes possess collective biophysical properties such as fluidity, thickness, and compressibility, which influence the structure, oligomeric state, and function of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Cholesterol is one of the most abundant lipids in mammalian cells and crucially important for modulating bilayer properties. It is asymmetrically distributed across the plasma membrane and regulates membrane permeability, membrane stiffness, and phase behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). By increasing lipid packing, it also increases the hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayer and reduces membrane compressibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P3">When the transmembrane domain of a protein does not match the hydrophobic thickness of the surrounding bilayer it is driven into oligomers to minimize the energetic strain from lipid distortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Lipid scramblases and membrane protein insertases, on the other hand, use such membrane distortions to facilitate lipid exchange between the two leaflets and/or to move hydrophilic sections of transmembrane client proteins through the hydrophobic membrane core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). These examples suggest an important role of membrane compressibility in regulating membrane protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Yet, it remains challenging to define the contribution of individual membrane properties to a specific transmembrane protein function for at least three reasons. Firstly, the collective bilayer properties are physically connected and interdependent. This makes it challenging to modulate one property without perturbing others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Secondly, most biophysical properties of biological membranes cannot be measured directly nor deduced from their (often unknown) composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Thirdly, it remains challenging to reconstitute membrane proteins in complex, asymmetric, and sterol-rich membranes for a functional characterization under defined conditions. This is particularly true for proteins such as lipid scramblases or membrane property sensors that rely on membrane distortions and hydrophobic mismatch-based mechanisms for their function. Reconstituting proteins with a substantial hydrophobic mismatch in cholesterol-rich membranes causes protein aggregation, low yields, and inhomogeneous distributions of proteins and lipids in the preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Hence, there is an urgent need for new experimental paradigms that would facilitate studying isolated transmembrane proteins in biomimetic, sterol-rich, defined membrane environments.</p><p id="P4">Here, we make a first step in this direction. We use methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβCD) in a dialysis setup to modulate the cholesterol content of preformed (proteo)liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). MβCD is a ring-shaped, hydrophilic oligosaccharide with hydrophobic cavity (6-6.5 Å) that is sufficiently large to accommodate cholesterol. This makes mβCD a perfect, water-soluble shuttle for either delivering or extracting cholesterol and other sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Using cholesterol-loaded mβCD in a dialysis setup maintains the (proteo)liposomes confined in a separate compartment and allows for a straightforward buffer exchange and quantitative removal of cyclodextrin after sterol delivery. We follow cholesterol insertion into liposomes and proteoliposomes quantitatively using C-Laurdan spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) and determine the rate of cholesterol delivery and removal. We demonstrate the cholesterol-dependent, membrane-based dimerization of the membrane property sensor Ire1 that monitors membrane compressibility by a hydrophobic mismatch-based mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Hence, we expand the applications of cyclodextrin in membrane research by the implementation of a dialysis setup for a direct characterization of the resulting (proteo)liposomes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P6">We wanted to establish an easy-to-use system for manipulating the concentration of sterols in preexisting liposomes and proteoliposomes. mβCD is an excellent tool for delivering sterols to model membranes and for removing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). However, once mβCD and (proteo)liposomes are mixed, it is not trivial to separate them. Normally, this separation involves size exclusion chromatography or harvesting the (proteo)liposomes by ultracentrifugation, which is both time-consuming and inefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). We wanted to know if mβCD in a dialysis setup can support lipid exchange whilst retaining (proteo)liposomes in a separate compartment. This would make subsequent preparative steps obsolete and minimize loss of material.</p><p id="P7">Both empty and cholesterol-loaded mβCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) can cross a dialysis membrane with a molecular weight cutoff of 100 kDa (pore size ≈10.5 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). By dialyzing (proteo)liposomes contained in the dialysis cassette with either cholesterol-loaded or empty mβCD, we should be able to either deliver cholesterol or to remove it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Because the (proteo)liposomes are trapped within the cassette, it should be possible to repeat this procedure several times. Hence, this experimental setup provides a means to reversibly manipulate the cholesterol concentration in pre-formed (proteo)liposomes to modulate lipid packing and membrane compressibility.</p><sec id="S3"><title>Kinetics of cholesterol delivery through a dialysis membrane</title><p id="P8">First, we were interested in the delivery of cholesterol to LUVs composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), an abundant lipid in biomembranes featuring 50% unsaturated monounsaturated lipid acyl chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Cholesterol was delivered to the LUVs in a dialysis cassette by placing it in an outer bath (V = 21 ml) containing 2.4 mM cholesterol-loaded mβCD. Cholesterol incorporation was probed, by removing 60 µl fractions of the liposome suspension at various times points and subjecting them to C-Laurdan spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). C-Laurdan is a solvatochromic probe that reports on the degree of water penetration into the lipid bilayer, which is directly related to the inter-lipid spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). The generalized polarization (GP) of C-Laurdan is a ratiometric value derived from the fluorescence emission spectrum. It can assume values from +1 (being most ordered) to -1 (being least ordered), but its absolute value depends on the instrumentation and many other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Previously, giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) formed from POPC featured a C-Laurdan GP of -0.29, while the inclusion of 40 mol% cholesterol resulted in a GP of 0.27 indicative for tighter lipid packing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). In our setup, we observed a dramatic change of the C-Laurdan fluorescence emission spectrum within a few hours of cholesterol delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Hence, cholesterol-loaded mβCD can readily pass the dialysis membrane and unload its cargo into the membrane of acceptor liposomes. Next, we tested if cholesterol can be removed from these liposomes. Upon placing the dialysis cassette with cholesterol-containing, POPC-based liposomes in a new bath containing 4.8 mM empty mβCD and a two-fold excess of POPC-based, multilamellar liposomes as a ‘sink’ for cholesterol, we observed changes in the fluorescence emission spectrum consistent with near-complete cholesterol removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). With respect to the C-Laurdan GP values, we observed an increase from -0.15 to 0.24 upon cholesterol delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>) and a decrease back to -0.16 upon cholesterol removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). While the observed changes of the C-Laurdan spectrum suggested an efficient modulation of cholesterol in the liposome membrane, we wanted to determine its precise concentration. To achieve this, we performed a calibration experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). We generated a series of POPC-based LUVs containing different cholesterol concentrations, recorded C-Laurdan fluorescence emission spectra, and plotted the experimentally determined GP values against the known cholesterol concentration under identical conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). The observed dependency of the GP values from the cholesterol concentration could be fitted reasonably well with a polynomial function, thereby providing a means to deduce the molar concentration of cholesterol based on a C-Laurdan fluorescence emission spectrum (Equation 2 – <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>). Making use of this calibration, we found that the cholesterol concentration in POPC-based liposomes reaches 31.5 mol% within five hours of delivery with an approximated initial rate of 0.22±0.01 mol% min<sup>-1</sup> using the derivative of a mono-exponential association function. Notably, almost all cholesterol can be removed again when dialyzing the cholesterol-loaded liposomes with empty mβCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The same set of experiments was performed with liposomes containing an equimolar mix of POPC and DOPC featuring 75% mono-unsaturated lipid acyl chains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-E</xref>). Consistent with the lower degree lipid packing in unsaturated membranes, we also observed lower C-Laurdan GP values for DOPC:POPC-based liposomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C-E</xref>) than for POPC-based liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D,E</xref>). During dialysis with cyclodextrin, we again observed efficient delivery and removal of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-C</xref>) and found that concentrations of ≈30 mol% are reached within five hours of dialysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D,E</xref>). The initial rate of cholesterol delivery k = 0.16±0.01 mol% min<sup>-1</sup> was ≈1.5-fold lower (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2E</xref>) compared to the more tightly packed POPC liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P10">After prolonged dialysis (&gt;24 h) the system approached an equilibrium with barely any changes of the C-Laurdan GP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F</xref>). Notably, the final concentration of cholesterol was higher in the more loosely packed membrane containing both DOPC and POPC (52.24 mol%) than in the more tightly packed POPC-based membrane (42.65 mol%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2F</xref>). Our observations suggest that the loosely packed membrane has a ≈10% higher capacity for cholesterol although cholesterol has a higher affinity to POPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Liposomes remain intact during cholesterol exchange</title><p id="P11">When used in excess, mβCD can dissolve liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Even though the lipid:mβCD ratio of 1:11 in our setup is much lower than the 1:100 ratio required for solubilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), we wanted to verify that our liposomes remain intact during cholesterol delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E,F</xref>). To this end, we generated POPC-based liposomes loaded with 75 mM carboxyfluorescein (CF). CF is a water-soluble, charged fluorophore that is only poorly fluorescent at high concentrations due to excimer formation and self-quenching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Hence, for as long as CF is contained in the liposomes, we expect the sample to exhibit only a low level of fluorescence emission. Membrane rupture or solubilization, however, should lead to unquenching of CF marked by an increase in fluorescence intensity. We recorded the CF emission during the incubation of the respective liposomes with either cholesterol-loaded or empty mβCD in real time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). As a control, we also incubated the CF-loaded liposomes in a buffer lacking mβCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). During five hours of incubation, we observed only minor changes of the fluorescence emission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E,F</xref>) compared to the 3-fold increase observed upon solubilizing the liposomes with the detergent Triton X-100 (final concentration ≈1.6 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F,G</xref>). We conclude that the liposomes remain intact during the incubation both with cholesterol-loaded mβCD or empty mβCD. This interpretation was corroborated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments, which demonstrate that the average diameter of the liposomes (197±0.7 nm) is not affected by cholesterol delivery or by cholesterol removal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B-D</xref>). Furthermore, DLS experiments confirmed the efficacy of Triton X-100 in solubilizing liposomes: For detergent-treated liposomes we detected only objects of ≈13 nm, which likely represent mixed micelles of Triton X-100 and membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Together, our experiments suggest that preformed liposomes remain intact when their cholesterol level is remodeled using mβCD.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Modulating the cyclodextrin-dependent cholesterol exchange kinetics</title><p id="P12">Next, we explored how the temperature and the molecular weight cutoff of the dialysis membrane affects the rate of sterol transfer. Initially, we performed the delivery of cholesterol into pure POPC acceptors at three different temperatures (4°C, 22-24°C, and 55°C) and across a dialysis membrane with a 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). For each temperature, we followed the C-Laurdan GPs during sterol delivery over time. Expectedly, the GP increased gradually for all temperatures but more dynamically at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Using an established calibration curve (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>), we determined the cholesterol concentration in the acceptor liposomes for a more quantitative insight. Fitting these data to a one phase exponential association model revealed the impact of temperatures on the rate of cholesterol delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>): At 55°C we obtained a 4-fold faster initial rate of cholesterol incorporation (k<sub>55°C</sub> = 0.33±0.04 mol% min<sup>-1</sup>) than at 4°C (k<sub>4°C</sub> = 0.08±0.07 mol% min<sup>-1</sup>). Likewise, the molecular weight cutoff may affect the rate of cholesterol delivery to acceptor liposomes (50 mol% POPC and 50 mol% DOPC). We tested three different dialysis membranes with molecular weight cutoffs of 3.5 kDa, 20 kDa, and 100 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-D</xref>). Compared to the rapid delivery over a dialysis membrane with a 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff (pore size of 6-10 nm), the delivery was dramatically slower across membranes with 20 kDa and 3.5 kDa molecular weight cutoffs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). The most obvious explanation is the reduced pore size, which is only 3-5 nm and 1-2 nm for the membrane with molecular weight cutoffs of 20 kDa and 3.5 kDa, respectively. Thus, the passage of mβCD across the dialysis membrane can become rate-limiting for cholesterol delivery. This is important to consider when choosing the dialysis membrane for a particular experiment. For example, a membrane with lower pore sizes could be used to ‘ramp up’ the cholesterol concentration very slowly in the (proteo)liposomes of interest.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Sterol exchange between donor and acceptor liposomes</title><p id="P13">We wanted to know if the dialysis setup is suitable to transfer sterols between liposomes. To this end, we followed the concentration of dehydroergosterol (DHE) in donor and acceptor liposomes, which were separated by a dialysis membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). DHE is a fluorescent analogue of ergosterol with three conjugated double bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). Over a broad range of concentrations, the fluorescence emission of DHE is proportional to its molar concentration in liposomes (Equation 4 - <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). This allowed us to directly quantify DHE in both compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>) thereby monitoring both cholesterol extraction and delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). In the dialysis cassette we used sonicated POPC-based liposomes with 2% DHE (donor liposomes). In the outer bath, we used a 2-fold excess of liposomes composed only of POPC (acceptor liposomes), which are initially non-fluorescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Over time, we observed a decrease in the fluorescence in the compartment with the donor liposomes and an increase in the compartment with acceptor liposomes both approaching the theoretical equilibrium concentration of 1.33 mol% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). However, our approach cannot distinguish between DHE bound to mβCD and DHE in the membrane. Assuming that the majority of DHE is in the membrane under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>), we fitted the experimental data using single exponential equations for DHE removal and delivery with a forced plateau at 1.33 mol%. The initial rate of DHE removal from the donor liposomes k<sub>don</sub> was -0.06±0.01 mol% min<sup>-1</sup> and indistinguishable from the initial rate of delivery into the membrane of acceptor liposomes k<sub>acc</sub> = 0.07 mol% min<sup>-1</sup>. This suggests that either DHE removal or the transfer of cholesterol-loaded mβCD through the dialysis membrane is rate-limiting. Furthermore, the dialysis setup helps monitoring changes of the sterol level in two communicating populations of liposomes.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Studying the impact of cholesterol on the oligomerization of Ire1</title><p id="P14">Transmembrane protein reconstitution in sterol-rich membranes is challenging especially when there is a significant hydrophobic mismatch between the protein and the lipid bilayer. Energetic penalties associated with hydrophobic mismatch are higher in sterol-rich membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), thereby lowering the efficiency of transmembrane protein insertion.

Ire1 uses a hydrophobic mismatch-based mechanism to sense aberrant stiffening and thickening of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Increased membrane thickness and reduced ER membrane compressibility in the cells drives Ire1 into dimers and higher oligomers, which ultimately, triggers the unfolded protein response controlling hundreds of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Previously, the impact of the membrane environment on Ire1 dimerization was established by continuous wave electron paramagnetic spectroscopy (cwEPR) using a spin-labeled minimal sensor protein derived from Ire1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Here, we used Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to assess the oligomeric state of a similar Ire1-based sensor construct as an alternative readout. This Ire1-based sensor construct consists of an N-terminal Maltose binding protein, a flexible linker with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition site, and the residues P501 to K570 from Ire1, covering its entire transmembrane region with a functionally relevant amphipathic helix and the short transmembrane helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). A single cysteine was introduced at the C-terminal end of the construct to facilitate fluorescent labeling by maleimide-based chemistry. To prevent complications from undesired covalent crosslinking of Ire1, the endogenous cysteine 552 in the transmembrane helix was replaced by serine. Previously, it was shown that this mutation does not affect the function of Ire1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We co-reconstituted a ATTO514- and ATTO594-labeled constructs in liposomes composed of 50 mol% POPC and 50 mol% DOPC at a molar protein-to-lipid ratio of 1:16000, which should minimize proximity-FRET from random encounters of labeled Ire1 molecules in the liposome membrane.

Under these conditions, we expect no membrane-based dimerization of Ire1 and therefore no energy transfer between the two fluorophores even though they can form a FRET pair. Indeed, upon excitation of the ATTO514-labeled donor at 514 nm, we detected barely any energy transfer that would give rise to an emission at 620 nm due to FRET (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>).</p><p id="P17">When we used our dialysis setup to deliver cholesterol to the FRET pair-containing proteoliposomes using mβCD, we observed over time increasing FRET signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B,C</xref>) suggesting an increased proximity of the donor and the ATTO594-labeled acceptor constructs likely caused by the dimerization of Ire1. No such changes in the fluorescence spectrum were observed in proteoliposomes containing the ATTO514-labeled donor alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4C</xref>). The increased FRET signal upon cholesterol delivery to FRET pair-containing liposomes was abolished, when the proteoliposomes were solubilized with detergents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B-D</xref>). We conclude that successful cholesterol delivery triggers a change in membrane properties that induces dimerization/oligomerization of Ire1-derived sensor constructs.</p><p id="P18">In contrast to classical reconstitution schemes, our mβCD-based transfer of cholesterol also allows for removing cholesterol from proteoliposomes. This reversibility also provides a means to distinguish between a functional, cholesterol-triggered oligomerization and an irreversible aggregation of a transmembrane protein from an unsuccessful reconstitution. After cholesterol was delivered to proteoliposomes containing Ire1-based donor and acceptor constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, 0h), we removed it again by placing the dialysis cassette in a new bath containing empty mβCD. The removal of cholesterol from the proteoliposomes show reestablished membrane compressibility and dissociation of Ire1 dimers. Indeed, the relative FRET efficiency was substantially lower after 5 h or cholesterol removal and even more so after 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D,E</xref>). Hence, using a dialysis-based sterol exchange setup combined with FRET we demonstrate the potential of this approach to manipulate the behavior of reconstituted transmembrane proteins in a controlled and reversible manner. Tuning sterol levels and membrane compressibility in preformed proteoliposomes could become a useful and widely used tool to study the impact of the lipid bilayer on membrane protein structure, dynamics, and function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">We have implemented an easy-to-use experimental setup to reversibly modify sterol levels in pre-existing (proteo)liposomes. Because dialysis does not require expensive instrumentation, this approach is broadly accessible to virtually every biophysical, pharmaceutical or biochemical laboratory. Sterol transfer to and from proteo(liposomes) is mediated by mβCD shuttling between two compartments separated by a dialysis membrane. Throughout sterol exchange, the (proteo)liposomes are retained in their compartment, thereby facilitating easy recovery, straightforward buffer exchange, and quantitative mβCD removal whenever necessary. Our proof-of-principle experiments with liposomes and proteoliposomes show that cholesterol delivery increases lipid packing as shown by C-Laurdan spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and decreases membrane compressibility as suggested by the membrane-driven dimerization of a membrane property sensor module derived from Ire1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p><p id="P20">The dialysis setup is versatile and provides several advantages: 1) Membrane material can be recovered with excellent yields. 2) Donor and acceptor liposomes remain separated throughout the experiment, thereby preventing undesired membrane fusion and facilitating a parallel, spectroscopic characterization of both samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E-F</xref>). 3) Sterol-rich membrane environments can be established in pre-existing proteoliposomes, which often is challenging to achieve using ‘standard’ reconstitution procedures. 4) The gradual delivery of sterol is both time- and cost-effective: A single transmembrane protein reconstitution in a sterol-free membrane provides sufficient material for a whole set of samples covering a broad range of sterol concentrations and membrane compressibilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). 5) The versatile dialysis setup is applicable not only to liposomes, but also to other nanodisc or complex biomembranes such as exosomes, thereby widening the scope of potential applications.</p><p id="P21">Nevertheless, the dialysis-based setup has limitations and not all possible applications have been explored. 1) Lipid delivery to liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) takes hours. Only sufficiently stable transmembrane proteins that ‘survive’ the time of dialysis can be suitably studied using this approach. 2) The specificity of mβCD does not guarantee the exclusive transfer of sterols, and some level of glycerophospholipid transfer cannot be ruled out. In fact, mβCD is known to bind and exchange glycerophospholipids at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), but less so at the concentrations used in this study. Yet, it will be important to quantify lipid recovery especially when handling (proteo)liposomes with complex lipid compositions. 3) While being theoretically useful for generating asymmetric liposomes, the cyclodextrin-mediated transfer of glycerophospholipids is too slow under the here established conditions (data not shown). A significant portion of glycerophospholipids delivered to the outer leaflet of an acceptor (proteo)liposome would passively flip to the luminal leaflet in the time of dialysis.</p><p id="P22">One of the key challenges in studying the structure, dynamics, and function of transmembrane proteins in complex, native-like membrane environments arises from the heterogeneous distribution of membrane components in (proteo)liposomes, which can be accentuated by the presence of sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). The mβCD-mediated delivery of sterols to pre-existing (proteo)liposomes, which is best accomplished in a dialysis setup, provides a potential work-around scheme to potentially overcome at least some of these issues. Because sterol delivery is reversible, we can distinguish between irreversible aggregation and reversible, membrane-based oligomerization as demonstrated for the sensory module of the membrane property sensor Ire1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). We are convinced that this setup for lipid exchange can be applied to both model membranes and biomembranes by providing an on-demand delivery of sterols and/or phospholipids. After manipulation of the lipid composition, individual (proteo)liposome fractions can be removed from the dialysis setup and subjected to virtually any type of biophysical analysis including fluorescence spectroscopy, CD spectroscopy, native mass spectrometry, dynamic light scattering, electron-paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy. Hence, the dialysis-based setup for a mβCD-mediated lipid transfer will be a valuable tool to characterize the structure and function of membrane proteins in different lipid environments.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Production of multilamellar vesicles</title><p id="P23">Liposomes of defined compositions were generated by mixing 1,2-dioleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC),1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and cholesterol (25 mg/ml stock) or dehydroergosterol (DHE) (1 mg/ml stock) in chloroform.

significance</title></caption><p>Generating complex, sterol-rich, biomimetic membranes for studying the structure and function of reconstituted membrane proteins is challenging. As an important step towards asymmetric, sterol-rich, complex model membrane systems, we have established a procedure to control the membrane sterol level of liposomes and proteoliposomes using methyl-β-cyclodextrin in a dialysis setup. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by C-Laurdan and dehydroergosterol fluorescence spectroscopy and gain control over the membrane sterol content. We explore several parameters that affect the rate of cholesterol delivery and show that the oligomerization of a membrane property sensor, which is on the unfolded protein response sensor protein Ire1, is controlled by the sterol content of the surrounding lipid bilayer.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Manipulating cholesterol levels in preformed membranes.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Chemical structures of molecules used in this study.

The (proteo)liposomes are trapped and separated from the outer bath containing either cholesterol-loaded or empty mβCD.

The data are derived from three independent experiments (n = 3; mean±SD). <bold>(D)</bold> The molar fraction of cholesterol is derived from the GP values in (C) and plotted with the same color code as in (C). <bold>(E)</bold> Sonicated liposomes composed of 98 mol% POPC and 2 mol% (Donors) were dialyzed in the presence of empty mβCD against a two-fold excess of POPC-based liposomes using a dialysis cassette with a 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff. <bold>(F)</bold> The transfer of DHE from donor liposomes (200 µmol) to acceptor liposomes (400 µM) at 23±1°C was followed using the DHE fluorescence emission (Ex: 324±4 nm; Em: 394±4 nm) yielding an estimate of the molar DHE concentration in the donor and acceptor liposomes (green and yellow, respectively). For the donor liposomes, the data were fitted using a one phase exponential decay (constraint at Y0 = 2.0 mol% DHE and plateau of 1.33 mol% DHE) with an R<sup>2</sup> = 0.93. For the acceptor liposomes, the data were fitted with a one phase association model (constraints for Y0 = 0 mol% DHE and the plateau of 1.33 mol% DHE) with an R<sup>2</sup> = 0.98. The data are derived from three independent experiments (n = 3; mean±SD).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199156-f003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Cholesterol insertion into proteoliposomes induces Ire1 oligomerization in a reversible manner.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Ire1 oligomerization model in response to induced lipid bilayer stress <italic>in vitro</italic>. The reconstituted Ire1 transmembrane domain (Ire1<sup>aa501-570</sup>, C552S+C) is labeled with an N-terminal MBP-tag and a C-terminal ATTO dye. For the donor construct an ATTO514 is linked at the C terminal cysteine while in the acceptor construct an ATTO-594 is linked at the C terminal cysteine. Donor and/or acceptor constructs were reconstituted in cholesterol free 50% POPC 50% DOPC liposomes (normal ER). In turn, cholesterol was gradually inserted into the membrane inducing Ire1 oligomerization (stressed ER). Transverse membrane thickness of each model is represented by black bars. <bold>(B)</bold> Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded upon donor excitation (Ex: 514 nm; Em: 525–675 nm; slit width: 3 nm) and normalized to the maximal donor emission at indicated times during cholesterol delivery via cholesterol-loaded mβCD.
