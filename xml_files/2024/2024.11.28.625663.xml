Based on striking cell-type specificity, we postulated that these mechanisms must operate early in cancer development and set out to study them in a model of von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease. Biallelic mutation of the VHL ubiquitin ligase leads to constitutive activation of hypoxia inducible factors HIF1A and HIF2A and is generally a truncal event in clear cell renal carcinoma. We used an oncogenic tagging strategy in which <italic>VHL</italic>-mutant cells are marked by tdTomato, enabling their observation, retrieval, and analysis early after <italic>VHL</italic>-inactivation. Our findings reveal markedly different consequences of HIF1A and HIF2A activation, but that both contribute to renal cell-type specific consequences of <italic>VHL</italic>-inactivation in the kidney. Early involvement of HIF2A in promoting proliferation within proximal tubular epithelium supports therapeutic targeting of HIF2A early in VHL disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The von Hippel Lindau (<italic>VHL</italic>) tumor suppressor gene (TSG) is a classical TSG which is mutated in a highly tissue-restricted range of tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Its biallelic inactivation is almost universally the truncal driver for both syndromic and sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, the most common malignancy observed in the kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. ccRCC is generally thought to arise from the proximal tubule (PT) of the renal tubular epithelium (RTE) suggesting that <italic>VHL</italic> inactivation has a unique oncogenic potential in this cell lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Despite this cell-specificity, <italic>VHL</italic> is expressed ubiquitously and encodes the recognition subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is best characterized as targeting the α-subunits of hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIFα) for oxygen-dependent degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Following <italic>VHL</italic> inactivation in PT cells, HIFα is constitutively stabilized leading to upregulation of its transcriptional targets irrespective of oxygen levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The tissue-specificity of <italic>VHL</italic>-associated cancer suggests that the oncogenic potential of HIFα activation in this setting is itself tissue-specific, leading to a major focus on defining the underlying mechanisms. HIFα has two principal isoforms, HIF1A and HIF2A which have partially overlapping sets of transcriptional targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. While HIF1A is expressed widely, HIF2A is expressed at variable levels in a more limited number of tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Although many studies support the existence of contrasting roles for HIF1A and HIF2A in the development of ccRCC, most have focused on systems representing mature or even late-stage cancer. For instance, multiple studies have identified HIF1A as unfavorable and HIF2A as favorable to the growth of ccRCC cells as xenografts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The loss of chromosome 14q, which harbors the <italic>HIF1A</italic> locus, associates with worse prognosis in ccRCC, potentially supporting an anti-oncogenic role for HIF1A in this setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In contrast, and consistent with a pro-oncogenic role for HIF2A, HIF2A specific antagonists retard the growth of ccRCC tumors in patients and ccRCC-derived xenografts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. An explanation for these effects has been suggested by the observation that HIF2A co-operates with the RTE-specific transcription factor PAX8 to upregulate cyclin D1 in ccRCC cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Crucially, these insights into the roles of HIFα isoforms in advanced disease do not necessarily inform on the earliest stages of ccRCC development. Biological understanding of such events is important, particularly in view of the potentially decades-long latency before <italic>VHL</italic>-null cancer cells develop into clinically detectable tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. This is also of potential therapeutic importance following the development of isoform-specific inhibitors of HIFα, such as the HIF2A-specific antagonist Belzutifan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. One means of interrogating the early effects of HIFα activation is by co-inactivation of each of the genes encoding HIFα isoforms with <italic>Vhl</italic>. Interestingly, when this has been done, the effects of HIFα isoform activation appear more complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">In a mouse model deploying concomitant <italic>Vhl</italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic> and/or <italic>Rb1</italic> inactivation, tumor incidence is delayed or completely prevented by co-deletion of either <italic>Hif1a</italic> (encoding HIF1A) or <italic>Epas1</italic> (encoding HIF2A), suggesting that both HIFα isoforms are necessary for oncogenesis in this setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, this work involved the use of oncogenic mutations that are rarely seen in ccRCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and does not resolve actions of HIFα isoforms at the cellular level. Studying the earlier effects of <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation has also been limited by a technological inability to identify and assay <italic>VHL</italic>-null cells in tissue precisely and in advance of morphological abnormality. To overcome this limitation, we have developed an ‘oncogenic cell tagging’ mouse model in which <italic>Vhl</italic> recombination is linked structurally to tdTomato expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. This model allows for the accurate tagging and retrieval of cells that have undergone <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation and subsequent analysis by immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Earlier analyses with this model using <italic>Pax8-CreERT2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> to drive <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation in RTE from the PT of the cortex to the collecting ducts of the papilla revealed cell-type specific patterns of proliferation and elimination which suggested that the tissue-specificity of <italic>Vhl</italic>-associated oncogenesis might be coded by cellular tolerance and adaptation to <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation that is manifest very early during ccRCC evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms underlying these processes have not yet been studied. Here, we have examined the HIFα-dependence of cellular responses and gene expression after <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation in the RTE <italic>in vivo</italic>, by coupling the oncogenic cell tagging model of <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation with conditionally inactivated alleles for <italic>Hif1a</italic> and/or <italic>Epas1</italic> (which encodes HIF2A). Our findings resolve the roles of different HIFα isoforms in this setting and reveal marked cell-type specific effects along the RTE.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Combined inactivation of <italic>Hif1a</italic> and <italic>Epas1</italic> in tdTomato-tagged <italic>Vhl</italic>-null cells</title><p id="P8">To define tissue-specific actions of biallelic <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation, an oncogenic cell tagging <italic>Vhl</italic> allele<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (<italic>Vhl<sup>pjr.fl</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) was combined with either a constitutively inactivated (<italic>Vhl<sup>jae.KO</sup></italic>) or wild-type (<italic>Vhl<sup>wt</sup></italic>) second allele of <italic>Vhl</italic>. Biallelic <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation was induced specifically in the RTE by activation of an RTE-restricted Cre recombinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> in <italic>Vhl<sup>jae.KO/pjr.fl</sup>; Pax8-CreERT2</italic> (‘VKO’) mice, following tamoxifen administration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>).

Although unrecombined forms of the <italic>Hif1a</italic> and <italic>Epas1</italic> alleles (<italic>Hif1a<sup>fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Epas1<sup>fl</sup></italic>) were also detected, signals were very weak (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the large majority of tdTomato-positive cells in VHKO, VEKO, and VHEKO mice are also <italic>Hif1a-</italic>null, <italic>Epas1</italic>-null, and <italic>Hif1a/Epas1</italic>-null respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Contrasting effects of HIFα isoforms on cell-type specific responses to Vhl inactivation in the kidney</title><p id="P11">Our previous work on the effects of <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation using this model demonstrated a substantial time-dependent loss of tdTomato-positive cells in the renal papilla following biallelic inactivation of <italic>Vhl</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. To assess the actions of HIFα on this phenotype, we induced combined recombination of <italic>Vhl</italic> and genes encoding either or both HIFα isoforms <italic>Hif1a</italic> and <italic>Epas1</italic> and compared the number of tdTomato-positive cells in the papilla across all mouse genotypes (VKO, VHKO, VEKO, VHEKO) using identical methodology to that used previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. In VKO mice, a striking loss (<italic>p</italic> = 0.020) of <italic>Vhl</italic>-null tdTomato-positive cells was observed in the papillae of kidneys examined at 4-12 months <italic>versus</italic> 1-3 weeks after <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). This reduction was abrogated in VHEKO (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.999) or VHKO mice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.311), in which tdTomato-positive cells were <italic>Hif1a</italic>-null. In contrast, the reduction in papillary cells was maintained in VEKO mice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.006), in which tdTomato-positive cells were <italic>Epas1</italic>-null (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). No statistical difference was observed in any of the ConKO, ConHKO, ConEKO, and ConHEKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a, b</xref>). This data demonstrates that the loss of <italic>Vhl</italic>-null RTE cells in the renal papilla requires HIF1A but not HIF2A.</p><p id="P12">In contrast to the survival disadvantage experienced by <italic>Vhl</italic>-null cells in the renal papilla, we have shown that <italic>Vhl</italic>-null PT cells in the renal cortex and outer medulla survive for at least 12 months post recombination and increase in number owing to transient proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, we sought to assess the HIFα-dependence of these phenotypes. No loss of tdTomato-positive cells was observed over time in the renal cortex and outer medulla in VHKO, VEKO, and VHEKO mice, indicating that neither HIFα isoform is necessary for the survival of <italic>Vhl</italic>-null cells. However, the gain in number of tdTomato-positive cells that was observed in VKO mice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.016) was absent in VHEKO and VEKO mice (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.999) and did not attain statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.335) in VHKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c, d</xref>). As with the renal papilla, none of the <italic>Vhl</italic>-competent genotypes (ConKO, ConHKO, ConEKO, and ConHEKO) exhibited significant changes in tdTomato-positive cell number over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2c, d</xref>). This indicates that the full extent of <italic>Vhl</italic>-dependent proliferation depends on the integrity of both HIFα isoforms.</p><p id="P13">To pursue this, we performed further analyses of the tdTomato-tagged cells. A tdTomato-positive cell will create two neighboring tdTomato-positive cells upon cell division. We therefore hypothesized that division and survival of tdTomato-positive cells should be reflected in a greater number of tdTomato-positive immediate neighbors at 4-12 months when compared to 1-3 weeks after <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation. Over 98% of tdTomato-positive cortical and outer medullary cells had at least one other cell, tagged or not tagged, within an internuclear distance of 16 μm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). This distance was thus chosen to denote the ‘immediate neighborhood’ for tdTomato-positive cells. Early (1-3 weeks) after <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation, tdTomato-positive cortical and outer medullary cells in VKO, VHKO, VEKO, and VHEKO mice exhibited a similar spatial distribution, with &gt;75% having one or no tdTomato-positive neighbors within their neighborhood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b, c</xref>). An increase in the number of tdTomato-positive neighbors was observed over time in VKO cells (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003) that was absent in VHEKO (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.999) and VEKO (<italic>p</italic> = 0.719) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). The number of tdTomato-positive neighbors increased over time in VHKO cells (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), but to a lower extent than it did in VKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We then tested whether the HIFα-dependent differences in accumulation of <italic>Vhl</italic>-null cells in the cortical and outer medullary renal tubules at 4-12 months were associated with HIFα-dependent differences in proliferation early (1-3 weeks) after <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation. We performed dual immunohistochemistry for tdTomato and the cell cycle marker Ki67 and quantified the proportion of tdTomato-positive cells that stained positive for Ki67 in ConKO, VKO, ConHKO, VHKO, ConEKO, VEKO, ConHEKO, and VHEKO mice early (1-3 weeks) after <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). The proportion of tdTomato-positive cells that were also Ki67-positive was increased in VKO <italic>versus</italic> ConKO cells (<italic>p</italic> = 0.049). This difference was absent (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.999) when comparing VHEKO to ConHEKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).

Data was obtained from 147,045 high-quality cells from 7 male and 5 female mice (4 mice per genotype), with an average of 12,254 ± 6438 (SD) cells per mouse, 4,933 ± 2,037 (SD) mapped reads per cell, and 1,594 ± 408 (SD) genes detected per cell. To facilitate comparison of this scRNA-seq data amongst the genotypes we first classified cells by nephron cell type using specific marker genes obtained from published scRNA-seq and anatomical studies in the kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. 95.7% of cells were assigned as PT S1, S2, or S3 proximal tubular cell types, consistent with the PT-restriction of <italic>Pax8-CreERT2</italic> at this tamoxifen dose.</p><p id="P17">After performing dimension reduction, we visualized the data by uniform manifold approximation (UMAP). Cells from different mice of the same genotype (VHKO, VEKO or VHEKO) occupied overlapping positions on the UMAP plot, indicating reproducible patterns of gene expression within genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Cells of similar nephron cell types were also positioned together in UMAP space, supporting the accuracy of cell type assignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Interestingly the UMAP analyses also revealed a previously observed dichotomy in gene expression in PT cells that was independent of cell type (PT S1, S2, S3) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. This dichotomy in PT gene expression, which we have termed ‘PT Class A’ and ‘PT Class B’, was driven by the same genes (‘PT Module A’; provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) as was observed previously and it was present in all HIFα-inactivated genotypes (VHKO, VEKO and VHEKO), indicating that it is independent of the status of HIFα-encoding genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c, d</xref>). The existence of this dichotomy <italic>in vivo</italic> was confirmed by visualization of the cell-specific expression of genes characterizing PT Class A and Class B cells by <italic>in situ</italic> RNA hybridization in all HIFα-inactivated genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4e</xref>).

To decipher the contributions of HIFα isoforms to these effects precisely, we analyzed gene expression changes across ConKO, VKO, VHKO, VEKO, and VHEKO genotypes separately in cells of each PT identity. We first used Louvain clustering on this amalgamated data to compare the magnitude of differences.

Strikingly, no overlap was observed between GO terms over-represented significantly within HIF1A- and HIF2A-specific upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), indicating that the two HIFα isoforms regulated distinct biological processes. In an effort to define common functions encompassed by the over-represented GO terms, some with redundant annotation, we clustered the GO terms based on similarities in the genes that drove their over-representation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6-8</xref>).

To do so, we first derived lists of genes that 1) constituted this early upregulation (VKO <italic>versus</italic> ConKO cells at 1-3 weeks following recombination) (‘Early Up’), and 2) constituted adaptive up- or downregulation specifically in <italic>Vhl</italic>-null cells (VKO cells at late (4-12 months) <italic>versus</italic> early (1-3 weeks) intervals following <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation (‘Adaptive Up’ or ‘Adaptive Down’).

So far this has been hard to study, in part because of difficulty in the recognition and molecular analysis of mutated cells in native tissues, in advance of the development of identifiable morphological abnormalities. We have devised a system for oncogenic tagging that allows for the recognition and analysis of <italic>Vhl</italic>-null cells and have applied it to understand the role played by the two main HIFα isoforms, both of which are constitutively stabilized and transcriptionally active immediately after <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation. To do this, we co-deleted <italic>Hif1a</italic>, <italic>Epas1</italic>, or both <italic>Hif1a</italic> and <italic>Epas1</italic>, together with <italic>Vhl</italic> using tamoxifen-inducible expression of Cre recombinase in the RTE. In tagged <italic>Vhl</italic>-null cells, very high levels of co-deletion of the genes encoding HIFα isoforms were observed. Whilst not every single tagged cell harbored genetic co-deletion of HIFα (and we therefore may have underestimated the effects of HIFα co-deletion), our strategy revealed distinct roles for the two HIFα isoforms that are of relevance to early oncogenesis following <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation.</p><p id="P28">Our analysis suggested that the tissue-specificity of <italic>VHL</italic>-associated oncogenesis is derived from the isoform-specific and cell type-specific actions of the two HIFα isoforms. Inducing <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation in papillary RTE cells resulted in their loss from the renal papilla, possibly explaining why <italic>VHL</italic>-associated cancers do not appear to arise from this site. This cell loss was rescued completely and specifically by <italic>Hif1a</italic> co-deletion, marking HIF1A as potentially ‘anti-tumorigenic’ and HIF2A as agnostic to tumorigenesis in cells in this region of the kidney. Large-scale genetic studies in many types of cultured cells have identified <italic>VHL</italic> inactivation and HIF1A activation to have negative effects on cell survival (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/portal/gene/VHL">https://depmap.org/portal/gene/VHL</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Our analysis <italic>in vivo</italic> has extended these observations to papillary epithelial cells in the normal kidney.</p><p id="P29">In this context, our observations regarding HIFα activation in the cancer-associated PT cells in the renal cortex and outer medulla are of particular interest. Here, inducing <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation did not result in cell loss but rather resulted in a significant accrual of tagged <italic>Vhl</italic>-null PT cells. That this represented cell proliferation was supported by increased numbers of tdTomato-positive cells co-expressing the marker of proliferating cells Ki67 and by increased contiguous grouping of tdTomato-positive cells in tissue. Notably, the co-inactivation of either of the two HIFα isoforms impaired all these measures of proliferation, indicating that in this setting both HIFα isoforms are tolerated and that the activation of each is necessary for the positive selection of cells in the proximal tubule. The identification of both HIF1A and HIF2A as potentially ‘pro-tumorigenic’ in the PT is consistent with work in a mouse model of ccRCC, in which the onset of renal tumors following concomitant <italic>Vhl, Trp53,</italic> and/or <italic>Rb1</italic> was dependent on both HIF1A and HIF2A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">A dependency on both HIFα isoforms may arise either because the two HIFα isoforms independently regulate a shared set of genes critical for <italic>Vhl</italic>-null cell proliferation, or because the two HIFα isoforms regulate distinct sets of genes that act in concert to confer a proliferative advantage to <italic>Vhl</italic>-null cells. Our single-cell transcriptomic analysis indicated the latter to be the case in <italic>Vhl</italic>-null cells. This is because in cells of each region of the PT, the sets of genes regulated individually by HIF1A and HIF2A showed little overlap and were enriched for distinct sets of biological pathways.

In previous work, we studied how gene expression changed both early and late after <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation. That work demonstrated two major effects; a change in gene expression that occurred early after <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation and persisted, and an additional set of changes in gene expression that occurred only after time and included downregulation of markers of PT differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Our analysis here revealed that while the changes in gene expression observed early following <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation were contributed to equally by both HIFα isoforms, the delayed changes that were super-imposed on these, including dedifferentiation of PT cells, were largely dependent on HIF2A. Thus, ultimately HIF2A contributed substantially more than HIF1A to altered gene expression in <italic>Vhl</italic>-null PT cells. It is unclear why the effects of HIF2A activation specifically take so long to manifest fully, though it is possible that new HIF2A targets are made accessible as <italic>Vhl</italic>-null cells dedifferentiate. It is also unclear what aspects of this adaptive gene regulation are necessary for, or only associate with, the long-term survival and selection of <italic>Vhl</italic>-null cells in the PT. In either case, the substantial dependency on HIF2A of gene expression and proliferation of <italic>Vhl</italic>-null cells in the proximal tubule provides support for the use of HIF2A antagonism (e.g., with the clinically approved inhibitor Belzutifan) to prevent the expansion of potential cancer cells-of-origin early in VHL disease.</p><p id="P32">Overall, our data demonstrates that the major consequences of <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation <italic>in vivo</italic> – cell-type specific elimination, proliferation, and gene expression – are all dependent on the cell-type specific, temporally-distinct and isoform-specific activities of HIFα. Additionally, we provide evidence that pro-oncogenic effects manifest only when <italic>Vhl</italic> inactivation entrains the disparate activities of both HIFα isoforms in concert.

Kidney sections were annotated manually to define regions of the renal papilla or the renal cortex and outer medulla based on morphological appearance and anatomical location in the tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Briefly, the renal cortex was identified by the presence of glomeruli and of proximal convoluted tubules (corresponding to PT S1 and S2 cell types), distal convoluted tubules, and cortical collecting ducts, each of which have characteristic tubular shape, nuclear shape, and nuclear distribution along the tubular circumference. The outer medulla was distinguished from the cortex by the absence of glomeruli and the presence of proximal straight tubules (corresponding to PT S3 cell type); it was distinguished from the inner medulla by the absence of cells of the loop of Henle, which are thinner and more densely packed than cells of the proximal straight tubule. The renal papilla, comprising cells of the collecting duct and located at the apex of the medullary pyramid, was characterized by its elongated tubules and sparse cellularity, giving it a relatively pale appearance compared to the cortex and outer medulla. Nuclei were detected using the HALO AI v3.6 Nuclei Seq algorithm based on hematoxylin (for tdTomato IHC) or methyl green (for tdTomato-Ki67 dual IHC) counterstaining. Nuclei &lt;15 μm<sup>2</sup> and &gt;200 μm<sup>2</sup> were excluded from analysis. The Red-Green-Blue (RGB) IHC image was deconvoluted computationally into individual contributions from DAB, VIP, hematoxylin, or methyl green based on known colorimetric properties of the three stains. Cells were recorded as tdTomato-positive if the tdTomato (DAB for tdTomato IHC, VIP for tdTomato-Ki67 dual IHC) signal passed a fixed intensity threshold in detected nuclei and in a 2 μm perimeter drawn around each nucleus. Cells were scored as positive for Ki67 if the signal (DAB in tdTomato-Ki67 dual IHC) passed a fixed intensity threshold in the nucleus. For tdTomato IHC, an average of 185,189 cells, and 16,109 cells per mouse were quantified in the cortex + outer medulla and papilla respectively. For tdTomato Ki67 dual IHC, an average of 125,384 cells per mouse were quantified in the cortex and outer medulla.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Dual RNA <italic>in situ</italic> Hybridization</title><p id="P42">Dual RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization was performed using the RNAscope 2.5 HD Duplex Detection Kit (ACD BioSciences 322430) on 4 μm paraffin sections cut on the previous day and baked at 60°C for 1 h.
