We previously reported that following cryoinjury, a heterogeneous population of Runx1-expressing endocardial cells differentially upregulates genes associate with scarring and myofibroblast identity. Further analysis of our published RNAseq data alongside 5 publicly available datasets now identifies additional heterogeneity in the Runx1-positive injured endocardium. Here, we show that the endocardium also reactivates a dormant endocardial-to-haematopoietic transition (EHT) mechanism. Runx1-expressing endocardial cells upregulate genes associated with haemogenesis and morphologically display features of EHT. Live imaging shows cells budding off the endocardium and lineage analysis identifies overlap with leukocyte markers. Ablation of <italic>runx1</italic> function further shifts differentiation of the endocardium towards the EHT fate. The identification of transient <italic>runx1</italic>-expressing cells transitioning towards myofibroblast or haemogenic endocardium identities demonstrates the complexity of the zebrafish endocardial injury response and highlights the role of Runx1 in regulating cell fate decisions in the endocardium.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">During regeneration, tissue repair typically occurs in a manner recapitulating the developmental processes giving rise to specific organs in the embryo so that normal tissue architecture and physiological function are restored. This re-activation of developmental pathways is thought to underlie successful regeneration by initiating processes normally dormant in the adult heart to replace lost tissue, including neovascularisation and myocardial proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. This process also takes place in the endocardial cells found in the wound area that upregulate pathways required for endocardial development, including retinoic acid, Wnt, TGF-β and Notch signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Besides signalling to cardiomyocytes to initiate a proliferative response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, the activated endocardium undergoes morphological changes and upregulates genes involved in fibrosis, such as smooth muscle genes and collagens, thereby contributing to scar formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Recently, we discovered that Runx1 is upregulated in a number of cell-types responding to injury in the zebrafish heart, including the endocardium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. <italic>Runt</italic>-related transcription factor-1, <italic>Runx1</italic> (also known as acute myeloid leukaemia 1 protein, AML1), is a key transcription factor during development and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and fate decisions of multiple cell-types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we showed that a subset of these injured <italic>runx1</italic>-positive endocardial cells upregulates a myofibroblast phenotype without losing their endocardial specific gene expression, thus taking on a dual cell-type identity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Up-regulation of this myofibroblast gene programme without commitment into fully mature myofibroblasts might be key to the formation of a scar that is temporary and can be degraded during successful regeneration. Removal of functional Runx1 results in a strong reduction of this dual endocardial-myofibroblast gene profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. This observation fits well with recent findings in other organs, highlighting the importance of Runx1 in cell-type transition, in particular epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and myofibroblast formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and its importance for cardiac repair following injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">However, the control of Runx1 on cell-type transition extends beyond EMT as Runx1 is best known for its key regulatory role in endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition (EHT) during embryonic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. During early stages of development, multipotent haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with self-renewal capability derive from endothelial cells in the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta as the definitive blood wave<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. These HSCs give rise to different hematopoietic lineages, including myeloid and erythroid progenitors. Runx1 marks these haemogenic endothelial cells and is required for the process of EHT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. While EHT was initially thought to be restricted to a specific localised set of endothelial cells only in the dorsal aorta, studies have reported another site of EHT, the developing endocardium in both mouse and zebrafish embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Most recently, Bornhorst et al have reported on the contribution of endocardial cells to the haematopoietic lineage supported by their observations of a sustained population of HSPCs/Megakaryocyte-Erythroid Progenitor cells in the endocardium of zebrafish embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, the appearance of Runx1-positive endocardial cells after injury suggests the possibility of re-activation of developmental EHT in the endocardium after injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we report that the upregulation of Runx1 in the injured endocardium can indeed be viewed as a reactivation of developmental endocardial Runx1 expression in the embryo. Detailed re-analysis of sections and published scRNA-Seq data highlights the cellular heterogeneity in the Runx1-positive injured endocardium where, in addition to a population of cells with a dual endocardial-myofibroblast phenotype, we identified a population with gene expression characteristic for haemogenic endocardium. These Runx1-positive endocardial cells in the wound acquire the morphology of haemogenic endothelial cells. Using time-lapse live imaging, we demonstrate that Kdrl-GFP endocardial cells bud off the injured endocardium. These Kdrl-positive blood cells are present in low numbers and can only be identified after injury, especially at 3dpci when the number of Runx1-positive endocardial cells in the wound also peaks. Additionally, lineage tracing analysis of the injured endocardium using the scRNA-Seq data as well as a <italic>Tg(fli1-creERT2);Tg(ubiCSY)</italic> line, provides further evidence that EHT occurs. We previously published that absence of functional Runx1 results in a strong reduction in the number of re-activated endocardial cells and these cells fail to transition towards the myofibroblast phenotype. We now find that in absence of <italic>runx1</italic>, the remaining cells favour a transition towards the EHT gene program with appearance of a mutant specific population of Kdrl-positive blood cells. These data suggest that an EHT gene programme is indeed re-activated in the injured adult endocardium with Runx1 playing an important role in lineage decisions in the endocardium. Runx1 involvement in the regulation of developmental pathways could have important implications in understanding the regenerative processes of the heart.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The injured endocardium is highly heterogeneous after injury</title><p id="P6">During fish heart regeneration, many developmental pathways typically upregulated in the aorta of the developing embryo are re-activated in the injured endocardium, including Notch, retinoic acid, Wnt and TGF-β signalling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Upregulation of the same pathways results in the activation of the transcription factor Runx1 during development, which is required for the formation of the haemogenic endothelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. In our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, we noted a temporary upregulation of Runx1 in the endocardium following cardiac injury using the <italic>TgBAC(runx1P2:Citrine)</italic> reporter line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> crossed to the <italic>Tg(kdrl:Hsa.HRAS-mCherry)</italic> line, which labels the endothelium and endocardium. To test if the injury-specific expression is a re-activation of aspects of embryonic development, we examined the expression of Runx1 in the embryonic heart using the same Runx1:Citrine; Kdrl-mCherry fish line. Analysis of the endocardium for Runx1:Citrine expression during development showed that while there were few Citrine/mCherry double-positive cells at 2 days post fertilisation (dpf), there was a strong increase at 5dpf with expression decreasing again by 7dpf, confirming expression of Runx1 in a scattered population of endocardial cells during early heart development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). Therefore, expression after injury can indeed be considered a re-activation of embryonic expression, which raises the possibility of EHT occurring after injury.</p><p id="P7">The endocardium becomes a heterogeneous cell population after injury with a subset of cells upregulating Runx1 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Notably, within the Runx1-positive cell population, we identified further heterogeneity. As previously reported, a portion of cells upregulated a Myh11-positive myofibroblast gene programme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, however, only in rare instances Myh11-positive endocardial cells also displayed an endocardial to mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) phenotype with signs of invasion of the underlying cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> blocks 1-2). We further confirmed that there was little evidence of these cells fully undergoing EndoMT despite the upregulation of key genes for mesenchymal transformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A-C</xref>). However, many of the injured Runx1-positive endocardial cells were negative for Myh11 gene expression and displayed a more rounded morphology than the Myh11-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> block 3). Such heterogeneity as present within the same tissue section (highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) underlines the possibility that a subset of cells could activate EHT genes, especially in light of the presence of Kdrl-mCherry-positive cells resembling circulating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> block 4).</p><p id="P8">Given the assumption that EHT may be a rare event and thus requiring a large number of cells for observation, our previously published scRNAseq data set (Koth <italic>et al</italic>) is well-suited for analysing this possibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. In our dataset, uninjured and 3dpci cells from the Runx1-Kdrl fish line were FACS sorted as Runx1:Citrine+, Kdrl-mCherry+ and Citrine-mCherry double positive in equal proportions to specifically enrich for the relatively sparse double-positive population. Furthermore, to increase the depth of the analysis and relate the double-positive cell population to all other cell types, we have integrated our data set together with 5 other publicly available scRNAseq data sets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> into one large integrated zebrafish heart regeneration data set with 279,384 cells in total, including cells from uninjured and injured fish up to 30dpci. This large high-resolution data set allowed to confidently identify 19 distinct cell-types present in the healthy or the injured heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary figure 1D</xref>). We then coloured the 357 wild-type <italic>runx1:citrine, kdrl-mcherry</italic> double positive cells onto the integrative UMAP for the uninjured and 3dpci samples, respectively. As expected, double-positive cells were mainly found in the endocardial cluster in the uninjured condition. However, after injury, subsets of double-positive cells displayed high heterogeneity and were located sparsely in a large range of cell type clusters, while retaining some level of <italic>kdrl</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-F</xref>). One subset of double-positive cells was present in the vasculature, in both the endothelial lining as well as in <italic>tcf21</italic>-positive perivascular cells, which we confirmed by microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>). Another large sub-set of double-positive highly proliferative cells was present as a bridge on the UMAP connecting the endocardial cells to the large leukocyte cluster which only appeared after injury, peaking at 3dpci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, arrowheads).</p><p id="P9">Considering the possible activation of EHT following cardiac injury, this direct connection between the endocardial and leukocyte clusters via proliferating cells is interesting. The bridging cells were enriched with <italic>pcna</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>), which is a key marker gene for cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Others have described that endothelial cells need to re-enter the cell cycle for EHT to occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. If the cell cycle is blocked, haemogenic endothelial cells lose their ability to undergo this transitional process. The endocardium is known to be highly proliferative after injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, and the overlap of <italic>pcna</italic> expression with Runx1:Citrine in the endocardium confirms this occurs within the Runx1-positive cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1F</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The large number of double positive cells within the highly proliferative endocardium-leukocyte bridging cluster, with a subset present in the directly neighbouring leukocyte population is highly suggestive of a transitionary state between the endocardium and leukocyte populations. Therefore, Runx1-positive endocardial cells can upregulate gene programmes involved in either myofibroblast or perivascular cell differentiation, but also a transcriptional programme suggestive of the possible transition towards a leukocyte phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The injured endocardium gains features of endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition upon injury</title><p id="P10">A number of recent scRNAseq studies on the process of EHT have identified that the cell cycle status discriminates the haemogenic endothelium from its progenitors. As cells transit from an endothelial state towards a haematopoietic state, they lose expression of endothelial genes and enter the cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesised that the highly proliferative cell cluster connecting the endocardial population with the also highly proliferative leukocytes could represent EHT. While we observed three additional UMAP bridges between the endocardial and blood cell clusters, these did not contain double positive <italic>Runx1:Citrine;Kdrl-mCherry</italic> cells and detailed analysis indicated they did not warrant further attention in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). To gain a better understanding of the highly proliferative cells in the bridge of interest and potential haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), we isolated the bridging cells and performed further sub-clustering analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>) to identify the key cellular processes and signalling pathways, characterising each sub-cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Clusters 1 and 2 that were located within or close to the large endocardial cluster were represented by processes including <italic>vasculature development</italic> and <italic>blood vessel morphogenesis</italic> and were enriched for genes involved in <italic>hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation</italic>, while still expressing endocardial genes such as <italic>kdrl, fli1a</italic> and <italic>cdh5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-D</xref>). These gene expression profiles indicate the similarity of these clusters to the pre-haemogenic endothelium as seen during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Clusters 3 and 4 were largely located within the highly <italic>pcna</italic>-positive UMAP bridge and connecting leukocyte cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The proliferative status of clusters 3 and 4 was reflected by processes enriched for <italic>cell cycle</italic>, which is characteristic of the haemogenic endothelium itself as well as HSPC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Mapping specific genes of interest onto the bridging cells in question shows that <italic>kdrl</italic> levels decreased from cluster 1 to 4, while <italic>pcna</italic> levels increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Clusters 1 and 2 expressed genes such as <italic>gata2a</italic> and <italic>tal1</italic>, which are key initiators of EHT. Cluster 4, which was enriched for genes involved in processes for <italic>“RUNX1 regulates transcription of genes involved in differentiation of HSCs”</italic>, had low levels of expression of endocardial genes, but high levels of genes like <italic>myb, gata2b</italic> and <italic>spi1b</italic>, suggesting this cluster has HSPC-like characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. <italic>myb</italic> and <italic>gata2b</italic> are also required for myeloid and lymphocyte differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, and expression of <italic>sla2</italic> in the HSPC-like cluster suggests differentiation towards this lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Some cells expressed the macrophage marker <italic>mpeg1.1</italic>, while others expressed the neutrophil marker <italic>mmp9</italic>, suggesting differentiation towards several different blood lineages in this highly proliferative cluster. While <italic>tal1</italic> was expressed in the cells resembling pre-haemogenic endothelium, we did not note any expression in the cells possibly undergoing EHT, suggesting no evidence of erythrocyte differentiation of these cells. To investigate the scRNAseq findings, we analysed the 3dpci Runx1-positive endocardium for expression of transcription factors which are known to be key to the process of EHT, <italic>gata2b, myb</italic> and <italic>tal1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). We could indeed detect these genes in the Runx1:Citrine positive endocardium. These data fit well with the knowledge that haemogenic endothelium gives rise to multi-lineage haematopoietic populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> and provides further evidence that haemogenesis in the endocardium could occur.</p><p id="P11">Our analysis so far confirms that a subset of injured Runx1-positive endocardial cells activates an EHT gene programme. In light of our findings on the transient upregulation of a myofibroblast gene programme without much evidence of differentiation into full myofibroblasts, we questioned if the cells could similarly upregulate EHT genes as a feature of an inflammatory phenotype in endocardial cells without fully transitioning into blood lineages. Upregulation of inflammatory genes has been found in injured endocardial cells in zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> and endothelial cells in mouse after myocardial infarction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Therefore, we visualised the expression of key inflammatory markers on the integrative UMAP, including <italic>tnfa, nfkb</italic> and <italic>il1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, we did not observe upregulation of these inflammatory markers in the endocard ium after injury, with only marginal upregulation in the EHT clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Specifically looking at the EHT bridging clusters, there was slightly higher expression towards the HSPC-like cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), which we have shown has lost its endocardial identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-D</xref>). The published upregulation of inflammatory genes in the injured zebrafish endocardium was restricted to a very small cell population peaking at 3dpci that was identified using the Hu <italic>et al</italic> scRNAseq data set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. To better understand the nature of these cells in relation to our data, we also sub-clustered the endocardial cells from Hu <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and identified 2 small clusters with inflammatory gene profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3A-B</xref>). Plotting these cells onto our integrated data set revealed that these cells were mostly distributed throughout the large endocardial cluster of our integrated data, indicating a lack of unique identity when compared to other data sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3C-D</xref>). However, a small subset of endocardial cells was present within the T-cell cluster of the integrated data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, arrowhead in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>), which aligns well with the reported upregulation of T-cell markers <italic>cd74a/b</italic> and <italic>mhc2</italic> genes, including <italic>mhc2dab</italic>, in the endocardium after injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. As these cells clustered within the T-cell population and only expressed low levels of endocardial genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3E</xref>), we questioned if these cells could be endocardial cells differentiating into T-cells via EHT, especially as Cd4<sup>+</sup> T-helper cells were previously identified directly neighbouring these cd74-positive endocardial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Based on the upregulation of lymphoid differentiation-related genes in EHT cluster 4, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) and the published role of Cd74 in EHT, we then plotted <italic>cd74a/b</italic> and <italic>mhc2dab</italic> onto the EHT subclusters, which showed these genes being upregulated in HSPC-like EHT cluster 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Therefore, in contrast to the dual temporary myofibroblast-endocardial identity we previously described, we do not find clear evidence of a temporary dual inflammatory-endocardial gene programme.

PAGA trajectory analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> revealed a close association among the four EHT clusters, suggesting a potential transition sequence from EHT1 to EHT4, followed by differentiation into proliferating macrophages and T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). To confirm the origin of the EHT trajectory, we utilised the unique LINNEUS approach included in Hu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. By employing Cas9, DNA scars were generated during early development, allowing lineage tracing analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Although the scar read depth was limited to confirm the association of endothelial cells with downstream EHT clusters 1-2, there was corroborating evidence suggesting a potential transition from endocardial cells to EHT clusters 3-4 and subsequently to leukocyte populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Selecting the endocardium as the initial state for trajectory analysis in Cellrank also suggested the possibility of a gradual transition towards an HSPC-like terminal state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>). This likely presents the emergence of proliferating marcophages and T cells from haematogenic endocardial cells as validated by FateID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E-F</xref>)..</p><p id="P13">As the scRNAseq lineage analysis supports the transition from endocardial to a haematopoietic phenotype, we looked in more detail into the morphology of the Runx1:Citrine positive endocardial cells. It has previously been described that endocardial cells in the injury area undergo morphological changes and round up<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Considering the evidence indicating EHT occurring in the endocardium, Runx1:Citrine positive cells indeed show morphological features of cells rounding up as also seen during the phenotypic transition in the embryo, suggesting the cells could successfully transition away from the endocardial phenotype. Runx1-positive endocardial cells were observed to display different morphologies, from flat, bulging to rounded up. A small number of cells was found with no apparent connection to the rest of the endocardial sheet (Morphologies 1-5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). While endocardial gene expression is turned off during EHT, it is possible to detect past gene expression due to the longer half-life of fluorescent proteins. The Tg(<italic>kdrl:GFP</italic>) zebrafish line has been extensively used in haemogenic endothelium studies during development because of the cytosolic labelling of endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next used the Tg(<italic>kdrl:GFP</italic>) line to examine for Kdrl-GFP-positive circulating cells on fixed sections. Small numbers of these cells could indeed be observed in the lumen near the injury site at 3dpci, with different levels of GFP-fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). Additionally, co-staining with a lyC antibody that labels neutrophils, showed that in some cells still weakly GFP-positive there was overlap with lyC, suggesting that these endocardial-derived cells have obtained a neutrophil identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>). This observation mirrors what happens in the embryonic zebrafish endocardium, where blood cells derived from haemogenic endocardium display neutrophil characteristics as marked by the positive labelling for lyz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Combined, these data provide further evidence of endocardial cells gaining characteristics of haemogenic endothelium after injury of the adult heart and successfully undergoing cell fate transition.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Live imaging and in vivo lineage tracing show the presence of endocardial-derived blood lineages</title><p id="P14">While the activation of Runx1 after injury recapitulates developmental expression and cells of the injured Runx1-positive endocardium upregulate genes involved in EHT and display the associated changes in morphology, live imaging has been essential in establishing the occurrence of this process in the embryo. To achieve this in the adult heart, we generated 75um thick live cardiac sections which were imaged for 15-24 hours, similar to a recently published approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> using the Tg(<italic>kdrl:GFP</italic>) line which labels the endocardium with GFP and has been widely used to image the haemogenic endothelium during development. Images were taken every 10 minutes over 15 hours on 3dpci ventricle slices, the peak timepoint when EHT is indicated to occur. Examples of endothelial cells rounding up, before detaching from the endocardial surface could indeed be observed in these time-lapse movies in a similar manner to that seen during EHT in development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>). The detached cells disappeared out of focal view immediately after detaching. While we were able to visualise a number of events resembling EHT, these events were rare (4/22 experiments). On one occasion, we also observed a GFP-positive cell detach from the endothelium of a vessel in the compact wall of the ventricle near the injury site. This suggests the injured vascular endothelium as another location exhibiting features of haemogenic endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), which would fit well with the observation of upregulation of <italic>Runx1</italic> in the large vessels in the injury area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Next, we used the <italic>Tg(fli1a-creERT2)</italic> line crossed to the <italic>Tg(ubiCSY)</italic> line to allow for lineage analysis of the endocardium. YFP staining at 3dpci recapitulated the staining seen with the <italic>kdrl</italic> lines, with rounded up endocardial cells present in the injury region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). At 7dpci, we observed a diverse range of circulating YFP positive cells in the ventricular lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D-E</xref>). Double staining for YFP and lyC indicated that while some YFP cells were lyC positive and likely neutrophils, not all were, fitting with the multilineage potential of HSPCs derived from haemogenic endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). Importantly, while most YFP-positive endocardial cells in the wound were positive for <italic>kdrl</italic> mRNA, the cells with more rounded morphology did not express <italic>kdrl</italic> anymore, as would be expected when they undergo the transition towards a haematopoietic phenotype. In line with this, we also did not identify any <italic>kdrl</italic> mRNA in lineage traced YFP-positive circulating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). To further confirm that <italic>kdrl</italic> is not normally expressed in some circulating cells, we probed the integrated scRNAseq data for <italic>kdrl</italic> expression. There was no difference in the numbers of <italic>kdrl</italic>-positive cells before and after injury in the scRNAseq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A-B</xref>). Additionally, while <italic>kdrl</italic> seemed to be expressed to some extent in all cell-types, including unexpectedly in cardiomyocytes and mature circulating cell populations, further analysis revealed that this could be considered background expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4A-C</xref>). We confirmed this on sections, where we did not observe <italic>kdrl-mcherry</italic> (data not shown) or <italic>kdrl-GFP</italic>-positive cardiomyocytes or circulating cells in the uninjured heart at any point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4D</xref>) or any lyC-positive Kdrl-GFP-positive cells in the kidney (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4E</xref>). Additionally, if <italic>kdrl</italic> mRNA expressing circulating cells are present, based on the scRNAseq data, <italic>kdrl</italic> would be expressed in mature leukocytes, including neutrophils and macrophages and therefore likely be stable. However, the <italic>Tg(fli1a-creERT2); Tg(ubiCSY)</italic> lineage traced leukocytes did not express <italic>kdrl</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). These results show that not only does a portion of the injured <italic>runx1</italic>-positive endocardium upregulate an EHT gene programme, at least a small proportion of these cells seems able to successfully transition into blood cell lineages as observed during development.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Haemogenic endocardium is altered in absence of functional runx1</title><p id="P16">Since Runx1 is a key regulator of EHT, we next investigated how loss of Runx1 activity would influence this process, and subsequently if formation of cells with a haemogenic endocardial gene programme was impacted. The adult viable <italic>runx1<sup>W84X/W84X</sup></italic> global mutant contains a premature truncation mutation in the Runt domain causing an almost complete loss of Runx1 activity. Crossing this line to the <italic>TgBAC(runx1P2:Citrine);Tg(kdrl:Hsa.HRAS-mCherry)</italic> line allowed to analyse Citrine activity via the BAC P2 promoter which serves as a readout for Kdrl-mCherry positive endocardial cells that would have expressed Runx1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. To understand any differences in EHT between the Runx1 mutant and wild-type cells in light of the previously reported difference in myofibroblast phenotype, we re-analysed the data on which the UMAP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref> from Koth et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> was based. This UMAP included all <italic>runx:citrine; kdrl-mcherry</italic> double positive cells from wild-type uninjured and 3 dpci samples as well as 200 cells from the Runx1 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Among the 5 clusters previously defined, the red cluster (cluster 3) seemed to be a transition cluster located right at the boundary for transition into either a myofibroblast or haematopoietic fate. In particular, visualisation of the 5 double positive cell clusters both using a diffusion map and within the integrated UMAP highlights that after injury, the red transitionary cluster (cluster 3) exhibits a binary shift towards both cell lineages. In the wild-type condition, cluster 3 cells appeared to be in favour of the transition to the highly <italic>myh11a</italic> positive myofibroblasts (purple, cluster 4), while the <italic>runx1</italic> mutant favoured the hematopoietic cell identity as evident by the expanded cluster of highly proliferative leukocytes (orange, cluster 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-C</xref>). To better understand this phenotype in relation to all endocardial cells, next, we re-analysed 5474 cells defined as endothelial/endocardial cells from the Koth data set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and reassigned these cells into 13 distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). On the UMAP, 2 injury-responsive clusters appear in the wild-type at 3dpci, one characterised by the myofibroblast marker <italic>tagln</italic> (cluster 11) and the other by high <italic>pcna</italic> expression levels with cells in S and G2M phase (cluster 8). In contrast, the myofibroblast cluster (Cluster 11) is absent in the <italic>runx1</italic> mutant, but there is an increase in <italic>pcna</italic> positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5C</xref>). To determine if this <italic>pcna</italic> positive cluster serves as a progenitor pool emerging from the endocardial cluster and as a progenitor pool for a downstream cell type, we performed RNA velocity analysis capturing full transcriptional dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). This showed that the <italic>pcna</italic>-positive cluster transitions away from the endocardial cells, suggesting fate transition towards another cell phenotype. Plotting 3dpci <italic>runx1</italic> mutant and wild-type <italic>pcna</italic> on the integrated UMAP shows that <italic>pcna</italic> expression reflects the pattern of the <italic>runx1:citrine, kdrl-mcherry</italic> double positive cells within the leukocyte cluster and suggests a higher occurrence of EHT in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). Therefore, Runx1 may be responsible for regulating the balance between obtaining a myofibroblast versus EHT cell fate.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Absence of Runx1 alters cell identity programmes</title><p id="P17">Following the observation that in the absence of functional Runx1 there is a switch from a myofibroblast gene programme towards a leukocyte gene programme, we looked into how these EHT-associated cells distributed among the different leukocyte compartments in the presence or absence of Runx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A-B</xref>). Interrogation of the Koth data set in the integrated data at 3dpci in the <italic>runx1<sup>W84X/W84X</sup></italic> mutant displayed an expansion of the macrophage and T-cell compartments when compared to the injured wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Specifically, mutation of functional Runx1 promoted an increase in highly proliferative cells expressing <italic>myb</italic> and <italic>gata2b</italic>, two transcription factors known for their role in regulating proliferation and cell differentiation decisions in the haemogenic endothelium and HSPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B-C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.

We subsequently tested whether this had a downstream effect on the induction of haematopoietic differentiation programmes and the populations of myeloid and lymphoid cells derivatives. Comparison of the expression of haematopoietic regulators and EHT markers in the bridging EHT clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) in wild-type and mutant showed a strong increase of EHT-related genes as well as proliferation and erythropoiesis genes in the <italic>runx1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). We have previously observed that the integrated data set did not show significant evidence of erythrocyte differentiation as marked by <italic>tal1</italic> expression occurring in the HSPC-like cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Deletion of <italic>runx1</italic>, however, seemed to promote erythrocyte differentiation, albeit that there was evidence of overall increased erythrocyte lysis in the mutant that could have biased this finding. T cell differentiation was also increased in the mutant as evident by the increase in <italic>alas2</italic> and <italic>sla2</italic> positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>). Conversely, macrophage differentiation was reduced as shown by the reduced numbers of <italic>mpeg1.1</italic>-positive cells in relation to wild type in the Koth data in the integrated dataset.</p><p id="P18">This preference in cellular transition in the mutants was also observed on tissue sections where smaller and immature looking Runx1:Citrine; Kdrl-mCherry positive circulating cells were present at the injury site in the <italic>runx1</italic> mutant, both within the lumen as well as within the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). Together, these results further support our observation that haemogenic endocardium is altered in the absence of <italic>runx1</italic>. Thus, Runx1 may be involved in the regulation of the balance of different EHT branches or could be responsible for inducing macrophage formation while alternative regulators may be present for the induction of erythroid and T cell programmes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">During development, endocardial cells mainly provide the inner lining of the heart but also contribute to the formation of other cardiac cell populations including fibroblasts of the heart valves, the coronary vasculature and blood cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.

Lately, there has been renewed interest in this process due to possible discrepancies in reported findings of Cre expression systems. Multiple groups report the embryonic endocardium behaving similar to haemogenic endothelium and contributing to erythroid, platelet and myeloid lineages in mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup> as well as zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Our observation of Runx1 expression, a known marker of haemogenic endothelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, in the developing endocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) aligns with recent reports of EHT and transient haematopoiesis occurring in the zebrafish endocardium during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>.While one study reports 24hpf as the peak of EHT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, we only see the initiation of Runx1expression from around 2dpf. The peak of Runx1 expression we observed at 5dpf fits better with more recent reporting of the first Runx1-positive cells attached to the endocardium at 56hpf and EHT peaking at 72hpf<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. While we have not further investigated the formation of the embryonic haemogenic endocardium, this suggests multiple waves of EHT occurring during development, with Runx1 involvement in the later wave. Multiple scRNAseq studies have highlighted the heterogeneity of EHT for the generation of the various haematopoietic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. Therefore, it could be possible that two waves of induction of haemogenic endocardium occur in the embryo which contribute to different blood lineages. The first wave of EHT at 1dpf seems likely to mostly give rise to neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, while other cell types may be derived in a subsequent induction of haemogenic endocardium around 3-5dpf.</p><p id="P21">In addition to the previously published transition into a myofibroblast phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, we now find evidence of another sub-population of Runx1-expressing endocardial cells in the adult heart after injury that transition towards a haematopoietic fate. The expression of Runx1 is key for this lineage decision, as in absence of functional Runx1, the cells shift from the myofibroblast lineage towards the haematopoietic identity. A similar role for Runx1 during cell identity transition has also been described in other organs, where Runx1 determines the balance between proliferation and differentiation, with control over cell-type transitions towards myofibroblast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and haematopoietic lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. However, how some endocardial cells are primed to make those decisions and what triggers and regulates these gene expression changes is not known. A transient identity shift towards a smooth muscle cell-like phenotype, without loss of the endocardial identity, could be key for successful scar degradation and regeneration. Likewise, the upregulation of an EHT gene programme in the endocardium might largely be transient, with only a subset of cells actively undergoing full transition to HSPCs as similarly to our lineage tracing of myofibroblasts, we found only few circulating haematopoietic cells with an endocardial origin. The activation of EHT seems to have a positive impact on regeneration as EHT is enhanced in the faster regenerating <italic>runx1</italic> mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, highlighting that Runx1 expression after cardiac injury is suboptimal for tissue repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> which possibly facilitates scarring of the heart.</p><p id="P22">Injured cardiac endothelial and endocardial cells have previously been shown to also upregulate inflammatory gene programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup> and cytokine signalling from the endocardium is known for its role in regeneration, specifically for regulating EMT and inducing myocardial proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>.</sup> Therefore, expression of Runx1 could also be important for activation of a transient inflammatory state in response to endocardial injury. However, we identified no clear activation of inflammation in the injured Runx1-positive endocardium. This lack of upregulation of a broad inflammatory gene programme in response to injury could be a critical difference to the mammalian response after injury in terms of regenerative capacity. Some injured endocardial cells have recently been found to upregulate antigen presentation genes, which have been suggested to communicate to infiltrating adaptive immune Cd4+ T helper cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Tracing these antigen presenting endocardial cells in our integrated data set suggests that these cells might part of the population of cells undergoing EHT that is differentiating towards a T cell identity.

Recent findings on blood cell populations in the <italic>runx1</italic> mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup> highlight that these haematopoietic populations are also present in absence of injury. Since <italic>runx1</italic> is known as a key regulator during definitive haematopoiesis, it is unclear how some <italic>runx1</italic> mutants survive during early development in absence of definitive haematopoiesis in the dorsal aorta, and still develop multilineage blood populations. The endocardium could hence be the source of these blood cells during development for which Runx1 function during EHT is dispensable. This would support our data, showing that in absence of <italic>runx1</italic>, a shift towards EHT versus myofibroblast identity occurs after injury. Further evidence shows that endocardial-specific deletion of Runx1 does not affect the production of endocardial-derived macrophages from multipotent hematopoietic progenitors during mouse embryonic development, revealing that endocardial-derived macrophages are not Runx1-dependent and hence, not definitive in nature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We, however, observed that deletion of <italic>Runx1</italic> resulted in the increase of erythrocyte and T cell populations but reduced the cluster size for mpeg1.1 positive macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7D</xref>) which does not fully align with the embryonic mouse data. Our observation for the reduction of the macrophage cluster and shift towards T-cell and erythrocyte phenotypes thus could imply the possible presence of distinct haematopoietic pathways present in the adult zebrafish heart. Further work is needed however to identify the specific mechanisms via which these varied responses arise.</p><p id="P24">There is evidence that leukocytes with an endocardial origin may have unique functions. In particular, EHT-derived macrophages from the developing mouse valves were shown to persist from E10.5 to adulthood and exhibit a distinct predominantly M2 phenotype displaying higher levels of phagocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. This suggests that macrophages (and other leukocyte populations) derived from the injured endocardium could be distinct from macrophages from other sources and have different functions after injury. As EHT is increased in the Runx1 mutant and this mutant has enhanced regeneration, leukocytes derived from the EHT process could have specific positive functions during regeneration. Specifically, higher levels of phagocytosis by macrophages after injury could increase scar degradation and speed up regeneration, which aligns with the reduced levels of scarring we previously observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. However, the function and contribution to heart regeneration of endocardial-derived leukocytes requires further investigation as we identified the presence of both lyC positive and negative circulating cells which is suggestive of endocardial contribution to different leukocyte compartments.</p><p id="P25">Our study combines extensive bioinformatic and <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis to show that EHT mechanisms are reactivated following injury and that Runx1 is involved in this process.

In particular, the extent to which endocardial cells undergo the full transition towards leukocyte populations after injury needs further investigation as well as the role these unique blood populations could play during successful regeneration. Additionally, further research into the role of Runx1 as regulator of the balance between cardiac fibrosis and successful regeneration will increase our understanding of the cardiac injury response and provide candidate targets for therapeutic modulation in the injured heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Zebrafish strains and husbandry</title><p id="P26">All experiments were carried out under appropriate Home Office licenses and in compliance with the revised Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 in the UK and Directive 2010/63/EU in Europe, and all have been approved by Oxford’s central Committee on Animal Care and Ethical Review (ACER).
