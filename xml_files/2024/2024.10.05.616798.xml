In order to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning the sensory changes, single nuclei RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics were employed to profile the transcriptional landscape at single cell resolution of human trigeminal nerves and neuromas. Cellular and transcriptional changes were identified that correlated with the presence of pain, including an expansion of endothelial cells with a pro-inflammatory phenotype and over-expression of <italic>HLA-A, CXCL2</italic> and <italic>CXCL8</italic>. Interactome analysis highlighted signalling changes linked with the presence of pain. HLA-A protein expression was confirmed in neuromas and positively correlated with symptoms of pain.

In addition to loss of motor and sensory function, a proportion of patients have persistent pain for which there is no reliable treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. This is associated with sleep disturbances, depression and various debilitating psychological problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Injuries to branches of the trigeminal nerve, most commonly the lingual and inferior alveolar nerves, can occur as a result of routine dental procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. While peripheral nerves regenerate spontaneously, in some patients the presence of a gap between the proximal and distal ends, bone fragments, scar tissue and inflammation may prevent functional reinnervation of the target areas, resulting in the formation of a swollen mass termed neuroma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The frequency of lingual nerve injuries during oral and maxillofacial procedures varies between 0.6-2%, resulting in anaesthesia, paraesthesia or hyperesthesia of the floor of the mouth, the lingual gingiva and the anterior part of the tongue, affecting everyday activities such as speaking, eating and drinking and potentially leading to altered taste<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In addition, some patients report the presence of neuropathic pain, often described as a burning sensation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. To treat these symptoms, patients can undergo nerve repair surgery where the neuroma is resected and the nerve ends are surgically reconnected, promoting functional recovery of sensation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Human lingual neuromas represent a unique resource to investigate mechanisms linked with neuropathic pain. The comparison between samples from patients that have incurred the same type of injury, where some, but not all, report symptoms of pain, enables the identification of factors specifically linked with neuropathic pain, which are independent from the pathophysiological changes associated with nerve injury and regeneration. Previous work on human neuromas highlighted changes in the molecular expression of selected targets including ion channels, MAP kinases and inflammatory mediators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. High-throughput bulk transcriptomics has been employed to identify overall differences in non-trigeminal neuromas compared to healthy uninjured controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, detailed characterisation of the cellular composition and the transcriptional changes linked with the severity of pain at single cell level in human neuromas has never been performed.</p><p id="P4">In this work, we sought to characterise the cellular and transcriptional composition of healthy and injured trigeminal nerves and identify molecular changes in human trigeminal neuromas linked with the presence of pain. Single nucleus RNA sequencing was employed on samples of healthy and injured human trigeminal nerves to characterise the cellular composition at single cell resolution. Spatial transcriptomics was performed on a larger pool of human lingual neuromas, including both painful and non-painful samples, to characterise the transcriptional landscape within the morphological context and identify changes in gene expression localised within the nerve fascicles. Cell-cell interactome analysis was performed to identify changes in signalling networks linked with the presence of pain. RNAscope and immunohistochemistry were used to validate the findings.</p><p id="P5">Several transcriptional changes linked with the presence of pain were identified, including over-expression of <italic>HLA-A, CXCL2</italic> and <italic>CXCL8</italic> in painful samples, highlighting the role of inflammation in neuropathic pain. The protein expression of <italic>HLA-A</italic> was confirmed in neuromas and positively correlated with symptoms of pain. The unique atlas generated here provides a detailed spatial overview of the cell types that populate human peripheral trigeminal nerves, in health and injury, and their transcriptional profile. The comparison of painful and non-painful samples highlighted several changes in cellular composition, transcriptome and inferred molecular signalling linked specifically with the presence of pain.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Single nuclei RNA sequencing reveals the cellular composition of healthy and injured human trigeminal nerves</title><p id="P6">In order to characterise the cellular composition of trigeminal nerves with and without injury in humans, single nuclei RNA sequencing was employed on samples of mechanically dissociated trigeminal nerves and neuromas.

Nuclei with fewer than 500 reads and 250 genes detected, a novelty score lower than 0.8 and the presence of mitochondrial genes higher than 5% were removed. After quality control, data from 56,959 nuclei were kept, 21,990 from lingual neuromas and 34,969 from trigeminal root nerves, with a median of 1,305 genes detected per nucleus. The data was analysed with Seurat, performing SCT normalisation, rPCA integration and clustering at resolution 0.5.

The atlas highlights the role of endothelial cells in neuropathic pain, which display a pro-inflammatory phenotype and are more abundant in neuromas, particularly in the samples linked with pain, compared to healthy nerves. Additionally, differential expression analysis indicated over-expression of <italic>HLA-</italic>A and <italic>NLRC5</italic>, involved in antigen presentation, and the chemokines <italic>CXCL2</italic> and <italic>CXCL8</italic>. Protein expression of HLA-A was localised to blood vessels and exhibited a correlation with symptoms of pain. These findings contribute to the idea that inflammation is a prominent aspect of neuropathic pain, with increased antigen presentation and chemokine signalling in painful neuromas. Further work is needed to identify whether genetic factors might predispose the immune system to a heightened response to injury and result in higher inflammation and pain chronification.

The counts from each section were aggregated for pseudo-bulk differential expression analysis, performed with DEseq2 (1.44)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup>. After performing variance-stabilizing transformation with the vst function from DEseq2, principal component analysis (PCA) analysis was conducted with the package PCAtools (2.16). DE analysis was performed with DEseq2. Nominal P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method and the logarithmic fold changes (LFC) were shrunk with the approximate posterior estimation for generalized linear model (apeglm) method to reduce the variance of LFCs caused by low or variable gene counts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup>. Genes with an adjusted p-value lower than 0.05 were deemed to be differentially expressed. The volcano plot and graphs of normalized counts were generated with the R package ggplot. The expression of the top DE genes in the snRNA-seq dataset was visualised with Seurat and ggplot.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Inference of cell-cell communication</title><p id="P61">CellChat v2 (2.1.2) was used to investigate changes in cell-cell interactions between the clusters in the Visium data in painful and non-painful samples. CellChat is based on a manually curated database, CellChatDB, which takes into account ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions as well as the presence of co-factors and multimeric complexes. Intercellular communication is calculated based on a mass action model, along with differential expression analysis and statistical tests on cell groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P62">The count matrices of all samples, separated by painful and non-painful, and the cluster annotation from Harmony integration performed with Giotto were used to create the cellchat objects, using the identities of Schwann cells (SC), endothelial cells (Endo), perineurial cells (Peri), B cells (Bcells) and macrophages (Macro). The spatial information from json files generated by spaceranger were used to account for the distances between barcodes. Standard cellchat workflow was used for the generation of the cell-cell interaction inference network, using the human ligand-receptor database. Dysfunctional signalling was identified with differential expression analysis. The interactions were visualised with the plotting functions provided by CellChat, including chord plots, circos plots and heatmaps.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>RNAscope</title><p id="P63">RNAscope in situ hybridization multiplex version 2 was performed as instructed by Advanced Cell Diagnostics (ACD) following the fixed-frozen tissue preparation protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref></sup>. Antigen retrieval was performed in a steamer at 95°C for 5 minutes with ACD 1X Antigen Retrieval Reagent. Protease treatment was performed with Protease III at room temperature for 1 minute. RNA quality in all tissues was checked by using a positive control probe cocktail (ACD) which contains probes for high, medium and low-expressing mRNAs expressed in all cells (ubiquitin C, Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B and DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB1). A negative control probe against the bacterial DapB gene (ACD) was used to reference non-specific/background label. The following probes were used: RNAscope™ 3-plex <italic>Hs-SOX10-C1</italic>, targeting <italic>SOX10</italic>, and RNAscope™ <italic>3-plex Hs-PTGDS-C2</italic>, targeting <italic>PTGDS</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p id="P64">Frozen sections of human neuromas cut at a thickness of 10 μm and placed on Superfrost Plus slides were thawed and washed in PBS-T (0.2% Triton-X in PBS). The following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-HLA-A (Abcam, ab52922, 1:1000), mouse monoclonal anti-NGFR (Abcam, ab3125, 1:200), rabbit polyclonal anti-PI16 (Atlas, HPA043763, 1:200), mouse monoclonal anti-TUJ1 (BioLegend, 801202, 1:100), rabbit polyclonal anti-GLUT-1 (Abcam, Ab15309, 1:400) and mouse monoclonal anti-CD45 (Abcam, Ab8216, 1:400). Labelling of endothelial cells was performed with fluorescein conjugated Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin I (Vector Laboratories, FL-1061, 1:50). The sections were incubated with 20% Normal Donkey Serum in PBS-T for 1 hour at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% NDS in PBS-T and incubated overnight at 4°C. The slides were washed with PBS-T and incubated with a secondary antibody diluted in 1.5% NDS in PBS-T for 90 minutes in the dark. Sections were mounted in Vectashield Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, H-1200-10), cover-slipped and sealed.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Image Acquisition</title><p id="P65">Images were acquired using a Leica DMi8 inverted microscope fitted with a Leica K5 sCMOS microscope camera system.

Maximal intensity projections were generated from z-stacks of tile-scans of the tissue sections imaged at 20X magnification. A threshold was selected to isolate areas positive for HLA-A labelling and the percentage of the area within the nerve fascicles, identified by TUJ1 labelling, was recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (10.0.2, GraphPad software, San Diego, CA, USA). Pearson correlation test was used to test the correlation between the area of HLA-A positive labelling with the patient’s self-reported pain VAS scores.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary files</label><media xlink:href="EMS199250-supplement-Supplementary_files.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d196aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S31"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all participants for taking part in this study.
