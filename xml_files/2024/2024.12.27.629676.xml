Hippocampal place cells are the neuronal substrate of these cognitive maps. However, while hippocampal allocentric position coding in reference to external landmarks is well characterized, the determinants of idiothetic hippocampal distance coding remain poorly understood. Using virtual reality, electrophysiological recordings in mice, and local cue manipulations we could dissociate distance from position coding. In the cue-poor condition, we found pervasive distance coding with high distance indices in all bidirectional place cells including both superficial and deep CA1 pyramidal cells. In this condition, the mapping of distance onto a low-dimensional manifold and rigid distance relationships between place fields suggested strong attractor dynamics similar to those observed for grid cells. Inactivation of the medial septum (MS), which disrupts grid cells, significantly reduced both distance coding and rigid distance dynamics, suggesting an alteration (but not complete abolition) of the underlying attractor. In contrast, allocentric position coding could be observed in cue-rich environments, predominantly engaged deep CA1 pyramidal cells, and persisted during MS inactivation. These results are consistent with a selective contribution of grid cells and associated rigid attractor dynamics to hippocampal idiothetic distance coding but not allocentric position coding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">When navigating to find food, escape predators, or find potential mates, animals can use two strategies: the cognitive map and path integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The cognitive map strategy relies on the acquisition, through learning, of an internal representation of the environment that contains spatial relationships between significant landmarks and important locations. Animals can locate themselves on this map using a variety of external cues (allocentric position coding). The hippocampus has been implicated in this type of navigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. During navigation, hippocampal principal cells, called place cells, increase their activity each time an animal is in the same location in reference to external cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Accordingly, the study of allocentric position coding have dominated the field of hippocampal research for several decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In contrast, the path integration strategy allows animals to locate themselves independently from external sensory cues using self-motion cues to continuously update their location along a travel path by integrating the distance traveled in different direction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. However, while decades of research have revealed how the brain represents absolute location (i.e. hippocampal position coding), reports of hippocampal distance coding in the literature have been scarce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Accordingly, the neural mechanisms of hippocampal distance coding and whether they differ from position coding remain largely unknown.</p><p id="P6">At the cellular level, while the morpho-functional heterogeneity of CA1 pyramidal cells along the hippocampal radial axis is now well established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, it remains unknown whether distance coding can be mapped specifically to a given CA1 pyramidal cell subtype (deep versus superficial). At the network level, grid cells were initially proposed to contribute to hippocampal position coding. However grid fields show fixed and rigid distance relationship<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, supported by a recurrent continuous attractor network with a toroidal topology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and could provide a distance metric to place cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, medial septum (MS) inactivation, which reduces theta rhythmicity and selectively alters the spatial firing pattern of grid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> does not prevent place cells’ position coding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> but disrupts distance estimation based on path integration in rats navigating in the dark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and place cell activity away from external landmarks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Finally, during postnatal development, the accuracy of place cell coding away from boundaries improves with the functional maturation of grid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Taken together, these results are consistent with a specific contribution of grid cells to hippocampal distance coding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, grid cell firing is disrupted in the absence of visual cues when self-motion-based distance coding should dominate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and distance coding can be observed in preweaned rats before grid cell maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, calling this specific role into question.</p><p id="P7">To address these questions, we performed large-scale extracellular recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells during virtual navigation in cue-rich and/or cue-poor virtual environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We focused on bidirectional place cells in hippocampal area CA1 with place fields in both forward and backward trials to decipher whether individual cells exhibited position coding (firing at the same position with respect to external visual cues in forward and backward trials) or distance coding (firing at the same distance from the start of each trial)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Distance coding dominated hippocampal activity in the absence (cue-poor), but not in the presence (cue-rich), of salient local visual cues (virtual 3D objects). This ability to isolate hippocampal distance coding in the cue-poor condition provides a unique opportunity to decipher its cellular and circuit determinants. In particular, we asked whether it is supported by a specific subpopulation of deep or superficial CA1 pyramidal cells. We also characterized distance coding at the population level, looking for signatures of attractor dynamics using dimensionality reduction approaches and correlation analysis. Finally, we tested the effect of MS inactivation on hippocampal distance coding at both the cellular and population level. Overall, our results demonstrate pervasive egocentric distance coding in the hippocampus during virtual navigation in cue-poor environments, supported by both deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells. In this condition, place cell distance coding is strongly reduced (but not completely abolished) by MS inactivation. However, position coding was still observed in a cue-rich environment under MS inactivation. Taken together, our results are consistent with a preferential contribution of grid cells to hippocampal distance but not position coding.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Absence of local visual cues promotes distance coding in bidirectional CA1 place cells</title><p id="P8">Proximal visual cues have a strong influence on the coding of hippocampal place cells in virtual reality environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We first tested their influence on the propensity of hippocampal place cells to perform position or distance coding. For this, head-fixed mice were trained to run in 2 m long virtual linear tracks locally enriched with visual cues (two or three virtual 3D objects; cue-rich track) or without objects (cue-poor track; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>) for sweetened water rewards distributed at the track ends. Immediately after reward consumption, mice were teleported in the same position but facing the opposite direction of the track allowing them to run back and forth in the same environment. Once animals reached a stable and proficient behavior (at least one reward/min during a 60-min session: 4.38 ± 0.52 cue-rich and 5.17 ± 0.61 cue-poor, t26 = 0.82, p = 0.42, unpaired t-test), we recorded spiking activity in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 hippocampal region using 8-shanks silicon probes in the right and/or left hemisphere over the course of 2–3 days (cue-rich: 402 neurons from 9 recording sessions in 4 mice; cue-poor: 1462 neurons from 19 recording sessions in 14 mice).</p><p id="P9">We focused on bidirectional place cells because these cells, that have place fields in back-and-forth trials, allows distinguishing position coding (firing at the same position with respect to external visual cues in forward and backward trials) from distance coding (firing at the same distance from the start of each trial)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">The percentage of bidirectional place cells was higher in the presence of proximal sensory cues (46.1 ± 4.7 % in the cue-rich versus 30.5 ± 4.0 % in the cue-poor track ; t<sub>26</sub> = -2.33, p &lt; 0.028, two-tailed unpaired t test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. In the cue-poor environment, the vast majority of bidirectional place cells appeared to have place fields at a similar distance from the start of each journey in back-and-forth trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, blue). This was evident when we plotted the place fields sorted by their location in one direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, “sorted”) and compared them with the location of the place fields when mice ran in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>): we observed a mirror image. To quantify this, we computed a distance index (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">methods</xref>) whose value vary from 1 when place fields are at the exact same distance in back-and-forth trials to - 1 when they are at the same position.

As previously reported, the presence of proximal visual cues significantly increased the proportion of spatially modulated cells (place cells) among active cells (cue-rich: 68.9 ± 4.6 % vs cue-poor: 32.2 ± 3.1 %; t26 = - 6.42 p &lt; 10<sup>-6</sup>, two-tailed non-paired t test, Figure S1A, B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. In this condition we also observed bidirectional distance coding place cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, orange and 1D</xref>), but in addition, some bidirectional place cells also appeared to code at the same position with respect to external cues in back-and-forth trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C, orange and 1D</xref>). Indeed, the distance index was significantly lower in the cue-rich compared to the cue-poor environment (0.38 ± 0.05; Z = 7.08, p&lt;10<sup>-11</sup>, two-tailed Wilcoxon Rank Sum test or WRS test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) while the position index was significantly higher in the in cue-rich compared to the cue-poor environment (CR: 0.06 ± 0.07; CP: -0.62 ± 0.05; Z = - 6.66, p&lt;10<sup>-10</sup>, two-tailed WRS test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Next, we classified bidirectional place cells as distance-coding cells or position-coding cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">methods</xref>). Strikingly, in the cue-poor track almost all bidirectional place cells were distance-coding cells: 94.2 % (n = 81 out of 86) with only 2.3 % (n = 2) of bidirectional place cells showing position coding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D and 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>). In the cue-rich track, the proportion of distance-coding and position-coding cells was more balanced: Distance-coding: 50.5 % (n = 49 out of 97); position-coding: 33.0 % (n = 32) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D and 1F</xref>; Supplementary Figure 1E).

Interestingly the place fields of distance-coding cells were equally distributed between cue-rich and cue-poor parts of the track (18.4 % cue-rich vs 19.4 % cue-poor), whereas the place fields of position-coding cells were preferentially located in the cue-rich part of the track (59,4 % vs 14.1 % cue-poor; X<sub>2</sub> (1, n = 146) = 15.14, p&lt;10<sup>-4</sup>, Chi-square test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Overall, these results show that in the cue-rich track, place cells can exhibit distance coding in both cue-rich and cue-poor parts of the track, whereas position coding is mostly observed in cue-rich parts of the track.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Both deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells exhibit distance coding in cue-poor environments</title><p id="P16">CA1 pyramidal cells are morpho-functionally diverse depending on their location along radial, proximo-distal and transverse axes of the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. In the radial axis, CA1 pyramidal cells whose soma is located deep in the layer (closer to the stratum oriens) are more strongly activated by local sensory cues and have their place fields in cue-rich locations in heterogeneous environments.

Next, we asked how hippocampal distance/position coding map onto this heterogeneity.</p><p id="P17">To decipher the anatomical distribution of cells along the CA1 radial axis, we defined the middle of the CA1 pyramidal layer as the recording site where sharp-wave ripples had the largest amplitude <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Cells above or below this threshold were classified as deep or superficial, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). We were able to record a large number of deep and superficial pyramidal cells when mice explored both cue-poor and cue-rich tracks (cue-poor: 362 deep and 642 superficial cells, 14 sessions in 8 mice; cue-rich: 122 deep and 246 superficial cells, 8 sessions in 3 mice). Overall, there was no difference in the propensity of deep and superficial cells to be active and spatially modulated in either cue-poor or cue-rich environments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B and S2C</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We then compared distance/position coding of deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells in cue-poor and cue-rich environments focusing on bidirectional place cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>). The percentage of bidirectional cells among all place cells did not differ between deep and superficial pyramidal cells (Figure S2D). In the cue-poor environment the majority of both deep and superficial cells had place fields at the same distance from the start of each journey (i.e. distance-coding cells; deep: 87.5 %; superficial: 90.7 %, X<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>(2, n = 67) = 1.83, p=0.40, Chi-square test).

Thus, in the absence of local sensory cues distance coding dominates in both deep and superficial bidirectional CA1 pyramidal cells.</p><p id="P19">In the heterogeneous cue-rich environment, however, the distance index of superficial cells was significantly higher than that of deep cells (superficial: 0.46 ±0.07 and deep: 0.23 ±0.08, respectively, Z = -2.2251, p = 0,0261, two-tailed WRS test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, we observed a significant negative correlation between cell body depth and distance index (R = -0.22, p &lt; 0.05, Pearson correlation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Accordingly, in this track, the position index was higher for deep cells (deep: 0.28 ±0.09; superficial: - 0.05 ± 0.09, Z = 2.0937, p = 0.0363, two-tailed WRS test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) and the correlation between cell body depth and position index was significantly positive (R = 0.22 p &lt; 0.05, Pearson correlation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Nevertheless, both deep and superficial pyramidal cells could be classified as either distance-coding cells or position-coding cells. When considering the superficial cell population, the proportion of distance-coding cells (55.0%) tended to be higher than the proportion of position-coding cells (28.3%) but without reaching statistical significance.

Indeed, there was a good correlation between the distance traveled by the animal from the start of each journey and the evolution of the population activity along the manifold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). The reduction of hippocampal activity onto a low-dimensional manifold is consistent with continuous attractor dynamics. These dynamics could impose internal constraints on the neuronal activity of place cells such as rigid distance relationships between place fields as recently described for grid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. To test whether similar dynamics might underlie relative distance coding, we looked for rigid distance relationships between hippocampal firing across laps in the cue-poor condition. Despite the large intertrial spatial variability of place fields in this condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, spatial cross-correlation analysis revealed that a significant fraction of cell pairs maintained a fixed distance between their place fields across laps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D, E</xref>). The correlation matrix showed that short distances between place fields (in the range of 10-20 cm) were overrepresented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).

We next tested the impact of MS inactivation on hippocampal distance coding in the cue-poor environment. Hippocampal neuronal activity was first recorded while mice performed back-and-forth trials in a familiar cue-poor environment (at least 20 trials). We then inactivated the MS, by micro-infusion of muscimol, an agonist of GABAA receptors (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">methods</xref>).

The proportion of place cells among active cells was also similar (32.4 ± 4.4 % and 21.2 ± 2.9 %, respectively, t<sub>6</sub> = 1.93, p = 0.10, n = 7 sessions, paired t-test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>).

We indeed observed a drastic decrease in the number of distance-coding bidirectional place cells under MS inactivation (from 38 before to 5 after MS inactivation; 86.8 % decrease, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This loss of bidirectional distance coding place cells under MS inactivation also reached significance on a session-by-session analysis (t<sub>6</sub> = 4.75, p = 0.0032, two-tailed paired t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). In comparison, the total number of unidirectional cells decreased less (by 21.4 %; 70 to 55 during the MS inactivation). We next compared the percentages of bidirectional and unidirectional cells, calculated from the total number of place cells, before and after the muscimol infusion. Before MS inactivation, 35.2 % of place cells were bidirectional and 64.8% were unidirectional, whereas after MS inactivation, only 8.3% of place cells were bidirectional and the remaining 91.7% were unidirectional (X2(1, n = 168) = 14.6, p = &lt; 10<sup>-3</sup>, chi-squared test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). To further estimate the effects of MS inactivation on bidirectional and unidirectional place cells, we calculated their relative change (N<sub>after</sub>- N<sub>before</sub>)/N<sub>before</sub>. For bidirectional place cells, the relative change was close to -1 and significantly different from 0, indicating a strong decrease during MS inactivation (mean: - 0.88 ± 0.06, p = 0.016, n = 7, two-tailed WSR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).

The five bidirectional place cells remaining after MS inactivation had a mean distance index of 0.92 ± 0.009, which was not significantly different from the distance index of the 38 bidirectional cells recorded before inactivation (0.89 ± 0.02, Z = 0.27, p = 0.79, two-tailed WRS test). However, while the place fields of bidirectional place cells were distributed in all parts of the track before inactivation, the place fields of place cells remaining under MS inactivation had their place fields almost exclusively near to the track ends, leaving the central part of the track not coded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). To quantify for this, we performed population vector overlap analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). While a diagonal of high correlation corresponding to distance coding was observed in all parts of the track (albeit somewhat weaker in the middle) before MS inactivation, high correlations were lost in the middle of the track and only visible at the beginning and end of the track after inactivation. Comparison with shuffled data yielded similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>). We also calculated a distance overlap index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>), which quantifies the overlap of place fields in both directions when aligned to the start of each journey. Distance overlap decreased significantly under muscimol inactivation in the center of the maze between 60 cm and 120 cm (60 to 80 cm: Z = 3.99, p &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup>; 80 to 100 cm: Z = 4.01, p &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup>; 100 to 120 cm: Z = 4.04, p &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup>; two-tailed WRS test).

For both unidirectional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>) and non-place cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>), spatial correlations decreased significantly after the muscimol infusion (unidirectional: H(2) = 81.3, p &lt; 10<sup>-17</sup>, Kruskal Wallis, before vs after p &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup>, multiple comparison ; non-place: H(2) = 92,4, p &lt; 10<sup>-20</sup>, Before vs After p &lt; 10<sup>-8</sup>, multiple comparison). However, for both cell populations, spatial correlations under muscimol remained significantly higher than the shuffled values (unidirectional: p = 0.0127, multiple comparison; non-place cells: p = 0.0348, multiple comparison) suggesting that some distance coding remained even after medial septum inactivation. Taken together, these results show that MS inactivation induces a global decrease in hippocampal distance coding.</p><p id="P34">To further investigate the effect of MS inactivation on hippocampal population dynamics in the cue-poor track we compared low-dimensional manifold before and after muscimol injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

To decipher whether the lower mapping of distance onto the manifold under muscimol could be related to an alteration of the attractor dynamics in the network, we next compared the fraction of cell pairs showing rigid distance relationships between their firing profile across laps before and after MS inactivation. After muscimol injection, this fraction was significantly reduced (from 0.104 to 0.058, p = 0.004, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>), but still significantly higher than the fraction observed with randomly shuffled spike trains (0.104 and 3.6 10-4, p &lt; 10-8, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Thus, in addition to locally improving the resolution of spatial coding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> local visual cues can promote allocentric position coding over idiothetic distance coding. This finding complements previous studies in rats showing that distal visual cues alone are not sufficient to support allocentric position coding in virtual environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Conversely, distal cues are sufficient for allocentric position coding in real linear environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. This difference could be due to the presence of uncontrolled local sensory cues, which are more difficult to control in real environments.

This heterogeneity is best characterized along the radial axis.

According to this work, CA1deep cells would be primarily driven by external sensory cues, whereas CA1sup cells would be preferentially driven by self-motion or idiothetic cues. However, in our study, both cell types were equally recruited in the cue-poor track. One possibility is that both cell types perform distance coding, but on the basis of different sensory cues. While CA1deep cells would code distance with respect to an external landmark, such as the end of the track, CA1sup cells would use self-motion or idiothetic cues to code distance based on path integration.

In particular, it allows highlighting relative distance coding along the track. Dimensionality reduction analyses applied to hippocampal coding at the population level in the cue-poor track revealed a 1D manifold. Distance traveled along the track, but not position, mapped well onto this manifold. Indeed, there was a good correlation between the evolution of population activity along the manifold and the distance traveled by the animal along the maze. The observation of this manifold suggests that a Continuous Attractor Network (CAN) might constrain hippocampal activity. The population activity of large ensembles of grid cells has recently been shown to also lie on a toroidal (2D) manifold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> imposing rigidity in the correlation structure of their activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. We found a similarly fixed distance relationship between hippocampal cell activity in this condition, suggesting that grid cell attractor dynamics may constrain hippocampal activity in the absence of local visual cues. Indeed, grid cells discharge at fixed distances in 1D environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> and are more influenced by self-motion-related information than visual information during gain changes in virtual environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Consistent with this hypothesis, MS inactivation, which disrupts the spatial organization of grid cell discharge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and distance estimation based on path integration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> strongly reduced distance coding in the absence of local visual cues, with a significant reduction in the number of bidirectional distance-coding cells. Population vector analysis further confirmed a significant loss of distance overlap, particularly in the center of the path. These deficits were not observed when aCSF was injected into the medial septum as a control. Accordingly, we observed a decrease in the correlation between the evolution of population activity along the manifold and the distance traveled by the animal along the maze, together with a loss of rigidity in the distance relationship between place fields across laps. It is worth noting that although distance mapping along the manifold and correlation structure of hippocampal population activity were reduced under MS inactivation, they were still higher than when spiking was shuffled. This suggests that the underlying CAN structure may be preserved. Interestingly, similar differences between coding in physical and manifold space have been observed for grid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. For example, grid cells retain some distance coding properties and the correlation structure of their activity is preserved even when the grid pattern is lost in the dark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> or after hippocampal inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Collectively, these results suggest that grid cell activity could sustain hippocampal distance coding in the absence of local visual cues and that MS inactivation would more specifically alter the mapping of distance onto the manifold rather than the underlying attractor dynamics. The few bidirectional distance-coding cells that remained under MS inactivation were active at the start or end of the track, suggesting that they used allothetic cues (the track ends) rather than idiothetic cues to encode distance. This intuition was confirmed by population vector analysis, which showed that some distance overlap remained at the start and end of the track. These end-of-track cues could be used to anchor the grid in the control condition, allowing accurate path integration-based navigation and hippocampal distance coding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Such anchoring could be lost under MS inactivation thus precluding accurate distance coding along the track while potentially preserving path-integrated distance coding along the manifold.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>MS inactivation alters distance but not position coding</title><p id="P44">Allocentric position coding could be observed under MS inactivation when local visual cues (virtual 3D objects) were introduced into the cue-poor track. In this condition, position coding cells were concentrated in the cue-rich part of the track and dominated hippocampal spatial coding. This is consistent with behavioral results showing that grid cell anchoring to the track is not required for cue-based navigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Previous studies have reported various effects of medial septum inactivation on place cell coding in real-world environments. While allocentric position coding was observed in small scale 2D and 1D environments under MS inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, hippocampal coding was selectively altered when animals ran in a wheel during a spatial working memory task or away from external cues sensory cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. However, allocentric and idiothetic coding have been difficult to disentangle in these experiments. Our experimental paradigm using back-and-forth trials in virtual reality together with local cue manipulations allowed for the first time to disentangle the effect of MS inactivation on allocentric position coding and idiothetic distance coding. Our results are consistent with a specific deficit in hippocampal distance coding based on path integration but not allocentric position coding. As the MS comprises a variety of cell types, future work should determine which of these cells are more specifically involved in hippocampal distance coding.</p><p id="P45">In addition to altering grid cell firing, the effects of MS inactivation on hippocampal distance coding could result from altered theta rhythmicity and theta-driven dynamics of internally organized hippocampal networks, such as theta sequences. Indeed, a computer model has shown that self-motion-based firing fields can be built from theta sequences in the absence of external sensory cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. However, we and others have previously shown that theta phase precession and theta phase spike coordination are altered in the cue-poor condition even without MS septal inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Collectively, these results suggest that theta sequences are dispensable for distance-coding firing fields, but may be selectively involved in internally generated firing fields in the context of working memory. Finally, while average trial speed was not significantly affected by MS inactivation, the number of stops per trial was increased after compared to before MS inactivation. This could be due to direct inhibition of MS glutamatergic neurons, whose activity has been directly linked to locomotor speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Part of this increase could also be related to a decrease in motivation for reward at late stages of the recording session when spatial coding is assessed under MS inactivation. In line with this, the number of stops was also increased at similarly late stages of the experimental protocol after control aCSF injections. Although the impact of behavior on hippocampal dynamics is difficult to disentangle from the impact of hippocampal dynamics on behavior, the increased number of stops following aCSF injections did not prevent clear distance coding in this condition. Conversely, altered hippocampal distance coding and path integration-based self-localization deficits could also contribute to the increased number of stops observed after MS inactivation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P46">Despite years of investigation, the specific determinants of hippocampal distance coding are unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Using virtual reality and local cue manipulations, we could isolate distance and investigate its cellular and network determinants. We showed that distance coding is ubiquitous in the hippocampus in the absence of local visual cues, involving both CA1deep and CA1sup cells as well as unidirectional and non-place cells. In this condition, the distance traveled along the track, but not the allocentric position, could be mapped onto a low-dimensional manifold imposing rigid distance relationships between place fields. This is reminiscent of attractor dynamics observed in the grid cell network. MS inactivation, which alter the firing pattern of grid cells, dampened distance coding at the single cell level and rigid distance relationships at the population level. However, allocentric position coding could still be observed under MS inactivation in the presence of local visual cues. Based on these results, we propose a specific role for grid cells in maintaining hippocampal distance coding in cue impoverished conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S16"><title>Animals</title><p id="P47">Data were collected from 16 male mice C57BL/6J (Janvier/Charles River) between 8 and 12 weeks of age during the recording phase (weight: 21-23.6 g).

Two jeweler’s screws were inserted into the skull above the cerebellum for reference and grounding. For muscimol infusion in the MS, a guide cannula (26G, Dominique Dutscher) was implanted 1 mm above the MS (AP: +1 mm, ML: +0.7 mm, DV: -3 mm, angle 10° towards the midline). A dental cement cap was then constructed, leaving the skull free above the hippocampi for later craniotomies. The exposed skull was sealed with silicone elastomer (Kwik-Cast, World Precision Instruments). A small titanium rod (0.65 g; 12 x 6 mm) was inserted above the cerebellum to serve as a fixation point for a larger head plate, which was used for head fixation only during training and recording.

The wheel was surrounded by six 19” TFT monitors covering a total angle of 270 degrees. The monitors were elevated so that the mouse’s eye level corresponded to the bottom third of the screen height to account for the fact that the rodent’s field of view is upwardly biased. The head restraint system (Luigs and Neumann) was placed behind the animal so as not to interfere with the view of the virtual reality environment. The virtual reality environment was a 200 cm long and 32 cm wide virtual linear maze with different patterns on the side and end walls, enriched or not with virtual 3D objects (see Virtual Reality Environments section). The movement of the wheel updated the position of the mouse avatar. The mouse could only move forward or backward, but could not turn back in the middle of the path (see Training section).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Virtual reality environments</title><sec id="S21"><title>Cue-poor track</title><p id="P51">Each side wall had a unique pattern (black and orange stripes on one wall; green crosses on a black background on the other).

The animal could neither orient to the objects nor receive any sensory feedback from them other than vision. 3 mice used in this study (6 recording sessions) were trained and recorded in a virtual linear track enriched with 2 virtual objects (origami + cube). An additional mouse trained and recorded in a track enriched with 3 objects was added to the study. The results of this animal were already used in a previous study (Bourboulou, Marti et al., 2019). For the experiments in which animals were first trained in the track without objects and then exposed to a novel environment with objects, the track with 2 objects was used.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Training</title><p id="P53">Mice were first habituated to the experimenter by daily handling sessions of 20 min or more, which continued throughout the experiment. After a 5-day recovery period following surgery, mice were water-deprived (1 ml/day, including the amount of water consumed during training). They were then progressively trained to run in the virtual reality setup. First, mice were familiarized with running head-fixed on the wheel for water rewards in a black track (screens always black). During these sessions, animals received sweetened water (5% sucrose) as a reward for every 50 cm run on the wheel. When the animals were familiar with the setup, they were trained to run in a 200 cm long linear virtual track (familiar track). When animals reached the end of the track, a liquid reward delivery tube extended in front of the animal and the animal had to lick to obtain the reward (a 4 mL drop of water containing 5% sucrose). Animals were then teleported to the same position but in the opposite direction of the maze and had to run in the opposite direction to the end of the maze to receive another reward. Animals were trained until they were able to complete at least 60 trials. Ad libitum access to water was restored if the animal’s weight dropped below 80% of its preoperative weight at any time during training.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Recording procedure</title><p id="P54">When animals reached a stable behavioral performance (at least two reward/minute and 60 trials), we performed acute recordings using silicon probes (4/8 shanks; A-32/A-64 Buzsaki Probe, Neuronexus). The day before the first recording session, animals were anesthetized (with isoflurane supplemented with buprenorphine 0.1 mg/kg) and a craniotomy was made over one hippocampus (centered at a point AP: - 2 mm ML: ± 2 mm). The craniotomy was covered with agarose (2% in physiological Ringer solution) then sealed with silicon elastomer (Kwik-Cast, World Precision Instruments). This craniotomy was used for acute recording for 2-3 consecutive days (with the probe lowered to a new location each time). A second craniotomy was then made over the other hippocampus using the same procedure, and recordings were made for 2-3 additional days. The silicon probe was lowered into the brain while the animal was allowed to walk freely on the wheel with the screens displaying a black background. The good positioning of the probe with recording sites in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer was verified by the presence of multiple units showing complex spike bursts at several recording sites and the recording of sharp wave ripples during quiet behavior. After positioning the silicon probe, the virtual reality environment was displayed on the screen. On the day of the last recording in each hippocampus, the back of the probe shaft was coated with a thin layer of a cell-labeling red fluorescent dye (DiI, Life technologies), so that its location (shaft tips) could be assessed histologically post hoc. All mice (n = 16) were recorded in a familiar environment (either cue-poor or cue-rich track) for approximately 20 trials. For mice trained in the cue-poor track (n = 10), these trials were followed by an intracranial infusion of muscimol (n = 5) or aCSF (n = 6) in the MS (see ‘Intracranial infusions’ section), during which the mouse was free to run with the screens turned off (black). Approximately 15 min after the infusion, mice were again exposed to the familiar track for at least 20 trials. Some mice (n = 4 for muscimol, n = 4 for aCSF) were then exposed, 3 min after the end of the second session, to a new environment (cue-rich track), identical to the previous one except for the presence of two 3D objects (an origami and a cube). Again, animals had to complete at least 20 trials in this last condition. Note that animals stayed head-fixed on the wheel surrounded by screens during the entire recording session.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Intracranial infusions</title><p id="P55">Intracranial infusions were performed as follows. First, a custom-made infusion cannula (33 Ga, Dominique Dutscher) was connected by polyethylene tubing to a 2 μl Hamilton syringe mounted in a microinjection pump (Legato 130 Single Syringe I/W Nanoliter, World Precision Instruments). The syringe, tubing, and cannula were filled with pure water. Dissolved muscimol or aCSF was then added to the infusion cannula (separated from the water by an air bubble). Muscimol powder (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in sterile aCSF (Harvard Bioscience, Inc.) at a concentration of 1 μg/μl. At the beginning of the microinjection procedure, the infusion cannula was inserted into the implanted guide cannula and the infusion was made 1 mm deeper than the tip of the guide cannula. 0.1 μl of muscimol or aCSF was slowly injected into the MS (0.08 μl/min), and the infusion cannula was left in place for another 2 min after microinjection was completed. During infusion, the animals were allowed to run freely and were given food. Animals showed no signs of stress or discomfort during the procedure. 10-15 min after microinjection, animals were returned to the virtual familiar environment.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Data acquisition and pre-processing</title><p id="P56">The animal’s position in the virtual maze was digitized by the virtual reality control computer (Phenosys) and then sent to a digital-to-analog card (0-4.5V, National Instrument Board NI USB-6008) connected to the external board (I/O Board, Open Ephys) of a 256 channel acquisition board (Open Ephys). Neurophysiological signals were acquired continuously at 25 000 Hz on a 256-channel recording system (Open Ephys, Intan Technologies, RHD2132 amplifier board with RHD2000 USB interface board).

The time-frequency spectrogram (0-20 Hz) of the LFP was computed using a window size of 5 s and a time step of 1 s, and was 1/f corrected. The LFP was band-pass filtered in the delta (0.5 - 4 Hz) and theta (6 - 9 Hz) bands using zero-phase IIR Butterworth filters. Theta power was computed when the animal was performing the task in each track condition before and after the infusion. We first determined the theta power by Hilbert transform and calculated the theta power on the channel with the best ratio of theta to delta power when the animal speed exceeded 2 cm/s. Theta power was taken from the maximum power in the 6-9 Hz band. To examine changes in theta power after infusion of aCSF or muscimol in different recording sessions, the absolute theta power was normalized by dividing by the total power of the band (1-30 Hz). This normalization allowed comparison of pre- and postinfusion theta power levels across recording sessions. A second method was used to calculate the theta power in each movement period. Movement periods were detected using criteria for running speed and duration. Specifically, a locomotor period was defined as a period of at least 2 seconds with a velocity greater than 2 cm/s. Two movement periods were merged if less than 0.5 sec separated them. The theta power in the movement period was averaged. For both theta power methods, the percentage of theta attenuation was computed from the ratio of theta power after the infusion to the theta power before the infusion.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Speed and stop analysis</title><p id="P60">The maze was divided into 100 spatial bins of 2 cm, and the mean speed was calculated for each bin.

These vectors were smoothed using a Gaussian filter with a half-width set to 10 spatial bins. Spikes occurring during epochs when the velocity was less than 2 cm/s were removed from all analyses. The smoothed spike count vector was divided by the smoothed occupancy time vector to obtain the firing rate vector for each trial. Firing rate vectors were pooled for a given condition (track condition, pre- or post-infusion) and animal direction (e.g., back) to create a firing rate map.

To distinguish deep pyramidal cells from superficial pyramidal cells, we defined the middle of the CA1 pyramidal layer as the recording site where ripples had the largest power (Geiller et al., 2017; Mizuseki et al., 2011; Sharif et al., 2021). To detect ripple events, a spectrogram (using a short-time Fourier transform) of the LFPs in CA1 pyramidal layer was computed (time windows of 20 ms) for one channel (the one with the strongest ripple power between 120 and 230 Hz) of each shank. Ripple epochs were defined as periods during which ripple power (120 to 230Hz) was continuously greater than mean 120 to 230Hz power + 3 standard deviation (sd) and than mean 250-300Hz + 3 sd. Then, during ripples times, the power in the ripple band was calculated for each channel and the channel with the largest mean power was selected as the middle of the pyramidal layer (Mizuseki et al., 2011).

A bootstrap procedure was used to detect a mean place field. For each trial, a new spike train was generated using a Poisson process with λ equal to the mean firing rate of the trial and a time interval of 1 ms. A “randomized” firing rate map was then generated and the mean firing rate vector was determined and compared to the mean firing rate vector from the initial rate map. This process was repeated 1000 times to generate a p-value vector (p-value for each 2 cm spatial bin). Candidate place fields were defined as a set of more than three contiguous spatial bins associated with p-values less than 0.01Two place fields were merged if the distance between their closest edges was at most equal to five spatial bins (10 cm). The edges of place fields were extended by a maximum of five spatial bins (for each edge) if the p-value for these bins was less than 0.30. A field with a size greater than 45 spatial bins (90 cm) was not considered as a place field. To validate a mean place field, the cell had to verify a stability criterion. Spatial correlations were calculated between the firing rate vector of each trial and the mean firing rate vector. The spatial bins corresponding to other detected place fields were not included in the spatial correlations. The place field was validated if the spatial correlations were greater than 0.60 in at least 40% of the trials. If multiple mean place fields were detected, only the place field with the highest peak was retained, unless otherwise specified. An active cell with at least one place field in one direction was considered a unidirectional place cell. Bidirectional cells were place cells with at least one place field in both directions. The proportion of place cells was calculated from the total number of active cells. All recording sessions had at least 13 active cells. To calculate the proportion of bidirectional and unidirectional cells, only sessions with at least 4 active cells were included. The same procedure was used to calculate place fields per lap without the stability criterion, which cannot be calculated on single trials.

We then correlated (Pearson’s correlations) the vectors from the place field map of the forward trials with all the vectors from the place field map of the backward trials to obtain an 80*80 correlation matrix. For statistical comparison, we first generated 500 randomized firing rate maps for each cell (using the same method as for place field detection) and computed the population vector analysis for each randomized firing rate map.
