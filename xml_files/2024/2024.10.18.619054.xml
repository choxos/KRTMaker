Here, we bridge this gap by linking genome to proteome in 800 meiotic progeny from an intercross between two closely related <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> isolates adapted to distinct niches. Modest genetic distance between the parents generated remarkable proteomic diversity that was amplified in the progeny and captured by 6,476 genotype-protein associations, over 1,600 of which we resolved to single variants. Proteomic adaptation emerged through the combined action of numerous <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory mutations, a regulatory architecture that was conserved across the species. Notably, <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory variants often arose in proteins not traditionally associated with gene regulation, such as enzymes. Moreover, the proteomic consequences of mutations predicted fitness under various stresses. Our study demonstrates that the collective action of natural genetic variants drives dramatic proteome diversification, with molecular consequences that forecast phenotypic outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>systems genetics</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>genotype-phenotype mapping</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>gene expression evolution</kwd><kwd>transgression</kwd><kwd>variant interpretation</kwd><kwd>omnigenic model</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Genetic variation plays a central role in health and disease, yet, three decades into the genomic era, we are unable to predict the phenotypic effects of most mutations. For example, the ClinVar database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> compiles variants linked to significant clinical effects in well-studied disease genes. Approximately one-third of these variants are classified as being of uncertain significance, and this number continues to grow. The problem is even more acute for rare mutations, which are often presumed to be deleterious but cannot be characterized by population genetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, accurate functional predictions, if achieved, hold tremendous clinical promise: a study of patients with a monogenic multisystem disease of STAT3, for instance, revealed that all bore mutations causing a biochemical gain-of-function of the protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. These linked challenges arise because we lack a systems-level understanding of how the effects of DNA mutations propagate to other molecular layers and ultimately impact cellular physiology, even in the best-studied organisms. The problem is extremely complex, as mutations may exert their effects on organismal phenotypes by changing the abundance, fold, activity, or otherwise altering the functions and interactions of biomolecules in manifold ways.</p><p id="P4">Due to rapid progress in nucleic acid sequencing technology, many large-scale efforts to associate mutations with molecular phenotypes have focused on mRNA levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> or mRNA splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Yet it is the proteome that predominantly exerts function, and pioneering experiments established the possibility of mapping the effects of variants on protein levels directly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. This approach has been revolutionized by large-scale antibody-, aptamer- and mass spectrometry-based technologies, primarily focusing on the human plasma proteome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, two barriers have limited the explanatory power of these datasets. First, the plasma proteome only indirectly represents the primary events of gene expression regulation, being controlled by an interplay of protein excretion by the liver, the tissue leakage of proteins, and glomerular filtration by the kidney. Second, human populations harbor a large excess of rare polymorphisms. As a consequence, genetic associations explain little of the variation observed in plasma protein levels (<italic>e.g.</italic>, 2.7% median genetic contribution in a study with more than 10,000 participants9).</p><p id="P5">On the other hand, a direct link between genetic variation and the proteome can be made in single-cell organisms: the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is at a sweet spot of genetic tractability due the combination of small genome size and the ability to readily cross and segregate haploid progeny in the laboratory. Crosses of yeast strains have linked genetic variants to changes in mRNA and protein expression at the genome-wide scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, as well as investigating the regulation of model transcripts and proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. These studies revealed a complex regulatory architecture conserved across eukaryotes, composed of strong <italic>cis</italic>-acting variants alongside pleiotropic <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory mutations (so-called hotspots)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Yet the number of proteins or strains examined in proteomic studies of yeast has often been small (~ 100 segregants)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, and even large collections of wild yeast isolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> are not well-suited to genetic mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> due to the large number of rare variants. Studies in such panels and in inbred crosses typically cannot resolve linked genomic regions to individual causal polymorphisms, or unambiguously implicate causal genes.</p><p id="P6">We have shown that this barrier can be overcome by intercrossing the progeny of two closely related wild isolates. Six rounds of meiosis and mating – in contrast to most prior approaches which limited intercrossing to one or two generations – resulted in a panel of haploid segregants in which the genetic linkage between neighboring mutations has been broken, allowing genetic associations to be mapped to individual polymorphisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Here, we combined precise, systematic proteomics using analytical flow-rate chromatography and Scanning SWATH acquisition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> with nucleotide-resolution genetic mapping in a large library of 851 segregants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> to comprehensively chart a natural genotype-to-protein map at high resolution. The resulting molecular atlas consisted of thousands of variant-protein associations, many resolved with single-nucleotide resolution and revealed solely at the level of proteins. Notably, the progeny exhibited widespread transgression in proteins not differentially expressed in their ancestors, highlighting the latent potential of the genome to create proteome diversity. Indeed, selection on variants throughout the genome engaged modular regulons to dramatically remodel the proteomes of the two closely related parental strains, revealing general molecular principles underlying causality. Overlaying these molecular data on a complementary genotype-to-phenotype map revealed that the variants controlling protein levels in the absence of stress drove resistance to diverse perturbations. These results suggest that genotype-to-protein maps are conserved across environments and broadly predict phenotypes, charting a path forward to forecast the molecular and phenotypic consequences of genetic variation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mass spectrometry-based proteomics to probe molecular adaptation</title><p id="P7">Two ubiquitous obstacles in understanding the mechanistic influence of the genome on the proteome are the excess of rare polymorphisms in natural populations and the difficulty of directly obtaining measurements of protein levels in cells at sufficient scale and precision. Here, we addressed these challenges using 851 F6 isolates from a large population of haploid yeast derived from a single mating of two parents, one isolated from the mucosa of an immunocompromised patient (YJM975; henceforth YJM)24 and the other isolated from a California vineyard (RM11; henceforth RM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Despite their substantial phenotypic diversification, they harbor a low level of polymorphism (~ 0.1%), comparable to that between two unrelated humans. The segregating mutations are in very low linkage disequilibrium, enabling high-resolution genetic mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">To measure protein levels in these strains, we took advantage of recent developments in mass spectrometry-based data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics using scanning sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (Scanning-SWATH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and new data processing strategies using deep neural networks implemented in the DIA-NN software suite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The high acquisition speed and the ability to match precursor masses with MS2 fragments in Scanning SWATH allowed its integration with high-flow rate analytical chromatography, increasing throughput while maintaining high proteomic depth and excellent quantitative precision. We achieved a measurement throughput of 4.8 min./proteome, compared to, <italic>e.g.</italic>, 120 min./proteome in previous proteome mapping experiments in yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. We assessed biological and technical variability using numerous controls. The segregant library was cultivated in twelve 96-well plates, each of which included at least three replicates of each parental haploid from which the mapping panel was derived [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>]. Alongside these, we measured <italic>n</italic> = 117 samples of a pooled sample to detect and correct for batch effects. As a benchmark of species-wide proteome diversity, we also included 22 diverse isolates from the Saccharomyces Genome Resequencing Project (SGRP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplemental Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Table S2</xref>]. We observed low technical variability (C.V. 15.6 - 19.9%) and negligible effects of plate or batch [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1ABC</xref>], such that the genetic background was the predominant contribution to proteome variation across the proteomes we acquired [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>]. The quantified proteins accounted for ~ 70% of the proteome on a molar basis, and the estimated protein quantities correlated well with absolute protein levels reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Standing and latent variation in the proteome</title><p id="P9">Despite modest genetic distance (~ 12,000 mutations; ~ 1 - 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> divisions since the last common ancestor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>) and similar growth properties in standard laboratory conditions [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E</xref>], the proteomes of the parents were highly diverged. For 826 of the 1,225 proteins quantified in the two parents (67.4%), we obtained significantly different intensities (<italic>n</italic> = 36 - 39; B.-H. corrected <italic>q</italic> value &lt; 0.05; 190 with fold-change &gt; 1.5; 66 with fold-change &gt; 2) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>]. The most up- and down-regulated subsets of the proteome were highly functionally coherent: for example, the clinical isolate (YJM) had higher levels of amino acid and purine biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis proteins, whereas the vineyard isolate (RM) had higher levels of proteins associated with oxidative phosphorylation and the TCA cycle [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Table S3</xref>]. These differences correspond broadly to the two key metabolic states of budding yeast, reflecting a fermentative versus a respiratory metabolism, respectively.</p><p id="P10">Protein abundance spanned a large dynamic range, both between the parents and amongst the F6 progeny, as many protein levels in progeny transgressed beyond their abundance in the parental strains [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>]. Despite this, our approach yielded very high broad-sense heritability (median 76.2%), which depended only modestly on protein abundance [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>] and was limited primarily by technical variability rather than gene-by-environment interactions [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1F</xref>]. Transgression was common, and, indeed, the variation amongst the progeny was greater than that between the parents for 77.9% proteins we measured (955 of 1,225). Strikingly, the proteomic variation released in the F6 progeny was most pronounced for the proteins that were also highly variable across genetically diverse wild yeast isolates spanning the diversity in this species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (<italic>r</italic> = 0.74; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-213</sup>) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>]. Thus, the proteomic diversification released by meiosis in our experiment was broadly representative of species-wide variation, perhaps reflecting conserved layers of modular regulation in this organism.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>A nucleotide-resolution proteogenomic map in a model eukaryotic species</title><p id="P11">Based on these high-quality measurements and the statistical power afforded by the F6 segregant panel, we performed genetic mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> to identify variants associated with changes in protein abundance. Briefly, we conducted global and <italic>cis</italic>-focused (local) mapping by multivariate regression [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>], including growth differences as a covariate. This proved important for a small subset of proteins, as found previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1G</xref>]. The effects of associations that were discovered in both local and global mapping agreed well [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1H</xref>].</p><p id="P12">Global mapping, which encompassed all segregating polymorphisms and allowed us to compare <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-acting effects, identified 6,476 variant-protein associations (pQTLs) controlling the abundance of 923 proteins (~ 10% FDR; by permutation; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S26">Methods</xref>) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplemental Table S4</xref>]. Of these, 1,650 of the associations (25.5%) fine-mapped to a single underlying polymorphism, granting an unprecedented molecular window onto the genome-to-proteome map. In the case of the mitochondrial NADH-cytochrome <italic>b</italic>5 reductase Mcr1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, for example, we identified a coding SNP (Mcr1<sup>Gly240Ser</sup>) that was associated with reduced Mcr1 levels in <italic>cis</italic> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1GH</xref>]. Upon reconstruction of the variant by genome editing, subsequent proteome analysis revealed that the Mcr1<sup>240Ser</sup> mutation alone was sufficient to decrease Mcr1 level by nearly 40% [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1I</xref>].</p><p id="P13">Our model explained a median of 30.4% of the broad-sense heritability in protein level, and, due to the high heritability of protein abundance in our experiment, we explained 22.8% of the variance in protein abundance [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J</xref>]. This was comparable to mapping of mRNA abundance in yeast (median 21.9% variance explained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>). Our approach, however, achieved much higher resolution: the median confidence interval in prior studies of yeast crosses ranged from 48 kb (mRNA eQTL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>) to 68 kb (protein X-pQTL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>). Moreover, approaches such as X-pQTL mapping that rely on tagged proteins freeze the immediate genomic context, prohibiting direct assessment of <italic>cis</italic>-acting effects. We were well-powered to detect additional associations of modest effect had they been present (sensitivity ~ 95% for effects of 0.1 standard deviations; ~ 63% for 0.025 s.d.) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1I</xref>]. Thus, residual missing heritability in our map was likely due to numerous additional pQTLs of small effect or, potentially, epistatic interactions.</p><p id="P14">As expected given the high sensitivity of our mapping panel, the rate at which we discovered additional unique <italic>trans</italic> pQTLs declined as we considered additional proteins [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>], suggesting that we captured a comprehensive overall picture of protein regulation. At the same time, downsampling real data to 50% of the strains in the experiment yielded just 3,498 associations (54% of the complete atlas), confirming that we were well-powered to chart the regulatory network. In concordance with widespread transgression, we identified at least one pQTL for 233 of the 399 proteins that were not differentially expressed between the parents (mean 2.63 pQTLs per protein) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1J</xref>]. Accordingly, the true biological variability released in the cross (C.V. amongst the F6 progeny normalized to technical C.V.) was highly predictive of the number of pQTLs discovered for a protein (<italic>r</italic> = 0.60; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-117</sup>) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1K</xref>]. Overall, across the ~1,200 proteins we robustly quantified, at least 1,000 were subject to genetic control (as indicated by differential expression or regulation by a pQTL), even in the closely related isolates we analyzed. Thus, our approach presents an opportunity to understand the molecular genetic basis of both standing and latent variation in the proteome.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Testing the impact of causal variants across the species</title><p id="P15">As a test of our mapping findings, we next examined the penetrance of pQTL effects across other natural isolates, exploiting the transcriptomes and proteomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> of the 1,002 Yeast Genomes collection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>]. Across these diverse wild strains, both Odc2 and Rdl1 transcript and protein levels, for example, were affected by the <italic>cis</italic>-acting variants identified [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>]. Broadly, <italic>cis</italic>-acting variants affected the same protein abundances across the divergent natural strain backgrounds in this independent experiment (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-3</sup>; 46 concordant out of 67 <italic>cis</italic>-pQTL associations tested) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>]. Strikingly, we also identified several instances (<italic>e.g.</italic> Faa1 and Map1) in which protein <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory effects were evident at the proteome but not at the transcriptome [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>]. Thus, our protein-oriented mapping captured both mRNA regulation that propagated to protein levels as well as the molecular basis of regulation that emerged primarily in the proteome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, with these effects evident species-wide.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>mRNA- and protein-level gene regulation</title><p id="P16">We then compared our protein mapping data with allele-specific mRNA expression (ASE) analysis of the F<sub>0</sub> hybrid of the parents of our genetic mapping panel [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Interestingly, only 30 of 127 proteins with a <italic>cis</italic>-pQTL had a significant mRNA allelic imbalance, even though we were well-powered to detect allele-specific expression of these mRNAs (117 of the <italic>cis</italic>-pQTLs had a tag SNP in the associated ORF; median depth 183 read counts) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplemental Table S5</xref>]. These data indicate that many <italic>cis</italic> effects arise more strongly at the protein level rather than at the mRNA. This could occur if a variant affects the translation, folding, trafficking, or localization of the encoded protein.</p><p id="P17">To examine this property in detail, we selected two regulatory <italic>cis</italic>-pQTNs, one mutation upstream of the <italic>NCP1</italic> gene encoding a P450 reductase and one in the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of <italic>SER2</italic>, which encodes phosphoserine phosphatase. The effect of the <italic>NCP1</italic> mutation was only significant for protein level (no mRNA ASE was detected), while the <italic>SER2</italic> variant impacted mRNA and protein levels in similar fashion. We then used CRISPR genome editing to reconstruct these mutations35 and used proteomics to measure protein abundances. In both cases, the exchange of the variant recapitulated the predicted effects: the <italic>NCP1</italic><sup>A-177T</sup> mutation resulted in an upregulation of Ncp1 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup>), while introducing <italic>SER2</italic><sup>G</sup>*<sup>14A</sup> downregulated Ser2 <italic>(p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-4</sup>) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2CD</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title><italic>Non-canonical regulators underlying</italic> trans-<italic>acting hotspots</italic></title><p id="P18">Our genotype to proteome atlas reflects considerable complexity in the regulation of protein expression: the median protein was controlled by 5 loci and 22.6% of proteins were controlled by more than 10 pQTLs [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>]. 98% of associations involved distant, presumably <italic>trans</italic>-acting loci (&gt; 1 kB from the target gene in the compact <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome) while the remainder were nearby and likely acted in <italic>cis</italic>. A large proportion of these associations were due to a small number of <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory hotspots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> that controlled a disproportionate number of targets: the 100 most pleiotropic <italic>trans</italic>-pQTL genes (out of ~ 2,000) accounted for more than 44% of associations.</p><p id="P19">The transcription factor <italic>PHO2</italic>, for instance, controlled the adenine biosynthetic pathway [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D</xref>].

We first used a classic metric (BLOSUM62<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>) to assess the conservation of missense <italic>trans</italic> pQTNs as compared to all other segregating missense variants.

With this in mind, we used the FoldX variant effect prediction algorithm–which incorporates protein structures–to score the pQTNs and the set of control missense variants47. This analysis indicated that <italic>trans</italic> pQTNs were indeed more disruptive to protein stability than other segregating missense mutations (median ΔΔG ~ 0.83 vs. 0.54 kcal/mol; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-6</sup>) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>].</p><p id="P27">The discrepancy between the BLOSUM62 and FoldX predictions suggested that local context within a protein was important. Consistent with this idea, amongst the pleiotropic <italic>trans</italic> hotspots we identified, perturbative missense <italic>trans</italic>-pQTNs often occurred outside of the core functional domains of the encoded protein: Ira2<sup>Asn201Ser</sup> (356 targets) lay outside of the Rho GTPase domain; Gcs1<sup>Ala147Pro</sup> (50 targets) outside of the ArfGAP catalytic domain; and Snf5<sup>Lys174Thr</sup> (37 targets) in a disordered region outside of the conserved SNF5/SMARCB1 domain [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>].

We also noted that Ura5<sup>Gly73Val</sup>, which controlled 79 targets, lay in the core phosphoribosyltransferase domain of the enzyme – this may account for its strong and widespread effects.</p><p id="P28">Generalizing this idea, we hypothesized that two parameters might capture key aspects of the structural context: 1) a residue’s solvent-accessible surface area and 2) the number of other alpha-carbon atoms within 10Å (a proxy for the local complexity of the protein fold). Together, we expected these metrics to capture the proximity of a residue to a protein’s core folded and functional domains. Exploiting the availability of AlphaFold2-predicted backbone structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, we calculated these statistics for every residue in the yeast proteome. Reasoning that missense variants that fixed in wild strains might themselves represent a conservative subset of the possible mutational spectrum, we first compared all segregating missense variants in our cross to all possible missense SNPs that could arise in the proteome (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S26">Methods</xref>). Indeed, the mutations present in the F6 progeny used in our experiments were both more solvent-exposed and occurred in less-complex regions of the protein fold <italic>(p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-20</sup>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-90</sup>; respectively) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>]. The same was true when considering only transitions or only transversions, suggesting that this finding was independent of biases in the origin of the natural mutations. Nevertheless, amongst these fixed mutations, both structural metrics distinguished missense pQTNs from all other segregating missense variants: pQTNs were more buried and occurred in more complex regions of the fold relative to other segregating variation (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.04; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02; respectively) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4J</xref>].

Reconstructing the putative causal variant had widespread effects on protein abundance that agreed very well with our mapping results: nearly all the proteomic effects in the clinical (YJM) background (94%; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-19</sup>) and the majority in the vineyard (RM) background (78%; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-11</sup>) agreed with the mapping prediction [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref>]. Thus, the Ira2<sup>Asn201Ser</sup> mutation is a true pleiotropic <italic>trans</italic>-pQTN.</p><p id="P40">Although highly sensitive, our phenotypic and pQTL mapping approaches (like most, with a handful of exceptions, <italic>e.g</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup>) assume a linear model in which the effects of mutations combine additively. We therefore entertained the possibility that while the regulatory effects of the Ira2<sup>Asn201Ser</sup> mutation were as predicted, its effects were modified by nonlinearities not captured by our linear model (<italic>e.g.</italic>, those arising due to genetic background effects). Indeed, the quantitative consequences of the <italic>IRA2</italic> variant were much more pronounced in the YJM background than in its RM counterpart, despite widespread directional concordance [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I</xref>]. This suggested that a genetic background effect might be at play.</p><p id="P41">With this in mind, and considering that Ras/PKA signaling is central to nutrient sensing, we measured the growth of the genome-edited strains bearing the <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory mutation on various carbon sources. Strikingly, we found that the Ira2<sup>Asn201Ser</sup> mutation had fitness effects that were both strain- and condition-specific: the vineyard allele was highly deleterious in the clinical background when cells were grown on non-fermentable carbon sources, whereas the clinical variant had a minimal fitness effect when reintroduced into the vineyard background [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6J</xref>].</p><p id="P42">Conversely, the clinical mutation modestly impacted fermentative growth in the vineyard background, while the vineyard mutation had no significant effect under such conditions in the clinical parent [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6E</xref>]. The asymmetric phenotypic effects of the Ira2A<sup>sn</sup>2<sup>01Ser</sup> polymorphism were likely obscured in statistical mapping due to the segregation of suppressing alleles responsible for the strong background effect. Thus, molecular mapping can unmask nonlinearities that otherwise disguise the fitness effects of even highly pleiotropic regulatory hotspots, and forecast their impact under the conditions where these effects emerge.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Forecasting variant effects across environments from molecular phenotypes</title><p id="P43">The proteomic measurements that determined our mutation-to-protein map were made only in the absence of stress: the causal <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variant at <italic>ERG11</italic> for instance [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>], was identified as a pQTN in media without azoles, but was a potent regulator of azole sensitivity. Likewise, the widespread proteomic impact of the <italic>IRA2</italic> hotspot mutation was readily apparent in minimal glucose, even though its fitness consequences emerged more strongly in respiratory conditions. Moreover, stress-response QTLs were highly condition-specific: we saw little decline in the identification of unique QTLs as we considered additional environments [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>]. In concordance with an omnigenic model of complex heritability in which many genes contribute to a phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>, stress-response traits were more genetically complex than protein levels and stress-response QTLs exhibited smaller median effect sizes than pQTLs (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-16</sup>) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>]. Consistent with their larger effects, and in contrast to phenotypic QTLs, rarefaction analysis indicated that we captured a comprehensive pQTL atlas [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>]. Together, these properties suggested that the genotype-to-protein map was well-powered to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying emergent stress-response QTLs.</p><p id="P44">Although effects on phenotype arise through diverse mechanisms, and only a subset act <italic>via</italic> changes in protein level, our mutation-to-protein map overall contained rich information on causality: pQTNs were much closer to stress-response QTNs than expected by chance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-11</sup>) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>]. Moreover, the effect sizes of pQTNs and stress-response QTNs were correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.29; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-16</sup>) [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that growth phenotypes reflect the effects of underlying mutations controlling proteins with distinct phenotypic consequences [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7D</xref>]. Indeed, across all the environments we surveyed, pQTNs discovered in minimal glucose medium were much more predictive of causality under stress (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>-152</sup>) than QTNs from the minimal glucose condition [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E</xref>].</p><p id="P45">Rapamycin and tebuconazole resistance traits, for instance, shared few large-effect QTLs in common (<italic>e.g. HPF1</italic>) and were predominantly driven by distinct loci (<italic>e.g.</italic> at <italic>RICTOR/AVO3</italic> and <italic>ERG11</italic>, respectively): of the 663 causal loci identified in rapamycin, only 268 (40%) coincided with one of the 635 causal loci underlying tebuconazole resistance [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7F</xref>]. Strikingly, on the other hand, the genetic architecture of protein levels had much greater overlap, with 489 tebuconazole-resistance loci (77%) and 534 rapamycin-resistance loci (81%) coinciding with a pQTL. This was true in general: across the diverse environments we tested, an average of 78% of stress-resistance QTLs colocalized with a pQTL, in contrast to an average of only 48% of QTLs coinciding between stress conditions [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7G</xref>]. This suggested that the molecular effects of genetic diversity that pre-existed in unstressed cells emerged into distinct cellular phenotypes under stress. Molecular mapping therefore holds powerful promise in forecasting the functional consequences of mutations, even if the maps are charted before pathologies emerge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S18" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P46">Most mutations, and even many genes, remain of unknown cellular function. A promising bridge from genotype to phenotype is to map the effects of natural variants on protein levels, because proteins perform an array of critical cellular functions that link the DNA blueprint to physiology. Despite this promise, causally linking individual mutations to their proteomic consequences and phenotypic effects remains a challenge. This is in part because most genetic mapping approaches yield (at best) gene-level resolution, and also because mutations can alter protein function in various ways; for example, many proteins function in protein complexes or larger molecular pathways. Moreover, associating proteins with phenotypes alone often cannot disentangle whether changes in protein levels are truly causal. Here, building on ‘super-resolution’ phenotype mapping using a large segregant panel from two closely related yeast parents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, we combined this approach with quantification-precise high-throughput proteomics to link genetic to proteomic diversity.</p><p id="P47">Although we do not quantify all proteins, we capture a large fraction on a molar basis. Quantifying additional marginal proteins would not change the overall regulatory picture we charted, as indicated by rarefaction analysis (although more <italic>cis</italic>-acting loci would likely be identified). Notably, because essential proteins are enriched in the high-abundance protein fraction well-detected by mass spectrometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, our map captures essential proteins particularly well, and thus complements forward and reverse genetic screens. Moreover, because our cross recombines naturally occurring genetic variation, our study complements deep mutational scans that contain many variants not found in nature.</p><p id="P48">Despite their small genetic differences, the two parental isolates harbor highly diverged, functionally coherent proteomes. While the boundaries set by the parents largely define the proteomes of the offspring, the offspring exhibited substantial proteomic diversification, as well. Exploiting the segregation of the underlying genetic diversity in the F6 progeny, we captured genetic control for most proteins in our atlas, with a surprisingly high number of variants impacting protein levels. Thus, fixed natural mutations were often far from neutral: even the variation between two closely related strains proved to be a rich vein of diversity in the proteome.</p><p id="P49">Notably, proteins that did not differ in abundance between the parents often changed in the offspring. Termed transgression, this property has been reported for mRNA abundance and organismal phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>, but has thus far received limited attention in the proteome. Similar effects also likely underlie the phenotypic transgression commonly observed in agricultural genetics73. Further, for several proteins, their abundance in most of the offspring closely resembled one parent rather than the other. Interestingly, the deviating parent often represented an extreme relative to other wild isolates, while the typical offspring more closely resembled the average of natural strains across the species. Both phenomena are explained in our data by multiple loci that aggregate in controlling the abundance of a protein. Due to different variants driving abundance in opposing directions, the extremes become less likely–but not inaccessible–compared to typical protein levels. Natural genetic diversity is thus amplified in the proteome through meiosis; this emergent proteomic diversity could be a potent source of variation allowing some offspring to rapidly adapt to new environments.</p><p id="P50">Our dataset demonstrates the added value of proteomics in interpreting genetic variation. We achieved explanatory power previously reported only for mutation-to-mRNA maps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, but with the critical addition of very high resolution–often implicating single causal nucleotides. This highlighted the complementarity of eQTL and pQTL approaches: many <italic>cis</italic>-pQTL effects are detected only at the proteome level, with no evidence of mRNA allelic imbalance for the associated mRNAs. These associations likely stem from protein properties that are not represented at the mRNA level, such translation efficiency, protein stability, and turnover. Conversely, we observed widespread signatures of <italic>trans</italic> mRNA regulation in our pQTL map (for example, downstream of the Ras/PKA pathway). The remaining missing heritability in our and prior studies likely arises from a large number of small-effect variants, some epistatic contributions, and epigenetic influences, such as prions, that we have not yet tracked in the meiotic progeny. Previous difficulties in identifying signatures of mRNA-level effects in proteomes likely arose primarily from comparatively limited statistical power to identify and colocalize <italic>trans-</italic>eQTLs and -pQTLs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. Of note, much of <italic>trans</italic> regulation arose from proteins not usually thought of as regulatory, and illustrates the profound self-regulatory structure of metabolism. Indeed, <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory variants were often found in metabolic enzymes and transporters.</p><p id="P51">The sheer number of well-resolved pQTLs we identified, and our choice to study the progeny of two wild isolates, rather than one wild and one domesticated strain, granted excellent statistical power to assess natural selection on protein levels. Indeed, a sign test on pQTLs revealed that directional selection had acted to reshape the proteome to fit the niches inhabited by each parent, despite their relatively recent evolutionary divergence. This further suggests that the levels of many proteins are relevant to fitness and subject to selection. These and many prior observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> call into question the notion that much of segregating genetic variation is functionally neutral, or nearly so. Rather, natural proteomes likely reflect an intricate interplay between stabilizing selection–as evidenced by transgression–and directional selection–as reflected in the striking proteomic divergence of the parents and the results of the pQTL sign test.</p><p id="P52"><italic>Cis</italic>-acting effects were balanced between coding and non-coding variants, but coding variation appears to have a privileged role in <italic>trans</italic> regulation of protein levels. This may be because coding variants can alter both protein function and abundance, while non-coding variants are expected to leave the former untouched. Given that few genes are haploinsufficient, whether in yeast or humans, tolerance of small excursions in the amount of a gene product may be a general property. Indeed, in a recent study addressing aneuploid gene dosage in natural strains, we made similar observations and hypothesized that the attenuation of <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulatory variation may arise from buffering of the proteome against gene expression noise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Accounting for the structural context of the <italic>trans</italic> pQTNs in their host proteins revealed molecular signatures that distinguished pQTNs from other segregating variants. Thus, the potency of a coding <italic>trans</italic>-pQTN likely depends on the amino acid substitution it encodes and the function of the protein domain in which the mutation occurs. Given that less stable proteins are more quickly degraded, we speculate that many pQTNs altered protein abundance by reducing stability. Mapping other molecular layers (<italic>e.g.</italic> metabolite levels) may help to disentangle effects on protein stability <italic>versus</italic> catalytic activity, as may considering the position and role of proteins in the metabolic network, as we have shown elsewhere on longer timescales of adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. Another intriguing question for future study is which mutations represent a simple modulation (modest gain or loss) of existing activity <italic>versus</italic> an incipient neofunctionalization or gain of new targets.</p><p id="P53">Abundance covariation amongst the progeny revealed a rich map of functional associations–much more so than considering covariation only in the parents. The pQTL map revealed functional connections not captured by prior interaction networks, even in yeast where these resources are most complete. In a few cases (&lt; 4%), pQTLs reflected known physical or genetic interactions between the proteins, but to a much larger extent our molecular map reflected physiological interactions not captured by these metrics. These included global metabolic traits, such as a cryptic causal variant in <italic>IRA2</italic>, common in natural strains, which affected the respiration/fermentation balance via the Ras/PKA pathway; functional metabolic traits, such as the iron- and iron-sulfur co-dependency of the respiratory chain; and local metabolic traits such as the anti-correlation of hexokinases. Additional functional relationships can likely be identified by extending high-resolution mapping to post-translational modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> and protein-protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>, which are governed by some overlapping and some distinct processes relative to protein abundance pQTLs. Also of interest is to dissect how many of the surprising pQTL hotspots we identified (<italic>e.g.,</italic> at <italic>FRE1</italic>) are mediated by mRNA levels, or whether they are in part due to direct cofactor binding and posttranslational protein destabilization invisible in the transcriptome. Indeed, cofactors are highly prevalent for several important enzyme classes, such as oxidoreductases (80% having a cofactor) and transferases (36%), highlighting the far-reaching potential of this mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. Moreover, there is emerging evidence of many other metabolite-protein interactions that are only beginning to be characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P54">High-resolution molecular mapping also proved valuable in identifying cryptic causal variants hidden in plain sight, such as the epistatic variant we identified in <italic>IRA2</italic>. Indeed, the low SNP density in our mapping panel allowed us to readily pinpoint the function of this mutation, unlike in other genetic backgrounds in which the variant exhibits strong epistasis even within the <italic>IRA2</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>. Proteomics suggests that the phenotypic masking we observed arises in part from buffering of the impact of the mutation across all of its targets. This phenomenon likely arises from multiple suppressor mutations throughout the genome, as in the case of a single segregating suppressing allele we would likely observe a residual phenotypic mapping signal [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref>]. Complex cryptic effects like these are particularly pernicious: they do not manifest as “missing heritability”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup> but rather as “hidden causality,” because they are suppressed in most progeny. An intriguing area for future investigation is the metabolic basis of this pronounced epistatic effect, and we speculate that genotype-to-protein maps may show the way to many cryptic genetic variants.</p><p id="P55">Finally, we show that much of the adaptive potential of natural variation under stress can be forecast from molecular genetic mapping: pQTNs that were initially phenotypically buffered were highly predictive of fitness effects in new environments. Thus, proteome diversity may explain emerging phenotypic differences across environments, and may be a mechanistic explanation for the difficulty in predicting phenotype across conditions using genomic data alone. This in turn suggests that molecular maps can highlight variants that are likely to emerge to cause disease even if mutation-to-molecule relationships are mapped before pathologies develop (although such conclusions will likely require the integration of other data, for instance, on which genes are causally related to a pathology). Moreover, data from a single tissue or, as with serum, from a pool of proteins from multiple tissues, likely holds molecular regulatory information to support inferences in other tissues affected by a disease.</p></sec><sec id="S19" sec-type="methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>STAR Methods</title><sec id="S20"><title>Resource availability</title><sec id="S21"><title>Lead contact</title><p id="P56">Requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Prof. Daniel F.

Summary results of these simulations can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7C</xref>.
