In this paper, we analyse the genetic and phenotypic contribution of the pAA virulence plasmid to a non-Shigatoxigenic O104:H4 strain (1070/13) that was nonetheless implicated in a substantial UK outbreak in 2013. We find that pAA<sub>1070</sub> is 99.95% identical across 88% of the plasmid sequence to pTY2 from the 2011 outbreak strain and has a copy number of approximately 2-3 plasmid molecules per chromosome. We demonstrate that pAA<sub>1070</sub> carries a functional CcdAB plasmid addiction system that only marginally impacts its stability under the conditions tested and that none of the other toxin-antitoxin systems encoded by the plasmid appear to be functional, though we note a surprisingly high stability of the plasmid <italic>in vitro</italic> regardless. We demonstrate the expected contribution of pAA<sub>1070</sub> to intestinal cell adhesion but find that it does not contribute to biofilm formation. When assessing the impact of pAA<sub>1070</sub> on motility, we discovered a region of the O104:H4 chromosome that can be excised, abolishing motility via truncation of the <italic>fliR</italic> gene. Ultimately this work contributes to our knowledge of enteroaggregative <italic>E. coli</italic> as an important pathovar in its own right and demonstrates the complexity but necessity of experimentally characterising genuine outbreak strains rather than domesticated laboratory strains in order to understand virulence phenotypes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>plasmid</kwd><kwd>toxin-antitoxin</kwd><kwd>postsegregational killing</kwd><kwd>enteroaggregative</kwd><kwd>motility</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Abbreviations</title><glossary><def-list><def-item><term>AAF</term><def><p id="P2">aggregative adherence fimbriae</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ddPCR</term><def><p id="P3">digital droplet polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EAEC</term><def><p id="P4">enteroaggregative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EHEC</term><def><p id="P5">enterohaemorrhagic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FAM</term><def><p id="P6">fluorescein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HEX</term><def><p id="P7">hexachlorofluorescein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MGE</term><def><p id="P8">mobile genetic element</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>pAA</term><def><p id="P9">aggregative adherence plasmid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>pINV</term><def><p id="P10">invasion plasmid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSK</term><def><p id="P11">postsegregational killing</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P12"><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is a common enteric bacterium in mammals. Due to its propensity for mobile genetic element (MGE) acquisition, commensal or otherwise avirulent <italic>E. coli</italic> can be converted into pathogenic forms known as pathovars, defined by their mode of virulence in human disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. One such diarrheagenic pathovar, enteroaggregative <italic>E. coli</italic> (EAEC), is phenotypically characterised by a “stacked-brick” adherence pattern on intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. This phenotype is thought to result from the production of aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAF) typically encoded on a large (70-130 kb) aggregative adherence plasmid, pAA.</p><p id="P13">In mid-2011, EAEC serotype O104:H4 made headlines after infecting almost 4,000 people and killing over 50 otherwise-healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The atypical outbreak variant was found to be a hybrid pathovar, carrying both the expected EAEC virulence genes on its pAA variant, named pTY2 in sequenced strain TY2482 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], and a gene encoding Shiga-like toxin variant Stx2a on a prophage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The carriage of both traits likely dramatically enhanced the strain’s virulence relative to both non-enteroaggregative enterohaemorrhagic <italic>E. coli</italic> (EHEC) and non-enterohaemorrhagic EAEC. Whilst Shiga-like toxins are highly-studied virulence factors of EHEC, the virulence plasmid of EAEC is far less well-characterised. AAF are found in five different forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] and the pAA plasmids that encode them are similarly varied. After a thorough recent analysis, Boisen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] proposed that EAEC be characterised genetically by the presence of both AAF and the plasmid-encoded master regulator, AggR. Other genes such as those encoding the anti-aggregation protein dispersin and its related transporters are also highly-represented amongst EAEC strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p id="P14">Given their size, low copy number and propensity to encode complex protein-based macromolecules (e.g. specialised fimbriae or secretion systems), enteric virulence plasmids are often associated with a growth burden and can be lost or degraded when their specific function is not required, such as during growth outside the pathogen’s preferred niche or in laboratory culture. To counter this, many such plasmids encode maintenance systems or induce compensatory mutations in the bacterial host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Toxin-antitoxin (TA) loci are plasmid maintenance systems comprised of genes encoding a stable toxin protein and unstable antitoxin, which can itself be either a protein or RNA molecule. In type II TA systems, both toxin and antitoxin are proteins, and the antitoxin functions by directly binding to and sequestering the toxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Type II antitoxins are rapidly degraded by cellular proteases such as Lon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. After bacterial cell division, loss of a plasmid carrying TA genes results in toxin activation and bacterial growth arrest or death, as the antitoxin is degraded and not replaced; hence, a growing population must retain the plasmid to avoid this post-segregational killing (PSK). Two well-characterised type II TA systems are <italic>ccdAB</italic>, encoding DNA gyrase poison CcdB and its antidote CcdA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], and <italic>vapBC</italic>, encoding tRNA-cleaving toxin VapC and its antidote VapB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Both <italic>ccdAB</italic> and <italic>vapBC</italic> are common in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> virulence plasmids, though their stability functions vary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><p id="P15">In 2013, a multi-pathogen foodborne disease outbreak in Newcastle, United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>] was found to be predominantly caused by EAEC strains carrying a wide range of pAA plasmids. Whilst these isolates were all Shiga toxin-negative, amongst the strains were O104:H4 isolates carrying a form of pAA almost identical to pTY2 from the 2011 outbreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. The 2013 Newcastle strains can therefore be used as convenient model organisms to study the virulence and maintenance functions of this particular pAA variant.</p><p id="P16">Given their role in pathoadaption, knowledge of the impact and stability of <italic>E. coli</italic> MGEs is essential to understand how the organism causes disease and how it is able to amass multiple MGEs in order to form hybrid pathovars. In this study, we characterise various virulence functions of pAA in Newcastle outbreak strain 1070/13 and analyse the role of CcdAB encoded on this plasmid. We also identify a region within the chromosome of the organism that is able to spontaneously excise and disable motility in the strain, perhaps suggesting a future evolutionary step for the organism.</p></sec><sec id="S3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S4"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p id="P17">Bacterial strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) were grown in lysogeny broth (LB; Sigma-Aldrich, UK) or on solid L-agar (LB + 1.5 % (w/v) agar (Sigma-Aldrich, UK)) supplemented with relevant antibiotics unless otherwise stated.

The former gave a mean read depth of 264.6x, and the latter a mean read depth of 100.3x, indicating a plasmid copy number of approximately 2.6 plasmid molecules per chromosome; a result expected from prior studies on enteric virulence plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. Long read sequencing from our hybrid approach agreed, giving a copy number of 2.48 plasmids per chromosome (calculated from an overall plasmid contig depth of 2.82x to a mean chromosome contig depth of 1.138x).</p><p id="P32">To confirm this value experimentally, we carried out droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) to determine the absolute DNA quantities of a range of plasmid genes relative to chromosome genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> 1070/13 grown to stationary phase in LB at 37°C. Results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) show an estimated plasmid copy number of between approximately 1.5 and 3.3 depending upon probe combination; the mean of 2.2 plasmid molecules per chromosome was in general agreement with the copy number extrapolated from sequencing data. As a control for the ddPCR assay, we also produced a pAA-cured variant of strain 1070/13.

Based on this information, we designed primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) to detect the configuration of this genomic region and confirmed that motility loss in all instances, including the Δ<italic>ccdB</italic> mutant, correlated perfectly with excision of this region, whereas strains containing the sequence (and hence the full-length <italic>fliR</italic> gene), including the Δ<italic>aggR</italic> mutant, remained motile.

We have also shown almost no measurable difference in toxicity between constructs encoding CcdB<sub>101</sub>, the traditionally-characterised variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>], and CcdB<sub>110</sub> (a variant putatively translated from an alternative TTG start codon on pAA<sub>1070</sub>). However, since we saw no difference in toxicity against the native host bacterium, we did not experimentally validate the proteins produced from each construct. It therefore remains possible (even likely) that the TTG start codon is not genuinely recognised by the translation machinery, that it is an annotation error, and that our CcdB<sub>110</sub> construct is simply producing the CcdB<sub>101</sub> variant. If ongoing work suggests a potential impact of this alternate start codon, further protein characterisation should be performed as a priority.</p><p id="P49">Divergently-transcribed TA systems are not well-studied, and given the role of conditional cooperativity, i.e. binding of type II TA complexes to their own promoters, we wondered whether the CcdAB and VapBC systems on pAA<sub>1070</sub> might impact one another’s gene expression as has been reported for several TA systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>] and the divergently-transcribed <italic>par1/par2</italic> partitioning loci on pB171 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>]. However, with the finding that this particular VapC variant is non-toxic and that this is likely due to an active site mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], this avenue was not pursued further in this particular work. Nonetheless, regardless of a lack of VapC toxicity, putative regulation by the VapBC complex may also alter the effectiveness of the CcdAB system with regards to plasmid stability. Notably, the strain we used to perform pSTAB analysis does not encode VapBC. Though we did demonstrate a significant <italic>ccdAB</italic>-dependent increase in pSTAB<sub>1070</sub> stability, the effect was not dramatic (&lt; 10-fold). This subtle plasmid-stabilising role is not atypical of CcdAB TA systems, where some members of this particular TA system family have been shown to impart little or no stabilising effect overall under laboratory conditions despite being highly toxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. It is possible that the pAA CcdAB system functions primarily not as a PSK module but as a regulator of other cellular functions. The regulatory function of both non-toxic and toxic but non-stabilising TA complexes is currently a subject of ongoing investigation within our laboratory.</p><p id="P50">We have shown that pAA is a low-copy virulence plasmid, similar to other pathovar-defining plasmids in <italic>E. coli</italic> such as pINV (copy number approximately 1 per chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]). We have also confirmed that pAA<sub>1070</sub> is remarkably stable <italic>in vitro</italic>, with &lt;1% natural plasmid loss occurring over multiple subcultures in liquid media, in agreement with a stress study on the 2011 outbreak strain of hybridised EAEC/EHEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>] and consistent with our pSTAB results (approximately 0.1% plasmid loss over 20-25 generations of growth on solid medium). The lack of a stabilising TA system on this plasmid is therefore curious, as such maintenance elements are important for the stability of similar virulence plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>]. We note that the plasmid carries genes related to ParA- and ParM-type partitioning systems; such systems function by physically segregating plasmid molecules during cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>] as opposed to the PSK activity of TA systems. TA systems and partitioning systems often work synergistically to optimise plasmid maintenance without excessive PSK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>]. However, the partitioning operons on pAA<sub>1070</sub> are incomplete and are therefore unlikely to contribute to plasmid maintenance. Instead, as suggested by our pSTAB assay, the dual FII/FIB replicon of pAA<sub>1070</sub> may be the cause of the plasmid’s <italic>in vitro</italic> stability. Indeed, it was not possible for us to generate pSTAB vectors using the FII replicon alone, contrasting past success with other IncFII and IncA/C plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>]. We also note here the work by Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>] related to Stx-encoding O104:H4 in case patients, which showed that pAA may be far less stable <italic>in vivo</italic> than <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is possible that laboratory conditions are insufficient to reflect the host environment and that time-dependent pAA loss during infection is a common factor in human EAEC pathogenicity, though this would likely render the bacterium relatively non-pathogenic after passage through the host. Alternatively, pAA loss within the host may be correlated to production of Shiga toxin. To our knowledge, no research has addressed pAA loss in non-Shigatoxigenic EAEC isolates during the process of infection within patients.</p><p id="P51">Studies have previously reported the enhanced motility of EAEC strains compared to MG1655 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>], agreeing with our data. The plasmid-encoded EAEC virulence regulator AggR may negatively regulate the aggregation factor antigen 43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>] and positively regulate flagellar genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>]. In the former work, no motility effects were observed in the <italic>aggR</italic> mutant background, in agreement with our study. Contrasting this, motility was increased by overexpressing <italic>aggR</italic> in EAEC strain 042 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>]. This did not occur with the addition of our <italic>aggR</italic> complementation vector; though, as the <italic>aggR</italic> promoter is under complex regulation, increasing the gene’s copy number may not increase AggR production <italic>per se</italic>, or there may be relevant differences between EAEC strains. Notably, EAEC strain 042 carries a larger pAA variant than strain 1070/13 (113.3 kb vs 75.5 kb) and encodes AAF/II rather than AAF/I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Indeed, Prieto <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>] showed that motility in strain 042 was increased by loss of the pAA plasmid, which we cannot rule out due to conflicting effects of <italic>fliR</italic> mutation in our pAA<sup>–</sup> strain.</p><p id="P52">We demonstrated that loss of motility in EAEC strain 1070/13 can occur readily during laboratory culture and mutagenesis. This phenotype was found to correlate perfectly with the spontaneous excision of a chromosomal region bordered by transposase genes and insertion sequences, containing the 3’ end of the <italic>fliR</italic> gene. We note this as a cautionary tale in the era of readily-accessible whole genome sequencing; knowledge of the excised region in advance of our motility and complementation experiments would have been an advantage. The same chromosomal region, including IS elements, is present in the 2011 outbreak strain TY2482 (shotgun sequence scaffold4; accession NZ_GL989603.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], though it is unknown if motility loss has ever occurred during experiments with that strain. Whilst reversible motility loss via transposon excision and re-insertion may reflect a type of phase variation in EAEC, we did not observe reversion to a motile phenotype during our assays. Alternatively, the ability of the organism to lose motility may confer an evolutionary benefit and future route to heightened pathogenesis, as some other enteric pathogens such as <italic>Shigella</italic> contain cryptic flagellar genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>]. We observed no impact of this motility loss on either biofilm formation or host cell adhesion in our experiments. Ultimately, our study reflects the complexity of working with pathogenic outbreak isolates rather than laboratory strains, and validates the importance of doing so.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS199790-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_1.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d35aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figure 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS199790-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d35aAcFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Figure 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS199790-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d35aAcFdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Table</label><media xlink:href="EMS199790-supplement-Supplementary_Table.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d35aAcFeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS199790-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d35aAcFfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Claire Jenkins for strain provision under a Material Transfer Agreement (2017-03-23) from Public Health England (now UKHSA).

Statement</title></caption><p>Enteroaggregative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> causes severe food-borne illness in humans. One serotype, O104:H4, caused a worldwide outbreak in 2011 that infected almost 4,000 people and killed dozens. The 2011 strain contained two key virulence factors: the Shiga toxin encoded by a bacteriophage and a plasmid that encodes aggregative adherence fimbriae for adhesion to host cell surfaces. Whilst the Shiga toxin has been studied extensively, the virulence plasmid has been far less well-characterised. In this study, we characterise the plasmid of a non-Shigatoxigenic O104:H4 outbreak strain and find that it contributes to host cell adherence, as expected, and that it encodes a functional CcdAB toxin-antitoxin stability system. We also demonstrate that part of the strain’s chromosome can be spontaneously lost during growth in the laboratory, converting the organism from highly-motile to non-motile, and suggesting a future evolutionary route for the bacterium, as has occurred in similar enteric pathogens such as <italic>Shigella</italic>. In summary, this work contributes to our knowledge of often-neglected enteroaggregative <italic>E. coli</italic> as an important pathovar and highlights the necessity of experimentally characterising genuine outbreak strains rather than “domesticated” laboratory strains.</p></boxed-text><boxed-text id="BX2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Repositories/Data Summary</title></caption><p>The authors confirm all supporting data, code and protocols have been provided within the article or through supplementary data files.

Dark blue: transposase-related genes; yellow: flagellar genes; green: other genes of known function; grey: genes encoding hypothetical proteins. PCR primers indicated by black arrows; rev primer forms a product of either 771 bp (pairing with fwd primer 1, indicating excision of region) or 962 bp (pairing with fwd primer 2, indicating presence of region). <bold>(D)</bold> PCR screen of bacteria used in motility assay (three replicates per strain), indicating presence/absence of the excised region. Representative of multiple independent PCR/motility assays. NTC: no template control. L: ladder; band sizes (bp) shown left.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199790-f005"/></fig></floats-group></article>
