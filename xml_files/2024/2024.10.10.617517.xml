A key feature of the transition to MASH involves oxidative stress resulting from defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Here, we show that pathological alterations in the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) directly instigate electron transfer inefficiency to promote oxidative stress. Specifically, mitochondrial cardiolipin (CL) was downregulated with MASLD/MASH in mice and in humans. Hepatocyte-specific CL synthase knockout (CLS-LKO) led to spontaneous and robust MASH with extensive steatotic and fibrotic phenotype. Loss of CL paradoxically increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity but also reduced the formation of I+III<sub>2</sub>+IV<sub>1</sub> respiratory supercomplex and interfered with the ability of coenzyme Q (CoQ) to transfer electrons to complex III. In turn, the bottleneck at complex III promoted electron leak primarily at site III<sub>Q0</sub> as well as other upstream sites in the electron transport chain. Thus, reduction in mitochondrial CL promotes oxidative stress and contributes to pathogenesis of MASH.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a growing global health concern with an increasing prevalence that parallels the rise in obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> In the United States, annual medical costs related to MASLD exceed $103 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> A large portion of patients with MASLD only exhibit steatosis, a silent and relatively benign early stage characterized by lipid accumulation in hepatocytes without hepatocellular inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> Steatosis can then progress to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), determined by hepatocyte injury and tissue fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> MASH is the last stage of MASLD that may be reversible, making intervention at this stage particularly important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> Although extensive clinical and basic research have been conducted in this field, the underlying mechanisms by which fatty liver transitions to MASH remain poorly understood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup></p><p id="P4">A defect in mitochondrial function is considered one of the hallmarks of MASLD progression in both mice and humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> MASLD is initially associated with an increase in mitochondrial respiratory capacity, followed by a subsequent impairment in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> Mitochondrial ROS is thought to be caused by an inefficient electron transport chain (ETC) that increases the propensity for electron leak.

Thus, we performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) lipidomics specifically on mitochondria isolated from human liver samples with or without MASH. Samples from patients undergoing liver transplant or resection due to end-stage MASH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended Data Table 1</xref>) were compared to samples from patients without MASH, undergoing resection for benign liver tumors or metastases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Strikingly, mitochondrial CL levels were reduced, primarily due to a decrease in tetralinoleoyl CL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), commonly thought as the mature and functional form of CL. Additionally, levels of mitochondrial PG, an essential precursor to CL production, were also reduced, suggesting a disruption in CL biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d-e</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We next performed lipidomic analyses on four distinct mouse models of MASLD/MASH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f-q</xref>). These included: 1) mice given a Western high-fat diet (HFD, Envigo TD.88137) or standard chow diet for 16 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), 2) ob/ob mice or their wildtype littermates at 20 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), 3) mice given the Gubra Amylin NASH diet for 30 weeks (GAN, Research Diets D09100310) or standard chow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>), 4) mice injected with carbon tetrachloride (CCI<sub>4</sub>) or vehicle (corn oil) for 6 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). Importantly, none of these interventions appear to alter the protein abundances of OXPHOS subunits or citrate synthase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1j-m</xref>), suggesting that these interventions did not alter mitochondrial density in hepatocytes. Nevertheless, we performed all mitochondrial lipidomic analyses by quantifying lipids per mg of mitochondrial proteins. Each intervention appeared to alter different subsets of mitochondrial lipid classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1n-q</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">2</xref>), as seen with our previous studies in skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> We take these observations to mean that most physiological interventions induce multiple systemic and local responses that are not mechanistically directly related to the phenotype of interest (e.g., cold exposure or exercise can increase food intake, obesity could affect locomotion and insulation, etc.). Although several phospholipid classes were altered among the four models, strikingly, mitochondrial CL was reduced in all four MASLD/MASH models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1n-r</xref>). Furthermore, PG was significantly increased in all MASLD/MASH models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1n-r</xref>). These changes coincided with decreased transcript levels for CLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1s-v</xref>). These observations further suggest that an insult in CL synthesis may be a key factor to disrupting mitochondrial function in MASLD/MASH.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Hepatocyte-specific deletion of cardiolipin synthase promotes MASH</title><p id="P9">CL is thought to be exclusively synthesized in the IMM where CLS is localized. To study the role of CL in hepatocytes, we generated mice with hepatocyte-specific knockout of CLS (CLS-LKO for <italic>CLS l</italic>iver <italic>k</italic>nock<italic>o</italic>ut, driven by albumin-Cre) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>), which successfully decreased mitochondrial CL levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>). Consistent with our previous studies in non-hepatocytes, CLS deletion does not completely reduce CL levels to zero, suggesting that CL generated in other tissues may be imported. Our results showed that decreased levels of CL did not significantly impact body weight or composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d,e</xref>) but resulted in significantly less liver mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We sought to further characterize livers from control and CLS-LKO mice. Histological analyses revealed that CLS deletion was sufficient to promote steatosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>) and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>) in standard chow-fed and high-fat fed conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4a,b</xref>). To more comprehensively describe the effects of loss of hepatic CLS on gene expression, we performed RNA sequencing on these livers. CLS deletion increased the expression of 713 genes and decreased 1026 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>).

CoQ is the main electron transporter between complex I/II and III. CLS deletion in hepatocytes appeared to disrupt CoQ’s ability to cycle between its oxidized and reduced forms. There are several ways in which low CL might directly or indirectly influence CoQ’s redox state. The primary suspect is CL interacting with complex III, as eight or nine CL molecules are tightly bound to complex III<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> and are thought to be essential to its function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> While CL has been found to bind to other respiratory complexes, our data suggest that loss of CL might disproportionately influence complex III. This is also supported by our findings that the loss of CL reduced the formation of complex III-dependent supercomplex, without influencing other supercomplexes. Reduced capacity for complex III to efficiently accept electrons from CoQ might explain the increased electron leak at site III<sub>Q0</sub> and increased level of oxidized CoQ. Meanwhile, loss of CL also increased electron leak at complex I and II. CL has also been implicated to bind to these complexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> Thus, complex III dysfunction is perhaps unlikely to entirely explain electron leaks at sites I<sub>F</sub>, I<sub>Q</sub>, and II<sub>F</sub>, though we think that the majority of its effect is due to the bottleneck created by the reduced ability of complex III to accept electrons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> Conversely, complex I and II are unlikely to be the only primary sites of defect as such defects probably will not promote electron leak at site III<sub>QO</sub>. Moreover, CLS deletion did not have an effect on the abundance of reduced CoQ despite there being greater abundance of oxidized CoQ, suggesting that complex I/II do not have reduced ability to transfer electrons onto CoQ. Another potential mechanism by which CL influences CoQ redox state is by CL directly interacting with CoQ. As they are both lipid molecules in the IMM, low CL may reduce the lateral diffusability of CoQ between respiratory complexes. Low CL might also indirectly influence CoQ by contributing to changes in membrane properties, distribution of ETC in the cristae, and the cristae architecture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> Finally, increased electron leak, regardless of their origin, could have a feed-forward effect by which oxidative stress disrupts redox homeostasis in other components of ETC.</p><p id="P28">MASH is a progressive liver disease characterized by lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> The progression to MASH involves a complex interplay of metabolic stress, mitochondrial defects, and immune responses that collectively promote hepatocellular injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> Our findings suggest that a low mitochondrial CL level directly induces key pathological features of MASH, including steatosis, fibrosis, and immune cell infiltration, even in the absence of dietary or environmental stressors, such as high-fat diet.

In those samples, where reduction in CL was quantitatively modest compared to what was induced with CLS knockout, CoQ might have gradually decreased coincidental to the decrease in CL.

We further link CL deficiency to increased electron leak at the CoQ-complex III interface, and as the primary defect that promotes oxidative stress. We believe that these bioenergetic changes underlie the pathogenesis of MASLD, as CL deletion was sufficient to cause steatosis, fibrosis, and inflammation, phenocopying many changes that occur with MASLD/MASH progression.
