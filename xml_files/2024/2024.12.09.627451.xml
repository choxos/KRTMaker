transcription factors and signalling pathways. This is likely mediated by numerous non-coding regulatory elements that shape sex-specific transcriptomic programs. To explore the dynamics of these in detail, we performed paired time-series of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility assays on pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells throughout their development in the embryo, making use of new and existing mouse reporter lines. Regulatory elements were associated with their putative target genes by linkage analysis, and this was complemented and verified experimentally using promoter capture Hi-C. We identified the transcription factor motifs enriched in these regulatory elements along with their occupancy, pinpointing LHX9/EMX2 as potentially critical regulators of ovarian development. Variations in the DNA sequence of these regulatory elements are likely to be responsible for many of the unexplained cases of individuals with Differences of Sex Development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Testis</kwd><kwd>Ovary</kwd><kwd>Sertoli cells</kwd><kwd>pre-granulosa cells</kwd><kwd>gene regulatory networks</kwd><kwd>cis-regulatory elements</kwd><kwd>Transcription Factor Binding Sites enrichment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">In eutherian mammals, sex determination occurs during embryo development with the bipotential gonad committing to either testicular or ovarian cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). This choice relies on an initially extremely delicate balance between the expression and repression of several key transcription factors (TFs) and signalling pathways. There is then a period of reinforcement involving redundant mechanisms, perhaps to ensure the whole gonad follows one fate, before specific factors can become predominant postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The gonadal differentiation process is, therefore, an ideal one in which to study cell fate decisions and the roles played by gene regulatory networks over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In mice, the bipotential gonad begins to develop at embryonic day 10 (E10.0) as a thickening layer positioned on the ventromedial surface of the mesonephros (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). The early bipotential gonad in the mouse comprises two distinct populations of progenitor cells: those derived from the coelomic epithelium, which can be considered multipotent because it is the origin of most of the somatic cell types, and the primordial germ cells, which differentiate according to the type of gonad that forms into spermatogonia in the testis, or oogonia in the ovary. The somatic cell types include the bipotential supporting cell precursors that differentiate into Sertoli cells (male) or pre-granulosa cells (female), and the steroidogenic cell precursors, which give rise to the majority of Leydig (male) or theca (female) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The underlying mesonephros also contributes to the gonadal via progenitor cells that later differentiate as either perivascular, Leydig and myoid cells (male) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) and theca cells (female) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). More recently, a population of supporting-like cells deriving from the gonadal coelomic epithelium close to the mesonephros have been identified at the origin of the <italic>rete testis</italic> and <italic>ovarii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In XY gonads, the sex-determining gene <italic>Sry</italic>, located on the Y chromosome, together with its direct downstream gene <italic>Sox9</italic>, initiates a genetic cascade at E11.5 leading to the differentiation of the supporting cell precursors into Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). Sertoli cell identity is further maintained by several other TFs and signalling pathways including NR5A1, GATA4, WT1, DMRT1, SOX8, and FGF9, which together reinforce Sertoli cell fate and repress the pre-granulosa cell pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Once established, Sertoli cells instruct the steroidogenic cell precursors to differentiate into Leydig cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), and also encapsulate the germ cells and promote their differentiation into prospermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In XX gonads, without SRY to upregulate <italic>Sox9</italic> expression by E11.5, the activity of ovarian promoting factors leads to pre-granulosa cell differentiation and ovary development. These include the ovarian determining factor WT1<sup>-KTS</sup> isoform, the WNT4/RSPO1/β-Catenin signalling pathway and several TFs, notably FOXL2 and RUNX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). The expression of these factors within the supporting cell precursors also act to repress the Sertoli cell differentiation program, for example high levels of WT1<sup>-KTS</sup> interfere with <italic>Sry</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), while WNT signalling interferes with <italic>Sox9</italic> upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Despite identifying many key pro-testicular and pro-ovarian factors, the gene regulatory networks they govern and the genomic elements they utilize to coordinate gene expression during sex determination remain poorly understood. <italic>Cis</italic>-regulatory elements are defined as regions of non-coding of DNA (usually 500–1,500 bp) that have the capacity to control gene expression. Such elements are highly enriched in transcription factor binding sites and can be located upstream or downstream and at varying distances of the transcriptional start site(s) of the genes they regulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). <italic>Cis</italic>-regulatory elements are usually classified as promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators. Within the field of sex determination, few <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions have been characterized in detail to date. We have previously identified Enh13, a distal enhancer of the <italic>Sox9</italic> gene, as a critical enhancer for male sex determination. We and others have shown that deletions, duplications and even micro-deletions in two transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) of this enhancer can significantly alter <italic>Sox</italic>9 expression levels, leading to complete sex reversal in both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Thus, we believe Enh13 is one of many regulatory elements in which variant DNA sequences may underlie numerous unexplained cases of Differences of Sex Development (DSDs). This data will also offer insights into the complex gene regulatory networks driving sex determination and gonadal differentiation.</p><p id="P8">Pioneer attempts to characterize the gene regulatory landscape of purified Sertoli and pre-granulosa cells have used DNaseI-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) and ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) on TESCO-CFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) and TESMS-CFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) transgenic lines carrying fluorescent reporter constructs controlled by the native and a mutated version of the TESCO enhancer of <italic>Sox9</italic>, respectively. While these approaches identified key elements like Enh13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), they provided limited temporal resolution. Indeed, DNaseI-seq was restricted to Sertoli cells at E13.5 and E15.5, and ATAC-seq examined supporting cell precursors at E10.5 and Sertoli and pre-granulosa cells at E13.5. However, single-cell transcriptomics analyses indicate that critical gonadal gene expression changes occur between E11.5–E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), likely accompanied by dynamic patterns of chromatin accessibility. The lack of such data between E10.5 and E13.5 may obscure transient regulatory elements active during this critical window. Thus, a detailed timeline of chromatin accessibility, supported by high-quality, cell type-specific, and time-resolved bulk RNA datasets, is essential to fully capture and begin to understand the complexity of <italic>cis</italic>-regulation during sex determination.</p><p id="P9">Here, we generated a novel reporter mouse strain, <italic>Enh8-mCherry,</italic> which allowed us to efficiently purify pre-granulosa cells. Using both the <italic>Enh8</italic>-mCherry and <italic>Sox9<sup>IRES-GFP</sup></italic> mouse strains, we purified pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells at four developmental time points in which sex determination occurs and performed bulk RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. This data constitutes the first bulk RNA-seq data of these critical cell types and provides a wealth of information of their dynamic transcriptomic profiles. The chromatin accessibility data enables the identification of numerous putative regulatory elements that may function during sex determination, among which many exhibit sex- and stage-specific patterns. We employed computational approaches to provide linkage correlation between accessible regions and gene expression profiles allowing us to identify putative enhancers and silencers of key sex determination genes. This was validated <italic>in vivo</italic> by performing Promoter Capture Hi-C (PCHi-C) on purified Sertoli and pre-granulosa cells at E13.5. We find enrichment of our ATAC-seq candidate regulatory elements within the PCHi-C data, suggesting that many of the elements we identified are physically bound to the promoters of the neighbouring genes that they regulate within these cells. Furthermore, we performed transcription factor motif and footprinting analyses on the open chromatin regions in each sex, allowing us to identify the regulators that are bound to them and therefore likely to control the process of sex determination. In Sertoli cells, we see enriched binding of SOX/SRY/DMRT1/GATA/WT1 and NR5A1 TFs, all of which are known to be critical for testis development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Strikingly, in pre-granulosa cells we see all of the known pro-female factors as WT1/FOXL2/RUNX1/TCF and GATA, but the most enriched motif is one bound by EMX2 and LXH9, suggesting that these factors may play an additional, yet unidentified role during ovary differentiation and not only during early gonad development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Altogether, this study constitutes an extensive analysis of the gene regulatory networks that operate during mouse sex determination, and it is highly likely that variants within the human homologues of these regulatory elements are responsible for many of the undiagnosed cases of DSD.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Generation and use of transgenic mouse lines that allow efficient purification of pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells</title><p id="P10">To explore the gene regulatory network and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements controlling gonadal sex determination, we first needed to purify gonadal supporting cells from both sexes. Therefore, we needed transgenic mouse lines that allow for the efficient purification of pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells at key developmental stages. Existing pre-granulosa cell reporters, such as TESMS-CFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) or Sry-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>) present limitations in term of percentage of positive cells and sorting efficiency due to low fluorescent signals. To overcome these limitations, we generated a novel transgenic mouse line in which the <italic>Sox9</italic> enhancer 8 (referred to as Enh8) was cloned upstream of the <italic>hsp68</italic> minimal promoter and the <italic>mCherry</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, termed <italic>Tg(Enh8-mCherry),</italic> or in short <italic>Enh8-mCherry</italic>). Enh8 is a 672 bp-long enhancer, located 838 kb upstream to the <italic>Sox9</italic> transcription start site (TSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). This enhancer has been shown to be active and capable of driving LacZ reporter expression in the mouse embryonic ovary. Indeed, although <italic>Sox9</italic> is highly expressed in Sertoli cells and faintly in pre-granulosa cells, several studies performing ChIP-seq in both embryonic and adult ovaries have found binding of FOXL2 and RUNX1, two transcription factors involved in the maintenance of pre-granulosa cell identity, to <italic>Sox9</italic> Enh8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). The binding of these factors explains why this enhancer is active in pre-granulosa cells. To characterize the expression profile of the <italic>Enh8-mCherry</italic> mouse line, we dissected XX and XY embryonic gonads at E11.5, 12.5, 13.5 and 15.5. As expected, mCherry expression was evident in ovaries from E11.5 onward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Surprisingly, and conversely to what we observed with the LacZ reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), mCherry expression was also evident in E11.5-E15.5 testes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To explore whether the mCherry-positive cells are indeed pre-granulosa cells, we performed co-immunostaining with antibodies against mCherry, FOXL2 (pre-granulosa cells) and TRA98 (germ cells) in sections of ovaries. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>, the cytoplasmic mCherry staining overlaps well with nuclear FOXL2 staining suggesting that the mCherry labels pre-granulosa cells. No overlap is seen with the TRA98-positive germ cells or COUP-TFII (NR2F2)-positive stromal cells. To further confirm that the XX mCherry-positive cells are pre-granulosa cells, we performed bulk RNA-seq on E11.5, E12.5 and E13.5 mCherry-positive sorted cells. We compared the expression of different cell-type-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) in our RNA-seq data to that of embryonic whole gonad RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, expression profiles of the mCherry-positive cells resemble those of pre-granulosa cells with enriched expression of markers of the pre-supporting cells, but also many markers known to be expressed in pre-granulosa cells. No expression or negative enrichment was found with markers of both germ cells and stromal cells, indicating the absence of these cells in the mCherry-positive cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). All of the above strongly suggest that this new <italic>Enh8-mCherry</italic> reporter mouse line is an efficient genetic tool to allow the sorting of pure populations of pre-granulosa cells from embryonic XX gonads.</p><p id="P12">To analyse which cells are mCherry-positive in embryonic testes, we performed immunostaining with antibodies against mCherry, SOX9 (Sertoli cells) and TRA98 (germ cells) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). While mCherry overlapped with SOX9, suggesting it is labelling Sertoli cells, there was also expression outside the tubules, within the interstitium. Co-staining with mCherry and 3βHSD indicated that the reporter is also labelling fetal Leydig cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). Hence, this mouse line cannot be used to purify Sertoli cells from embryonic gonads. Instead, we used the well-established <italic>Sox9<sup>IRES-GFP</sup></italic> reporter strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>) where GFP labels <italic>Sox9</italic>-expressing Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We and others have previously used the TESCO-CFP and TESMS-CFP reporter mouse lines to purify embryonic Sertoli and pre-granulosa cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). While these lines allow the purification of Sertoli and pre-granulosa cells, the percentage of CFP-positive cells out of the entire embryonic gonad was significantly lower than we find with the <italic>Enh8-mCherry</italic> or <italic>Sox9<sup>IRES-GFP</sup></italic> lines (~33-40% mCherry-positive cells in <italic>Enh8-mCherry</italic> ovaries, ~14% of GFP-positive cells in <italic>Sox9<sup>IRES-GFP</sup></italic> testes, ~5-7% CFP positive cells with the TESCO-CFP/TESMS-CFP reporters) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). ScRNA-seq studies show that the actual proportion of supporting cells in the embryonic gonads is similar to those obtained after sorting with the <italic>Enh8-mCherry</italic> or the <italic>Sox9<sup>IRES-GFP</sup></italic> lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D</xref>), suggesting that these allow more representative capture of Sertoli and pre-granulosa cell populations at these stages.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Exploring the transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility of purified pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells from embryonic gonads</title><p id="P14">To investigate the establishment of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element landscape that drives pre-supporting cell differentiation into pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells, we performed paired time-series transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility assays (ATAC-seq) at four time points (E11.5, E12.5, E13.5 and E15.5) covering cell fate commitment and differentiation in both sexes using <italic>Enh8-mCherry</italic> for XX and <italic>Sox9<sup>IRES-GFP</sup></italic> for XY gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">methods</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The bulk transcriptomes on sorted Sertoli and pre-granulosa cells provided the expression level of 12,058 protein-coding genes, and the ATAC-seq detected a total of 87,988 high confidence and non-overlapping open chromatin regions (stages and sexes combined), which represent 2.8% of the mouse genome. Principal component analysis (PCA) reveals that transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility changes along supporting cell differentiation are following fairly similar trajectories and are associated first with the sex (PC1), and second with the embryonic stages (PC2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F and G</xref>). This illustrates that the rearrangement of the chromatin accessibility occurs in concert with the establishment of sex-specific gene expression programs during gonadal supporting cell differentiation.</p><p id="P16">Next, we wanted to compare our bulk RNA-seq on purified pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells (E11.5-E15.5) to a bulk RNA-seq dataset that was obtained with whole embryonic gonads (E11.5-E13.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). It is evident that the expression levels of pre-granulosa cell markers (<italic>e.g</italic>. <italic>Runx1</italic> and <italic>Fst)</italic> and Sertoli cell markers (<italic>e.g</italic>. <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Amh)</italic> differ significantly between the two datasets, showing higher expression in our data (solid lines) compared to the whole gonad data (dashed lines <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1H</xref>) without any enrichment in other cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). This is likely due to dilution of supporting cell gene expression when many other cell types are present in the whole gonad. Hence, our data constitute an important resource and the first time-series bulk transcriptomic data of the supporting cell population during the developmental window of sex determination. To facilitate further research, we offer a web application as a community tool to permit the expression level of any gene to be plotted overtime (Link).</p><p id="P17">These paired time-series RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data allow the in-depth characterization of the relationship between gene expression temporal dynamics and chromatin accessibility in regard to the differentiation of the pre-supporting cells into pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The sexual dimorphism of pre-granulosa and Sertoli cell transcriptomes increases with time</title><p id="P18">We undertook to characterize the transcriptomes of the differentiating supporting cells in both sexes to discern the genes that are expressed in a sex- and time-specific manner with a focus on transcription factors (TFs) as they directly contribute to gene regulatory networks.</p><p id="P19">We first conducted differential expression analysis to identify the genes exhibiting sexual dimorphism at each embryonic stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5, data file S1</xref>). Supporting cells progressively acquire a growing number of genes expressed in a sex-biased manner as they differentiate, from 1,776 and 1,424 at E11.5, to 3,713 and 3,649 at E15.5 pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The enriched GO (Gene Ontology) terms associated with sexually dimorphic genes at each embryonic stage align with our knowledge of supporting cell differentiation processes. Genes expressed at higher levels in pre-granulosa cells from E11.5 onward are involved in epithelial morphogenesis (<italic>Tbx2, Bmp2, Bmp4</italic> or <italic>Shh</italic>, to cite a few), cell differentiation and WNT signalling pathways (<italic>Wnt2, Wnt11, Axin2</italic> and <italic>Snai2</italic>, among others) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), while those with higher expression in Sertoli cells from E11.5 are predominantly linked to mitotic cell cycle (<italic>e.g. Cdk1, Cdc20, Cdc6, Birc5</italic>) and epithelial morphogenesis (<italic>e.g. Epha2, Sox8, Sox9, Map7</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5, data file S1</xref>). The number of TFs exhibiting sex-biased expression also increases progressively as cells differentiate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">data file S1</xref>).

These genes were subsequently classified based on their expression profiles (groups <italic>a</italic> to <italic>h</italic> in pre-granulosa cells, and <italic>a</italic> to <italic>g</italic> in Sertoli cells) and GO term enrichment analysis was performed on each of the gene profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">data file S3</xref>). Among these dynamically expressed genes, we identified 574 TFs in pre-granulosa cells, with 89 of them reported causing a gonadal phenotype when mutated.

Like the transcriptomes, the open chromatin landscape exhibits increasing sexual dimorphism as cells differentiate, from 4,206 to 16,619 regions more accessible in pre-granulosa cells and 12,679 to 24,703 regions more accessible in Sertoli cells between E11.5 and E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">data file S4</xref>). A major proportion of the pre-granulosa-biased accessible regions (7,476) appears from E12.5 onward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), while 9,039 Sertoli-biased regions are already established from E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>), suggesting the sex-specific accessible chromatin landscape mediating pre-granulosa cell differentiation is delayed compared to Sertoli cells, as suggested by previous transcriptomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).

We focused our analysis on TFs that were found expressed in the supporting cells based on our RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">data file S5</xref>). Both pre-granulosa and Sertoli-biased open chromatin regions are enriched for the motifs recognized by the non-sex-specific gonadal factors NR5A1, GATAs and WT1. Among the pre-granulosa biased open chromatin enriched motifs, we also find binding sites for known ovarian factors such as FOXL2, RUNX1, TCFs and HES1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>). Similarly, we find enrichment of sites for the testis-specific factors DMRTs and SOX-SRY in the Sertoli-biased open chromatin regions. We notice, however, that the sites for GATA factors are much more enriched in pre-granulosa biased regions compared to Sertoli, and that the motif recognized by homeobox proteins, EMX2 and LHX9 which are critical factors for genital ridge development, are among the topmost enriched motifs in pre-granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Taken together, the results demonstrate that supporting cells undergo major sex-specific chromatin rearrangements during their differentiation.

We found 8,298 regions that change in accessibility in pre-granulosa cells and 20,607 in Sertoli cells along their differentiation, demonstrating that Sertoli cells operate a massive rearrangement of their chromatin landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">data file S6</xref>). Among them, only 2,266 are found in common in both sexes, suggesting that the change in accessibility is mostly driven by sex-specific regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). We classified the chromatin regions according to the dynamics of their accessibility (groups <italic>a</italic> to <italic>d</italic> for both sexes). The chromatin accessibility events in pre-granulosa cells can be divided into two main modules. The first consists of chromatin regions that decrease in accessibility from either E12.5 (group <italic>a</italic>) or from E13.5 (group <italic>b</italic>) as cells differentiate. The second module represents chromatin regions that increase in accessibility, from E13.5 (group <italic>c</italic>) and from E15.5 (group <italic>d</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). This suggests that the pre-granulosa chromatin landscape is transitioning from committed to differentiated cells between E12.5 and E13.5. Sertoli cells present more gradual chromatin accessibility changes, with regions from groups <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> that decrease in accessibility, and groups <italic>c</italic> and <italic>d</italic> that become more accessible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, unlike pre-granulosa cells, the increase in accessibility is initiating from E12.5 onward, supporting the idea that the Sertoli specific chromatin landscape is established earlier than that of pre-granulosa cells, similar to the transcriptomic profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p><p id="P29">These genomic regions are mainly located in intronic and intergenic regions as observed with the sexually dimorphic accessible regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E-F</xref> presents several interesting examples of changes in chromatin accessibility over time. For example, we observe that the <italic>Wnt4</italic> gene, which is expressed in pre-granulosa cells, presents an open chromatin region in its first intron that increases in accessibility as cells differentiate (highlighted in yellow), while the promoter of the <italic>Wnt4</italic> gene remains stably accessible over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). Similarly, we identified two intronic open chromatin regions on the <italic>Fshr</italic> male specific gene that increase in accessibility as cells differentiate and are likely to be putative enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Among the dynamically accessible regions present around gonadal critical gonadal genes, we could observe more complex patterns. <italic>Dmrt1</italic>, which is expressed in both pre-granulosa and Sertoli at E11.5 and become exclusively expressed in Sertoli cells from E12.5 onward, presents one open chromatin region upstream of the promoter that gradually becomes more accessible specifically in Sertoli cells (highlighted in light blue), while another region in the second intron shows a decrease in accessibility in pre-granulosa cells while remain stably accessible in Sertoli cells (highlighted in yellow) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). Altogether this suggests a complicated gene regulatory network both temporally and also between sexes.</p><p id="P30">The changes in the open chromatin landscape also reflect a change of accessibility of specific binding motifs from TFs expressed in pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells (TPM&gt;10). Differential TF-binding motif enrichment analysis showed that pre-granulosa cell regions that are more accessible at early stages (groups <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>) are enriched for motifs recognized by NR2F2 and NR5A1, but also by DMRT1. This concords with the fact that supporting cells are derived from <italic>Nr2f2</italic> and <italic>Nr5a1</italic> expressing progenitor cells, while the expression of both of these genes decreases as cells differentiate into pre-granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), and the fact that <italic>Dmrt1</italic> is expressed in E11.5 pre-granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>).

One of the most commonly used proxies to achieve this is to look for the correlation between gene expression and accessibility of the open chromatin regions in the +/-500 kb region from their TSS. A positive correlation, or link, corresponds to a chromatin region accessibility that mirrors the nearby gene expression and therefore suggests a putative enhancer function. Conversely, a negative correlation means that the chromatin accessibility is the opposite of the nearby gene expression suggesting it may function as a silencer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Using this method, we could identify 44,116 putative regulatory regions (50.1% of all the open chromatin regions) whose accessibility correlates positively or negatively with 10,685 genes, which represents 88.6% of all the expressed protein coding genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">data file S8</xref>).

This represents physical binding of protein onto the open chromatin DNA in a way that confers small blockage to Tn5 digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>). We measured the difference of occupancy of the motifs of the expressed TFs between pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells in the sex-biased open chromatin regions and confirmed that most of the sexually dimorphic enriched motifs are also differentially occupied by a transcription factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>, data file S10). Surprisingly, although the RFX1/5 and ZBTB14 motifs are among the top three enriched transcription factor motifs of pre-granulosa cell-biased open chromatin regions compared to Sertoli cells, they are not the most differentially bound motifs. The motif recognized by EMX2, LHX9 and MSX1, among others, is the most differentially bound compared to Sertoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A and B</xref>), and its score increases with time, suggesting that these factors are potentially the most important for the establishment of the pre-granulosa specific gene regulatory network.

These observations suggest that EMX2 and LHX9 could play a crucial role in the pre-granulosa cell commitment.</p><p id="P40">Finally, we looked at TF footprints at a locus resolution around known enhancers like Enh8 and Enh13 of the <italic>Sox9</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D and E</xref>), but also within candidate enhancers of sex determination genes to identify potential gonadal factor binding sites (highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D to J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">data file S10</xref>).

We can identify footprints of WT1 on open chromatin region in <italic>Rspo1</italic> promoter and first intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6F</xref>) that overlap with WT1 ChIP-seq data performed on embryonic kidneys. This may suggest that shared regulatory elements are exploit in the kidney and gonads and that <italic>Rspo1</italic> is a direct target of WT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>).

Thus, these regions constitute putative genomic targets of the sex-determining factors. Furthermore, it is possible that factors with known function at early gonad development such as EMX2 and LHX9 also play a critical role at later stages during pre-granulosa cell development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P42">Decades of research on mouse sex determination and human DSD individuals have unravelled many of the TFs and signalling pathways involved in the process. Yet, it is striking that ~70% of the 46,XX DSD and ~50% of 46,XY DSD patients fail to receive genetic diagnosis following whole exome sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>). This suggests that variants in the 98% of the non-coding genome are highly likely to explain many of the unresolved DSD cases. This emphasises the need to identify the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that control the antagonistic gene networks at play during mammalian sex determination.</p><p id="P43">In this study, our aim was to decipher the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that participate in the process of gonadal supporting cell differentiation, the genes they regulate, and the transcriptomic outcome. To achieve this, we purified fetal pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells using the newly generated Enh8-mCherry and the established <italic>Sox9<sup>IRES-GFP</sup></italic> mouse lines at four embryonic stages covering the process of sex determination and subsequent supporting cell differentiation. One limitation of the use of <italic>Sox9<sup>IRES-GFP</sup></italic> to purify Sertoli cells is that we preferentially enriched our multiomics data with already committed Sertoli cells at E11.5, as shown by the low expression of <italic>Sry</italic> in our dataset compared to whole gonads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4C</xref>). However, the use Enh8-mCherry and the <italic>Sox9<sup>IRES-GFP</sup></italic> mouse lines allowed us to increase our cell sorting yield by five-fold compared to the previously used <italic>TESCO</italic>-CFP and <italic>TESMS</italic>-CFP transgenic mouse lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2D</xref>). Moreover, the proportion of cells we obtained using these two mouse lines is close to what was observed in the whole gonads, according to scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). This suggests that our study is based on representative fetal gonad supporting cell populations.</p><p id="P44">In recent years, several studies have generated time-course transcriptomic profiles of mouse gonadal development using both whole gonad bulk RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>) and scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). While these studies have been transformative to the field and enabled the identification of novel and rare cell populations, they also hold some limitations. Bulk RNA-seq of whole gonads lacks the resolution needed to characterize gene expression within specific gonadal cells, a challenge that can be overcome by scRNA-seq technologies. However, scRNA-seq techniques are limited in sensitivity, making it difficult to detect low-abundant transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>). Our bulk RNA-seq data represent the first transcriptomic analysis of purified Sertoli and pre-granulosa cells during early gonad development. Although averaging cells in which differentiation is asynchronous, the sensitivity of bulk RNA-seq makes this method as a good complement to scRNA-seq data for lowly expressed genes.</p><p id="P45">Previous ATAC-seq analysis was performed on E10.5 supporting cell precursors and E13.5 Sertoli and pre-granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) and E14.5 and later pre-granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>), leaving a big gap of the most critical stages in which gonadal sex is being established. Here, we performed RNA-seq, as well as ATAC-seq on four critical developmental stages covering the entire window of sex determination. Overall, we found that 2.8% of the 98% non-coding DNA are accessible during male and female supporting cell differentiation. Our analysis indicates that while many <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements exhibit sexual dimorphism in accessibility staring at E11.5 in Sertoli cells, most pre-granulosa-biased open chromatin regions are established from E12.5, reinforcing the idea that pre-granulosa cell commitment is delayed compared to that of Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>).</p><p id="P46">TF-binding motif enrichment analysis and footprinting indicate that most of the Sertoli-cell biased regions are bound by DMRT and SOX factors. SOX9 has been described as being a pioneer TF that is able to bind closed chromatin, inducing <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element opening that leads to cell reprogramming in embryonic epidermal stem cells and umbilical vein endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>). All these data confirm the importance of SOX9 as the master regulator for the onset of Sertoli cell fate decision by establishing the chromatin landscape necessary for the activation of the male-specific gene program. It was also shown that ectopic DMRT1 in the ovary acts as a pioneer factor to induce <italic>Sox9</italic> expression but also repress <italic>Foxl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>). Interestingly, depletion of <italic>Dmrt1</italic> in males does not affect testicular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>), which argues in favour of a role in the maintenance of Sertoli cell identity rather than a determining gene. However, its expression in E11.5 pre-granulosa cells and the enrichment of its binding motif in early pre-granulosa cells (when <italic>Foxl2</italic> is not yet expressed), can fit with its role to negatively regulate <italic>Foxl2,</italic> and, more globally, female-specific gene expression. This data may also potentially explain the delay in pre-granulosa cell differentiation compared to Sertoli cells.</p><p id="P47">Regarding pre-granulosa cells, we observed that RUNX1 and FOX motifs were not the most enriched in the pre-granulosa-biased open chromatin regions at the onset of their differentiation. This is consistent with the fact that deletion of these TFs in fetal gonads leads to a delayed female-to-male sex reversal, either in postnatal ovaries when only <italic>Foxl2</italic> is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), or in late fetal stages, around E15.5, when both factors are deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). As such, FOXL2 and RUNX1 are required for granulosa cell fate maintenance rather than being ovary determining factors. However, our study sheds light on two factors that may act on pre-granulosa cell commitment: EMX2 and LHX9. While they have been shown to be crucial for bipotential gonad formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>), their role at later stages has never been characterized. The identification of the <italic>Wt1<sup>-KTS</sup></italic> isoform as the female determining factor is a clear illustration that early factors can also have critical roles at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). <italic>Emx2</italic> and <italic>Lhx9</italic> expression become restricted to the pre-granulosa cells soon after the supporting cell commitment, from E11.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>). Concomitantly, the pre-granulosa cell accessible genome presents increasing enrichment and binding footprints of the motifs recognized by these two factors. Although our analysis cannot decipher whether one or both are actually binding on the pre-granulosa putative <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, EMX2 and LHX9 represent the most promising candidate TFs that could regulate the pre-granulosa cell differentiation genetic program. Moreover, EMX2 has been shown to play an important role in mouse neuroblast proliferation, migration and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>), while LHX9 has not been identified in cell fate decision role in other systems.</p><p id="P48">Integration of both RNA and ATAC-seq data allowed for the linking of putative <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements to their target genes, allowing the identification of thousands of pre-granulosa-and Sertoli-specific putative <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. Yet, it is likely that this is an understatement of the real state, as we limited the linkage analysis to +/- 500 kb, and critical enhancers like Enh13 (<italic>Sox9</italic>) and ZRS (<italic>Shh</italic>) are often located over 500 kb away from their target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>). Similar findings in other systems suggest a complex regulatory network of enhancers and silencers, many acting redundantly to control gene expression. While redundancy is common, single enhancers like Enh13 and ZRS can fully regulate target genes at specific stages, with deletions causing dramatic phenotypes.</p><p id="P49">Our PCHi-C analysis corroborated some of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element-gene association predicted by the linkage analysis. Yet, while able to detect specific enhancer-promoter interactions, we could not detect the interaction of Enh13 to the <italic>Sox9</italic> promoter in Sertoli cells. This suggests that the PCHi-C, while revealing interesting interactions, is not comprehensive enough and needs to be further refined. Indeed, PCHi-C is normally being performed using millions of cells, and here it was done using 100K sorted gonadal cells. It is possible that using a larger number of cells could improve the resolution.</p><p id="P50">Altogether, this study serves to unravel the gene regulatory networks that are at play during mammalian sex determination. It uncovers the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that function during sex determination, along with the binding motifs enriched and occupied in them, the physical binding of regulatory elements and target genes, and how all this eventually translates into unique gene expression profiles. To complete our understanding of the gene regulatory networks, it will be important to have additional layers of information such as histone post-transcriptional modifications as well as binding of TFs and histone modifiers.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Mice and ethics</title><p id="P51">All animals were maintained with appropriate husbandry according to Bar-Ilan University ethics protocols 11-02-2020, 57-08-19, 2305-111-1 and 2306-117-1.

Briefly, for each protein-coding gene, we selected the open chromatin regions within 500□kb upstream and downstream of the canonical TSS of the gene as potential regulatory regions. Then we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients between the gene expression and the chromatin accessibility of each region (all stages and sexes together). To control for false positives, we selected 10,000 random open chromatin regions and calculated the correlation coefficients between the regions and expression. We then tested the significance of each region-to-gene correlation using the <italic>Z</italic>-test method and obtained a <italic>p</italic>-value that is corrected for false discovery rate (FDR). Finally, we considered a significant region-to-gene link with a Pearson correlation coefficient □&gt;0.7 (positive link) and &lt;0.7 (negative link) and a FDR□&lt;0.01. We excluded open chromatin regions overlapping TSS of alternative transcripts from our analysis to avoid links between genes and their alternative promoters.

Following lysis, the nuclei were permeabilized and digested with DpnII (NEB) overnight. The restriction overhangs were filled in using a biotinylated dATP (Jena Bioscience) and ligation was performed for 4 hours at 16°C (T4 DNA ligase; Life Technologies). The crosslinks were reversed using proteinase K and overnight incubation at 65°C, followed by purification with SPRI beads (AMPure XP; Beckman Coulter). Short fragments up to 1000 bp were produced via tagmentation and the biotinylated restriction junctions were then pulled down using MyOne C1 streptavidin beads (Life Technologies). PCR amplification (5 cycles) was performed on the libraries directly bound to the C-1 beads and the libraries were purified using SPRI beads as before. Promoter Capture was performed using the mouse custom-designed Agilent SureSelect system, following the manufacturer’s protocol, followed by 7 PCR cycles.

To generate the consensus interaction calling per cell type (Granulosa and Sertoli cells), CHiCAGO input (.chinput) files were generated per biological replicate, using bam2chicago.sh from chicagoTools v1.13 and then CHiCAGO pipeline was run at 5 kb bins resolution taking the variation across replicates into account. The pipeline was run in two complementary modes. One where we only considered chromosomal interactions with the original baited fragment (termed "original bait") and another where the baited fragment was expanded to a 5 kb bin resolution (termed "5 kb extended bait"), as we have previously described. We performed tests for epigenetic marker enrichment at promoter interacting regions in both modes, using the peakEnrichment4Features function in CHiCAGO. For the enrichment analysis ChIP-seq data for H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3H27me3 from E13.5 pre-granulosa and Sertoli cells was obtained from GSE118755 and GSE130749 and reanalysed using the nf-core/chipseq v2.0.0 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>TFBS motif analysis</title><p id="P83">Differential transcription factor motif enrichment analysis was performed with monaLisa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R110">110</xref>) using vertebrate TFBS matrices of transcription factors from JAPSAR2024 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R111">111</xref>) extracted using TFBSTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R112">112</xref>).</p><p id="P84">TFBS motifs differentially enriched in the sexually dimorphic accessible regions were analysed by merging the sexually dimorphic regions from all stages and by binning them by sex-specific accessibility.
