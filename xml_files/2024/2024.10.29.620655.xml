quiescent cells downregulate amino acid (AA) transport remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that cells entering quiescence select plasma membrane-resident AA transporters for endocytosis and lysosomal degradation, to match AA uptake with reduced translation. We identify the α-arrestin TXNIP as a key regulator of AA uptake during quiescence, since it mediates the endocytosis of the SLC7A5-SLC3A2 (LAT1-4F2hc) transporter complex in response to reduced AKT signaling. Mechanistically, TXNIP interacts with HECT-type ubiquitin ligases to facilitate transporter ubiquitination. Loss of TXNIP disrupts this regulation, resulting in dysregulated AA uptake, sustained mTORC1 signaling, and accelerated quiescence exit. A novel TXNIP loss-of-function mutation in a patient with severe metabolic disease further supports its role in nutrient homeostasis and human health. These findings highlight TXNIP’s role in controlling SLC7A5-SLC3A2 mediated AA acquisition with implications for quiescence biology and disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">How cells maintain a homeostatic pool of 20 proteinogenic amino acids (AA) is a fundamental question in biology. For the uptake and the release of AA across the plasma membrane (PM) and across organelle membranes, the human genome encodes at least 66 AA transporters, which belong to 11 individual solute carrier (SLC) families <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The importance of controlling AA transport is exemplified by monogenic diseases and human pathologies caused by the deficiency or dysregulation of individual AA transporters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Cellular AA import is coordinated with cell proliferation. Proliferating cells, in particular cancer cells, increase the abundance of AA transporters at the cell surface and thereby promote nutrient uptake for protein synthesis during cell growth prior to cell division <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Transcriptional mechanisms are responsible for the upregulation of AA transporter expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Conversely, entry into quiescence, the reversible exit from the cell cycle, is accompanied by a reduction in cell size, lower rates of transcription, and reduced protein synthesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, quiescent cells must somehow re-calibrate AA uptake to align it with lower translation and metabolic homeostasis for cell survival, rather than for growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. How quiescent cells match AA flux across the PM to reduced cell size and to lower translation rates is unclear. This presents a knowledge gap in understanding cellular nutrient acquisition.</p><p id="P5">In budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, we previously demonstrated that entry into quiescence induces the ubiquitin dependent endocytosis of AA transporters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The selective ubiquitination of AA transporters requires proteins of the α-arrestin family <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Activated α-arrestins function as adaptor proteins that recruit the homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus (HECT) type ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 to different AA transporters for ubiquitination, endocytosis and lysosomal degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">The human genome encodes six a-arrestin family members or ARRDCs (arrestin-domain-containing proteins). With the exception of ARRDC5, a-arrestins contain one or more PPxY motifs in their C-terminal regions and are able to interact with several HECT-type ubiquitin ligases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. The best characterized a-arrestin is thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP). TXNIP was first described as a negative regulator of thioredoxin (TRX) through the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond that requires two critical cysteine residues of TXNIP (cysteine 32 and cysteine 247) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">TXNIP also regulates glucose uptake by mediating the selective endocytosis of SLC2A1 (GLUT1) and SLC2A4 (GLUT4), two major glucose transporters. TXNIP binds to these glucose transporters at the PM and interacts with a di-leucine motif in its C-terminal tail with components of the endocytic machinery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. The TXNIP dependent regulation of SLC2A1 and SLC2A4 is tightly coupled to intracellular glucose homeostasis, ATP availability and growth factor signaling. AMPK activation in response to low ATP levels or AKT activation in response to insulin signal results in the phosphorylation of TXNIP at serine 308, thereby inactivating it <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. This inactivation of TXNIP ensures SLC2A1 and SLC2A4 accumulation at the PM to increase glucose uptake <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. TXNIP inactivation can involve ubiquitination by the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase ITCH, leading to its proteasomal degradation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. These processes appear to be largely independent of TRX binding. Consistent with the function in regulating glucose uptake, biallelic loss-of-function mutations in TXNIP in humans lead to lactic acidosis in three siblings. Interesting, these patients also showed lower serum methionine levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Here, we show that in human cells entering quiescence, several AA transporters are selectively removed from the PM by endocytosis, including the heterodimeric AA transporter (HAT) SLC7A5-SLC3A2 (LAT1-4F2hc). The endocytic degradation of SLC7A5-SLC3A2 during entry into quiescence requires TXNIP. TXNIP uses its PPxY motifs to engage HECT-type ubiquitin ligases for SLC7A5-SLC3A2 endocytosis and subsequent lysosomal degradation. The TXNIP mediated endocytic degradation of SLC7A5-SLC3A2 reduces AA uptake, lowers free intracellular AA levels, and thereby helps to dampen mTORC1 signaling and translation. In growing cells, AKT phosphorylation of TXNIP restricts SLC7A5-SLC3A2 endocytosis. In addition, we identified a novel biallelic loss-of-function TXNIP variant in a boy with a severe inborn metabolic disease. The analysis of fibroblasts from this patient revealed that SLC7A5-SLC3A2 endocytosis was also blocked. This further supports the central role of TXNIP in adjusting cellular AA uptake, with important implications for human health.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Selective endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of AA transporters in cells entering quiescence</title><p id="P9">To study the regulation of nutrient uptake during the transition from proliferation to quiescence, we used hTERT RPE1 cells (non-cancerous human telomerase-immortalized retinal pigmented epithelial, hereafter RPE1) as a model cell line <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. First, we established and evaluated conditions for entry into quiescence.</p><p id="P10">The DNA content of cells growing with serum was analyzed by propidium iodide (PI) staining and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). 46% (± 2%) of these cells were in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, 30% (± 6%) were in S phase and 24% (± 4%) in the G2/M phase. 24 h after serum starvation (but in the presence of AA and glucose), the number of cells in G0/G1 increased to 67% (± 10%), while the number of cells in S-phase and G2/M phase decreased to 15% (± 6%) and 19% (± 7%), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Cell viability was not affected by serum starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>). Serum starved cells also decreased their volume by 20% from 2907 fl to 2332 fl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Consistent with an entry into quiescence in response to serum starvation, SDS-PAGE and Western Blot (WB) analysis of total cell lysates showed that the protein levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27<sup>Kip1</sup> increased, while the phosphorylation dependent activation of mitogen activated kinases ERK1/2, and mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of AKT on serine 473 decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, lane 2).</p><p id="P11">Of note, in cells entering quiescence, the protein levels of the heterodimeric AA transporters (HAT) SLC7A5-SLC3A2 (LAT1-4F2hc) and SLC7A11-SLC3A2 (xCT-4F2hc) decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, lane 1 and 2). Also, a decrease in the protein levels of SLC1A5 (ASCT2) was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, lane 1 and 2). The protein levels of the neutral AA transporter SLC38A2 (SNAT2), the glucose transporter SLC2A1 (GLUT1), the transferrin receptor TfR and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) remained relatively unchanged over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, lane 1 - 3). The downregulation of SLC7A5 and SLC1A5 was observed in other non-cancerous cell lines, such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>) and primary human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1c, d</xref>), when subjected to serum starvation. However, this downregulation was not observed in a panel of seven different lung cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To understand how SLC7A5-SLC3A2 and SLC1A5 were downregulated in cells entering quiescence, we examined the localization of these transporters using indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and confocal microscopy. In growing cells, endogenous SLC3A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>) and SLC1A5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1f</xref>) were mainly detected at the PM and partially co-localized with LAMP1 positive lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1f</xref>). In serum starved cells, signals for SLC3A2 were barely detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>), which was in line with the downregulation of SLC7A5-SLC3A2 in quiescent cells. Also, cell surface FACS analysis measured a marked decrease of PM resident SLC3A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). Treatment of cells with chloroquine (CQ), which impairs lysosomal catabolic function, resulted in the accumulation of SLC3A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>) and SLC1A5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1f</xref>) inside LAMP1 positive lysosomes and efficiently prevented the lysosomal degradation of these AA transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). Inhibition of the GTPase dynamin with dynasore (dyna), which blocks the scissions of clathrin coated vesicles from the PM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, impaired the endocytosis of SLC3A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1g</xref>) and SLC1A5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1g</xref>) and in consequence prevented their lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In line with the quiescence induced endocytic removal of SLC7A5-SLC3A2 from the PM, the uptake of its AA substrates [<sup>3</sup>H]-leucine and [<sup>14</sup>C]-isoleucine was reduced by 33% and 49%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1i</xref>).

A novel loss-of-function mutation in TXNIP, that impairs AA endocytosis, causes a rare metabolic disease.</p><p id="P48">Together with a previous report on three siblings from a single consanguineous family that were homozygous for a loss-of-function frameshift variant c.174_175delinsTT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, our data suggest TXNIP deficiency as a novel inherited metabolic disease with specific metabolic alterations, that appear associated with neonatal lactic acidosis, recurrent hypoglycaemia, and specific anomalies in AA metabolism, although full the spectrum of associated clinical manifestations remains uncertain. Similar to our patient, the three siblings presented with lactic acidosis in the neonatal period, which was treated with long-term dichloroacetic acid (DCA). Rather than directly clearing lactate from serum, DCA inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase to stimulate pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, resulting in reduced serum lactate levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Two of the three affected children had normal development during childhood; one child, which also suffered from recurrent hypoglycaemia, had neonatal muscular hypotonia and failure to thrive, and was under investigation for autism spectrum disorder, similar to our patient. Our patient additionally has an increasing frequency of epileptic seizures. The three siblings developed low plasma methionine concentrations. No other AA anomalies were specified in the previous report except for a transient general hyperaminoaciduria in one child <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. The detailed metabolic investigations in our case revealed relative normal methionine levels, but identified other specific AA alterations in line with impaired SLC7A5 endocytosis in the case of complete TXNIP loss. How these metabolic defects are linked to other clinical manifestations such as possible autism and the severe epileptic developmental disorder in our patient, remains to be investigated. We speculate that these feature could be related to role of SLC7A5 in neurons and in the blood brain barrier <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Yet, the patient phenotype appears to be variable in severity and not fully penetrant. Hence, loss of TXNIP alone is likely to be insufficient and other genetic or non-genetic factors (e.g. diet) that are not yet known, must be involved.</p><p id="P49">Several studies in mice show that TXNIP is important during the transition between fed and fasted states, which was attributed to its role in glucose and energy metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Our findings imply that at least some of the described TXNIP dependent effects on glucose homeostasis might also be linked to TXNIP dependent regulation of SLC7A5-SLC3A2 and the regulated import of LNAAs as cells enter and exit quiescence.</p><p id="P50">While it is clear how proliferating cells benefit from the upregulation of SLC7A5-SLC3A2, it is less clear how quiescent cells could profit from the downregulation of SLC7A5-SLC3A2. One rational for the selective endocytosis of this AA transporter could be that the cellular demand for essential AAs must be matched to lower rates of protein translation in quiescent cells. In line with this concept, also quiescent mammary epithelial cells reduced levels of V, L, I and Q <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Similar results were obtained in a non-malignant murine pro-B lymphocyte cell line (FL5.12), in which the abundance of SLC3A2 at the plasma membrane was regulated by the presence of growth factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. In those cells, the consumption rate of essential AAs was decreased in G0 arrest and increased upon re-entry into the cell cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Hence, the downregulation of AA transporters provide means to avoid an excess/imbalance of free intracellular AAs which facilitates the controlled decrease of mTORC1 signaling and the ensuing reduction of translation rates, possibly in conjugation with the integrated stress response. Thereby, the TXNIP mediated selective downregulation of SLC7A5-SLC3A2 and the ensuing decreased import of essential AAs, helps to promote the switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism. Moreover, the downregulation of AA transporters upon entry into quiescence might also contribute to the barrier for cellular transformation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P51">TXNIP was specifically required for the endocytosis of SLC7A5-SLC3A2, but not for the endocytosis of SLC7A11-SLC3A2. How TXNIP interacts specifically with SLC7A5-SLC3A2 remains unclear at the moment. Yet it is clear that TXNIP requires its first PPCY motif (331) to interact with several different HECT type ubiquitin ligases, and this interaction is required for the downregulation of SLC7A5. In line with our results, SLC7A5 was shown to be ubiquitinated on N-terminal lysine residues by Nedd4-2 upon protein kinase C (PKC) activation and mTORC1 inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P52">We conclude that the role of TXNIP in controlling the abundance of SLC7A5-SLC3A2 at the PM is important to match AA uptake with metabolic needs in proliferating and quiescent cells.

Briefly, glucose uptake was initiated by adding 2-NBDG (2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose) (AAT Bioquest, #36702, dissolved in DMSO) at a final concentration of 100 μM in the respective medium. To inhibit glucose uptake, cells were simultaneously treated with 1 mM phloretin (Sigma-Aldrich, #P7912, dissolved in 50% ethanol) for 45 min. After 45 min incubation at 37°C in the dark, cells were washed with ice cold PBS to stop the reaction, trypsinized and resuspended in PBS. Cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl PBS and 10% FBS. The fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry (Attune NxT Flow Cytometer, Life Technologies). For every experiment, more than 5000 cells were analyzed. Flow cytometry analysis was performed with FlowJo software 10.8.1 (BD Life Sciences). Cells were gated by forward versus side scatter (FSC-A vs. SSC-A) to identify cell population, forward scatter width versus forward scatter area (FSC-W vs FSC-A) for doublet exclusion and fluorescence intensity (BL1-A) vs cell count to reflect the uptake of 2-NBDG.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Incorporation of <sup>35</sup>S labeled L-Cysteine and L-Methionine</title><p id="P73">150000 cells were seeded and after two days, these cells were left untreated or serum starved for 24 h or serum starved and then refeed for 24 h. Prior to radiolabeling the cells, the serum starved cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 30 min in L-cysteine, L-methionine, L- glutamine free medium (Sigma-Aldrich #D0422), supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco #25030-024) and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin/streptomycin. The proliferating cells were incubated for 30 min in L-cysteine, L-methionine, L-glutamine free medium, supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% dialysed FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific #26400044) and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were washed with PBS, brought into suspension using 1x trypsin-EDTA solution and resuspended in the corresponding L-cysteine, L-methionine free medium. 17.6 μCi/mL [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine [<sup>35</sup>S]-cysteine (Hartmann Analytic #21635410) was added to the cell suspension for 2 min and quenched with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cell pellets were lysed for 30 min on ice, with RIPA lysis buffer, supplemented with protease inhibitors and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, (de)stained with Coomassie and dried for 1 h at 70°C. The dried gel was exposed to a phosphorimager for 48 h. Detection of a [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine [<sup>35</sup>S]-cysteine radiogram was performed using a Typhoon FLA 9500 detection system.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Mass spectrometry analysis of intracellular free AAs</title><p id="P74">The analysis of intracellular AAs by mass spectrometry was performed as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Briefly, 10<sup>6</sup> cells were seeded and serum starved for 24 h prior the extraction. Then, cells were washed three times with ice cold 1xPBS and extracted by adding 500 μl ice cold methanol (99,9% vol/vol, Fisher Chemicals) and 500 μl cold Millipore H2O, containing the internal standard (1:100), a stable isotope-labeled canonical AA mix composition (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory, #MSK-CAA-1). Cells were scraped and 500 μl ice cold chloroform (99,9% vol/vol, Sigma-Aldrich, #650498) was added to the cell extracts. Cells were agitated in a tube shaker for 20 min at 1400 rpm at 4°C, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 16100xg at 4°C. The upper, polar phase was separated, evaporated by using a SpeedVac (Savant SPD111V SpeedVac Concentrator, Thermo Scientific) and stored at -80°C. The interphase was used to determine the protein concentration. Therefore, the interphase was evaporated and the pellet was resuspended in denaturing buffer (1.6 M Urea, 100 mM AmBiCa, pH 8.2) and sonicated for 10 sec to break up protein aggregates. Protein determination was done by using Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, #23235) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For absolute quantification, AAs were analyzed by targeted LC-MS using mixed-mode chromatography (RP-AEX, reversed phase–anion exchange chromatography) and ultra-high sensitive orbitrap technology (Orbitrap Q Exactive HF-X and Orbitrap Fusion Lumos, both Thermo Scientific), operating in parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mode. Bioinformatics data processing and statistical analysis was performed using TraceFinder (Thermo Scientific) and in-house R and Python scripts.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Statistical analysis and software</title><p id="P75">Software used in this study, if not already specified, were Affinity Designer Version 1.10.5 (Serfi, RRID:SCR_016952), Image J Version 1.53t (RRID:SCR_003070), GraphPad Prism 9 Version 9.4.1 (458) (RRID:SCR_002798), Benchling (RRID:SCR_013955), FlowJo Version 10.8.1 (RRID:SCR_008520), ModFit LT (RRRID:SCR_016106), Primer3 Version 4.1.0 (RRID:SCR_003139), PrimerBank (RRID:SCR_006898), CHOPCHOP (RRID:SCR_015723), ZEISS ZEN Digital Imaging for Light Microscopy Version 3.5 (RRID:SCR_013672), and online tools TIDE (tracking of indels by Decomposition) (Brinkman et al. 2014), ICE Analysis online tool (Synthego, v2.0; Synthego, USA) and PrimerQuest™ Tool (Integrated DNA Technologies, IDT, USA)</p><p id="P76">Results were represented as mean with standard deviation (SD) analyzed by GraphPad Prism.
