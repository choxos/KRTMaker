In land plants, successful cytokinesis requires precise targeting of Golgi-derived vesicles to the future division plane by the phragmoplast, a cytoskeletal structure that undergoes continuous remodelling. Endomembrane trafficking and phragmoplast remodelling are tightly coupled, indicating the existence of active crosstalk. However, although many molecular regulators of membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal organisation are known, it remains poorly understood how these processes are co-ordinated. Here, we describe a regulatory module consisting of the membrane-associated GTPase RAB-A2a, cytoskeleton-associated Class II Kinesin-12s, and the Fused kinase orthologue TIO. We provide evidence that the interaction between these molecules at the midzone is essential for cytokinesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> through simultaneously targeting vesicles to the midzone and coupling phragmoplast remodelling to vesicle delivery.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">During cytokinesis in plant cells, both the endomembrane and cytoskeleton systems undergo substantial remodelling, which differs markedly from that found in other eukaryotic lineages. Following the dissolution of the spindle at the end of anaphase, plant cells form a phragmoplast, a cytoskeletal structure unique to land plants and some green algae. The phragmoplast is predominantly composed of microtubules which are arranged into two partially-overlapping arrays, with microtubule plus-ends directed towards the future division site at the midzone. Endomembrane vesicles from the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network/early endosome (TGN/EE) are mass-transported along phragmoplast microtubules to the midzone where they fuse to form the cell plate, an endomembrane compartment also unique to the green lineage that is filled with oligosaccharides. The phragmoplast initially forms a disk, but subsequently undergoes centrifugal expansion to form a ring. Phragmoplast expansion is achieved through microtubule depolymerisation at the phragmoplast core once the cell plate no longer requires a cytoskeletal scaffold, and simultaneous microtubule polymerisation at the phragmoplast outer edge. This remodelling drives simultaneous centrifugal expansion of the cell plate, which eventually fuses with the plasma membrane to form a new crosswall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">To ensure successful cytokinesis, the cell plate needs to expand within a 2D plane to form an organelle large enough to partition the entire cell (new cross walls are typically several hundred μm<sup>2</sup>). This process depends on the precise control of two factors: (1) spatial targeting of vesicles to the midzone via the phragmoplast, and (2) temporal coordination between membrane delivery and phragmoplast remodelling. Cytoskeleton-associated molecular machinery located at the phragmoplast and cell periphery regulate phragmoplast formation, remodelling and positioning. These include kinesins of the Kinesin-12 family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, IQ67 domain family proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, microtubule crosslinkers of the MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 65 (MAP65) family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and diverse regulators of microtubule nucleation, polymerisation and severing (summarized by Smertenko and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>). Microtubule depolymerisation at the phragmoplast core is regulated by at least three signalling pathways involving Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), and Aurora Kinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The widely-conserved signalling kinase TWO-IN-ONE (TIO) has also been linked to initiation of phragmoplast expansion in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> microspores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, a function that may relate to its interactions with phragmoplast-associated kinesins PAKRP1/Kinesin-12A (Kin-12A) and PAKRP1L/Kinesin-12B (Kin-12B), and TETRASPORE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Kin-12A/-12B localise to interdigitating microtubules at the phragmoplast midzone in somatic cells of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and are redundantly required for proper phragmoplast formation during mitotic cytokinesis of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> microspores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. In a <italic>kinl2a kinl2b</italic> (<italic>kin12a/b</italic>) double null mutant, the majority of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> microspores fail to form organised phragmoplasts during cytokinesis, causing reduced fertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. However, somatic cytokinesis has been reported to occur normally in <italic>kin12a/b</italic> double mutants, indicating cell-type specific functional redundancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Directional transport of TGN/EE membrane vesicles along phragmoplast microtubules to the midzone is believed to be driven by phragmoplast-associated transport kinesins. Such kinesins have not been identified in angiosperms, but recent data indicate that in the moss <italic>Physcomitirum patens</italic>, these include members of the class II Kin-12 family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Vesicle transport to the cell plate also requires regulators of endomembrane trafficking such as Rab GTPases, multi-subunit tethering complexes, dynamins, and SNARE components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Vesicles arrive at the phragmoplast midzone at the leading edge, before fusing to form a tubulo-vesicular network in the transition zone, and eventually becoming complete cell plate in the core phragmoplast lagging zone. While phragmoplast expansion is essential for patterning vesicle transport during cell plate formation, vesicle trafficking from the TGN/EE is also conversely required for phragmoplast expansion. Pharmacological inhibition of membrane trafficking from the TGN/EE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> as well as mutants in endomembrane regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> can perturb phragmoplast organisation and expansion, indicating the existence of crosstalk between mechanisms controlling cytoskeleton remodelling and endomembrane trafficking during cytokinesis to ensure co-ordination of both processes. However, it is not known how information about endomembrane dynamics and activity during cytokinesis is integrated into control of phragmoplast formation and dynamics.</p><p id="P6">Here, we describe the interaction between the endomembrane-associated small GTPase RAB-A2a, members of the cytoskeleton-associated Kinesin-12 family, and the Fused kinase orthologue TIO during cytokinesis in plant cells. We present evidence that their interaction forms a regulatory module that functions to both precisely target molecular regulators of cytokinesis to the phragmoplast midzone, as well as coupling cytoskeletal remodelling to endomembrane delivery during cell division. We conclude the RAB-A2a-Kin-12-TIO module provides a mechanistic basis for robust spatio-temporal control of plant cytokinesis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>RAB-A2a interacts with Class II Kinesin-12s <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in planta</italic></title><p id="P7">In a Y2H screen for interactors of RAB-A2a, we isolated 11 independent clones encoding for the C-terminal/tail regions of three Kinesin-12 proteins: Kin-12A, Kin-12B and Kin-12F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The six Kinesin-12 proteins (Kin-12s) encoded in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome are grouped into two subclasses, Class I and Class II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. In our Y2H screen, we identified all three members of Class II, while no clones corresponding to Class I Kin-12s or any other kinesins were isolated. To validate the interaction between RAB-A2a and Class II Kin-12s, we conducted pairwise Y2H tests using independently-cloned constructs of the Kin-12 tail regions, and confirmed interactions for all Class II Kin-12s with wild-type RAB-A2a as well as RAB-A2a[QL], a mutant variant with reduced GTPase activity that is considered ‘constitutively active’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1AB</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>). By contrast, we found no evidence of a Y2H interaction between Class II Kin-12 tail regions and RAB-A2a[SN], a variant predicted to have increased binding affinity for GDP and thus be arrested upstream of Rab GTPase activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>). We also found reduced interaction with RAB-A2a[NI], a variant with reduced nucleotide affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>). We also tested interactions between the Class II Kin-12 tail regions and other Rab GTPases that localize to the cell plate during cytokinesis, and found no interaction between Kin-12A, -12B, or 12F and wild-type or [QL] variants of RAB-A5c, RAB-A3, and RAB-E1d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that Class II Kin-12s can interact with RAB-A2a in its active form.</p><p id="P8">Kin-12A and Kin-12B localize to the phragmoplast midzone during cytokinesis, and are thought to play a structural role in phragmoplast organization in microspores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. To investigate the role of the related Kin-12F, we generated stable transgenic lines expressing fluorescently-tagged Kin-12F. We first attempted to express fluorescently-tagged Kin-12F constitutively under the control of the 35S promoter. However, we recovered no stable transgenic lines with either a gDNA or cDNA amplification template. We therefore used the dexamethasone-inducible pOp6/LhGR expression system driven by the <italic>AtRPS5a</italic> promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> to conditionally express YFP:Kin-12F (<italic>AtRPS5a&gt;&gt;Dex&gt;&gt;YFP:Kin-12F</italic>), as well as a truncated protein variant encompassing the Kin-12F tail including the RAB-A2a interaction domain identified in Y2H, but lacking the Kin-12F motor domain (<italic>AtRPS5a&gt;&gt;Dex&gt;&gt;YFP:Kin-12F-tail</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). We observed YFP fluorescence in 6 of 18 <italic>AtRPS5a&gt;&gt;Dex&gt;&gt;YFP:Kin-12F</italic> T2 lines after Dex treatment, and 6 of 8 <italic>AtRPS5a&gt;&gt;Dex&gt;&gt;YFP:Kin-12F-tail</italic> T2 lines after Dex treatment.</p><p id="P9">After 24h induction, YFP:Kin-12F localised to the phragmoplast midzone during cytokinesis in primary roots, where it closely followed the expanding phragmoplast labelled with RFP:TUB-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), matching previous reports of Kin-12A and -12B localisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. We did not detect YFP:Kin-12F during earlier stages of cell division when preprophase bands and spindles were present, or in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C</xref>), although the AtRPS5a-driven pOp6/LhGR was active during all stages of the cell cycle in meristematic root cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). By contrast, we were able to detect YFP:Kin-12F-tail during all stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1D</xref>), suggesting that (1) Kin-12F is post-transcriptionally or - translationally suppressed in non-dividing cells and (2) this suppression requires the N-terminal end of Kin-12F. Unlike the full-length YFP:Kin-12F, YFP:Kin-12F-tail localised to the plasma membrane (PM) in interphase, and labelled the entire cell plate during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1D</xref>). To confirm the localisation pattern of Kin-12F that we observed when expressed from the <italic>AtRPS5a</italic> promoter, we also performed immunolocalisation of endogenous Kin-12F in wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> primary roots using a polyclonal antibody against a 16 amino acid peptide sequence located in the N-terminal region of Kin-12F. During cytokinesis, this anti-Kin-12F antibody was detected at the phragmoplast midzone of both disk- and ring-phase phragmoplasts, similar to the localisation pattern of conditionally expressed YFP:Kin-12F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1G,H</xref>). This signal was abolished in primary roots of a <italic>kin-12f</italic> SALK mutant, indicating the antibody was specific to Kin-12F (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1G</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We next co-expressed <italic>AtRPS5a&gt;&gt;Dex&gt;&gt;YFP:Kin-12F/YFP:Kin-12F-tail</italic> with <italic>p35S::mCherry:RAB-A2a</italic>, and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments against YFP:Kin-12F/YFP:Kin-12F-tail. In these experiments, we found that mCh:RAB-A2a co-purified with YFP:Kin12F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>), as well as YFP:Kin-12F-tail (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>), demonstrating these proteins can interact <italic>in planta</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Class II Kin-12 members and RAB-A2a can mutually influence each other’s patterning</title><p id="P11">To investigate the functional relevance of these interactions, we performed quantitative co-localisation analyses between mCh:RAB-A2a and YFP:Kin-12F/YFP:Kin-12F-tail at the cell plate. In the presence of YFP:Kin-12F, mCh:RAB-A2a labelled the entirety of early cell plates, and was later enriched at the edges of expanding cell plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A</xref>). YFP:Kin-12F broadly followed the same pattern, but was depleted relative to mCh:RAB-A2a at the leading edge, which is the major site of vesicle delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G, I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2A</xref>). However, when co-expressed with YFP:Kin-12F-tail, mCh:RAB-A2a distribution was notably altered towards a more uniform pattern across the cell plate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). This closely matched the pattern of YFP:Kin-12F-tail at cell plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E,H, I</xref>). Furthermore, both YFP:Kin-12F-tail and mCh:RAB-A2a colocalised in interphase cells at the PM, as well as occasionally at intracellular punctae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>, white arrowheads/arrows, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1D, S2D</xref>). We did not observe substantial PM localisation for mCh:RAB-A2a in the absence of YFP:Kin-12F-tail (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C, S2C</xref>), indicating that this localisation shift was driven by the presence of YFP:Kin-12F-tail. PM localisation of YFP:Kin-12F-tail and mCh:RAB-A2a were both abolished by treatment with the TGN/EE recycling inhibitor Brefeldin-A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E,F</xref>) as well as by expression of the dominant-negative protein variants RAB-A2a[NI] and RAB-A2a[SN] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2G-L</xref>), indicating that PM localisation of YFP:Kin-12F-tail was dependent on RAB-A2a-mediated exocytic transport from the TGN/EE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>.

To test this hypothesis, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to abolish Kin-12F function in the <italic>kin12a/b</italic> background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. To avoid possible lethality, we targeted Kin-12F via CRIPSR-Cas9 driven from the <italic>GLABRA2 (GL2)</italic> promoter, whose activity in roots is confined to atrichoblast cell files<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> (<italic>pGL2::kin-12f:cas9-nls-mturquoise</italic>). To confirm suppression of Kin-12F by <italic>pGL2::kin-12f::cas9-nls-mturquoise</italic>, we first introduced it into the YFP:Kin-12F background. The cas9-nls-mturquoise signal was detected exclusively in atrichoblast cell files as expected, where it was present in the nuclei during interphase and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm during mitosis following dissolution of the nucleus, before gradually returning to the re-forming nuclei during telophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A,C-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P13">YFP:Kin-12F fluorescence in dividing cells in atrichoblast cell files was abolished, while YFP:Kin-12F was detected at the midzone of dividing cells in trichoblast cell files where <italic>pGL2::kin-12f:cas9-nls-mturquoise</italic> was not expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Successful cytokinesis in plants depends on the addition of vesicles from the TGN/EE to the cell plate, and spatio-temporal co-ordination of phragmoplast dynamics with this. Our data suggests that the interaction between RAB-A2a and Class II Kin-12 is essential for both of these processes: first, we have shown that Class II Kin-12s are required for somatic cytokinesis, during which they position RAB-A2a-associated membranes correctly at the phragmoplast midzone, and secondly, we have demonstrated that both Class II Kin-12s and functional RAB-A2a are required for phragmoplast expansion at physiological rates. Through co-operatively platforming TIO kinase at the midzone, we propose that this Class II Kin-12-RAB-A2a module acts to couple phragmoplast polymerisation to vesicle trafficking rates.</p><p id="P25">The question of exactly how Class II Kin-12s contribute to targeting of membranes at the phragmoplast midzone remains open: both Kin-12A and -12B were motile in <italic>in vitro</italic> gliding assays, indicating that they may play a role in vesicle transport to the midzone. However, we did not observe motility for Kin-12F. Whilst we cannot definitively conclude based on this that Kin-12F does not have motility <italic>in planta,</italic> it is noteworthy that Kin-12F is the only Kin-12 protein that does not have a conserved proline-tyrosine (PY) motif in its motor domain, which have been implicated in control of motor activity in other kinesins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The absence of Kin-12F from the phragmoplast leading edge, the main site of membrane delivery, also argues against a role in vesicle transport. We recorded slightly depleted RAB-A2a midzone targeting in <italic>kin-12a/b</italic> backgrounds compared to wild-type backgrounds, an effect that was enhanced when all three Class II Kin-12s were lost. We also often observed large, amorphous structures that were labelled by both RAB-A2a and FM4-64 when all three Class II Kin-12s were lost, which were frequently positioned close to the end of incomplete cross-walls. While it is therefore clear that Class II Kin-12s are required for proper midzone targeting of RAB-A2a-associated membranes during cytokinesis, it is difficult to discriminate whether this loss of targeting in the absence of Class II Kin-12s arises from failure to platform RAB-A2a-bearing vesicles at the midzone after their delivery, and/or a failure to transport RAB-A2a-bearing vesicles to the midzone along the phragmoplast. Both or a combination of these scenarios could lead to a situation in which mis-targeted vesicles fuse to form membrane structures away from the midzone, thus preventing proper cell plate formation.</p><p id="P26">One possibility is that Kin-12A/B and -F fulfil transport and platforming functions to different degrees: we found that localisation of Kin-12F to the midzone is not dependent on the interdigitating microtubule crosslinker MAP65-3, as has been shown previously for Kin-12A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Kin-12F is depleted at the leading edge of the cell plate/phragmoplast, but is present at the lagging transition zone where the cell plate becomes a tubulo-vesicular network. Here, the majority of microtubules attach to the cell plate without the participation of MAP65-3. We therefore propose that Kin-12F may act at the transition zone to promote targeting of vesicles during the formation of the cell plate tubulo-vesicular network, after their initial delivery to the phragmoplast leading edge. As we could find no evidence that Kin-12F interacts with TIO kinase, it is also possible that Kin-12F acts from this position as a “buffer” that can accumulate RAB-A2a membranes without triggering TIO kinase recruitment and further phragmoplast expansion. This implies the relative abundance of Kin-12A,B, and F may fine-tune cytokinesis dynamics in different cell types, which could account for the phenotypic differences observed between somatic and germline divisions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">RAB-A2a interacts with Kin-12A and -12B in an adjacent, but non-overlapping domain, to that of TIO kinase.

It is not entirely clear how TIO kinase-driven phosphorylation of Class II Kin-12s could contribute to phragmoplast expansion. Recent data suggest that a Kin-12A variant with reduced phosphorylation is excessively stabilised on microtubules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, which could be inhibitory to microtubule turnover required for phragmoplast growth. However, we did not observe any defects in transition from solid to diskshaped phragmoplasts, or other substantial defects in phragmoplast morphology, when either Kin-12s or RAB-A2a function was impaired, suggesting that microtubules were not excessively stabilised. To account for these observations, we instead propose that TIO kinase acts to promote polymerisation and stabilisation of microtubules of the phragmoplast. This can account for our observation that TIO kinase is involved in both phragmoplast formation after spindle dissolution as well as its later expansion. It is not clear whether this function emerges directly from Kin-12A/B phosphorylation, but TIO kinase may also have other, yet unknown targets that contribute to phragmoplast remodelling.proportional to RAB-A2a abundance Based on our data, we propose the following model for the function of a RAB-A2a/Kin-12/TIO module in spatio-temporal control of cytokinesis: (1) RAB-A2a-bearing vesicles are brought to the midzone along phragmoplast microtubules by transport kinesins, which include Kin-12A/B. (2) Kin-12A/B associate with microtubule-crosslinker MAP65-3 to stably platform vesicles at the leading edge, thus spatially patterning initial vesicle tethering and fusion. (3) Kin-12F is absent from the cell plate leading edge, but is enriched at the transition zone, where it may act as a scaffold to stabilise microtubule-membrane interactions independently of MAP65-3 promoting formation of a tubulo-vesicular network and eventually a stable cell plate. (4) The interaction of RAB-A2a with the tail regions of Kin-12A/-12B promotes recruitment of TIO kinase to the adjacent part of the Kin-12A/-12B tail regions, possibly via triggering a conformational change, therefore driving TIO kinase localisation to the midzone proportionally to RAB-A2a abundance at the midzone. (5) TIO activity promotes phragmoplast microtubule polymerisation, allowing first phragmoplast formation, and later phragmoplast expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). This model provides a testable, mechanistic explanation for previous observations regarding the coupling of vesicle delivery and phragmoplast growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, and explains how plants may ensure uniform cell plate morphology during cytokinesis.</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Plant materials, growth and treatments</title><p id="P28">The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ecotype Columbia was used throughout with the exception of the <italic>dyc283</italic> mutant of MAP65-3, which is in Wassilewskija ecotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. <italic>YFP: Kin-12F dyc283</italic> plants described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> are therefore Columbia - Wassilewskija hybrids.

(2) Kin-12A (and likely Kin-12B) is stabilised at the leading edge phragmoplast midzone by the microtubule crosslinker MAP65-3, where they provide a platform for incoming RAB-A2a-bearing vesicles. (3) Kin-12F provides an additional platform at the transition zone midzone that is independent of MAP65-3, supporting the formation of the tubulo-vesicular cell plate (4) RAB-A2a activity and Kin-12A&amp;B dictate proper TIO kinase localisation at the phragmoplast midzone, which (5) couples stable phragmoplast polymerization to membrane presence at the midzone. <bold>(B)</bold> Model for recruitment of RAB-A2a and TIO kinase to the midzone. Binding of membrane-associated RAB-A2a to the Kin-12A&amp;B tail regions promotes binding of TIO kinase to the adjacent part of the tail regions, possibly through inducing a steric change in the kinesin tail region. TIO kinase activity at the midzone then promotes phragmoplast remodelling proportional to RAB-A2a abundance at the midzone.
