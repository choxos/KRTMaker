Female meiosis culminates in two consecutive cell divisions of the oocyte, meiosis I and II, which are separated by a brief transition phase known as interkinesis. Due to the absence of chromosome decondensation and the suppression of genome replication during interkinesis, it has been widely assumed that the nuclear envelope does not reassemble between meiosis I and II. By analyzing interkinesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes, we instead show that an atypical structure made of two lipid bilayers, which we termed the interkinetic envelope, surrounds the surface of the segregating chromosomes. The interkinetic envelope shares common features with the nuclear envelope but also exhibits specific characteristics that distinguish it, including its lack of continuity with the endoplasmic reticulum, unique protein composition, assembly mechanism, and function in chromosome segregation. These distinct attributes collectively define the interkinetic envelope as a unique and specialized structure that has been previously overlooked.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The nuclear envelope delineates the nucleus in all eukaryotic cells. The nuclear envelope is comprised of two lipid bilayers, which form the inner nuclear membrane (INM) in contact with chromatin, and the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) facing the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Hetzer, 2010</xref>). Distinct protein compositions characterize the two layers of the nuclear envelope. The INM, lined by the nuclear lamina, faces the nucleoplasmic compartment, and features a unique set of proteins, including the LAP2, Emerin, and MAN1 (LEM)-domain integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Ungricht and Kutay, 2015</xref>). The ONM continuously connects to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and shares both composition and function with the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Deolal et al., 2024</xref>). While the primary role of the nuclear envelope is to separate the genome and nucleoplasmic space from the cytoplasm, there are specific points of contact and communication between these two compartments. First, the INM is fused with the ONM at designated sites where multisubunit macromolecular complexes, known as nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), assemble and facilitate nucleocytoplasmic transport across the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">De Magistris and Antonin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Ungricht and Kutay, 2017</xref>). Second, the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, a highly conserved 6:6 heterohexameric bridge spanning the nuclear envelope, serves to physically connect chromatin and the nuclear lamina to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">McGillivary et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P3">In organisms undergoing semi-open or open mitosis, the transition from interphase to mitosis (M-phase) is marked by nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and chromosome condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Boettcher and Barral, 2013</xref>). Following cell division and the segregation of sister chromatids, the nuclear envelope must reassemble around the decondensing chromatids to separate the genome from the cytoplasmic environment. Thus, cycles of NEBD and chromosome condensation, followed by nuclear envelope reassembly around decondensing chromatids, accompany successive cell divisions in most tissues and cell types. A notable deviation from this stereotypical sequence of events occurs during oogenesis. This process, responsible for producing haploid female gametes, culminates in two consecutive cell divisions of the oocyte, known as meiosis I and II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dumont and Desai, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Mullen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Ohkura, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Severson et al., 2016</xref>). During meiosis I, recombined homologous chromosome pairs are segregated into two chromosome sets. One set is directed for elimination into the first polar body (hereafter referred to as the PB chromosomal set), while the second set almost immediately proceeds to meiosis II (hereafter referred to as the MII chromosomal set), following a very brief transition phase termed interkinesis. A remarkable feature of interkinesis is the apparent lack of chromosome decondensation preceding entry into meiosis II and the segregation of sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Nakajo et al., 2000</xref>). The absence of chromosome decondensation at this stage is coupled with suppression of genome replication, which normally occurs after exit from M-phase, and which is essential in this specific context for generating haploid oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Furuno et al., 1994</xref>). Hence, although interkinesis occurs between two M-phases, it is not classified as a typical interphase. In this context, the status of the nuclear envelope during interkinesis remains notably ambiguous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gerhart et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Lenart and Ellenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Nakajo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Nebreda and Ferby, 2000</xref>). As interkinesis occurs between two M-phases, one would anticipate nuclear envelope reassembly in the oocyte at this stage. Yet, the apparent suppression of most interphase events and the scarcity of reports on the presence of a canonical nuclear envelope surrounding oocyte chromosomes during interkinesis in any species has led to controversy over its actual existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Penfield et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P4">By combining light and electron microscopy, we probed nuclear envelope reassembly in oocytes of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> during interkinesis. We found that a double membrane, superficially reminiscent of the nuclear envelope, progressively assembles at the surface of the segregating chromosomes during anaphase/telophase I. This structure is transient and disassembles rapidly upon entry into meiosis II. Furthermore, examination of the ultrastructure, protein composition, and function of this double membrane in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes revealed distinctive structural, compositional, and functional features that set it apart from a typical nuclear envelope. We thus named this novel organelle the interkinetic envelope.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>An interkinetic envelope forms on the surface of both chromosomal sets between meiosis I and II in oocytes</title><p id="P5">To determine if a nuclear envelope reassembles during the short interkinetic transition phase between meiosis I and II in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes, we analyzed the 3-dimensional organization of membranes around chromosomes during anaphase I/interkinesis by correlative light and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Lachat et al., 2022</xref>). Fertilized oocytes expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged tubulin and mCherry-tagged H2B were imaged <italic>ex utero</italic> using a spinning disk microscope until they reached mid-anaphase I or mid/late-interkinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). They were then fixed chemically and processed for SBF-SEM. 30 nm-thick sections were automatically cut and imaged throughout the two sets of segregating chromosomes, and a slab of each stage oocyte including both sets of chromosomes was reconstructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Video 1</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In the earlier mid-anaphase I oocyte, vesicular membranous structures were observed on the surface of both chromosome sets. These structures formed two discontinuous double membrane layers that covered the outer surfaces. These double membrane layers were seen surrounding both the extruded chromosomal set (facing the plasma membrane of the future polar body, [PB]) and the meiosis II chromosomal set (facing the oocyte cytoplasm, [MII]). Double membrane layers were excluded from the chromosomal surfaces facing the central spindle region of both chromosomal sets. As meiosis I progressed into mid-interkinesis, the double membrane layer enveloping the MII chromosomal set displayed increased continuity, with both the mean and total lengths of membrane contours continuously expanding until late-interkinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 C, D</xref>). After extrusion of the first polar body between mid- and late-interkinesis, the mean length of membrane contours stagnated. The initial increase in mean contour length suggests that double membrane fragments likely expanded or fused to generate longer fragments. In contrast, after this initial phase, the stagnation in mean contour length, coupled with the ever-increasing total length of contours, suggested that additional membrane fragments are likely recruited to the surface of chromosomal sets between mid- and late-interkinesis. The overall length of membrane contours on the PB chromosomal set remained comparatively stable during anaphase I/interkinesis, but completely disappeared as late-interkinesis ensued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Importantly, upon reexamination of the tomographic electron microscopy data that we had previously conducted to analyze microtubule organization during anaphase/telophase I in high-pressure frozen <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Laband et al., 2017</xref>), we identified identical vesicular and membranous structures on the surface of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 A</xref>). The overall characteristics and dynamics of membranes were thus not significantly disrupted by the chemical fixation procedure employed in our SBF-SEM observations. These results suggest that an asymmetric double membrane structure, reminiscent of the nuclear envelope, appears progressively during interkinesis at the chromosomal surface and disappears shortly after PB extrusion.</p><p id="P7">We next probed the nature and precise kinetics of assembly of this membranous structure by time lapse imaging fertilized oocytes from a <italic>C. elegans</italic> transgenic strain co-expressing the nuclear envelope marker and INM LEM-domain protein LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> fused to GFP and histone H2B fused to mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Video 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brachner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Lee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lin et al., 2000</xref>). Surprisingly, LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> localized asymmetrically to the different chromosomal sets. Unlike the double membrane structures observed in our EM analysis, LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> was only faintly detectable on the surface of the PB chromosomal set during both meiotic divisions. In stark contrast, following the onset of anaphase I, LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> gradually accumulated on the exterior surface of the MII chromosomal set, which correlated with the location of the membranous structure identified by SBF-SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Penfield et al., 2020</xref>). At mid-interkinesis, LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> enveloped the surface of the MII chromosomal set and reached its peak intensity. In late-interkinesis, it gradually diminished from the MII chromosomal surface, only to reappear during the onset of anaphase II. Consistent with an earlier observation, we noted a robust accumulation of LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> at the end of anaphase II on the inner (central spindle-facing) surface of the decondensing maternal pronucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Penfield et al., 2020</xref>). This accumulating LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> appeared to form a distinct “plaque”-like structure, which is the recruitment site of ESCRT-III complex proteins, such as CHMP-7<sup>CHMP7</sup> and VPS-32<sup>CHMP4</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, cyan arrows) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gatta and Carlton, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Gu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Penfield et al., 2020</xref>). These ESCRT-III proteins are involved in the remodeling and sealing of the nuclear envelope proximal to the central spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Barger et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Penfield et al., 2020</xref>). We did not observe any LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> “plaque”-like structure nor the accumulation of CHMP-7<sup>CHMP7</sup> or VPS-32<sup>CHMP4</sup> during interkinesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 B</xref>). This observation aligned with the absence of double membrane sealing in our late interkinesis SBF-SEM reconstruction, indicating that, unlike a typical nuclear envelope, double membranes never fully enclose the MII chromosomal set during interkinesis. Therefore, we chose the term “interkinetic envelope” to describe this unique, asymmetric, and non-canonical membranous structure.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Microtubules and proximity to the plasma membrane negatively regulate interkinetic envelope assembly</title><p id="P8">Next, we investigated the origin of the asymmetric assembly of the interkinetic envelope, which initiated on the external surface of chromosomes, and was more pronounced on the MII compared to the PB chromosomal set. We have previously demonstrated that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes, after anaphase onset, meiotic spindle pole microtubules disassemble before central spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Laband et al., 2017</xref>). This temporal uncoupling mirrors the observed asymmetry in interkinetic envelope assembly, which begins on the external (spindle pole-facing) surface of chromosomes before progressing toward the internal (central spindle-facing) surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 F</xref>). This observation suggested a potential functional link between microtubule disassembly and interkinetic envelope assembly, similar to nuclear envelope reformation during mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dey and Baum, 2021</xref>). To directly test this hypothesis, we treated oocytes with a low dose of colchicine immediately after anaphase onset to promote microtubule disassembly while allowing chromosome segregation to continue. We then monitored the recruitment of GFP-tagged LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> as a marker for interkinetic envelope assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 C</xref>). In colchicine-treated oocytes, LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> was recruited more rapidly to the chromosome surface and formed a more continuous layer around the MII chromosomal set compared to controls. These results indicate that spindle microtubule disassembly triggers interkinetic envelope formation, and prevents premature assembly on the internal surface of chromosomes.</p><p id="P9">The visible asymmetry between the MII and PB interkinetic envelopes mirrored the uneven positioning of the two chromosomal sets during anaphase and interkinesis. Specifically, the PB chromosomes were oriented toward the plasma membrane, while the MII chromosomes faced the oocyte cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 B-E</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that the plasma membrane might act as a barrier, inhibiting or delaying interkinetic envelope assembly around the PB chromosomal set. To test this, we depleted the dynein adaptor protein LIN-5<sup>NuMA</sup> via RNAi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 D</xref>). LIN-5<sup>NuMA</sup> is crucial for recruiting dynein to meiotic spindle poles, which in turn is essential for microtubule focusing at the spindle poles and proper spindle rotation perpendicular to the plasma membrane before anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">van der Voet et al., 2009</xref>). In LIN-5<sup>NuMA</sup>-depleted oocytes, the spindle remained parallel to the oocyte cortex, and chromosome segregation occurred parallel to the plasma membrane. Strikingly, this was accompanied by a symmetrization of GFP-tagged LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> levels between the two chromosomal sets compared to control oocytes, suggesting that proximity to the plasma membrane might hinder or delay LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> recruitment and interkinetic envelope assembly on the PB chromosomal set. Taken together, our results suggest that both the anaphase I central spindle microtubules and the proximity of the plasma membrane negatively regulate LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> recruitment, and likely also the formation of the interkinetic envelope.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The interkinetic envelope contains INM but lacks ONM proteins</title><p id="P10">To determine the protein composition of the interkinetic envelope, we analyzed the localization of GFP-tagged INM and ONM proteins including: the unique <italic>C. elegans</italic> B-type lamin protein LMN-1<sup>Lamin B1</sup>, which lines the inner side of the INM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Liu et al., 2000</xref>), the second LEM-domain INM protein EMR-1<sup>Emerin</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Gruenbaum et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Manilal et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Nagano et al., 1996</xref>), the chromatin-binding protein BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> (Barrier of Autointegration Factor) responsible for LEM-domain protein recruitment to the INM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gorjánácz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Shumaker et al., 2001</xref>), the two LINC complex components, SUN-1<sup>SUN1</sup> at the INM, and the KASH domain protein ZYG-12 at the ONM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Malone et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Ungricht and Kutay, 2017</xref>), the ER signal peptidase and ONM marker SP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Poteryaev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Rolls et al., 2002</xref>), and the Ribosome-Associated Membrane Protein 4 RAMP4 (also known as Stress-associated Endoplasmic Reticulum Protein 1 or SERP1, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Video 3</xref>). In addition to the single lamin LMN-1<sup>Lamin B1</sup>, all INM proteins tested, including LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup>, EMR-1<sup>Emerin</sup>, BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup>, and SUN-1<sup>SUN1</sup> were located at the surface of the MII chromosomal set during interkinesis colocalizing with the interkinetic envelope, with BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> also localized all over the chromosome mass. Instead, ONM proteins ZYG-12, SP12 and RAMP4 were absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 A-C</xref>). In the nuclear envelope, the ONM is continuous and functionally interrelated with the ER, with which it shares numerous proteins and markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Whaley et al., 1960</xref>). The lack of ONM markers in the interkinetic envelope suggests that, unlike canonical nuclear envelopes, the interkinetic envelope is not contiguous with the ER. We confirmed this hypothesis by analyzing the ultrastructure of the ER, close to the interkinetic envelope, using SBF-SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Video 4</xref>). Although ER membrane sheets were present near the MII chromosomal set throughout anaphase and interkinesis, they were visibly distinct and physically separated from the interkinetic envelope. Thus, the interkinetic envelope on the MII chromosomal set contains INM proteins but lacks ONM proteins, likely due to its physical disconnection from the ER.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> and VRK-1<sup>VRK1</sup> control the structural integrity of the interkinetic envelope</title><p id="P11">Upon mitotic exit in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human tissue cultured cells, BAF plays a crucial role in nuclear envelope reformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gorjánácz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Liu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Samwer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Schellhaus et al., 2016</xref>). To explore the potential involvement of the equivalent <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein in interkinetic envelope formation, we performed SBF-SEM following the full depletion of BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> in oocytes. Due to the inherent challenge of achieving full depletion through RNAi alone of a small 90 amino-acid protein such as BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup>, we employed a dual approach, combining RNAi with Auxin treatment in a transgenic strain engineered to express endogenous BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> fused to an AID (Auxin-Inducible Degron) tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2 A, B</xref>). Complete depletion of BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup>, achieved only through the combination of RNAi and Auxin treatments, did not inhibit the formation of the interkinetic envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2 A-C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Video 5</xref>). However, while control oocytes displayed a nearly continuous envelope covering the outer surface of the MII chromosomal set, BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup>-depleted oocytes assembled a highly fenestrated envelope with a strong reduction in overall membrane density (total membrane length in contact with chromosomes in control oocytes was 325.24 μm vs. 183.82 μm in the absence of BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup>). Unlike in controls, in BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup>-depleted oocytes, small membrane fragments covered the surface of both chromosomal sets and were found inside the chromatin masses of the segregating chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, white arrows). Thus, BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> depletion leads to a drastic reduction in the recruitment of membranes necessary for interkinetic envelope assembly, coupled with strong defects in membrane fusion and distribution over both segregating chromosomal sets.</p><p id="P12">During nuclear envelope reformation, BAF mediates the physical interaction between chromatin and LEM-domain proteins, which is essential for nuclear envelope integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gorjánácz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Liu et al., 2003</xref>). To determine if the phenotype we observed upon BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> depletion could be attributed to defects in LEM-domain protein recruitment, we employed RNAi to knock down BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> and monitored the presence of GFP-tagged INM proteins LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> and EMR-1<sup>Emerin</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2 D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Video 6</xref>). Depletion of BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> resulted in a significant reduction of both INM proteins from the interkinetic envelope. Together, these results suggest that BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> plays an important role in controlling the integrity and continuity of the interkinetic envelope, potentially by recruiting LEM-domain proteins on the chromatin surface. The structural integrity defects observed in the interkinetic envelope following BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> depletion prompted us to examine its potential impact on chromosome segregation. For this, we conducted time lapse imaging of oocytes expressing GFP-tagged tubulin and mCherry-tagged H2B, with and without BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). In both conditions, chromosomes aligned at the spindle equator on a tight metaphase plate during metaphase I. Throughout anaphase I, the segregating chromosomes maintained a compact arrangement, showing no signs of mis-segregation in both control and BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup>-depleted oocytes. On the other hand, chromosome segregation was noticeably faster and resulted in a significantly increased distance between the two segregating chromosomal sets in the absence of BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> compared to control oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Since the overall chromosome structure and condensation, and the meiosis I spindle organization appeared normal in the absence of BAF-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2 F, G</xref>), our results suggest that the integrity of the interkinetic envelope impacts the normal pace and extent of chromosome segregation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes.</p><p id="P13">Since the complete depletion of BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> resulted in the formation of a highly fenestrated interkinetic envelope with significantly reduced membrane content, we next investigated whether over-recruiting BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> on chromosomes would have the opposite effect. To test this, we depleted the VRK-1<sup>VRK1</sup> kinase, which phosphorylates BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> at mitotic entry to promote its detachment from chromatin—an event essential for efficient nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gorjánácz et al., 2007</xref>). In the absence of VRK-1<sup>VRK1</sup> during mitosis, BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> remains permanently bound to chromatin, leading to defects in NEBD and nuclear envelope reformation after mitosis, with excess membranes forming around chromosomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gorjánácz et al., 2007</xref>). First, we verified the presence of VRK-1<sup>VRK1</sup> at the surface of oocyte chromosomes during interkinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Then, we confirmed that, similar to mitosis, depleting VRK-1<sup>VRK1</sup> led to an excess of BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> and LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> on chromosomes during interkinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 C, D</xref>). Notably, in the absence of VRK-1<sup>VRK1</sup>, GFP-tagged BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> and LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> were strongly recruited to both the PB and MII chromosomal sets, unlike in control oocytes. This suggests that VRK-1 is at least partially responsible for the asymmetric localization of both proteins on chromosomes during interkinesis. Moreover, in the absence of VRK-1<sup>VRK1</sup>, this overaccumulation of BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> and LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> on chromosomes was accompanied by their noticeable stretching during segregation, which is reminiscent of the phenotype observed during mitosis in the same condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). These defects of mitotic chromosome segregation have previously been attributed to the excess of membranes that surrounds them in absence of VRK-1<sup>VRK-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gorjánácz et al., 2007</xref>). To investigate whether membrane hyper-recruitment was responsible for chromosome stretching during interkinesis in VRK-1<sup>VRK1</sup>-depleted oocytes, we conducted SBF-SEM followed by 3D reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 F</xref>). Surprisingly, although this approach confirmed the stretched chromosome phenotype, the density of membranes at the chromosomal surface was significantly reduced. In control oocytes, the total membrane length in contact with chromosomes was 325.24 μm, compared to 199.51 μm in the absence of VRK-1<sup>VRK-1</sup>. Thus, the chromosomal stretching observed in the absence of VRK-1<sup>VRK1</sup> is likely due to a function separate from its role in interkinetic envelope assembly. Furthermore, the interkinetic envelope appeared highly fenestrated, similar to the phenotype observed in BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup>-depleted oocytes. Thus, our results demonstrate that both depletion and over-recruitment of BAF-1 on chromosomes lead to a similar reduction in membrane density and a highly fenestrated appearance at the chromosome surface during interkinesis. Overall, these findings underscore the critical role of BAF-1, whose chromosomal levels must be tightly regulated to ensure the proper assembly of the interkinetic envelope.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> is essential for membrane recruitment on the chromosomal surface</title><p id="P14">We next sought to determine the origin of the double membranes that form the interkinetic envelope. In addition to BAF, nuclear envelope reformation at the end of mitosis requires the nucleoporin ELYS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Franz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Galy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Rasala et al., 2006</xref>). ELYS is a member of the ‘Y’ nuclear pore subcomplex, which is essential for post-mitotic NPC reassembly and nuclear envelope integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Harel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Walther et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the orthologous protein MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> is essential for nuclear envelope formation and function in embryos, and for chromosome segregation in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Fernandez and Piano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Galy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gomez-Saldivar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hattersley et al., 2016</xref>). During metaphase I in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes, MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> colocalizes with kinetochore cup-like structures on the surface of chromosomes, where it serves as a docking site for the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hattersley et al., 2016</xref>). In anaphase I, the localization of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> expanded to all chromosomes, while also maintaining colocalization with the interkinetic envelope on both chromosomal sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). At this stage, PP1c orchestrates kinetochore disassembly, a critical process for proper chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hattersley et al., 2016</xref>). To explore the potential involvement of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> in interkinetic envelope assembly and double membrane recruitment, we performed SBF-SEM following RNAi-mediated depletion of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup>. In line with previous findings, in the absence of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup>, chromosomes within each chromosomal set were not as tightly grouped as compared to in controls during anaphase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Video 7</xref>). Furthermore, physical segregation of the two chromosomal sets aborted rapidly after anaphase onset leading to a shorter separation distance compared to in control oocytes at the same stage. Thus, to confirm that MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup>-depleted oocytes had reached interkinesis at the time of chemical fixation, we used time lapse microscopy to capture their dynamics before proceeding with fixation and SBF-SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3 B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Video 8</xref>). After segmentation and 3D reconstruction, we observed a drastic reduction in double membranes on the outer surface of chromosomes in MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup>-depleted oocytes compared to in controls (total membrane length in contact with chromosomes in control oocytes was 317.53 μm vs. 17.58 μm in the absence of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup>). Upon segmentation and reconstruction of the other membrane compartments surrounding the segregating chromosomes (vesicles, mitochondria, and ER), we observed the expected meiotic spindle organelle exclusion zone around chromosomes in control oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3 C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Video 8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Albertson and Thomson, 1993</xref>). However, in the absence of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup>, the organelle exclusion zone was notably wider. Furthermore, this zone encompassed numerous unidentified small membrane fragments that surrounded the chromosomes but did not directly contact them—both features not observed in control oocytes. Thus, MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> is required for interkinetic envelope assembly.</p><p id="P15">We hypothesized that the expanded organelle exclusion zone and the deficiencies in interkinetic envelope assembly in the absence of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> might, at least in part, result from the abnormal persistence of spindle pole microtubules throughout anaphase and interkinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hattersley et al., 2016</xref>). These ectopic spindle pole microtubules could potentially act as a physical barrier, preventing membrane recruitment on the surface of chromosomes. To test this hypothesis, we compared the intensity of GFP::LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> around chromosomes during interkinesis in the absence of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup>, with and without microtubule depolymerization induced by nocodazole treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 E, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3 D</xref>). As expected, GFP::LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> was nearly absent from the surface of both chromosomal sets in the absence of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup>. Importantly, this absence of GFP::LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> was not attributed to the delocalization of BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup>, which remained properly localized on the MII chromosomal set in the absence of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3 E</xref>). Furthermore, upon microtubule depolymerization induced by nocodazole, GFP::LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> levels on the MII chromosomal set were partially restored, reaching approximately half of the levels observed in control oocytes. Therefore, microtubule depolymerization can partially ameliorate the defects in interkinetic envelope assembly induced by MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> depletion. During post-mitotic nuclear envelope reformation, ER sheets are enlisted at the chromosome surface to serve as a membrane source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Anderson and Hetzer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Barger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Deolal et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Haraguchi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Otsuka et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings collectively propose a distinct mechanism for interkinetic envelope assembly, implicating the MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup>-mediated accumulation of small unidentified membrane fragments on surface of the chromosomal sets. Moreover, this process is contingent, at least to some extent, on the rapid disassembly of spindle pole microtubules, a process that occurs early during anaphase in control oocytes, but is strongly delayed in the absence of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hattersley et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The interkinetic envelope contains nucleoporins but not NPCs</title><p id="P16">MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> is essential for post-mitotic nuclear pore complex reformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Franz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Galy et al., 2006</xref>). At mitotic exit, MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> binds to chromatin and recruits other nuclear pore components that form 6-8 protein modules, the NPC subcomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Fernandez-Martinez and Rout, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Huang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lin and Hoelz, 2019</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the NPC comprises 28 identified nuclear pore proteins (NPPs) distributed into 6 subcomplexes: the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic rings (also known as the ‘Y-complex’, which contains MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup>), the inner ring, the transmembrane nucleoporins, the central channel, the nuclear basket, and the cytoplasmic filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cohen-Fix and Askjaer, 2017</xref>).

We first validated NPP-6<sup>NUP160</sup> localization and observed a comparable chromosomal pattern for other Y-complex constituents, including NPP-2<sup>NUP85</sup>, NPP-5<sup>NUP107</sup>, NPP-15<sup>NUP133</sup>, NPP-18<sup>SEH1</sup>, and NPP-20<sup>SEC13R</sup>. The inner ring complex lines the inner part of the NPC. We detected the presence of the inner ring component NPP-19<sup>NUP35</sup>, but not NPP-13<sup>NUP93</sup> or NPP-8<sup>NUP155</sup>, at the outer surface of the MII chromosomal set. The central channel is formed by nucleoporins that contain FG repeats essential for establishing nuclear pore permeability. We could not detect the presence of central channel NPP-1<sup>NUP54</sup>, and NPP-11<sup>NUP62</sup> predominantly localized between the two sets of segregating chromosomes in a region corresponding to the anaphase I central spindle. The nuclear basket forms the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC. We found nuclear basket NPP-7<sup>NUP153</sup> distributed across the entire surface of both chromosome sets, whereas NPP-21<sup>TPR</sup> was absent. On the other side of the NPC, the cytoplasmic filaments include the nucleoporin NPP-24<sup>NUP88</sup>, which like NPP-11<sup>NUP62</sup>, was concentrated in the central spindle region during interkinesis. Finally, transmembrane nucleoporins NPP-12<sup>NUP210</sup> and NPP-25<sup>TMEM33</sup>, but not NPP-22<sup>NDC1</sup>, were present on the outer surface of the MII chromosomal set. In summary, our investigation revealed the presence of all examined Y-complex nucleoporins, along with specifically NPP-19<sup>NUP35</sup> (inner ring), NPP-12<sup>NUP210</sup> and NPP-7<sup>NUP153</sup> (cytoplasmic filaments), and NPP-25<sup>TMEM33</sup> (transmembrane), distributed across the entire surface of both chromosomal sets and/or asymmetrically at the interkinetic envelope. That is, nucleoporins within the same NPC subcomplex were not necessarily co-recruited to the interkinetic envelope, preventing the formation of functional subcomplexes or NPCs. In agreement, despite the presence of various nucleoporins and in alignment with prior observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Penfield et al., 2020</xref>), both our SBF-SEM and electron tomography analyses consistently indicated an absence of nuclear pores within the interkinetic envelope. Overall, while lacking nuclear pores, the presence of nucleoporins hints at their potential engagement in unconventional functions during interkinetic envelope assembly.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Nucleoporins with membrane binding domains could contribute to interkinetic envelope integrity</title><p id="P18">We next tested the role of nucleoporins in interkinetic envelope assembly. Interestingly, aside from the two transmembrane proteins NPP-12<sup>NUP210</sup> and NPP-25<sup>TMEM33</sup>, responsible for post-mitotic NPC anchoring in nuclear membranes and found at the interkinetic envelope, several nucleoporins identified in the interkinetic envelope are predicted to possess domains capable of folding as amphipathic helices, which can bind to membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Floch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Greber et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Hamed and Antonin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Vollmer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Vollmer et al., 2012</xref>). These included Y-complex nucleoporins NPP-6<sup>NUP160</sup> and NPP-15<sup>NUP133</sup>, inner ring component NPP-19<sup>NUP35</sup>, and nuclear basket protein NPP-7<sup>NUP153</sup>. We systematically depleted each of these six nucleoporins by RNAi and analyzed interkinetic envelope integrity by time lapse imaging using GFP::LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> intensity as a proxy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7 A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Video 9</xref>). Individual depletion of all six nucleoporins led to a mild but significant decrease in GFP::LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> intensity at the chromosomal surface during interkinesis. Importantly, depleting the inner ring nucleoporin NPP-8<sup>NUP155</sup>, which we did not find localized at the interkinetic envelope, exhibited no discernible effect on GFP::LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> intensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5 A</xref>). In line with the mild decrease in LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> intensity, none of the individual nucleoporin depletions caused chromosome segregation defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5 B</xref>). To determine whether depleting multiple nucleoporins would have a stronger effect, we systematically co-depleted the six nucleoporins in pairs. While all co-depletions consistently exacerbated the delocalization of GFP::LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> from the chromosome surface compared to single depletions, none resulted in its complete absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7 B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5 C</xref>). We were unable to assess the effect of the simultaneous depletion of NPP-12<sup>NUP210</sup> and NPP-19<sup>NUP35</sup>, as it caused the failure of oocyte NEBD and blocked meiotic divisions. Overall, our results suggest that nucleoporins function in parallel for membrane recruitment, and their roles in interkinetic envelope assembly are at least partially redundant.</p><p id="P19">Finally, we tested whether this network of nucleoporins was hierarchically positioned downstream of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup>, akin to during post-mitotic NPC reformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Franz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Galy et al., 2006</xref>). For this, we analyzed the localizations of GFP-tagged NPP-6<sup>NUP160</sup>, NPP-15<sup>NUP133</sup>, NPP-25<sup>TMEM33</sup>, NPP-12<sup>NUP210</sup>, NPP-19<sup>NUP35</sup> and NPP-7<sup>NUP153</sup> in oocytes during interkinesis upon MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> depletion by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Video 10</xref>). The intensities of all six nucleoporins on the chromosome surface were markedly reduced in the absence of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> during interkinesis, with NPP-6<sup>NUP160</sup>, NPP-7<sup>NUP153</sup>, and NPP-19<sup>NUP35</sup> absent from chromosomes. These results indicated that chromatin-bound MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> serves as a precursor to a network of nucleoporins including NPP-6<sup>NUP160</sup>, NPP-7<sup>NUP153</sup>, NPP-12<sup>NUP210</sup>, NPP-15<sup>NUP133</sup>, NPP-19<sup>NUP35</sup>, and NPP-25<sup>TMEM33</sup>. This network could interact with membranes and mediate their recruitment to the chromosomal surface, thus promoting interkinetic envelope assembly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">The suppression of most interphasic events during interkinesis in oocytes, including chromosome decondensation and genome replication, led to the widely accepted assumption that the nuclear envelope does not reassemble during this short transition phase between meiosis I and II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gerhart et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Lenart and Ellenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Nakajo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Nebreda and Ferby, 2000</xref>). We show here that, although not erroneous, this prediction is overstated. By combining electron microscopy and time lapse imaging in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes during interkinesis, we found that an ‘interkinetic envelope’ transiently forms around condensed chromosomes at this stage. Although this envelope is not nuclear as it does not compartmentalize the genome, it nevertheless shares several features with the nuclear envelope, including its double-membrane structure and protein composition of the inner layer. It also displays distinct and surprising differences from nuclear envelopes.</p><p id="P21">A striking feature of the interkinetic envelope is its lack of continuity with the ER. During post-mitotic nuclear envelope reformation, ER membranes are recruited at chromosome surfaces to regenerate nuclear envelope membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Anderson and Hetzer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Deolal et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Haraguchi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Otsuka et al., 2018</xref>). Then, because the ER membrane is contiguous with the nuclear envelope, proteins can translocate seamlessly from the ER to the ONM, resulting in partial sharing of protein composition between these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Deolal et al., 2024</xref>). In contrast, the lack of continuity between the interkinetic envelope and the meiotic ER likely explains the apparent absence of ONM protein within the interkinetic envelope. The reasons for the absence of a junction between the interkinetic envelope and the ER remain unclear. We propose two hypotheses to explain this lack of continuity. First, there may be an unknown physical barrier that prevents the interkinetic envelope from incorporating ER-derived membranes. Alternatively, missing components within the interkinetic envelope could inhibit the fusion of these two structures. Notably, despite being discovered decades ago, the mechanism for junction formation between the ER and the nuclear envelope in mitotic cells remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Watson, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Whaley et al., 1960</xref>). Further investigation will be required to uncover the molecular mechanism underlying this unique feature of the interkinetic envelope.</p><p id="P22">Nevertheless, we demonstrated that the interkinetic envelope initially assembles on the external surface of the MII chromosomal set that will persist in the oocyte cytoplasm for meiosis II, before almost completely covering the surface of this chromosomal set. In the absence of physical contact with the ER, we found that a population of small membrane fragments, the origin and identity of which are at present unclear, positioned near chromosomes, seemed to participate in interkinetic envelope assembly. We suspect that these small membrane fragments could originate from nuclear envelope remnants following NEBD of the diakinesis oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Lenart and Ellenberg, 2003</xref>). Our functional analysis suggests that MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> acts as an upstream regulator of these fragments. In its absence, the small membrane fragments concentrated around the segregating chromosomes but did not contact them to assemble an envelope at their surface.</p><p id="P23">We identified two complementary functions for MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> at the interkinetic envelope. First, we found that in absence of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup>, the observed small membrane fragments were positioned further away from chromosomes, likely caused by persistent ectopic spindle poles during anaphase I in absence of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hattersley et al., 2016</xref>). Second, we found that several nucleoporins bearing potential membrane-binding domains were recruited downstream of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> to the interkinetic envelope. Our results suggested that these nucleoporins could recruit membranes necessary for interkinetic envelope assembly at the surface of chromosomes. The role of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> in nucleoporin recruitment to the interkinetic envelope could be direct or indirect. Indeed, during post-mitotic nuclear envelope reassembly, a key initial event is the dephosphorylation of nuclear envelope components, including lamins and nucleoporins, by protein phosphatases PP1 or PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hattersley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Mehsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Steen et al., 2000</xref>). During meiosis I in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes, MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> is responsible for the docking of the catalytic subunit of PP1 on chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hattersley et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, PP1 docked by MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> on chromosomes could regulate the phosphorylation state of components essential for interkinetic envelope assembly, which would in turn promote their chromosomal recruitment.</p><p id="P24">The potential link we establish between nucleoporins bearing membrane-binding domains and interkinetic envelope assembly pertains to a non-conventional role of these nucleoporins outside their canonical function in the formation of nuclear pores. We indeed observed a complete lack of nuclear pores in the interkinetic envelope despite the presence of these nucleoporins. Consistent with this observation, we found that nucleoporins that normally belong to the same NPC sub-complex were not co-recruited to the interkinetic envelope. In a broader context, our findings imply that the conventional hierarchical relationships observed among nucleoporins within the same subcomplexes during post-mitotic nuclear pore assembly may not be preserved within the interkinetic envelope. We indeed found that NPP-21<sup>TPR</sup> was absent despite the presence of NPP-7<sup>NUP153</sup>, which is both necessary and sufficient for its recruitment to NPCs during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hase and Cordes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Walther et al., 2001</xref>). While the recruitment of NPP-8<sup>NUP155</sup> and NPP-19<sup>NUP35</sup> are interdependent at NPCs, we observed NPP-19<sup>NUP35</sup> localized in the absence of NPP-8<sup>NUP155</sup> at the interkinetic envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Rodenas et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, nucleoporins essential for nuclear pore assembly (i.e., NPP-8<sup>NUP155</sup>) were even missing from the interkinetic envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Franz et al., 2005</xref>). The lack of NPCs in the interkinetic envelope is not surprising in light of their normal function in regulating transport between the physically segregated nucleoplasm and cytoplasm during interphase. The interkinetic envelope is a transient structure that only exists during the short transition period between meiosis I and II, and unlike the nuclear envelope, the interkinetic envelope never seals completely. During this stage, the condensed chromosomes are thus in contact with the cytoplasmic content, and can in theory freely exchange components.</p><p id="P25">Despite the lack of complete interkinetic envelope sealing, we nevertheless found that the structural integrity of the interkinetic envelope is functionally important. In the absence of the chromatin-binding protein BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup>, the interkinetic envelope was highly fenestrated and membrane fragments were observed between chromosomes of a given chromosomal set. This phenotype is reminiscent of the post-mitotic nuclear envelope defects, including envelope fragmentation and micronucleation, observed following BAF depletion in human tissue cultured cells and during <italic>C. elegans</italic> mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Barger et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gorjánácz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Samwer et al., 2017</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that BAF not only plays a role in recruiting LEM-domain proteins for nuclear envelope assembly, as previously thought, but is also involved in DNA cross-bridging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Samwer et al., 2017</xref>). This function is carried out by BAF on chromosomes, where it creates a mechanically rigid surface of chromatin. This rigid chromatin surface restricts nuclear membranes to the chromosome surface and effectively prevents membrane fragmentation. Whether BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> functions by promoting chromosomal cohesion, targeting LEM-domain proteins, or through a combination of both mechanisms during interkinetic envelope assembly remains unclear. However, several lines of evidence suggest that both mechanisms may be involved. First, the presence of membrane fragments within chromosomal sets in the absence of BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup>—a phenotype never observed under normal conditions—implies that BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> may be crucial for excluding membranes from the spaces between chromosomes, suggesting its role in chromosomal cohesion. Second, our finding that depleting VRK-1<sup>VRK1</sup>, the kinase that negatively regulates BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> chromatin binding, produces the same fenestrated interkinetic envelope phenotype as BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> depletion but without interchromosomal membrane fragments, shows that these two phenotypes can be functionally separated. VRK-1<sup>VRK1</sup> regulates BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> chromatin binding, which recruits LEM domain proteins, such as LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> and EMR-1<sup>Emerin</sup>, to the chromosome surface. Therefore, VRK-1<sup>VRK1</sup> and BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup> depletion have opposite effects on LEM-domain protein chromosomal localization. Our observation that both the absence and over-recruitment of LEM-2<sup>LEMD2/3</sup> is coupled to the same fenestrated interkinetic envelope phenotype could suggest that precise regulation of LEM domain protein localization is the essential factor for proper interkinetic envelope assembly. A key question is the potential function of the interkinetic envelope. While it may simply result from chromosomes remaining permanently condensed and exposed in the absence of spindle microtubules during interkinesis—allowing the transient recruitment of some inner nuclear envelope components and associated membranes—our findings suggest that the interkinetic envelope could play an active role in meiotic chromosome segregation. In the absence of BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup>, we observed fragmentation of the envelope, leading to accelerated and more extensive chromosome segregation compared to control oocytes. This suggests that the interkinetic envelope could act as a brake for meiotic chromosome segregation by mechanically constraining chromosomes and the pushing anaphase spindle. However, we believe that the observed phenotype may underestimate the true importance of the interkinetic envelope. Indeed, upon depletion of BAF-1<sup>BAF</sup>, although the interkinetic envelope becomes abnormally fenestrated, it still surrounds the surface of chromosomes, unlike the total absence of an envelope seen upon MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> depletion. A striking observation is the abnormal spreading of chromosomes within each set in the absence of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup>, suggesting that the interkinetic envelope may play a role in keeping each chromosomal set tightly clustered to prevent the mixing of PB and MII chromosomes during segregation. Unfortunately, the severe chromosome segregation defects resulting from the lack of PP1-mediated kinetochore disassembly during meiotic anaphase after MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> depletion prevented us from selectively analyzing the contribution of the interkinetic envelope to chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gomez-Saldivar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hattersley et al., 2016</xref>). In turn, the contribution of the interkinetic envelope defects in the chromosome segregation phenotype upon MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup> depletion is hard to estimate. Thus far, we have been unable to recapitulate the complete absence of an interkinetic envelope, nor the chromosome segregation defects observed in the absence of MEL-28<sup>ELYS</sup>, using other experimental perturbations. Understanding the true function of the interkinetic envelope in meiotic chromosome segregation will require further investigation.</p><p id="P26">The scarcity of research on the transient phase of meiosis has left the existence of an interkinetic envelope in oocytes of species other than <italic>C. elegans</italic> largely unknown.

Oocytes enclosed in the capillary tubes were maintained on a glass slide in a droplet of meiosis medium and recorded by video-microscopy under the spinning disc confocal microscope as described above. Once in interkinesis, 15 μL of fixative medium (1% glutaraldehyde, 2% formaldehyde in 1x PBS) was added to the 5 μL of meiosis medium containing the capillary tube.
