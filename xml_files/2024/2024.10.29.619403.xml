Visual field tests can evaluate peripheral vision but require extended focus combined with precise fixation, often very challenging for patients with severe sight loss. Functional MRI (fMRI) with population receptive field (pRF) mapping offers a non-invasive way to map scotomas but is limited by its reliance on single contrast levels and the necessity of accurate fixation.</p><p id="P2">We developed an fMRI-based approach to measure contrast sensitivity across the visual field without the need for precise fixation. By combining large-field stimulation with varying spatial frequencies and contrast levels with either pRF mapping or a retinotopic atlas based on anatomical landmarks, we modeled contrast sensitivity in the primary visual cortex (V1) over a large (40 deg) expanse of the visual field. In seven normal-sighted participants, we characterized differences in V1 cortical sensitivity across eccentricities and visual quadrants, finding reliable and reproducible patterns of sensitivity differences at individual and session levels. Additionally, our method effectively visualized cases of simulated and disease-linked sensitivity loss at the cortical level. Crucially, we demonstrated that these results could be largely recovered using a structure-based retinotopic atlas, eliminating the need for pRF mapping and precise fixation - although such an approach reduced sensitivity.</p><p id="P3">This approach, integrating large-field stimulation with a retinotopic atlas, offers a promising tool for monitoring vision loss and recovery in patients with various visual impairments, addressing a significant challenge in current clinical assessments.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>Visual Field</kwd><kwd>Contrast Sensitivity</kwd><kwd>Primary Visual cortex</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">At least 2.2 billion people world-wide experience blinding eye diseases that emerge or progress across the lifespan, with 1.1 billion living with vision loss in 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bourne et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">World Health Organization, 2019</xref>). Accurate characterization of visual function is critical for optimal intervention and patient support, but fraught with challenges. The gold clinical standard measure is visual acuity, the highest spatial resolution that can be discerned. This index mainly relies on a well-functioning fovea, the small retinal area with the highest density of photoreceptors, which processes the central 0-2 degrees around fixation. However, many forms of visual impairment do not affect the fovea alone. The vast majority of our visual input comes from peripheral vision, which provides coarse but invaluable information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alvarez, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Oliva, 2005</xref>) − nearly all daily functions critically depend on intact functionality of the wider visual field, including driving, crossing the street, social function, mobility, and even reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lange et al., 2021</xref>). Accordingly, impairment of tissue beyond the fovea and its projections drastically affects function and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Lange et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lisboa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Roh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Subhi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The impacts of impairments across the wider visual field can be measured with various types of visual field tests, ranging from the finger counting visual confrontation field test to more complicated and/or computerized tests (e.g., standard automatic perimetry, kinetic perimetry, microperimetry). Computerized tests typically involve measuring sensitivity to the luminance contrast of a target relative to a background at different visual field locations while the participant’s gaze is fixed on a central point. In some cases (e.g., microperimetry), sensitivity measurements are paired with fundus imaging, offering greater precision in linking visual field functions to specific retinal locations. These tests can provide critical additional insights into function-relevant disease evolution and recovery beyond acuity scores alone, by identifying regions of reduced light sensitivity or blind spots beyond the fovea.</p><p id="P6">However, visual field testing comes with challenges and limitations, and as a result, the inclusion of visual field measures in sight-rescuing therapy trials is limited. Firstly, it requires prolonged fixation and sustained visual attention. This can be very challenging for patients with severe vision loss, who often struggle to fixate, and strain to detect even high-intensity stimuli. This can lead to long and unpleasant testing sessions with unreliable results. Secondly, as perception is inherently subjective and effortful, patients may vary in their criteria for visual recognition, and in their ability to report visual signals that are weakened or distorted by disease.</p><p id="P7">Functional MRI (fMRI) has recently been proposed as a promising alternative to measure visual field loss, as it requires no overt task, and instead measures visual sensitivity directly from brain responses. Population receptive field (pRF) mapping fMRI can measure which parts of the cortex respond to which parts of the visual scene. This is achieved by measuring local changes in cortical blood oxygenation in response to high-contrast stimuli such as flickering checkerboards that systematically traverse the visual field. These neural timeseries are then fit with a retinotopic spatial tuning function. The fMRI signal strength in a cortical region that encodes a specific visual field location provides information about visual sensitivity in this location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dumoulin &amp; Wandell, 2008</xref>). This approach has recently been used to accurately recover blind spots in the visual field detected with visual field perimetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Pawloff et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ritter et al., 2019</xref>). These results in turn suggest that fMRI may be a useful tool to monitor disease progression and recovery in visually impaired patients.</p><p id="P8">However, there are also significant challenges associated with this pRF mapping. Because pRF models require knowledge of where visual stimuli fall on the retina, this approach requires accurate and sustained fixation. If fixation is poor, the visual field locations assigned to cortical regions will be displaced, leading to noise or bias in the pRF maps. Additionally, most fMRI studies measure vision across a small central part of the visual fields (~10 degrees of eccentricity) which will not capture critical dynamics in the periphery. Finally, most studies use a single maximum contrast stimulus to assess visual function. This is suboptimal for at least two reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Broderick et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Farahbakhsh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">O’Connell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ritter et al., 2019</xref>): First, it may reduce the ability to detect subtle but clinically important changes that do not result in complete sensitivity loss or recovery. Second, with a single contrast stimulus, it becomes more difficult to determine whether a reduction in fMRI signal across sessions or brain regions reflects vision-related changes or other factors. Together, these factors currently limit the utility of neuroimaging-based visual field tests.</p><p id="P9">In this study we sought to develop fMRI methods for measuring visual field sensitivity to address these challenges, and to test its utility in artificial and realistic cases of visual field loss. Rather than presenting a single maximum contrast eccentricity-scaled checkerboard in a pRF mapping protocol, observers viewed large-field sinusoidal gratings at a range of contrasts without strict requirement to fixate. We used a large screen set up (40° diameter) to measure visual function across a large expanse of the visual field. To quantify visual sensitivity, we fit a simple cortical contrast response model to voxel timeseries evoked by the gratings, avoiding reliance on arbitrary signal amplitude thresholds. We first tested if this approach could sensitively and reliably quantify predicted contrast sensitivity differences across eccentricity and polar angle dimensions of the entire visual field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), using a short, patient-friendly protocol in sighted controls. Critically, to achieve this we linked cortical contrast sensitivity estimates to visual field locations using retinotopic tuning estimates obtained in a separate session. However, for patients with severe vision loss it is infeasible to obtain accurate pRF measures due to poor ability to fixate a central target. We therefore also evaluated the approach using the structure-based atlas of retinotopic values developed by Benson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Benson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Benson &amp; Winawer, 2018</xref>). This atlas estimates retinotopic tuning based on the alignment of structural features of cortex (e.g., surface curvature) to a mean atlas of those features. Once a brain is aligned to the structural atlas, a similar atlas of retinotopic maps that are defined on the structural atlas are used to estimate the polar angle and eccentricity maps for the individual subject. To increase accuracy of the Benson atlas for our large-field stimuli, we subsequently fit these eccentricity estimates to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Horton and Hoyt (1991)</xref> model of cortical magnification in each individual.</p><p id="P10">We demonstrate that our approach can recover, at a cortical level, known sensitivity changes across the visual field. V1 neuronal populations encoding the central visual field show the highest sensitivity to high spatial frequencies, whilst those encoding the periphery are most sensitive to low spatial frequencies. We also find greater sensitivity in V1 regions receiving visual inputs from the horizontal compared to vertical quadrants, and from the lower compared to upper quadrants. Crucially, these effects are detectable at the individual level and repeatable across visits, suggesting our approach will be suitable for detecting visual field sensitivity changes over time (e.g., due to learning, ageing, disease progression, or recovery). Moreover, when using the Benson atlas instead of individual pRF measures to link neuronal responses to visual field locations, we still detect these effects, although with slightly reduced sensitivity. We also demonstrate the clinical relevance of this approach by recovering a simulated scotoma, characterized by a ring of visual field loss around fixation, as well as visual field loss in a patient with a neurodegenerative disorder causing large areas of visual field loss. We conclude that this approach, i.e., the combination of cortical contrast sensitivity testing, large field stimulation, and a large-field calibrated retinotopic atlas, may be particularly useful for quantifying visual recovery in patients, whether spontaneous or following gene-therapy interventions, and for linking brain-based activations to behavioral performance.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P11">We collected data from 7 healthy controls (mean±SD: 29.6±4.7yo; 1M).

Because the projector was too bright and to reduce discomfort in the scanner, a circular neutral density filter (ND4 Plus+; Urth, Byron Bay, Australia) was placed in front of the projector to reduce light intensity by 4 times without altering the colors. The projector was also gamma-corrected to ensure accurate representation of the intended contrast levels and spatial frequencies used in our experiments. In all tasks, stimuli were embedded in circular aperture of 42.3x42.3º diameter. To achieve the large field-of-view, the front part of the 64-channel MRI coil was removed, and stimuli were back-projected onto a screen positioned close to the participant’s head inside the bore (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure A1 in Appendix</xref> section). Participants viewed the stimuli through a mirror, for a total viewing distance of 34cm. Throughout the session, participants were constantly reminded to remain still to minimize head and body motion, and eye motion and alertness were monitored using an EyeLink 1000Plus device (SR Research, Ottawa, Canada).

Stimuli were then followed by 2s of a grey background (0% contrast) to minimize the experience of after-effects. Each combination of contrast level and spatial frequency was shown three times within a run, arranged in a pseudo-random sequence, for a total of 9 repetitions per combination (i.e., 3 runs). Eight additional blocks of 15-second rest periods with a grey background were introduced to allow sufficient baseline. One healthy control also performed a version of the task in which we masked a region of the visual field with a grey, annular ring, covering 3º-8º eccentricity to simulate loss of visual inputs (i.e., artificial scotoma).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Population Receptive Field (pRF) mapping</title><p id="P14">To investigate how distinct regions of the visual field map onto the cortex, we collected pRF mapping data using a standard ring-and-wedge stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dumoulin &amp; Wandell, 2008</xref>).

The following steps were followed for both the contrast sensitivity task and the pRF mapping task. First, initial correction for distortions caused by field inhomogeneity was performed using a blip-up/blip-down approach (AFNI’s unWarpEPI.py program), and the first 4 volumes of each run were discarded using FSL’s fslroi program. Then an alignment scan was created from the volume out of all collected runs that contained the least amount of voxel outliers using AFNI’s 3dToutcount, 3dTstat and 3dcalc programs. This alignment scan was then co-registered to the MPRAGE image using FreeSurfer’s bbregister program, resulting in a rigid-body transformation matrix.

Steeper slopes within this context indicate greater V1 contrast sensitivity.</p><p id="P26">We fit this model for each vertex separately, for each participant and spatial frequency (0.3 and 3cpd) condition. The intercept was constrained to be zero, as the distribution of <italic>β</italic>-values is expected to be centered on zero when the contrast is zero (i.e., when no stimulus is presented). Next, the resulting V1 slope estimates were binned and averaged over five regions using pRF eccentricity estimates: 0.5°-2.5°, 2.5°-4.5°, 4.5°-9.5°, 9.5°-15°, and 15°-20°. These bins relate to the clinical definition of visual space based on anatomical landmarks, corresponding to the fovea, parafovea, perifovea and two near-periphery regions, respectively. Similarly, slope estimates were spatially constrained within a ±45º-wedge centered on each cardinal meridian to investigate asymmetries as a function of pRF polar angle locations, thus dividing the visual space between the upper, lower, left and right quadrants. These wedges were also derived from the polar angle estimates obtained with pRF mapping.</p><p id="P27">For each participant, average slopes for each eccentricity bin and polar angle wedge were then projected back into their corresponding visual field locations. This resulted in heat-maps of V1 contrast sensitivity across eccentricities and visual field quadrants, for each tested spatial frequency condition at an individual level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).

As these factors change across the visual field, contrast sensitivity varies with spatial frequency and visual field location in the typical, healthy visual system. We first investigated whether our brain-based approach can reliably detect these known differences in contrast sensitivity as a function of eccentricities and visual field quadrants, in individual normal sighted controls. We then investigated whether our approach could recover loss of visual inputs at the cortical level, either simulated in a healthy control or pathological in a patient.

Therefore, we expect our fMRI approach to uncover these established asymmetry patterns at the cortical level.</p><p id="P38"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows how cortical contrast sensitivity in V1 varies across visual field quadrants, for the 0.3cpd and 3cpd conditions. For this analysis, we collapsed eccentricities (0.5° to 20°) into a single bin. We found a main effect of visual field quadrant location on V1 sensitivity (<italic>F</italic><sub>3,18</sub> = 20.706, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Post-hoc tests revealed that, as predicted, the cortical contrast response function had a higher slope − indicating better V1 sensitivity − along the horizontal versus vertical quadrants (Horizontal-Vertical Anisotropy − <bold>HVA:</bold> <italic>t</italic>(6) = 5.908, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and along the lower versus upper quadrant (Vertical Meridian Anisotropy − <bold>VMA:</bold> <italic>t</italic>(6) = 4.106, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006). Conversely, no difference in cortical contrast sensitivity was found between V1 neuronal populations encoding the left and right quadrants of the visual field (Left-Right Horizontal Meridian Anisotropy − <bold>LRHMA:</bold> <italic>t</italic>(6) = 0.7197, <italic>p</italic> = 0.499). Moreover, there was no interaction between spatial frequency and visual field quadrant positions (<italic>F</italic><sub>3,18</sub> = 1.339, <italic>p</italic> = 0.293), suggesting V1 visual field anisotropies are relatively constant across spatial frequencies. Importantly, all these differences are also present in individual participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, transparent lines are individual data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> shows individual visual field plots; for stats, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table A2 in Appendix</xref> section). All participants had better V1 sensitivity in the horizontal versus vertical quadrants. 6 out of 7 participants showed asymmetries between the lower and upper quadrants. Differences in V1 sensitivity between left and right quadrants were inconsistent across participants (3 participants: left&gt;right; 2 participants: right&gt;left; 2 participants: non-significant), in line with no difference at the group-level. This again demonstrates the high sensitivity of our approach for identifying and quantifying sensitivity changes across the visual field, at the individual participant level, offering a potential valuable tool for assessing and addressing visual field loss in clinical populations.</p><p id="P39">We next tested if we could recover these V1 anisotropies when using retinotopic estimates based on structural scans fit with the Benson atlas instead of pRF measures (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure A3 and Table A3-4 in Appendix</xref> section). We found that the horizontal-vertical anisotropy effect was recovered (<bold>HVA:</bold> <italic>t</italic>(6) = 3.584, <italic>p</italic> = 0.012), but that the vertical meridian anisotropy effect was not (<bold>VMA:</bold> <italic>t</italic>(6) = 0.744, <italic>p</italic> = 0.485) with this approach. These results provide evidence that our approach can still detect subtle visual field quadrant anisotropies using a structure-based retinotopic atlas, although less accurately.</p><p id="P40">While the most pronounced contrast sensitivity difference along visual field quadrants (horizontal versus vertical quadrants) was retained when the adjusted Benson atlas was used to replace pRF measurements, not all anisotropies survived. This may be because the template does not model cortical magnification differences along meridians, reducing accuracy. It is not surprising that retinotopic estimates based on structure-retinotopy relationship modeling, provides less accurate estimates of retinotopic tuning of neuron population in V1 than direct measures of the individual retinotopy. Any individual deviations from the model make it more challenging to accurately assign cortical contrast sensitivity to visual field locations, potentially decreasing the ability to detect changes in visual function across the field. Given this challenge, results with the adjusted Benson map are surprisingly similar to those based on pRF measurement, showing promise for clinical applications when pRF mapping is unfeasible.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>V1 sensitivity differences across the visual field are reproductible across visits</title><p id="P41">Having shown that changes in cortical contrast sensitivity across the visual space can be detected with fMRI, it is crucial to determine how reliable our measure is. This is especially important for potential applications in monitoring changes over time. Using Spearman correlations, we measured the reliability of cortical contrast sensitivity estimates for the 0.3cpd spatial frequency condition across two repeated measurements, collected on two different days. We collected test-retest reliability measures from 4 out of 7 participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A-B</xref>) and benchmarked them against the correlations between the 0.3cpd condition and 3cpd spatial frequency condition, collected in the same session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). If measures are reliable, correlations should be higher for repeated measures with the same spatial frequency stimulus, collected on different days.</p><p id="P42">Our findings clearly show that the gradual increase in cortical sensitivity toward the periphery for the 0.3cpd condition is consistent across the two sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, the data of individual participants show characteristic profiles that stay highly consistent. Additionally, we observed moderate-to-strong positive Spearman correlations across sessions for the 0.3cpd condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>; C2: <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.5793; C4: <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.6996; C5: <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.4059; C6: <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.7677), which were consistently higher than those across different spatial frequency conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>; C2: <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.3979; C4: <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.2386; C5: <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.1437; C6: <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.3156). This indicates that within participants, our measure is reliable across sessions and distinguishes effectively between patterns elicited by various spatial frequency conditions. Collectively, this suggests that our measure could serve as a robust tool for detecting changes in cortical sensitivity, such as those occurring over time or following therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>A test-case of simulated loss of visual inputs</title><p id="P43">In the previous sections, we showed that the slope of a square root function provides a reliable measure of contrast sensitivity in the brain of healthy controls. But can this brain-level model also quantify loss of visual inputs? To test this, we first simulated an artificial scotoma in one normal sighted participant, by masking the 3cpd stimulus with a grey annular ring between eccentricities of 3-8° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). We expect smaller slope values in V1 neuronal populations that would under normal circumstances encode that part of the visual space.</p><p id="P44">As expected, we observed reduced responses in V1 locations corresponding to the artificial scotoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), with increased responses along the edges of the mask. This artificial loss of visual input was also clearly present in the cortical contrast sensitivity estimate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6C&amp;D</xref>), with significantly reduced slope steepness between 3-8° in V1. Additionally, we could recover this scotoma using the calibrated Benson template, although less accurately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). These results show that this measure of V1 contrast sensitivity is sensitive enough to detect loss of visual inputs in the brain at an individual level, when a complete local loss of sight is simulated, and that this approach does not crucially rely on pRF mapping data from the individual. This supports the utility of our approach in recovering patterns of vision loss and recovery at a cortical level.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Case of severe central vision loss</title><p id="P45">We next tested if brain-based cortical contrast sensitivity could recover visual field loss in a clinical patient with Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON; M, 45.5 years old, mutation: m.11778G&gt;A, disease duration: 36.1 years). LHON is a neurodegenerative disease caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations, leading to acute loss of retinal ganglion cells across large visual field areas. LHON patients often present with dense, central scotoma extending up to 10-15 degrees around fixation.</p><p id="P46">As vision loss often varies between eyes, the patient underwent monocular testing for the fMRI contrast sensitivity task. For comparison, a behavioral visual field perimetry map was obtained with the Compass fundus perimeter (CenterVue, Padova, Italy) for each eye, using a 24-2 testing grid with a Goldmann size III target (54 locations: 52 from the 24-2 grid, 1 at fixation, and 1 at the physiological blind spot). The Compass actively tracks the retina to compensate for fixation loss, automatically repositioning targets based on current eye position. Sensitivity thresholds at each location were determined using the ZEST projection strategy implemented in the device. The patient, who had some preserved central vision, could see the fixation targets in behavioral testing and the scanner, making them an ideal participant for methods evaluation.</p><p id="P47">The Compass perimetry map revealed drastic loss of sensitivity across the visual field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> − top row).

Using the brain-based approach, we recovered sensitivity loss in the upper-right visual quadrant for the right eye at the cortical level, reflected in smaller cortical contrast sensitivity slopes in V1 neuronal populations encoding that area. For the left eye, cortical contrast sensitivity was also lower in the upper-left quadrant of the visual field, but differences were less pronounced. This is in line with the observation that the left eye was the better eye, with substantially less severe vision loss in the affected regions (lighter shading, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> − top row). When using the calibrated Benson atlas instead of pRF mapping data to link neuronal responses to visual locations, this pattern was retained for the right eye, but the more subtle pattern in the left eye became noisier.</p><p id="P49">By combining large-field stimulation and contrast sensitivity modeling in fMRI, with the cortical magnification-adjusted Benson atlas, these data show how brain-based measures could provide a tool to characterize vision loss in patients without need for demanding tasks or sustained precise fixation, while highlighting challenges of detecting more subtle vision loss and pinpointing it to visual locations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S21" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P50">In this study, we aimed to develop and validate an fMRI-based method for measuring cortical contrast sensitivity across the entire visual field in V1, addressing the limitations of traditional visual field tests and existing neuroimaging approaches. By integrating population receptive field (pRF) modeling with contrast sensitivity measurements of the BOLD response to large-field sinusoidal gratings varying in contrast levels and spatial frequencies, we created a quantitative, sensitive, and reliable measure of cortical contrast sensitivity. Our key findings demonstrate that this approach can accurately quantify known variations in V1 contrast sensitivity across eccentricity and polar angle, recover simulated and pathological visual field losses, and produce consistent and reliable measures both at the group and individual participant levels.</p><p id="P51">Our method successfully captured the expected variations in cortical contrast sensitivity across the visual field. Consistent with previous behavioral and fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aghajari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Broderick et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">D’Souza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Henriksson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Rovamo et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Rovamo &amp; Virsu, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Welbourne et al., 2018</xref>), we observed that V1 neuronal populations encoding the central visual field exhibited higher contrast sensitivity for high spatial frequency (SF) stimuli, while those encoding peripheral regions were more sensitive to low SF stimuli. This aligns with the understanding that spatial frequency tuning varies across the visual field due to smaller pRF sizes and larger cortical areas dedicated to central vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Himmelberg et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P52">Additionally, our study identified anisotropies in contrast sensitivity across visual field quadrants, mirroring findings from previous behavioral studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Barbot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Carrasco et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Himmelberg et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, we found enhanced cortical sensitivity in V1 neuronal populations responding to horizontal versus vertical locations and to lower versus upper visual field locations. Unlike earlier fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">O’Connell et al., 2016</xref>), which either could not assess horizontal-vertical effects or used smaller region selections, our use of large-field stimuli enabled the detection of both upper-lower and horizontal-vertical asymmetries. Moreover, by modeling cortical contrast sensitivity across multiple contrast levels, we were able to identify subtle variations in V1 neuron sensitivity that single-threshold approaches might overlook.</p><p id="P53">Crucially, these effects were significant at the individual level indicating high sensitivity, and our approach proved reliable over time. We found consistent activation patterns and moderate-to-high correlations in slope estimates for the 0.3cpd condition across two separate sessions, significantly higher than when correlating responses to different stimuli (i.e., 3cpd condition). High sensitivity and reliability are essential for detecting longitudinal changes in clinical groups, such as those occurring before and after sight-rescuing interventions. Fitting a contrast response function to the BOLD signal might offer robust estimates of visual function by minimizing the impacts of overall BOLD amplitude variability and arbitrary thresholds.</p><p id="P54">Furthermore, our method successfully identified both simulated retinal loss in a healthy volunteer and real visual field loss in a patient with Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON). Unlike previous fMRI studies that used high-contrast stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Farahbakhsh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Pawloff et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ritter et al., 2019</xref>) − which may not accurately represent partial vision loss due to potential saturation and the stimulation of less sensitive retinal cells − our use of multiple contrast levels offers a more nuanced assessment of cortical contrast sensitivity. This may make our method particularly suitable for evaluating treatment efficacy in cases of widespread and variable vision loss.</p><p id="P55">One limitation of this brain-based approach to visual field testing, is its reliance on pRF mapping, which requires precise fixation and can be challenging to acquire in visually impaired patients. To mitigate this, we investigated the use of retinotopic templates based on anatomical landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Benson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Benson &amp; Winawer, 2018</xref>), thereby reducing the need for pRF data collection and facilitating the mapping of brain responses to visual field positions. Particularly at large eccentricities where, due to smaller cortical projection areas, small inaccuracies between the template and individual retinotopy can lead to large distortions in cortical visual field maps. To increase accuracy of the atlas at higher eccentricities, we adjusted the Benson eccentricity estimates to align with the cortical magnification scaling function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Horton &amp; Hoyt, 1991</xref>). With this structure-based atlas we successfully replicated key variations in visual field function, although with reduced sensitivity compared to individual pRF measures for more subtle differences (i.e., for the less consistent upper versus lower quadrant anisotropy, and the patient’s eye less affected by pathology). It is notable that cortical structure-based templates can successfully recover visual field loss. Critically, in patient groups with severe impairment such as LHON, where it is often very challenging or impossible to obtain reliable measures, even imperfect mapping between the brain and visual field could offer important improvements over available solutions for tracking functional change, and where they stem from. Further enhancing the alignment between retinotopic template atlases and individual retinotopic tuning - for example, by integrating them with functional measures using Bayesian methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Benson &amp; Winawer, 2018</xref>) - could improve this approach further.</p><p id="P56">While our method demonstrated high accuracy and reliability in sighted controls, further validation in patients is necessary to ensure the generalizability of our approach to measuring pathology. Next steps in this work will therefore include reconstructing diverse types of vision loss in larger patient cohorts, validating our approach for tracking pathology over time, and investigating how cortex-based visual field measures relate to and complement other visual field integrity indices such as the Compass in those contexts. Comparison of the cortical contrast sensitivity modeling approach presented here to other approaches will be another interesting direction for future research. For example, while we reasoned that using a single high contrast stimulus is likely to give less reliable measures for various reasons outlined above, this needs to be tested empirically. It is also unclear whether the square root contrast response function is optimal for patients, who are likely to show different non-linearities in their contrast response. Additionally, more extensive mapping of the spatial frequency and contrast sensitivity spaces could offer additional informative measures such as cortical acuity and spatial frequency preferences, provided such measures are feasible with patient-friendly protocols.</p><p id="P57">In sum, brain-based contrast sensitivity measures could significantly enhance the accurate characterization of visual field function in blinding diseases, by addressing limitations of traditional visual field tests that are subjective, time-consuming, and challenging for patients with severe sight loss. By providing a reliable, quantitative measure of cortical contrast sensitivity across the visual field, fMRI may help facilitate the monitoring of disease progression and recovery, including interventions like gene therapy. Combined with our large-field stimulation setup and fixation free approaches to linking cortical sensitivity estimates to visual field locations, this method is well-suited for a wide range of visual impairments, addressing a pressing challenge in the evaluation of current clinical trials. Additionally, linking brain-based variations in function across the visual field to behavioral performance, could help bridge the gap between neural measures and functional outcomes, offering deeper insights into developmental, learning, and vision loss mechanisms.</p><p id="P58">In conclusion, integrating cortical contrast sensitivity testing with large-field stimulation and a calibrated retinotopic atlas provides a promising tool for characterizing visual field impairments, and could offer a valuable addition to existing measures of visual field loss.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Appendix</label><media xlink:href="EMS199756-supplement-Appendix.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d77aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by Moorfields Eye Charity PhD Studentship GR001315 (London, UK), and the Birkbeck-UCL Centre for NeuroImaging (BUCNI; London, UK).
