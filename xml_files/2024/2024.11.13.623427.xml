These life limiting and life shortening diseases have the largest economic burden per patient of any rare disease with the majority being orphan diseases with no disease modifying therapy. Whilst there is significant development in the area of gene therapies for LSDs, these can only be used to treat individual diseases, are expensive, and in recent times many companies have abandoned their gene therapy pipelines. Small molecules on the other hand can be developed to target common mechanisms of pathogenesis or common central disease phenotypes providing therapies that can treat multiple diseases. In this study we report acid ceramidase as a novel therapeutic target for treating Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease. Using siRNA, and the literature tool compound carmofur, we observed a reduction in lysosomal area and reduced accumulation of the lipids cholesterol and LBPA in an NPC cellular model. These lipids are known to accumulate as secondary storage molecules across many lysosomal diseases, particularly primary sphingolipid storage disorders where lyso-sphingolipids are known to accumulate via the action of acid ceramidase. As acid ceramidase has also been shown to be a therapeutic target for Krabbe disease, our findings indicate that this is a novel target for the potential treatment of multiple LSDs with primary or secondary storage of sphingolipids.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Niemann-Pick C (NPC) disease is a rare autosomal recessive inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in one of either of two genes <italic>NPC1</italic> or <italic>NPC2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup></italic>. These genes encode proteins of the same name that are involved in lysosomal cholesterol and lipid homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. NPC1 is a 13 transmembrane domain protein of the lysosomal limiting membrane whilst NPC2 is a soluble intralysosomal cholesterol shuttle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Impairment in NPC1 or NPC2 function result in classical cellular hallmarks of intralysosomal storage of free unesterified cholesterol, sphingosine, sphingomyelin, lyso(bis)phosphatidic acid (LBPA) and glycosphingolipids (GSL) that occur in all NPC patient tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Lipid storage is a direct consequence of loss of NPC1 or NPC2 function but is exacerbated by abnormalities in endocytosis, lipid trafficking and lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Amongst the lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), NPC is unique as it is the only one where the simple sphingoid base sphingosine has been shown to significantly accumulate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Sphingosine is generated by desaturation of sphinganine during the formation of ceramide and is released within lysosomes by the action of acid ceramidase which catalyses the removal of the fatty acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Whilst the primary function of acid ceramidase is to cleave ceramide into sphingosine, the enzyme is also known to act on glycosphingolipids in other LSDs, presumably owing to their abundance within lysosomes of these cells, and to generate the so called lyso-glycosphingolipids (lyso-GSL), such as glucosylsphingosine and lyso-GB3 in Gaucher disease and Fabry disease respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Sphingosine and lyso-GSLs are extremely potent and potentially toxic molecules that if not regulated correctly can have significantly detrimental properties to the cell. Sphingosine, and other sphingoid bases including lyso-GSLs, have been known to modulate protein kinase C signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, ion channel signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and growth factor signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, they are implicated in numerous human pathologies including diabetes, neuropathy, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Despite this significant involvement in human pathologies there are very few therapeutic molecules that exist that are able to regulate the levels or activity of acid ceramidase to alter sphingosine or lyso-GSL levels.</p><p id="P4">Genetic proof of concept that acid ceramidase is a viable therapeutic target has been demonstrated previously in Krabbe mice crossed with mice null for the acid ceramidase gene <italic>ASAH1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</italic> Psychosine levels were returned to near normal with improvements seen in myelination, tremor, organ weight and motor function and an almost 50% increase in lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Further evidence of benefit was provided using the small molecule acid ceramidase inhibitor carmofur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Together these data provide evidence to support the concept that the lyso-GSL ‘psychosine’ (galactosylsphingosine), rather than the parental molecule galactosylceramide, which accumulates due to the genetic defect in lysosomal galactosylceramidase activity in Krabbe disease, is the primary cause of pathogenesis, confirming the so-called ‘psychosine hypothesis’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Whilst this has also been hypothesised for other LSDs, it is the understanding of these authors that only for Krabbe disease does evidence exist that inhibition of acid ceramidase activity leads to functional improvements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Reduction in total sphingolipid content using the serine palmitoyltransferase inhibitor myriocin has been shown in the past to be beneficial in terms of restoring lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in NPC disease human fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. However, this cannot be solely attributed to a reduction in sphingosine as total GSL would also be reduced, which is the mechanism of action of one of the few approved therapies for NPC disease, miglustat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. We therefore chose to test the impact of acid ceramidase inhibition on NPC cellular models to confirm whether reduction in lysosomal sphingosine is indeed responsible for improvement in NPC disease phenotypes, and to gauge the potential utility of this novel therapeutic strategy in LSDs where sphingolipids are typically considered as being secondary storage material.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cells</title><p id="P5">The glial cell line, prepared from the spontaneously occurring <italic>Npc1<sup>m1N</sup></italic> wild-type (<italic>Npc1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) and null (<italic>Npc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) BALB/c mouse, has been described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.

Following treatment of <italic>Npc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> glia with carmofur there is a clear and significant reduction at 30nM in lysosomal expansion (33% reduction) and lipid storage (LBPA and filipin back to wild-type levels). However, at 300nM only filipin is reduced and at 3μM, whilst there is no difference in any of the lipid phenotypes compared to the untreated control, we did observe a statistically significant increase in lysosomal expansion with LAMP1.</p><p id="P9">To confirm that the beneficial effects at the lower concentration of carmofur are due to reduction in acid ceramidase activity, rather than an off-target effect of carmofur, we treated <italic>Npc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> glia with <italic>Asah1</italic> siRNA for 72h to reduce acid ceramidase levels and activity. As can be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), whilst the negative control and lower siRNA concentration of 5nM have almost no effect on lysosomal expansion or lipid accumulation, the higher concentration of 50nM <italic>Asah1</italic> siRNA did lead to reductions in all phenotypes.

Our findings provide both genetic and small molecule proof of concept that reducing acid ceramidase expression or inhibiting function can improve multiple phenotypes associated with the disease. Encouragingly, phenotypes including cholesterol storage, secondary lipid storage and lysosomal expansion were improved.</p><p id="P11">Furthermore, our data suggests that the beneficial effects observed previously with a 48h treatment of the serine palmitoyltransferase inhibitor myriocin in NPC patient fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> are most likely due to a reduction in sphingosine rather than GSLs as the levels of these complex lipids are not modulated by carmofur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Miglustat is the current standard of care for NPC and it is well documented that it takes 3-5 days for any beneficial effect of this drug to be seen in NPC cellular models, indicative of the longer turnover times for GSL storage within lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Inhibition of acid ceramidase therefore provides a more rapid <italic>in vitro</italic> rescue of NPC lysosomal storage than miglustat, corresponding with the important role of sphingosine in the pathogenesis of NPC disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> as, in comparison to carmofur, miglustat is unlikely to have any effect on lysosomal sphingosine storage.</p><p id="P12">Miglustat is a small molecule substrate reduction therapy that has been used in most territories worldwide as a disease modifying therapy for NPC disease for &gt;15 years and most recently it has been approved for use in combination with arimoclomol in the US. Despite a clear benefit of miglustat on most NPC patients, leading to significant delay in disease onset, improved function and longer life expectancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, it is well known that miglustat has no impact on lysosomal cholesterol levels in NPC cellular models or mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. What impact this may have on the overall efficacy of miglustat in terms of improving NPC disease outcomes is unknown, as no therapy that has been shown to reduce lysosomal cholesterol in NPC disease models has yet translated into clinical efficacy. Our data indicate that inhibition of acid ceramidase, or reduction in expression, can reduce cholesterol accumulation in NPC cells, suggesting that this may be an improved therapeutic strategy in comparison to inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase and could lead to further therapeutic benefit for patients, particularly in combination with miglustat.</p><p id="P13">Finally, the presence of lyso-GSL storage across the majority of primary sphingolipidoses suggests that acid ceramidase could be a target for treating multiple LSDs. In addition to our data here, carmofur has been shown to be beneficial for treating Krabbe disease where it reduces storage of psychosine in the mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. However, carmofur has numerous off target effects, it is a chemotherapy used in Japan to treat bowel cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and is not an appropriate molecule to treat LSDs. Therefore, the development of a potent, titratable and selective acid ceramidase inhibitor, which is under development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, could be a novel pan-LSD therapeutic.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S8"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The study was supported by Springboard award funding (SBF005/1129)
