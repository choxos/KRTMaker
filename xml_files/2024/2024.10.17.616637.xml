Here, we present STRAIGHT-IN Dual, which enables simultaneous, allele-specific, single-copy integration of two DNA payloads with 100% efficiency within one week. Notably, STRAIGHT-IN Dual leverages the STRAIGHT-IN platform to allow near-scarless cargo integration, facilitating the recycling of components for subsequent cellular modifications. Using STRAIGHT-IN Dual, we investigated how promoter choice and gene syntax influences transgene silencing, and demonstrate the impact of these design features on forward programming of hiPSCs into neurons. Furthermore, we designed a grazoprevir-inducible synZiFTR system to complement the widely-used tetracycline-inducible system, providing independent, tunable, and temporally controlled expression of both transcription factors and functional reporters. The unprecedented efficiency and speed with which STRAIGHT-IN Dual generates homogenous genetically engineered hiPSC populations represents a major advancement for synthetic biology in stem cell applications and opens opportunities for precision cell engineering.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The efficient and rapid targeted insertion of DNA payloads, such as genetic circuits, into the genome of mammalian cells remains a significant challenge. From fundamental research to <italic>in vivo</italic> applications and gene or cell therapy studies, targeted integration approaches have been pivotal for tasks such as establishing functional reporters and biosensors, inserting or correcting diseasecausing DNA variants, generating humanized mouse models, and programming cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Balmas et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Blanch-Asensio et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Brandão et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hosur et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Low et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Pawlowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">M. Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Recently, several platforms leveraging CRISPR/Cas technology, site-specific recombinases (SSRs) or a combination of both, have been developed to facilitate these processes. For example, prime editing combined with Bxb1 recombinase can mediate inversions of genomic regions up to 40 kb, and the insertion of DNA cargoes up to 36 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Anzalone et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Pandey et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Yarnall et al., 2023</xref>). However, CRISPR/Cas approaches often suffer from off-target effects and highly variable targeting efficiencies, necessitating the screening of numerous clones.</p><p id="P4">SSR-based methods offer an alternative approach, though require the pre-establishment of an acceptor cell line harboring a landing pad (LP) cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Duportet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). However, once this is established, serine and tyrosine recombinases can mediate facile integration of large DNA payloads, with several studies reporting successful integration of fragments &gt;100 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Blanch-Asensio et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brosh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Mitchell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pinglay et al., 2022</xref>). These methods often use positive and/or negative selection markers in the LP cassette or donor plasmids which can yield nearly homogenous cell populations with single copy integrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Blanch-Asensio et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, some approaches also allow the removal of auxiliary elements, such as fluorescent reporters or selection markers associated with the LP and the donor plasmid backbone, resulting in markerless and near scarless integration of the DNA payload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Blanch-Asensio et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Brosh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">J. Li et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, several novel SSRs have been reported that enable DNA integration with efficiencies comparable to or exceeding established serine and tyrosine recombinases such as Bxb1 and Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Durrant et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Jelicic et al., 2023</xref>). However, Bxb1 remains a preferred recombinase due to its relatively high integration efficiency (up to 30%), ability to integrate large constructs, and the absence of pseudo-<italic>attP</italic> and <italic>attB</italic> recognition sequences in the human genome, thereby minimizing off-target events.</p><p id="P5">Bxb1 mediates the irreversible recombination of <italic>attP</italic> and <italic>attB</italic> sites, generating <italic>attR</italic> and <italic>attL</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Brown et al., 2011</xref>). For genome engineering applications, the genomically-integrated LP cassette typically contains the <italic>attP</italic> site while the donor plasmid carries the <italic>attB</italic> site, as this combination was shown to reduce off-target integrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Pandey et al., 2024</xref>). Through mechanistic studies of Bxb1-mediated recombination, orthogonal Bxb1 <italic>attP</italic>/<italic>attB</italic> mutant sites have been engineered by altering the traditionally used central “GT” dinucleotide sequence to a “GA” dinucleotide sequence which displays similar or higher integration efficiencies with minimal crossover between both recombination sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jusiak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Roelle et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P6">While potent compared with existing methods, one limitation of most Bxb1-based LPs is their inability to integrate multiple payloads at different locations in the human genome. Although some platforms can integrate two DNA payloads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Rosenstein et al., 2024</xref>), most lack allele-specific targeting which is required for uniform integration of both payloads. Alternative integration approaches, such as cassette exchange methods that rely on two recombination sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Matreyek et al., 2017</xref>), are relatively inefficient. In previous work, we developed a dual acceptor line in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that uses both Bxb1 and ɸC31 recombinases for orthogonal integration of two donor plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Blanch-Asensio et al., 2022</xref>). However, the integration efficiency of ɸC31 was much lower than that of Bxb1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Blanch-Asensio et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the Bxb1 LP utilized blasticidin S deaminase (<italic>BsdR</italic>) for positive selection, but enrichment was modest, resulting in heterogenous populations of unedited acceptor hiPSCs and cells with the integrated donor plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Blanch-Asensio et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To address these challenges, we developed STRAIGHT-IN Dual, a hiPSC acceptor line containing two orthogonal Bxb1-recognised LPs. This system enables the rapid, simultaneous, site-specific, markerless, and near-scarless integration of two independent payloads using a single recombinase (Bxb1), with 100% of the resulting hiPSCs containing both payloads. Using our system we investigated transgene silencing ,and could compare designs as well as control for the effects of the locus and adjacent transgene. Based on biophysical models of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Johnstone &amp; Galloway, 2022</xref>), we explored how gene syntax (i.e., the relative order and orientation of genes) impacts expression from the widely-used doxycycline-inducible all-in-one Tet-On 3G system. We observed significant differences between the four syntaxes; convergent, divergent, downstream tandem and upstream tandem, with two syntaxes identified as optimal for gene coupling in the Tet-On 3G system and the forward programming of hiPSCs to neurons. Our finding has broad implications for the design of transgenic systems and applications in research areas such as cancer biology, developmental biology, and synthetic biology.</p><p id="P8">Lastly, we characterized a grazoprevir-inducible system based on synZiFTRs in hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">H.-S. Li et al., 2022</xref>). As an orthogonal small-molecule inducible system, the grazoprevir-inducible system can be combined with the Tet-On 3G system for precise and independent control of dual transgenic payloads. We demonstrate independent control of lineage-specifying transcription factors and genetically-encoded functional reporters, facilitating both forward reprogramming of hiPSCs and real-time functional recordings at desired timepoints. Taken together, STRAIGHT-IN Dual expands the potential to explore biological questions using hiPSCs, by providing a platform to readily harness the power of state-of-the-art transgenic tools.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Bxb1 mediates allele-specific integration of two DNA payloads in <italic>CLYBL</italic></title><p id="P9">Building upon our previously developed STRAIGHT-IN acceptor hiPSC line that contained a single LP in one allele of <italic>CLYBL</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Blanch-Asensio et al., 2023</xref>), we targeted the unedited <italic>CLYBL</italic> allele to establish a dual STRAIGHT-IN acceptor hiPSC line. The original STRAIGHT-IN LP line (LU99_<italic>CLYBL</italic>-bxb-v2) contains a bxb1-GT <italic>attP</italic> site for allele-specific targeting with GT donor plasmids, as well as an excisable fluorescent reporter (<italic>EBFP2</italic>) driven by the PGK promoter and a selection cassette (<italic>BleoR</italic>) designed as a promoter trap due to the lack of an ATG initiation codon and promoter sequence. The 5’ and 3’ ends of the LP are flanked by two heterospecific <italic>loxP</italic> and <italic>lox257</italic> sites, enabling Cre recombinase (Cre) to excise the auxiliary sequences both 5’ and 3’ of the payload following integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Using TALENs, we targeted a novel LP containing a bxb1-GA <italic>attP</italic> site into the unedited <italic>CLYBL</italic> allele, thereby permitting allele-specific targeting with GA donor plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). This bxb1-GA LP also includes a distinct fluorescent reporter (<italic>mScarlet</italic>), selection cassette (<italic>PuroR</italic>) and heterospecific <italic>FRT</italic> and <italic>F3</italic> sites recognized by Flp recombinase. We characterized one of the resulting hiPSC clones (STRAIGHT-IN Dual) expressing mScarlet by genotyping PCR, ddPCR and Sanger sequencing, confirming a single copy of the novel LP in the previously unedited <italic>CLYBL</italic> allele with no mutations in the recombination sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b, 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>). Additionally, the genomic integrity and normal karyotypic status of the hiPSC line was confirmed by ddPCR and G-band karyotyping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1b, 1C</xref>). The hiPSC clone also expressed pluripotency markers and could differentiate into all three germ layers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1d, 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Next, we designed donor plasmids containing either <italic>attB</italic>-GT or <italic>attB</italic>-GA recombination sites. In the presence of Bxb1, these donor plasmids specifically integrate into their cognate LPs – <italic>attB</italic>-GT into the <italic>attP</italic>-GT allele and <italic>attB</italic>-GA into the <italic>attP</italic>-GA allele – allowing precise allele-specific cargo integrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Each donor plasmid contains the hEF1a promoter sequence and an ATG initiation codon that completes the promoter trap upon integration and leads to the expression of the respective selection markers (BleoR for the GT allele, PuroR for the GA allele), conferring resistance to either zeocin or puromycin.</p><p id="P12">We evaluated the integration efficiency of the GT and GA donor plasmids into their respective LPs using ddPCR, observing comparable levels for both alleles (1.09% ± 0.21 for GT, 1.10% ± 0.02 for GA) before selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d, 1e</xref>). Remarkably, antibiotic selection resulted in almost 100% enrichment of hiPSCs containing either the GT or GA donor plasmids (95.52% ± 1.87 for GT, 99.06% ± 0.08 for GA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d, 1e</xref>). To confirm allele specificity, we separately integrated the GT and GA donor plasmids. We hypothesized that if the GT donor plasmid incorrectly integrated into the <italic>attP</italic>-GA LP, cells would become puromycin-resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). Conversely, if the GA donor plasmid integrated into the <italic>attP</italic>-GT LP, cells would become zeocin-resistant. Antibiotic selection for incorrect integration resulted in complete cell death, confirming the orthogonality of the alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). Additionally, co-transfection of both donor plasmids and a Bxb1 expression plasmid, followed by dual antibiotic selection, resulted in &gt;93.9% of the hiPSCs containing both integrated payloads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">2b</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To further validate allele orthogonality, we cloned green and red fluorescent payloads (<italic>TurboGFP</italic> and <italic>mScarlet-I</italic>, respectively) into both GT and GA donor plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>). Additionally, <italic>TurboGFP</italic> was tagged with a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and <italic>mScarlet</italic>-I with an actin-targeting signal to distinguish between the two payloads in individual cells. As expected, co-transfection of the fluorescent payloads targeting the same LP (either <italic>attP</italic>-GT or <italic>attP</italic>-GA) resulted in cells expressing either green or red fluorescence, but not both.</p><p id="P14">However, co-transfection of <italic>TurboGFP</italic>-GT and <italic>mScarlet-I</italic>-GA donor plasmids resulted in hiPSCs expressing both fluorescent reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>). Furthermore, integrating the same fluorescent reporter into both LPs resulted in an ~2-fold increase in fluorescence signal, suggesting transgene expression levels are similar from both <italic>CLYBL</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Accelerating and simplifying the STRAIGHT-IN Dual protocol improves cell line generation</title><p id="P15">To streamline the generation of uniform, genetically modified hiPSCs, we optimized the STRAIGHT-IN integration process to improve efficiency, increase cell yield, and shorten the timeline required to subsequently perform downstream experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). We hypothesized that the lower cytotoxicity and higher transgene expression typically observed with modRNA delivery compared to plasmid DNA transfection in hiPSCs, could improve integration efficiency. Transfecting modRNA encoding Bxb1 resulted in a moderate increase in integration efficiency (~2-fold) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Next, we explored whether cytoprotective factors like p53DD could enhance the number of cells surviving post-genome modification, as has been observed for CRISPR-based genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Haideri et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">2024</xref>). Co-transfection of <italic>p53DD</italic> modRNA increased the fraction of cells with an integrated cargo by 12.4-fold compared to a control <italic>mGreenLantern</italic> modRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2e</xref>). We also examined four Bxb1 mutants (evoBxb1, Bxb1-V74A; eeBxb1, Bxb1-V74A + E229K + V375I; Bxb1-I87L; and Bxb1-I87L + A369P + E434G), which were reported to exhibit higher recombination activity than wild-type Bxb1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hew et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Pandey et al., 2024</xref>). Co-transfection of modRNAs encoding these Bxb1 variants with <italic>p53DD</italic> modRNA revealed that eeBxb1, in combination with p53DD, significantly increased pre-selection integration efficiency from 2.75% to 9.12% at the GT allele, and from 1.46% to 11.7% at the GA-allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). Other Bxb1 variants did not show significant improvements, although co-transfection of <italic>p53DD</italic> modRNA consistently boosted integration efficiencies across all experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2f</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To expedite enrichment using zeocin or puromycin, we utilized modRNA for faster Bxb1 expression compared to plasmid DNA. This reduced the time required to obtain uniform, payload-carrying hiPSCs to less than one week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). Notably, the addition of <italic>p53DD</italic> modRNA yielded hiPSC colonies with both GT and GA donor plasmids integrated after just 3 days of antibiotic selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2g</xref>). ddPCR analysis confirmed single-copy integrations of the GT and GA donor plasmids, with no evidence of random integration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2h</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The tyrosine recombinases, Cre and Flp, mediate the excision of the auxiliary elements following integration, resulting in a hiPSC line containing just the DNA payload and often improving the expression of the integrated transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Blanch-Asensio et al., 2022</xref>). We sought to improve excision efficiency by testing DNA-free delivery methods for Cre and Flp using modRNA or recombinant protein, replacing traditional plasmid-based approaches. Although plasmid transfections can result in high excision efficiencies via enrichment, the selection often results in few clones surviving, leading to clonal bottlenecks and prolonged waiting times for clonal expansion.</p><p id="P19">For the GT allele, Cre protein achieved excision rates of 91.9% and 80.7% of the <italic>loxP</italic> and <italic>lox257</italic> flanked sequences, respectively, with a second Cre administration increasing this to 97.6% and 93.7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g</xref>). Since Flp protein is unavailable, we used <italic>Flp</italic> modRNA for excision at the GA allele. After one round of transfection, 61.5% and 54.8% of the hiPSCs had excised the <italic>FRT</italic> and <italic>F3</italic> flanked sequences, respectively, with a second transfection increasing this to 87.8% and 76.3% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2i</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). Codelivery of Cre protein and <italic>Flp</italic> modRNA resulted in 83.6% of hiPSCs excising all flanked auxiliary sequences after two transfection rounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2i</xref>, <italic>right</italic>).</p><p id="P20">We hypothesized that including selection during the excision process could improve efficiency as seen for integration, and potentially result in 100% of the hiPSCs excising the auxiliary sequences after a single transfection. As a proof of concept, we integrated a donor plasmid into the GA allele, conferring puromycin resistance but keeping the cells zeocin sensitive. Transfecting a modRNA encoding both Flp and BleoR (<italic>Flp-2A-BleoR</italic>), followed by zeocin selection, resulted in nearly complete excision of both upstream and downstream auxiliary elements within 3 days with excision rates of 99.3% and 97.2%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). Unfortunately, this strategy could not be replicated with Cre for donor plasmids integrated at the GT allele, as puromycin selection following <italic>Cre-2A-PuroR</italic> or <italic>Cre-IRES-PuroR</italic> modRNA transfection failed to yield puromycin-resistant hiPSCs (data not shown). Co-transfection of <italic>Cre</italic> and <italic>PuroR</italic> modRNAs resulted in limited excision enrichment, with efficiencies only increasing from 25.7% to 44.3% for <italic>loxP</italic> and from 22.5% to 41.7% for <italic>lox257</italic> flanked sequences, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2j</xref>).</p><p id="P21">Finally, to further streamline the workflow and eliminate the need to passage the cells, we completed the entire STRAIGHT-IN protocol – from donor plasmid integration to auxiliary element excision – within the same well. For this, we co-transfected <italic>eeBxb1</italic> and <italic>p53DD</italic> modRNA with a bxb1-GA donor plasmid containing <italic>EGFP</italic>, applied puromycin selection, followed by <italic>Flp-2A-BleoR</italic> modRNA transfection, and zeocin selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2i</xref>). Within 9 days and in a single well, we achieved near uniform EGFP expression in the hiPSCs, with all auxiliary elements excised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2j,k</xref>), demonstrating &gt;98% precision, markerless, and near-scarless single-copy genome integration.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The hEF1a promoter is silenced over time in hiPSCs</title><p id="P22">Transgenes have revolutionized our ability to measure cellular processes and control cell behavior and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Peterman et al., 2024</xref>). However, genome-integrated transgenes are prone to silencing, particularly in hiPSCs, and even more so upon differentiation.

As expected, all puromycin-resistant hiPSC colonies uniformly expressed mRuby2. However, despite uniform integration of the hEF1a- <italic>mGreenLantern</italic> cassette, only a fraction of colonies expressed this reporter, indicating transgene silencing. This silencing became more pronounced with additional passaging of the hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P24">To determine whether this effect was specific to <italic>mGreenLantern</italic>, we replaced it with <italic>mStayGold</italic>, the brightest monomeric GFP currently available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">H.

As expected, swapping the promoters resulted in strong expression of CAG-driven mStayGold, while hEF1a-driven mRuby2 was silenced, further confirming the susceptibility of the hEF1a promoter to silencing in hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P25">In our STRAIGHT-IN system, the hEF1a promoter drives <italic>PuroR</italic> expression in hiPSCs that have integrated the GA donor plasmid. We hypothesized that promoter silencing could be limiting the number of colonies recovered after puromycin selection. To test this, we replaced the hEF1a promoter in the GA donor plasmid with the CAG promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). After puromycin selection, we observed ~50% more puromycin-resistant colonies with the CAG-containing bxb1-GA donor plasmid, suggesting that silencing and/or insufficient expression of the selection cassette when under the control of the hEF1a promoter was reducing colony yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Gene syntax determines induction efficiency in the Tet-On 3G system in hiPSCs</title><p id="P26">In addition to promoter selection, the relative arrangement of transcriptional units, often referred to as gene syntax, can influence the expression of adjacent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Engreitz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Johnstone &amp; Galloway, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Patel et al., 2023</xref>). While placing different elements of genetic circuits, such as inducible systems, at separate genomic loci may prevent suboptimal interactions between genes, integration at separate sites also requires integrating additional genetic cargo. To systematically compare how different designs of multi-component genetic circuits perform, we used STRAIGHT-IN Dual to elucidate key design principles, focusing on the Tet-On 3G system and examining trade-offs between co-localized and dual locus integration.</p><p id="P27">We first constructed a <italic>trans</italic> design of the Tet-On 3G system, with the transcriptional units integrated into the separate <italic>CLYBL</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). The inducible gene (<italic>mScarlet</italic>) was driven by a tetracycline response element (TRE) containing seven tetracycline operator (<italic>TetO</italic>) repeats. Having determined the CAG promoter resists silencing in hiPSCs, we used this promoter to drive expression of the transactivator gene <italic>rtTA</italic> in a bicistronic cassette which also expressed a nuclear-localized blue fluorescent reporter (<italic>mTagBFP2-NLS</italic>) as a proxy readout for rtTA levels.</p><p id="P28">We also generated <italic>cis</italic> designs of the Tet-On 3G system, where both the constitutive (<italic>rtTA-2A-mTagBFP2-NLS</italic>) and inducible (<italic>mScarlet</italic>) transcriptional units were integrated into the same allele. This allowed us to investigate how gene syntax, specifically the relative orientation and order of the transcriptional units, affects induction. We created four possible syntaxes: convergent, divergent, downstream tandem and upstream tandem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>). As the auxiliary sequences remaining in the GA allele could confound potential interactions between the constitutive and inducible genes, we examined mTagBFP2 and mScarlet expression both before (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>) and after excision of the sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p id="P29">In the <italic>trans</italic> configuration, induced mScarlet expression was weak, whereas several <italic>cis</italic> designs showed robust induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>), suggesting that spatial proximity between the constitutive and inducible genes improves expression in the Tet-On 3G system. Notably, <italic>mTagBFP2</italic> expression levels remained unchanged in the <italic>trans</italic> configuration, indicating that resource burden was not a limiting factor in induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c,d</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Prior to induction, we observed clear bimodality in mTagBFP2 expression for the convergent syntax, which was most pronounced in unexcised cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3c</xref>), and aligned with biophysical models of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Johnstone &amp; Galloway, 2022</xref>). In contrast, the other syntaxes exhibited unimodal mTagBFP2 expression, which remained stable upon induction with doxycycline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3c</xref>). Interestingly, in preexcised cells, induction resulted in slight repression of mTagBFP2 across all syntaxes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3d</xref>). However, after excision, syntax-specific differences in mTagBFP2 expression emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c,d</xref>). Most notably, the downstream tandem syntax exhibited an ~5-fold reduction in mTagBFP2 expression, while the convergent syntax showed no significant change. The divergent and upstream tandem syntaxes showed increased mTagBFP2 expression, in line with biophysical model predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c,d</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Upon induction with doxycycline, striking syntaxspecific differences also emerged in mScarlet expression. Although these differences became more pronounced after excision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b-d</xref>), similar trends were observed before excision (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3e,f</xref>). The divergent and downstream tandem syntaxes resulted in strong mScarlet induction, while the convergent and upstream tandem syntaxes showed poorer induction. Characterized by weak, bimodal, or broad expression distribution. Interestingly, excision significantly improved induction for the convergent syntax, possibly due to the increased expression of mTagBFP2 and therefore rtTA. However, excision did not improve induction for the upstream tandem syntax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c,d</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Given the robust mScarlet induction observed in the downstream tandem <italic>cis</italic> design, we further explored its utility in 3D stem cell-derived structures such as cardiac organoids (i.e., cardioids), which provide more complex cellular environments for disease modeling and developmental studies. We found that mScarlet expression could be modestly adjusted by varying doxycycline concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>). Additionally, altering the duration of doxycycline treatment modulated mScarlet expression, with longer inductions leading to higher expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f</xref>). Remarkably, even in developed cardioids, robust mScarlet expression could be achieved when adding doxycycline from day 7, demonstrating the potential to dynamically modulate gene dosage also in 3D organoids.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Dual inducible systems for forward programming and functional monitoring in hiPSCs</title><p id="P33">Forward programming drives hiPSCs into specific cell identities by overexpressing transcription factors. Potentially, suboptimal gene syntax may limit sufficient expression of the transcription factor. Thus, poor syntax may inhibit forward programming and fail to induce the new cell fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). Given the striking differences we observed between the two tandem orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>), we investigated whether the gene syntax influenced forward programming outcomes when overexpressing <italic>Ngn2,</italic> a pioneering transcription factor for neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Y. Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). To evaluate this, we constructed Tet-On 3G all-in-one systems for regulating Ngn2 expression using either the downstream or upstream tandem syntaxes.</p><p id="P34">Induction of <italic>Ngn2</italic> from the downstream tandem syntax led to the rapid generation of TUJ1+ and MAP2+ hiPSC-derived neurons within 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>). In contrast, almost no neurons were generated using the upstream tandem orientation syntax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). Based on our previous observation of poor <italic>mScarlet</italic> expression in the upstream tandem configuration, we hypothesize that limited Ngn2 expression in this orientation impairs forward programming. Indeed, qPCR analysis confirmed weaker induction of <italic>Ngn2</italic> and other neuronal genes in the upstream tandem syntax compared to the downstream tandem. As expected, pluripotency-associated genes were downregulated in the downstream tandem orientation after doxycycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>).</p><p id="P35">To demonstrate the utility of two orthogonal LPs, we used STRAIGHT-IN Dual to simultaneously overexpress Ngn2 and the genetically-encoded calcium indicator jRCaMP1b using the Tet-On 3G system. Each <italic>CLYBL</italic> allele harbored one of these transgene constructs under the control of a TRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e</xref>). With a single inducer, we achieved rapid and robust forward programming of hiPSCs into neurons while simultaneously recording calcium signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5f,g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Additionally, we designed a downstream tandem all-in-one Tet-On 3G GT donor plasmid to facilitate rapid cloning of genes of interest (GOIs), which also constitutively expresses a nuclear-localized BFP reporter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4c</xref>). A LacZ cassette was included in the cloning site to enable easy blue/white screening of bacterial colonies that contained the cloned GOIs. After assembly, most white colonies (&gt;85%) carried the correct cargo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4c,d</xref>). This streamlined cloning and screening approach allowed for the rapid generation of donor plasmids with diverse inducible cargoes that could then be integrated using the rapid protocol into the STRAIGHT-IN alleles. These hiPSC lines, which were established in under one week, also uniformly expressed the nuclear BFP reporter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4e,f</xref>).</p><p id="P37">To achieve independent control over two separate cargoes, we characterized an alternative inducible system in hiPSCs that, in combination with the Tet-On 3G system, would permit temporally and sequentially regulated expression of the distinct payloads. For this, we selected synthetic zinc finger transcription regulators (synZiFTRs) with ZF10 as the DNA-binding module, NS3 as the grazoprevir (GZV)-inducible module, and p65 as the transcriptional activator module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">H.-S. Li et al., 2022</xref>). An all-in-one synZiFTR-based GZV-inducible GA donor plasmid was constructed based on the downstream tandem orientation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5a</xref>). Induction of a <italic>mGreenLantern</italic> reporter with GZV revealed some toxicity, so we optimized the GZV concentration to achieve induction with minimal toxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5b,c</xref>). Overexpression of Ngn2 using the GZV-inducible synZiFTR system successfully directed forward programming of hiPSCs into neurons within 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5h,i</xref>).</p><p id="P38">Finally, we combined both inducible systems using STRAIGHT-IN Dual. Ngn2 was overexpressed via the all-in-one GZV-inducible synZiFTR system integrated into the GA allele, while mScarlet expression was induced using the all-in-one Tet-On 3G system targeted to the GT allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5j</xref>). Remarkably, most neurons expressed mScarlet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5d</xref>).</p><p id="P39">These findings demonstrate the power and flexibility of dual inducible systems for precise control of transcription factor expression and functional monitoring. They also underscore the suitability of STRAIGHT-IN for rapidly evaluating the effects of different genetic syntaxes on these processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P40">In this study, we present STRAIGHT-IN Dual, a platform that enables the integration of two independent DNA payloads into the <italic>CLYBL</italic> locus with unprecedented allele-specific control, efficiency, and speed. Following protocol optimization, genetically modified hiPSC lines could be generated in less than one week with near 100% efficiency. For the GA allele, both integration and excision procedures could be completed within 9 days without the need to passage the cells.</p><p id="P41">STRAIGHT-IN Dual allows for the simultaneous integration of two payloads with orthogonal precision due to the high specificity of the GT and GA sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jusiak et al., 2019</xref>). By using eeBxb1, a hyperactive Bxb1 mutant generated through directed evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hew et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Pandey et al., 2024</xref>), we could achieve significantly higher integration rates compared to Bxb1-WT. Since Bxb1 catalyzes recombination through DNA double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), we also investigated the use of p53DD, a dominantnegative truncated version of p53, to dampen the p53-mediated DNA damage response and thereby increase the number of cells that proceed through the cell cycle after recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Haideri et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">M. Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Rosenstein et al., 2024</xref>). By co-delivering eeBxb1 and p53DD as modRNA, we increased integration efficiency by approximately 10-fold, likely due to the improved survival of the hiPSCs following recombination.</p><p id="P42">The platform also provides near-scarless targeting of DNA payloads by enabling the excision of auxiliary elements, such as reporters, selection markers and plasmid backbones. Both here and in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Blanch-Asensio et al., 2024</xref>), we have demonstrated that removing these flanking sequences reduces silencing of integrated payloads in both undifferentiated and differentiated hiPSCs. Excision also allows for the reuse of the selection markers for further genomic modifications. With STRAIGHT-IN Dual, we achieved nearly 100% efficiency in excising the auxiliary elements from both alleles using Cre and <italic>Flp-2A-BleoR</italic> modRNA, with the entire process for the GA allele possible without needing to replate the cells. This streamlined approach supports the seamless generation of multiple genetically modified hiPSC lines, either in parallel or pooled, potentially facilitating large-scale plasmid library integration and combinatorial studies at singlecopy resolution. These optimized processes also make STRAIGHT-IN Dual highly compatible with automation pipelines, providing a robust platform for high-throughput generation of hiPSC lines for large-scale studies and functional screens.</p><p id="P43">Our results also highlight the limitations of current molecular tools used in hiPSCs. For example, the hEF1a promoter, despite its frequent use in synthetic biology and stem cell research, was rapidly silenced in hiPSCs after just a few passages, consistent with findings from other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bertero et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the CAG] promoter provided robust, consistent gene expression in hiPSCs. However, its length and high GC content make it less desirable for cloning and use in hiPSCs. While this is not a limiting factor when using STRAIGHT-IN, there remains a need to identify additional promoters that resist silencing in hiPSCs. STRAIGHT-IN Dual offers a platform for rapid, locus-controlled screening of libraries containing novel or synthetic promoter sequences. Furthermore, transgene silencing frequently occurs during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cabrera et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Karbassi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Klatt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Rosenstein et al., 2024</xref>). Screening libraries of insulators or anti-silencing elements that perform effectively in both undifferentiated and differentiated hiPSCs would be invaluable for overcoming these challenges.</p><p id="P44">To demonstrate the utility of STRAIGHT-IN Dual for such screens, we compared the four gene syntaxes of the popular Tet-On 3G all-in-one inducible system in hiPSCs, finding that divergent and downstream tandem orientations provided optimal transgene expression. Additionally, placing inducible and constitutive transgenes on separate alleles generally resulted in lower induction levels compared to all-in-one designs. Most studies reporting the use of all-in-one Tet-On systems in mammalian cells have favored these two orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Jillette et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kelkar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Ng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Otomo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Randolph et al., 2017</xref>), with convergent and upstream tandem syntaxes typically performing poorly unless extensively optimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Haenebalcke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Shin et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P45">Based on the clear differences in expression observed in the two tandem orientations, we evaluated both syntaxes for forward programming of hiPSCs into neurons via inducible expression of Ngn2. We selected the downstream tandem syntax over the divergent orientation because we observed higher transgene induction prior to excision of the flanking auxiliary elements, thereby obviating the need to perform this step and allowing for the initiation of overexpression studies within one week. Remarkably, forward programming was only effective in generating functional neurons when using the downstream tandem syntax, confirming its superior performance over the upstream tandem syntax.</p><p id="P46">This system opens new avenues for screening transcription factors that drive the differentiation of hiPSCs into specific cell types. Previously, such screens were only achievable using viral-based strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Joung et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Ng et al., 2021</xref>). With STRAIGHT-IN, transcription factor libraries could be screened in a similar timeframe, but with locus-specific and precise single-copy control, which is not possible with viral methods.</p><p id="P47">Moreover, STRAIGHT-IN Dual allows for combinatorial or sequential transgene overexpression using independent inducible systems, such as Tet-On 3G, and synZiFTRs. We demonstrated this using the grazoprevir-inducible synZiFTR system to overexpress <italic>Ngn2</italic> in hiPSCs, followed by mScarlet expression via the Tet-On 3G system in the resulting neurons. Surprisingly, we observed some toxicity with grazoprevir in hiPSCs, a phenomenon not reported in more terminally differentiated human cell types, such as primary T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">H.-S. Li et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P48">By combining multiple inducible systems, specific cell fate engineering along with the expression of functional biosensors or the modeling of sporadic or acquired genetic mutations in differentiated cells, is now be possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5l</xref>). Furthermore, these inducible DNA payloads can be expressed in complex in vitro cell models, providing a powerful tool for bioengineering in organoids, organs-on-chips, and other 3D <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Nahon et al., 2024</xref>). In summary, STRAIGHT-IN Dual facilitates the rapid generation of complex genetically modified hiPSC lines, and we envision that this technology will become a valuable tool for hiPSC research and biomedicine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS199477-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d26aAcDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S9"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Niels Geijsen and Peng Shang for providing Cre protein.

beta-like locus (CLYBL) and Bxb1 recombinase-mediated integration of GT and GA donor plasmids into their cognate LPs.
