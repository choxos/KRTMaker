We used the sustained attention to response task (SART) to induce fatigue, and manipulated motivation levels for the last block of the task in young and older participants (N = 34), while recording EEG to track electrophysiological markers of vigilance change, fatigue and motivation. Despite significant increases in subjective fatigue and mind wandering over 45 minutes, no vigilance decline was observed. However, the age groups differed markedly in their response strategies from the outset (adopting distinct speed-accuracy trade-off strategies) with faster/more erroneous responses in the younger and slower/more accurate responses in the older participants. The subjective rises in fatigue/mind wandering were coupled with an increase in pre-stimulus alpha-power, whereas the post-stimulus activity revealed two distinguishable beta signatures: a fronto-central topography as a marker of response strategy and a fronto-parietal distribution modulated by motivation <italic>per se</italic>. Our results thus show three distinct neural patterns underpinning the effects of fatigue, response strategy and motivation and suggest a (motivational) cognitive control mechanism behind resetting of performance decrement, independent of persistent fatigue.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sustained attention</kwd><kwd>alpha oscillation</kwd><kwd>beta oscillation</kwd><kwd>fatigue</kwd><kwd>vigilance decrement</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Sustaining attention requires a constant, self-directed maintenance of vigilance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Robertson and Garavan 2004</xref>) both across various daily activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Roach et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Massar et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">Walker and Trick 2018</xref>), and bespoke experimental tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Head and Helton 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Reteig et al. 2019</xref>).

However, the onset of a vigilance decrement will vary across experiments and studied populations, with some studies pointing to a continued ability of participants to concentrate and maintain focus during sustained attention tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Nakagawa et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lara et al. 2014</xref>), while others suggest impairments in accuracy and reaction times with increasing time-on-task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Smit et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">van Schie et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Pershin et al. 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Differences in motivation, both between-and within- participants, may account for some of this variability. For instance, it has been suggested that motivation can be a key influence in the reappraisal of task strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Earle et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gilsoul et al. 2022</xref>), which can lead, through the self-regulatory mechanism of attentional effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Sarter et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Stoll et al. 2016</xref>), to improved behavioural measures in sustained attention tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Oken et al. 2006</xref>). This was tested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Reteig et al. (2019)</xref>, who rekindled participants’ motivation after 60 minutes spent on a sustained attention task, by offering an additional monetary reward if they managed to out-perform 65% of the other participants in the final part of the experiment. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Reteig et al. (2019)</xref> found that the motivational manipulation restored the vigilance decline to some extent, this was not reflected in the tested EEG measures of attentional control, except for variability in a neural theta-response. Hence, a neural link of the effect of motivation on vigilance change remains tentative (see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Awh et al. 2012</xref>)). In the present study, we sought to re-examine the role of motivation in vigilance decrements by manipulating motivation in the course of a sustained attention task while recording its EEG markers (similarly to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Reteig et al. 2019</xref>)), and further extending the investigation into the neurophysiological basis of fatigue.</p><p id="P4">Performance declines in sustained attention tasks are often induced by mental fatigue, which can be characterised as a dynamic, time-dependent, state-like response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Ishii et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">Völker et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">Wylie and Flashman 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Reteig et al. 2019</xref>), typically resulting in difficulty concentrating and/or enhanced mind-wandering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Martínez-Pérez et al. 2023</xref>). The exact mechanisms driving mental fatigue are still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Kuppuswamy 2022</xref>), but are likely caused by either a depletion of cognitive resources, or by monotonous tasks leading to a disengagement of the sustained attention networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gergelyfi et al. 2015</xref>). Notably, previous work highlights that the effect of fatigue on vigilance decrement may be decoupled from the effect of motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gergelyfi et al. 2015</xref>) and hence taking into account fatigue in the study of neural markers of vigilance change, in addition to motivational factors, is relevant. Unlike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Reteig et al. 2019</xref>), who used a sustained attention-style task where the goal was to detect rare targets in an oddball paradigm (and where typical errors were omissions), we used the sustained attention to response task (SART) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Robertson et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">Weinstein 2018</xref>) in which failures in sustained attention manifest in commission errors to infrequent no-go stimuli. Performance changes in the SART are influenced by response strategy and chronobiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lara et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Wilson et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dang et al. 2018</xref>), can capture lapses into a less attentive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">Wilson et al. 2016</xref>), as well as task monotony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Head and Helton 2012</xref>), so the mapped effects extend well beyond the task itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Smit et al. 2004</xref>). Prolonged versions of the SART therefore represent an optimal method for exploring the relationship between vigilance decrements and potential differences in strategy linked to motivation and fatigue.</p><p id="P5">In terms of neural substrates and/or correlates of the vigilance decline, both the relevant anatomical networks and some of its potential neural markers have been identified. The vigilance network is responsible for sustained attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Milyavskaya et al. 2021</xref>), as well as executive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Holtzer et al. 2011</xref>), exerting attentional control over the incoming visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Posner and Dehaene 1994</xref>) via modulation of early visual centres and network interactions needed to carry out the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Corbetta et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Clayton et al. 2015</xref>). It has also been linked to task-induced fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Shen et al. 2016</xref>) and brain activity potentially associated with this network has been observed to change over the course of a task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Macdonald et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Benwell et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Li et al. 2020</xref>). Accordingly, activity changes in the vigilance network should track its gradual disengagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Johansson and Rönnbäck 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Ishii et al. 2014</xref>) and thus make the network a viable focus for the study of neural changes due to the vigilance decrement.</p><p id="P6">In EEG research, activity of the vigilance network has been broadly characterised as occurring in the oscillatory alpha frequency band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Clayton et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Sadaghiani and Kleinschmidt 2016</xref>)) extending over frontoparietal brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Corbetta and Shulman 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Clayton et al. 2015</xref>), although oscillatory activity pertaining to control extends beyond the alpha-band. Changes in beta-band activity have been associated with the regulation of attentional effort during time on task, in addition to motor preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Liu et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Stoll et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Li et al. 2022</xref>). Thus, analyses of oscillatory signals focusing on the alpha and beta band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Liu et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Stoll et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Benwell et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Arnau et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Li et al. 2022</xref>) should contribute to a better understanding of the neural processes underlying vigilance changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Martínez-Cañada et al. 2023</xref>) and clarify their contribution to fatigue and motivation.</p><p id="P7">Aside from oscillations, changes in the P300 ERP component have been associated with subjective fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Krigolson et al. 2021</xref>), as well as time on task in sustained attention paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Hart et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Guo et al. 2016</xref>), and ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Kaufman et al. 2016</xref>). We thus mapped the P300 ERP-changes across the factors of interest (time on task, fatigue, the motivational manipulation), as well as age group.</p><p id="P8">Finally, it is well documented that there is large inter-individual variability in SART performance across the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Vallesi et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Hanzal et al. 2024</xref>). In particular, different age groups tend to adopt either an accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dang et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Reteig et al. 2019</xref>) or speed-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lara et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Statsenko et al. 2020</xref>) strategy. These strategies are then prone to change (for example, switching from an emphasis on achieving high accuracy, to responding faster) during the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">van Schie et al. 2012</xref>). This could reflect differences in the underlying levels of fatigue, as suggested by surveys of general population fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gilsoul et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">Yoon et al. 2023</xref>), or instead an age difference in motivational levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Ryan and Campbell 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Carr et al. 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P9">In brief, we investigated in this preregistered study the behavioural and EEG measures of the vigilance decrement and increased fatigue in young and older participants as a function of time-on-task during prolonged (45 minutes) SART performance. We induced high levels of motivation in half of the participants during the final experimental block to investigate whether motivation could improve performance and change EEG markers of fatigue and tested for differences between age-groups. Our results reveal three, dissociated, frequency-specific EEG signatures of increased fatigue/mind wandering with time-on-task, of response strategies per age-group and of motivation, on the backdrop of maintained task performance (no vigilance decline observed). We speculate that these signatures may contribute to offset performance declines over time-on-task.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P10">The hypotheses, design and analysis plan were pre-registered prior to data collection and can be accessed via the Open Science Framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/y2vgc/">https://osf.io/y2vgc/</ext-link>). The study was approved by the University of Glasgow College of Science and Engineering Ethics committee. A total of 41 healthy adults aged between 18 and 87 years old were recruited from the University of Glasgow subject pool and the local area and were given monetary compensation for their time. The study was approved by the University of Glasgow College of Science and Engineering Ethics committee (Approval number: 300210156). Written consent was obtained from all participants. Participants were balanced for gender and were asked to report any existing medical conditions, eye-sight correction and medications which might impact their performance. Seven participants were excluded due to excessive noise and artifact in the EEG signal. The final sample consisted of 34 participants (F = 16) split into two groups based on age: young (n = 18, F = 9, mean age = 22.61, SD = 1.85, range = 20 - 26) and older adults (n = 16, F = 7, mean age = 66.50, SD = 8.45 years, range = 55 - 87).

Participants were provided with an information sheet and gave written, informed consent to take part.

A 64 Ag/AgCl BrainCap (BrainProducts, Gilching, Germany) were fitted according to the international 10/20 system (American Electroencephalograpic Society, 1991), including two horizontal electro-oculographs, and impedance reduced to &lt;25KΩ using Signa gel. Participants then completed the VAS-F and MW-S and a brief visual field test to map visual acuity. They then underwent a SART practice session of 30 trials and were given general feedback about their accuracy on the practice block. In the main experiment, participants completed eight blocks of the SART (90 trials, 72 go, 18 no-go trials, random presentation), each lasting five minutes and 20 seconds, with self-paced breaks between each block, followed by the VAS-F and MW-S to record post-task subjective states. Continuous EEG data was recorded at a 1000Hz sampling rate. The first eight blocks of the SART were followed by one further, unannounced, block of 90 trials (Block 9) to manipulate motivational state. Half of the participants were randomised into a motivated group and were instructed to try to maximise their performance on the last block (no guidance was given regarding potential strategies to achieve maximal performance). They were informed that the participant with the best performance during this block would receive an additional bonus of £50. The other half were only informed that the experiment includes an additional block and asked to undertake the block with the same instructions as the previous blocks.

After initial cleaning, the data was re-epoched for pre-stimulus and task-related analysis. Time-frequency analysis was performed using a transformation based on multiplication in the frequency domain method as specified in the ft_freqanalysis Fieldtrip function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Oostenveld et al. 2011</xref>), and a Hanning taper was applied to the data.

The maximum possible number of permutations (up to 3000) was undertaken for each test.

This is explained by a case-by-case basis of inclusion of participants based on the overall neural data quality which fluctuated between the two parts of the experiment, with a final overlap of 30 participants between both parts. The motivational block data was notably noisier, due to a likely higher proportion of agitation and motion artefacts introduced by the motivational manipulation.</p><p id="P24">The procedure for analysing the pre-stimulus signal was guided by the recent decomposition of the signal into periodic and aperiodic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Donoghue et al. 2020</xref>) which have distinct associations with tasks and participant populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Donoghue et al. 2022</xref>), e.g. ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Turner et al. 2023</xref>) and pathology, as in developmental dyslexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">Turri et al. 2023</xref>).

A random mixed effects model with beta-power as the to-be-predicted variable confirmed its increase across time-on-task [t(32) = 2.98, β = 0.16, p = .005] and revealed a higher value in the young participant group [t(32) = -3.93, β = -3.06, p &lt; .001], but no interaction [t(32) = .147, β = 0.01, p = .884]. This indicates an overall linear increase of task-related beta-power across time-on-task that is independent of age-group, while showing overall group differences. It is tempting to interpret these differences in terms of an association with fatigue/mind wandering levels (in analogy to the pre-stimulus alpha-power changes). However, inspection of the event-related beta-change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, line plot) provides evidence for a relationship to behavioural response patterns and hence response strategy across age-groups instead.</p><p id="P45">Inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref> (line plots) reveals a prominent beta-desynchronization around response onset (mean reaction times were ~400-500ms, see above), followed by a beta-rebound. The desynchronization was much stronger in amplitude in the older than younger participants, whereas the beta-rebound showed an earlier latency in the younger compared to the older group, reflecting the differences in their reaction times (see above). Given this dynamic pattern and the fronto-central topography, we interpret this beta-signal to reflect differences in motor response strategies between the groups. To further inform this interpretation, we explored to what extent this signal could be driven by the motor response. We therefore re-analyzed the beta-signal but taking into account correct omission trials only (hence eliminating any contamination by motor execution). Given the low number of omission trials, we averaged the data across all blocks 1-8 (it was not possible to resolve blocks 1 and 8 separately). This analysis revealed the same pattern (comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5C vs 5B</xref>), including in terms of age-group differences (t(25) = -2.20, p = .037), which therefore suggests that this beta-signal is more of a cognitive or motor control nature than linked to motor execution. Based on these findings, we interpret the stronger beta-desynchronization in the older as compared to the younger group to reflect deployment of more effort towards accurate motor control, while we interpret the shorter latency in beta-rebound in the young, as compared to the older group, to reflect the speeded response strategy.</p><p id="P46">To test whether the time-on-task related beta-signal also co-varied with the motivational manipulation, this signal was extracted in the electrode with the highest t-statistic (C3) also for the motivational block 9 and separately for the motivated and non-motivated groups, for comparison with block 8 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Post-hoc analysis exploring the interaction of motivation x block using dependent sample t-tests revealed that while the signal of the non-motivated group did not differ between the two blocks [t(17) = 1.94, p = .069], the motivated participants’ beta synchronisation decreased [t(11) = 4.45, p &lt; .001]. There was also a significant interaction between age and motivation [F(2, 26) = 5.28, p = .030, η<sup>2</sup> = .141] but this interaction was not further explored, as it almost certainly reflects a chance finding (despite random allocation in age and motivation groups).

The resulting model was not significant, F(3, 64) =.555, p = .647. Furthermore, the same signal was also traced into the motivational condition, compared in a 2×2 ANOVA collapsed across age, examining the effect of block (8, 9) and motivation (non-motivated, motivated). The resulting model was significant F(3, 56) = 3.47, p = .022.

Likewise, no effect was found for the relationship between mind wandering to pre-stimulus periodic alpha change [F(3, 30) = 1.73, p = .182], or task-related beta [F(3, 30) = 2.43, p = .085].</p><p id="P57">The model testing reaction time change was not significant for its relationship to pre-stimulus alpha-change (electrode CP1) [F (3,30) = 1.54, p = .224], but the model was significant for task-related beta-change (electrode C3) [F(3,30) = 8.84, p &lt; 0.001].

An inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 8</xref> reveals that the relationship between beta change and reaction time change was driven by the older adult group. Older adults who showed a greater decrease in reaction times, showed a greater increase in beta power.

This time-on-task rise reflects other research around time-related changes in EEG signal arising from experimental manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Tian et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Li et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Jacquet et al. 2021</xref>) and adds to the existing body of literature highlighting detectable changes in alpha oscillations in relation to demanding tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Benwell et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Huycke et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Pershin et al. 2023</xref>). More importantly though, our findings link these centro-parietal alpha-power increases to a general rise in subjective fatigue and mind-wandering, as well as the motivational manipulation: not only was there as a significant alpha rise over time (blocks 1 to 8), but also significantly greater elevation of the signal in the younger compared to the older participants. The signal thus mirrored perfectly, the reported fatigue/mind wandering scores which were not only significantly elevated over time, but also significantly higher in the younger compared to the older participants. Finally, the signal was co-modulated with participant motivation: while alpha oscillations kept rising for the unmotivated participants of the final block (in line with the reaction times that also increased from block 8 to 9 in this group), it levelled out for the motivated group (who were promised a monetary incentive if they outperformed others).</p><p id="P60">As a new finding and interpretation, in particular in light of the reported absence of a behavioural vigilance decrement, we propose this centro-parietal pre-stimulus alpha increase during time-on-task, that further levels out with participant motivation, to not reflect a resource depletion (nor a disengagement of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Arnau et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Krigolson et al. 2021</xref>), but instead to closely mirror the waxing and waning of a subjective fatigue state.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Post-stimulus, time-on-task modulated beta-oscillation relate to response strategy</title><p id="P61">We also observed a time-on-task rise in fronto-central post-stimulus beta synchronisation which, in contrast to the alpha oscillation, was unaffected by motivational interference. The observed pattern followed the structure of a classic post-motor beta desynchronization and rebound, the specific neural response concerned with preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Swann et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Darch et al. 2020</xref>) and/or execution of a motor response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Parkes et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Heinrichs-Graham et al. 2017</xref>). In the present study, the desynchronisation was much stronger in the older compared to the younger group, whereas the beta-rebound showed an earlier latency in the younger group. Given this dynamic pattern and the fronto-central topography, we interpret this beta-signal to reflect age differences in motor response strategy. More specifically, we think that these age (strategy) differences are of a cognitive or motor control (rather than motor execution) nature as we found the same pattern also for omission trials (which lacked a motor execution aspect). Our thinking is further underpinned by the significant relationship we found between beta signal change and age: older adults who showed a greater decrease in reaction time over time-on task, also showed a greater increase in beta power. This pattern was absent in the younger group. Overall, these analyses suggest that, across age groups, there are qualitive differences in response strategy (accurate vs fast), that are reflected in a beta-signal of fronto-central topography: we interpret the stronger beta-desynchronization in the older, as compared to the younger group, to reflect a deployment of greater effort towards accurate motor control, with the shorter latency in the beta-rebound in the younger group, to reflect the speeded response strategy. These results further emphasise contrasts in age group specific response strategies reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lara et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dang et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Reteig et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Statsenko et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">Vallesi et al. 2021</xref>), but more importantly, we now demonstrate that these qualitative strategic differences are underpinned by distinct beta oscillations (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">Xifra-Porxas et al. 2019</xref>) for similar findings on grip strength).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Post-stimulus ‘motivational’ beta oscillation</title><p id="P62">In addition to the beta-signature with its fronto-central topography, we found another beta oscillation of fronto-parietal distribution that was independent of age-group but instead modulated by motivation <italic>per se</italic>. This signal was stable over time-on task, yet we found it to show a larger beta-decrease from block 8 to 9 in the motivated relative to the non-motivated participants. This signal decrease was coupled with a reaction time levelling out in the motivated group (from block 8 to 9), while reaction times in the non-motivated group increased significantly. Our findings thus show that the motivation manipulation was effective, similar to the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Reteig et al.

Most importantly, we show this motivational effect to be co-modulated with an oscillatory beta decrease, whereas Reteig and colleagues failed to find any EEG markers linked to their motivation manipulation. Beta-oscillatory changes have previously been linked to motivational initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">Wilhelm et al. 2022</xref>) and reacted to changes of internal state also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Nickel et al. 2020</xref>), although there have been no previous reports on attentional motivation manipulation in human participants.</p><p id="P63">Our data thus best reflect the findings and interpretations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Stoll et al., (2016)</xref> who examined modulations of frontal beta around spontaneous pauses in work in monkeys.

It is possible that the subjective fatigue and mind wandering scales we used lacked sensitivity and further work is needed here.
