through laborious and expensive sequencing methodologies. We developed and validated a novel library preparation strategy for nanopore sequencing to generate long targeted reads with HPV and human chimeric sequences. Using this strategy, we validated known HPV integrations in HeLa (HPV18) and SiHa (HPV16) cell lines. We also mapped integration sites in five HPV+ cervical cancer patients, which were confirmed by whole genome and Sanger sequencing. Our nanopore-based method provides a precise and efficient strategy to capture HPV integrations crucial for understanding tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HPV integration</kwd><kwd>Cervical Cancer</kwd><kwd>nanopore sequencing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are associated with oropharyngeal, anogenital, genital, head and neck, and cervical cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, which according to GLOBOCAN 2022, accounted for more than 662,301 new cases reported and 348,874 deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Persistent HPV infection is the primary driver of more than 99% of cervical cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), 70% of which are caused by high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). HPV is a non-enveloped double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the <italic>Papillomaviridae</italic> family. It infects the basal cells of the cervical epithelium and replicates as these cells divide and differentiate to form the upper epithelial layers, eventually being shed from the top layer as progeny virions that initiate reinfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). HPV induces carcinogenesis by inhibiting the host tumor suppressor proteins, p53 and retinoblastoma protein (Rb) using the viral proteins-E6 and E7 respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Integration of the HPV genome into a host chromosome is also a crucial step in HPV-induced carcinogenesis and accompanies the formation of invasive cervical cancer that breaks through the basement membrane. Integration sites are more likely to be enriched at common fragile sites and open chromatin regions in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Large-scale genomic analyses have also uncovered hotspots of recurrent HPV integration with significant enrichment for sequences with microhomology between the human and HPV genomes at the breakpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Tumors with HPV integration show upregulation of viral oncogenes E6 and E7, as well as host genes at or near the site of integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Recent studies have observed that genomic regions around HPV integrations are enriched with Gene Ontology (GO) terms for DNA repair, fueling the hypothesis that integration events in the vicinity of DNA repair and tumor suppressor genes could lead to increased genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Moreover, HPV integration has been linked with changes in host chromatin structure and, consequently, in gene regulation, including long-range interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Numerous such studies highlighting the cis and trans effects of HPV integration in inducing and promoting cervical carcinogenesis have underscored the importance of HPV integration detection in cancer research, leading to a surge in developing technologies to study HPV integrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The Cancer Genome Atlas characterized 228 primary cervical cancers and reported HPV integrations in all HPV18-positive samples and 76% of HPV16-positive samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Campitelli <italic>et al</italic>. used these cell-viral junctions as a biomarker in circulating tumor DNA for analyzing a series of serum samples obtained from cervical cancer patients and reported that HPV integration can be used as a biomarker for the detection of minimal residual disease and subclinical relapse in HPV-associated cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Therefore, detecting HPV integration status and identifying the integration locus are crucial steps not only for understanding the role of HPV in cervical carcinogenesis, but also for clinical diagnosis and treatment monitoring in cervical cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Various techniques have been employed to determine HPV integration sites in the human genome, such as detection of integrated papillomavirus sequences by ligation-mediated PCR (DIPS-PCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), Restriction Site PCR (RS-PCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), amplification of papillomavirus oncogene transcripts (APOT) and next-generation sequencing (NGS). RNA-based assays for detection of HPV integration sites have substantial biological and technological constraints because of the lower stability of mRNA in biopsy samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Though assays like DIPS-PCR are dependent on DNA, the potential for detecting new integration sites is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Recently, NGS has been widely used for the genome-wide characterization of HPV integrations in cervical cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). However, the method requires whole genome sequencing at high coverage (&gt;30X) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), and involves multiple steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Considering the complexity of the procedure and the resulting data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), this method, though accurate, is not suitable for clinical use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Further, the cost of reagents used for these assays can be a challenge for labs with less resources, space, and medium to low sample throughput (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). With lower reagent costs and a shorter sequencing time, portable Nanopore sequencers may provide greater flexibility in this aspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Nanopore sequencing technology is the fourth generation of sequencing technology. It is portable, provides real-time data and enables rapid sequencing in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). In this study, as a proof of concept, we developed a novel enrichment strategy to capture HPV-human integration breakpoints using nanopore sequencing. We validated this technology by mapping known HPV integrations from cell lines and patient samples. Furthermore, by demonstrating expression changes of cancer-associated genes near the integration sites in the patient samples, we highlight the functional significance of mapping HPV integration events.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell Culture</title><p id="P6">Cervical cancer cell lines SiHa (HPV-16 positive), and HeLa (HPV-18 positive), procured from the National Centre for Cell Sciences (NCCS), Pune, India, were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (HiMedia Laboratories Pvt.

Patient clinical parameters like age, histological grade, comorbidity status, etc., were obtained from the medical records and summarized in Table 1. Biopsy samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or dry ice ethanol bath and stored at –80 °C until further use.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>DNA Isolation, HPV Detection and Genotyping</title><p id="P8">DNA was extracted from tumor biopsy samples using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The DNA concentration of each sample was measured using Qubit® fluorometer 3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) using the Qubit™ dsDNA BR Assay Kit. HPV detection by PCR was performed using HPV universal primers GP5+ and GP6+. PCR reaction comprised of 1x GoTaq® Green Master Mix (Promega Corp., WI, USA), 0.5 μM of GP5+ and GP6+ primers and 50 ng of genomic DNA. Thermal cycling was performed using SimpliAmp™ Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) with the following conditions: Initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, 95°C for 30 s, 51°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30s, 35 cycles and final extension at 72°C for 5 min for 1 cycle.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and analysis</title><p id="P9">Genomic DNA from tumor samples was sequenced using the Illumina Novaseq/ NextSeq sequencer as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, California), with 2 × 150-bp paired-end reads and a minimum coverage of approximately 30X. WGS was performed at Medgenome laboratories based in Bangalore, India. FASTQ files from the paired-end WGS were passed through quality control and adapter trimming using the Trim Galore wrapper over Cutadapt and FastQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). To detect viral integration, the trimmed FASTQ files for each sample were processed through the ViFi algorithm using hg38 as the human reference genome, along with HPV genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). ViFi employs phylogenetic methods in conjunction with reference-based read mapping to accurately identify integration events, even for novel viral strains. This analysis revealed samples with viral integration, providing details on the viral strain, the human chromosome and positional range of integration, as well as the number and identities of read pairs supporting the integration. Supporting reads include pairs in which one read maps to the human reference genome and the other to a viral reference genome, as well as split reads—a type of chimeric read that spans the integration site, mapping partially to the human and viral reference genomes. Split read sequences were fetched from the BAM file outputs from ViFi and verified by visualizing the alignments in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). Precise integration points were then identified from the split read sequences through BLAST analysis against the human reference genome and the detected viral strain.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Single primer PCR extension</title><p id="P10">We developed a novel single primer extension strategy for specifically targeting HPV fragments. The schematic of the single primer extension based nanopore library preparation is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. This method for detecting HPV-human breakpoints involves a pool of primers flanking which cover the entire HPV genome. Two sets of primer pools were designed which amplify specific HPV genomic regions in forward and reverse directions respectively. The elongation of a single primer can capture HPV fragments and adjacent human genomic sequences during primer extension. The homopolymer tailing (C-Tailing) step followed by the single primer extension produces double-stranded DNA fragments and inhibits potential PCR-generated artefacts caused by errors in polymerase incorporation. This method can also detect novel integration breakpoints, unlike the traditional HPV detection PCRs which can only amplify a certain number of integration sites based on specific genes of HPV (E1, E2 OR L1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Our method can also be instrumental in assessing HPV integration sites in highly fragmented or damaged DNA such as formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue DNA, as it does not require a predefined amplicon length, unlike conventional PCR methods. The final round of nested amplification using nanopore adapter specific primers makes the assay more specific by enriching the amplicons obtained in the first round of primer extension. The use of nanopore specific adapter helps in barcoding, thereby multiplexing samples, which further reduces the cost of sequencing. The use of this library preparation technique for nanopore sequencing reduces the need for whole genome sequencing for detecting HPV-human integration events while increasing the efficacy of detecting HPV-human hybrid fragments even at very low copies.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Primer Design</title><p id="P11">HPV16 and 18 whole genome references were obtained from the Papilloma Virus Episteme (PaVE) database (pave.niaid.nih.gov) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).

The single primers allowed us to randomly extend the HPV genome allowing us to capture integrations provided the DNA sequence adjacent to the primer binding site is in the vicinity of a HPV-human integration junction. The addition of poly-C tail by the terminal transferase enzyme enables the binding of a reverse primer with poly-G resulting in a double-stranded molecule with nanopore adapters at either end. The reads obtained from the nanopore sequencing were in size ranging from 96 to 4656 base pair (with a median size of 228). On an average, the polyC and polyG tracts observed were 7 to 8 base pairs long. To establish and validate this assay, we used genomic DNA from HPV-positive cervical cancer cell lines, HeLa and SiHa, to map chimeric viral-human breakpoints.

Patient P1 had an integration of the viral genome into intron 4 of the RAD51 paralog B (<italic>RAD51B</italic>) gene on chromosome 14. We could find only one viral breakpoint within this gene, and the integration resulted from the disruption of L1 gene of the virus. Patient P2, had an integration of HPV genome in a lncRNA gene LINC02046 on chromosome 3. Three patients P3, P5 and P4 had integration sites in intergenic regions of Chromosome 4, and Chromosome 2 respectively. Patients P3 and P5, had the exact same integration sites on chromosome 4. WGS was performed for the five patients using Illumina to validate the results of our analysis.

This included CPB1 (within the TAD near its 3’ boundary) and CPA3 (outside the TAD but near its 3’ boundary). For patients P3 and P5, which had the same integration site, genes CXCL8, RASSF6, ANKRD17-DT and MTHFD2L were selected since the integration site fell within their promoter-enhancer integration loops.

In this study, we developed a novel targeted sequencing approach which combines single primer extension enrichment followed by nanopore sequencing to precisely identify HPV integration sites in HPV-positive cell lines and tumor genomic DNA from cervical cancer patient samples. Whole genome sequencing on the Nanopore sequencing platform has been previously used for studying viral integration due to its ability to generate long reads, enabling comprehensive genome-wide analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Increasing the depth of sequencing by enriching the viral genome using a PCR can help in attaining improved accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The findings of our study highlight the effectiveness of our unique targeted nanopore based amplicon sequencing in accurately identifying integration sites within known chromosomal regions of HPV-positive cell lines (HeLa in chr8 and SiHa in chr13). Our results conformed previously identified integration breakpoints in these cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p><p id="P31">We further evaluated the utility of our single primer based targeted nanopore sequencing by comparing our results with Illumina Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). Our analysis of 5 cervical cancer patient samples reported concordance with Illumina WGS. In our study, one patient (Patient P1) had an integration within intron 4 of the RAD51B gene located on chromosome 14. RAD51B is an important DNA double-strand break repair protein, and its loss of function is reported in uterine leiomyoma and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). It has also been previously reported to be one of the hotspots for HPV integration which may lead to dysregulation of Homologous Recombination Repair (HRR), causing genomic instability—a hallmark of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). We also observed that this integration led to the downregulation of a neighboring gene within the same TAD, Zinc finger protein 36 (<italic>ZFP36L1</italic>), which acts as a tumor suppressor. <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> is often downregulated in several patient cohorts of bladder and breast cancers and its reduced expression is associated with worse survival in patients with breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Loss of <italic>ZFP36L1</italic> has also been reported to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>).</p><p id="P32">We also found an HPV integration site in a lncRNA gene LINC02046 in Patient P2. The sequencing data for the other three patients revealed integrations predominantly within intergenic regions, which is consistent with patterns reported in previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).

It has been reported that the overexpression of <italic>CPB1</italic> in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which is an early-stage breast cancer, can lead to the progression into invasive breast cancer in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Also, gene <italic>CPA3</italic>, currently known as <italic>CPA4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>) is associated with pancreatic cancer progression, and was observed to be overexpressed in pancreatic cancer patients when compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Integration sites in the HPV-positive cell lines HeLa and SiHa were also observed in the intergenic regions of Chr 8 (Chr8q24.21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) and Chr13 (between the KLF5 and LINC00392 genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). As hypothesized by Yang <italic>et al.,</italic> intergenic HPV integrations might serve as a defense mechanism of the virus which keeps the host cell viable as integration into human non-exonic regions would probably not cause a significant loss of function of any important gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Interestingly, two patients in our cohort (P3 and P5) had the same intergenic integration site and breakpoint patterns. We observed that this integration break point fell within the promotor enhancer integration loops of genes in that TAD including <italic>CXCL8, RASSF6, ANKRD17</italic> and <italic>MTHFD2L</italic>. <italic>CXCL8</italic> was overexpressed in these two patients P3 and P5 as compared to the other three patients and control. None of the other genes, nor ALB, a cancer-associated gene present in the same TAD, showed significant changes in the expression. <italic>CXCL8</italic> is a known chemokine which plays major role in the proliferation, invasion, and migration of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>).This gene is also reported to promote angiogenesis in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) and the overexpression of <italic>CXCL8</italic> is associated with increased risk of cancer and poorer prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).

We developed a targeted method for the detection of HPV integration sites which is over 20 times more cost-effective than WGS and minimizing sequencing data volume. With our novel enrichment method, we could also enable deeper analysis at the specific region of interest (HPV-human Integration breakpoint) which helps to avoid false positive interpretation of sequencing data. Also, this strategic combination not only increased our sensitivity in detecting integration breakpoints but also substantially reduced background noise, enabling us to pinpoint specific integration loci within the genome.</p><p id="P35">The accurate identification and characterization of HPV integration breakpoints holds immense clinical implications, especially in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying HPV-associated carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Our study highlights the potential of nanopore sequencing, complemented by the single primer extension enrichment method, as a useful tool for this purpose. Besides the reduced cost and amount of sequencing data, a simpler analysis pipeline makes HPV integration detection faster, more efficient, and easily adoptable, which is crucial for clinical applications. Larger cohorts may be explored in future studies to identify new integration sites, potentially paving the way for the development of prognostic biomarkers or targeted therapeutic approaches for HPV-associated cancers. Our method demonstrates the superiority of targeted nanopore sequencing in identifying HPV integrations compared to Illumina WGS, emphasizing its precision, comprehensive coverage, and compatibility with a novel enrichment method.</p></sec><sec id="S25" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P36">Our study demonstrates the efficacy of a targeted nanopore sequencing approach combined with a novel enrichment method for precise and efficient detection of HPV integrations in genomes of cervical cancer patients. This method has an advantage over the traditional Illumina WGS in terms of cost-effectiveness, and data analysis efficiency. This method will contribute significantly to the understanding of the role of HPV integration in cervical carcinogenesis by accurately identifying integration breakpoints. Our novel technique could be easily applied to studying other viral integrations like retroviral, Adenovirus associated and Human Herpes-viral integration events. In addition to mapping viral integrations, this method could also be a crucial and a cost effective solution for detecting gene fusions in several cancers. Larger cohort studies are further required to explore the clinical significance of this method and translate it to diagnostics or companion diagnostic solutions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS199564-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" id="d131aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figure 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS199564-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_2.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" id="d131aAcFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Figure 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS199564-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_3.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" id="d131aAcFdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Figure 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS199564-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_4.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" id="d131aAcFeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Figure 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS199564-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_5.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" id="d131aAcFfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Figure 6</label><media xlink:href="EMS199564-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_6.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" id="d131aAcFgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS199564-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d131aAcFhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>PP would like to acknowledge the support from Senior Research Fellowship (SRF-Direct) (CSIRAWARD/SRF-DIRECT2024/15079) awarded by Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Ministry of Science &amp; Technology, Government of India.
