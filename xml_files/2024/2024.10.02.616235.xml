Here, we explore the DNA loading process of the bacterial SMC complex MukBEF. Using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM), we demonstrate that ATP binding opens one of MukBEF's three potential DNA entry gates, exposing a DNA capture site that positions DNA at the open neck gate. We discover that the gp5.9 protein of bacteriophage T7 blocks this capture site by DNA mimicry, thereby preventing DNA loading and inactivating MukBEF. We propose a comprehensive and unidirectional loading mechanism in which DNA is first captured at the complex's periphery and then ingested through the DNA entry gate, powered by a single cycle of ATP hydrolysis. These findings illuminate a fundamental aspect of how ubiquitous DNA organizers are primed for genome maintenance and demonstrate how this process can be disrupted by viruses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P3">

They mediate mitotic and meiotic chromosome compaction, sister chromatid cohesion, folding of chromosomes, DNA recombination, double-strand break repair, silencing of viral genomes, and the restriction of plasmids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. SMC functions are based on the entrapment of DNA within the complex and the ATP-powered extrusion of large DNA loops. DNA entrapment was first described for its role in sister chromatid cohesion, where replicated sister DNAs are held together by the cohesin complex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. However, other SMC complexes entrap DNA without mediating cohesion, suggesting that entrapment has another more fundamental purpose <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. How exactly entrapment is established by loading DNA into an SMC complex, and how entrapment relates to loop extrusion, is largely unclear.</p><p id="P5">MukBEF was the first SMC complex discovered, and folds the chromosome of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and related bacteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. It is a member of the <underline>M</underline>ukBEF-li<underline>k</underline>e <underline>S</underline>MC (Mks) or Wadjet group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), many members of which associate with the nuclease MksG/JetD to protect bacteria against plasmid infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. MukBEF has a key role in chromosome segregation, and like several other Wadjet group members lacks MksG/JetD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). MukBEF deficiency is lethal under fast-growing conditions and accompanied by defective chromosome segregation and an increased production of anucleate cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Although the Wadjet group covers a diverse sequence space, MukBEF has retained many key features of other SMC complexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The SMC protein MukB dimerizes at its “hinge” domain, which connects via the long coiled-coil “arm” to the ABC-type ATPase “head” domain. MukBEF adopts a compact shape by folding over at its “elbow”, bringing the hinge close to the heads <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The heads are bridged by the kleisin MukF, whereby the C-terminal winged-helix domain (cWHD) of MukF binds the “cap” surface of one MukB, and the N-terminal middle domain (MD) binds the coiled-coil “neck” of the other MukB. This designates the corresponding MukB subunits as κ- and ν-MukB, respectively. MukF also recruits the dimeric KITE protein MukE.</p><p id="P7">MukBEF is an obligate dimer, formed by two MukB<sub>2</sub>E<sub>2</sub>F monomers held together by their MDs and MukF N-terminal winged-helix domains (nWHD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. ATP binding induces engagement of the heads within a MukBEF monomer, enabling ATP hydrolysis and subsequent head disengagement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Cycles of head engagement and disengagement power the activities of all SMC complexes.</p><p id="P8">SMC complexes undergo turnover on DNA, with dedicated mechanisms mediating loading and unloading. This often involves loading factors such as Scc2/4, ParB, and Nse5/6, or unloading factors such as WAPL, MatP, XerD, and possibly microcephalin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Loading depends on ATP hydrolysis in MukBEF, cohesin, Smc–ScpAB, and Smc5/6, and involves the opening of a DNA entry gate, ingestion of DNA, and re-sealing of the gate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In principle, DNA entry can proceed via any of three candidate gates: the hinge gate, the neck gate, or the cap gate. Cohesin can load DNA through both its hinge and neck gates, whereas Smc5/6 loads through its neck gate exclusively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. The neck gate also serves as cohesin’s exit gate for WAPL-mediated unloading <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. The entry and exit gates of MukBEF and other SMC complexes have not been identified.</p><p id="P9">DNA loading is complicated by the fact that MukBEF, and likely other SMC complexes, can entrap DNA as a “double-locked” loop with segments in separate compartments: the “ring” compartment, delineated by the kleisin, the SMC arms and the hinge, and the “clamp” compartment, delineated by the kleisin and the heads <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In addition, entrapment of a single DNA segment in a post-extrusion “holding state” was recently observed for the MukBEF-related <italic>E. coli</italic> Wadjet I <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. The mechanistic basis for DNA transport into any of these compartments in any SMC complex is currently unclear. Here, we set out to investigate the loading process of MukBEF using biochemical reconstitution and cryo-EM reconstruction.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Reconstitution of the MukBEF loading reaction</title><p id="P10">MukBEF loads onto chromosomal DNA to mediate long-range organization of the genome. We aimed to reconstitute DNA loading from purified components and enable its investigation by biochemical and structural methods. Previously, we monitored loading <italic>in vivo</italic> using site-specific covalent circularization of the MukB–MukF core by cysteine mutagenesis and BMOE-mediated cross-linking, inspired by work on cohesin and Smc–ScpAB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. This strategy selectively probes for entrapment in the ring or a topologically equivalent compartment, and converts loaded complexes into SDS-resistant covalently closed protein-DNA catenanes. These can be separated from free or non-circularized complexes and detected by gel electrophoresis. We now adapted this assay from our <italic>in vivo</italic> setup to an <italic>in vitro</italic> setup using circular plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>). We employed <italic>Photorhabdus thracensis</italic> MukBEF, which is better behaved in cryo-EM experiments than its <italic>E. coli</italic> homologue, and engineered cysteine pairs for BMOE cross-linking into the <italic>P. thracensis</italic> proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S1C and S1D</xref>). BMOE cross-linking of the purified complex produced a product pattern similar to what we previously observed for <italic>E. coli</italic> MukBEF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1E</xref>). To verify whether the engineered complex was functional, we replaced the chromosomal <italic>mukFEB</italic> locus of <italic>E. coli</italic> with the <italic>P. thracensis</italic> version, with and without the cysteine substitutions, and including a HaloTag on MukB. The chimeric strains were viable on rich media at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F</xref>), indicating that <italic>P. thracensis</italic> MukBEF can substitute for its <italic>E. coli</italic> homologue and is at least partially functional even in the presence of the cysteine point mutations.</p><p id="P11">Next, we incubated the purified complex with negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA in a low-salt buffer containing ATP. At various timepoints of the reaction, we added BMOE to circularize the MukB–MukF core. Finally, we added buffer containing SDS to strip off complexes that were not catenated with the DNA, and resolved the products by agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). The assay produced a ladder of bands, with slower migrating species appearing as the reaction progressed. We interpret this as single plasmids catenated with one or more circularized protein complexes, where loading of multiple complexes becomes prevalent later in the reaction. DNA entrapment was not observed in the absence of ATP and was abolished when the ATP-hydrolysis deficient E1407Q (EQ) mutant of MukB was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). These findings suggest that the reconstituted loading reaction strictly depends on ATP hydrolysis, reproducing a fundamental characteristic of MukBEF loading <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>DNA relaxation facilitates MukBEF loading</title><p id="P12">MukBEF directly binds topoisomerase IV (Topo IV) via its hinge region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, and we wondered whether this enzyme may modulate MukBEF loading by changing the local geometry of the DNA. We tested loading of <italic>P. thracensis</italic> MukBEF in the presence of either <italic>P. thracensis</italic> Topo IV which decatenates and relaxes DNA, <italic>E. coli</italic> Topo I which relaxes DNA, or <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA gyrase, which supercoils its substrate rather than relaxing it. As before, we incubated MukBEF with negatively supercoiled plasmid in the presence of ATP with and without topoisomerase, but increased the salt concentration to support topoisomerase activity. Under these conditions, loading was less efficient, but still produced a distinctive ladder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). As a post-loading treatment after the addition of BMOE, we added a nicking enzyme to collapse DNA topoisomers and make the electrophoretic mobility of all samples comparable. We observed that loading was stimulated both by <italic>P. thracensis</italic> Topo IV and <italic>E. coli</italic> Topo I, but not by DNA gyrase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). Because Topo IV and Topo I relax DNA, but gyrase does not, we tested whether loading was also stimulated on relaxed substrates in the absence of the topoisomerase enzymes. We prepared DNA substrates relaxed either by Topo I treatment or by nicking, and subsequently purified the DNA. We then repeated the loading reaction under low-salt conditions in the absence of topoisomerases. After BMOE treatment, we again converted DNA to nicked open circles to adjust their mobility, added loading buffer with SDS, and resolved the reaction products by agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). Both nicked and relaxed substrates showed a strong increase in loading efficiency compared to negatively supercoiled DNA. This suggests that loading of MukBEF is influenced by the DNA topology, with a preference for environments where the DNA is less supercoiled or torsionally strained.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>ATP binding triggers opening of the neck gate</title><p id="P13">To gain detailed insights into the DNA transactions of MukBEF, we vitrified samples of the reconstituted loading reaction and analyzed them by cryo-EM. In addition to a sample under ATP turnover conditions, we collected datasets where sodium vanadate or beryllium fluoride had been added one hour after reaction start to enrich for species with engaged ATPase heads. All three conditions enabled the reconstruction of a state with engaged heads, and we pooled the datasets to increase the signal and obtain higher resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S17">Methods</xref>). The resolved state was free of DNA, and the neck gate had opened widely. We refer to this state as the “open-gate state” (PDB: 9GM7).</p><p id="P14">The neck and head regions of MukB adopted radically different conformations from what we had previously observed for the apo and DNA-bound unloading states of MukBEF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). ATP binding and head engagement had triggered the detachment of the MukF MD from the MukB neck, which resulted in a swing-out of the MD of about 180° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>). Detachment of the MD was facilitated by the mechanical distortion of the MukB neck constrained between engaged heads and aligned arms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>), while the MD swing-out was stabilized by the binding of MukE to the top surface of the heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). This surface is formed by the engagement of the heads upon ATP binding and is a highly conserved DNA binding site in all SMC complexes. Our structure reveals that occupation of the top of the heads by MukE and DNA is mutually exclusive, suggesting that MukE senses the DNA-free state of the heads to open the neck gate.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>DNA capture at the open neck gate</title><p id="P15">Focused sub-classification of the particle images revealed a DNA-bound structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The DNA was captured directly at the open gate, while the proteins adopted a conformation virtually identical to the open-gate state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>). We refer to this structure as the “DNA capture state” (PDB: 9GM8). A low-resolution reconstruction of the dimeric MukBEF assembly in the capture state showed that both monomers bound a continuous DNA segment of about 52 bp (PDB: 9GMA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). DNA-binding surfaces were largely contributed by MukE and MukF, and to a lesser extent by the root of the ν-MukB neck. Compared to the apo state, MukE and MukF had aligned their DNA-binding surfaces to enable DNA capture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2D</xref>). The DNA was not entrapped inside the complex, but bound at its periphery without contacting the top-surface of the heads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). MukE employed a DNA binding mode overall similar to its role in the DNA clamping; however, the DNA followed a differently bent path along its surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F</xref>). As the captured DNA is positioned at the open neck gate but not entrapped, we reason that entrapment may be achieved by ingestion through the gate.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Discovery of a bacteriophage MukBEF inhibitor</title><p id="P16">Is DNA capture involved in loading of MukBEF? A serendipitous discovery from phage biology helped us address this question, as will be explained in the following paragraphs.</p><p id="P17">Bacteriophage T7 infects <italic>E. coli</italic> and encodes the RecBCD inhibitor gp5.9, which interferes with the processing of DNA ends <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Although RecBCD is not essential for host survival, we noticed that the production of gp5.9 from an arabinose-inducible promoter was highly toxic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). This was also the case in a Δ<italic>recB</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that the toxicity was not caused by a gain of function of gp5.9-bound RecBCD, but rather by targeting of another unknown and essential factor. To identify this factor, we immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged gp5.9 (gp5.9<sup>FLAG</sup>) from wild-type (WT) and Δ<italic>recB</italic> extracts and analyzed the samples by TMT-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A, and S3B</xref>). Both MukE and MukF were among the top hits, providing a possible explanation for the strong growth defect upon gp5.9 induction.</p><p id="P18">Prompted by these findings, we investigated whether induction of gp5.9 caused chromosome segregation defects, a hallmark phenotype of cells with inactive MukBEF. Cells expressing gp5.9 produced more anucleate progeny than the empty vector control, which coincided with a higher fraction of cells with an increased DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3D, 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3C, and S3D</xref>). Cell width was unaffected by gp5.9 expression, whereas cell length was increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3E</xref>), and many cells showed evidence of defective chromosome partitioning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>). These findings suggest that gp5.9 interferes with chromosome segregation, consistent with the notion that it inactivates MukBEF.</p><p id="P19">Next, we investigated whether gp5.9 binds MukBEF directly. Recombinant MukE, MukEF, and MukBEF were efficiently pulled down by gp5.9<sup>FLAG</sup>-bound beads, whereas binding of MukB and MukF was lower or nearly undetectable, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3F, 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3F, and S3G</xref>). This suggests that gp5.9 binds MukBEF mainly through the MukE subunit. In size exclusion chromatography (SEC), <italic>E. coli</italic> MukEF and gp5.9 formed a stable complex, whereas little if any binding was observed with <italic>P. thracensis</italic> MukEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). Consistently, the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain with its endogenous <italic>mukFEB</italic> operon replaced by the <italic>P. thracensis</italic> version showed reduced susceptibility to gp5.9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3H</xref>). As <italic>E. coli</italic> is the natural host for bacteriophage T7, these findings suggests that gp5.9 has evolved specificity for its target.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>gp5.9 targets the MukE DNA-binding cleft and inhibits DNA loading</title><p id="P20">To gain insights into how gp5.9 binds and inactivates MukBEF, we solved the structure of gp5.9 bound to <italic>E. coli</italic> MukEF by cryo-EM (PDB: 9GMD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Focused classification, signal subtraction of the MukF core, and focused refinement using neural-network-based regularization with Blush <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> resolved a 73 kDa region of MukE bound to gp5.9. As observed previously in its RecBCD-bound form, gp5.9 formed a parallel coiled-coil dimer complemented by a beta-sheet of the N-terminal strands <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. gp5.9 bound along the DNA-binding cleft of MukE, overlapping along its full length with the DNA capture site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Contacts of gp5.9 with MukE differed from those with RecBCD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figures S4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B</xref>), as did the precise path of DNA in the respective DNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>). However, the orientation of gp5.9 with respect to the DNA molecule is broadly similar, in the sense that the long axis of the gp5.9 coiled coil aligns approximately with that of the double helix. Moreover, within the resolution limits of the structures, gp5.9 positioned several negatively charged residues (D11, D15, D21, E24, E36, D38, E43, E45) near positively charged residues in MukE (R140, K150, R163, R164, R179) or MukF (R322). Most of these ion pair interactions mimic DNA phosphate backbone contacts and thus prevent the natural DNA substrate from binding efficiently (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4D</xref>). Therefore, although there are significant differences in the details of binding to individual targets, the data overall support the designation of gp5.9 as a DNA mimic protein.</p><p id="P21">The structure revealed that binding of gp5.9 to the MukE DNA-binding cleft is mutually exclusive with formation of the DNA capture state. Therefore, if the capture state does indeed take part in DNA loading, then gp5.9 would be expected to inhibit the loading reaction. To test this, we prepared purified <italic>E. coli</italic> MukBEF containing cysteine pairs for covalent circularization. Like the <italic>P. thracensis</italic> complex, <italic>E. coli</italic> MukBEF efficiently produced an SDS-resistant ladder of plasmid-bound species after loading and BMOE cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). When gp5.9 was added to the reaction, we observed a strong inhibition of ladder formation, with an almost complete loss at a two-fold molar excess of gp5.9 over MukBEF. In contrast, loading of <italic>P. thracensis</italic> MukBEF was unaffected even by an 8-fold molar excess, highlighting again the specificity of gp5.9 inhibition.</p><p id="P22">We reasoned that the effect of gp5.9 on MukBEF loading may be explained by two scenarios: an inhibition of loading or, alternatively, an acceleration of unloading. To dissect its mode of action, we performed the following experiments. Addition of an 8-fold molar excess of gp5.9 at different timepoints quenched the loading reaction at intermediate levels of DNA entrapment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4E</xref>). When loading reactions were run for one hour, then quenched with gp5.9 and incubated for an additional hour in the presence of the inhibitor, only modest unloading was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). This effect, if caused by gp5.9 at all, cannot explain the strong entrapment defect observed when gp5.9 was included at early timepoints of the reaction. In summary, these results suggest that gp5.9 inhibits DNA loading and support the notion that DNA capture is necessary for DNA entrapment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S10"><title>Neck gate opening in SMC complexes</title><p id="P23">The entrapment of DNA by SMC complexes requires the passage of DNA through an entry gate. Our findings show that MukBEF employs a dedicated mechanism for opening its neck gate, converting the DNA-free apo form to the open-gate state: 1) ATP binds the heads and leads to their engagement, 2) the neck distorts and releases the MD of MukF, 3) MukE binds the DNA-free top of the heads and stabilizes the open-gate state. This mechanism ensures that the gate opens only when the heads are DNA-free, which serves as an indicator that the complex is ready for loading. In line with this idea it has been found that ATP-induced neck gate opening in condensin and cohesin can be suppressed by linear double-stranded DNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. This suggests that these complexes may employ a selective gating mechanism similar to that of MukBEF. Opening of the neck gate in Smc5/6, in contrast, differs from the mechanisms used by cohesin, condensin and MukBEF, as it only requires Nse5/6 but not ATP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Although it may be controlled in distinct ways, neck gate opening emerges as a central property of SMC complexes.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>The DNA capture state as a first step of loading</title><p id="P24">DNA entry into an SMC complex works against a large entropic cost, making it more likely for DNA to be positioned outside than inside, and rendering stochastic gate passage inefficient. Analogous to the directed transport of molecules across biological membranes an initial substrate capture step may help to guide DNA through the entry gate. We propose that the DNA-bound structure obtained here represents this capture state.</p><p id="P25">Is the DNA capture state involved in DNA loading? We find that gp5.9 targets the DNA-binding site of MukE, which contacts DNA both in the capture state and when DNA is entrapped in the clamp compartment. As gp5.9 inhibits the loading reaction, either form of DNA binding may be involved in loading. We favor the capture state as the relevant target for the following reasons: DNA entrapment in the clamp requires ATP hydrolysis <italic>in vivo</italic>, indicating that it occurs after loading <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Structural evidence and <italic>in vivo</italic> entrapment assays also suggest that DNA entrapment in the clamp coincides with entrapment in the ring compartment, implying that clamping is a result, and not a precursor, of DNA loading <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The capture state, however, requires ATP binding only but not hydrolysis, and can thus occur before DNA entrapment. This makes it an attractive first step of the loading reaction.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Mechanism of DNA entry through the neck gate</title><p id="P26">Combining our new structures with existing data now enables us to propose a pathway of DNA loading through the neck gate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie S1</xref>). This mechanism only requires a single round of ATP hydrolysis, which will be explained in the following. A recent structure of another member of the Wadjet family, <italic>E. coli</italic> Wadjet I, was solved in a post-hydrolysis state after DNA loading and loop extrusion, called the “holding state” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. The holding state entraps DNA in a compartment formed by the kleisin JetA/MksF and the head-proximal part of JetC/MksB. Comparison with the MukBEF capture state suggests a straightforward conversion reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A-C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A</xref>). Starting with the ATP- and DNA-bound capture state, we envision that upon ATP hydrolysis the MukB subunits revert to their apo conformation. This has two major conformational consequences: 1) disengagement of the composite surface on top of the heads, and 2) straightening of the MukB neck. As both transitions are incompatible with binding of MukE to the MukB heads, MukB will release from MukE and the DNA. However, MukB cannot diffuse away because it is tethered to MukF via the cWHD and flexible linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A</xref>). MukB is free to sample the space around the DNA, and as its straightened neck is now competent to bind the MD of MukF, the neck gate will eventually close. This results in an overall rotation of MukB that wraps MukF around the DNA and generates the holding state with DNA entrapped inside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5B and 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P27">This “release and rotate” model of DNA entrapment has several attractive properties. First, the model explains how DNA loading depends on ATP hydrolysis. While ATP binding exposes the DNA capture site, ATP hydrolysis triggers closing of the neck gate and ingestion of the captured DNA. Second, the model explains why loading is more efficient on relaxed DNA and may benefit from a cooperation with topoisomerases: Rotation of MukB around the DNA needs space, and relaxation makes the double strand more accessible compared to a plectonemal supercoil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Notably, folding at the elbow reduces MukB’s radius of gyration, which may facilitate this movement. Third, the product of the loading reaction, the holding state, is consistent with our entrapment assay, which converts it into a protein/DNA catenane. Finally, the loading model predicts the start site of DNA loop extrusion. Transition from the capture state to the holding state retains a short DNA segment at the center of the MukBEF dimer. This segment is equivalent to the extruded loop in the <italic>E. coli</italic> Wadjet I post-extrusion holding state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>). Our model thus predicts that extrusion initiates directly at the captured DNA segment.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Switching from DNA loading to DNA loop extrusion</title><p id="P28">Both DNA loading and DNA loop extrusion require ATP hydrolysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. We propose that these processes are separate and use the ATPase cycle in different modes. While gate opening is a prerequisite for loading, it is likely detrimental to loop extrusion and needs to be suppressed during the operation of the motor. Our findings suggest how this is achieved, and how the switch from “loading mode” to “loop extrusion mode” may be implemented: Once DNA is inserted into the clamp during extrusion, the top surface of the heads becomes inaccessible to MukE, blocking the gate opening mechanism described above.</p><p id="P29">How can MukBEF insert DNA into the clamp and switch to loop extrusion? Starting from the holding state, the clamped conformation can be generated by head engagement and tilting of the MukEF-bound DNA segment onto the top of the heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie S1</xref>). This results in the overall insertion of a DNA loop, which is “double-locked” in ring and clamp compartments, as supported by the structure of the MatP-bound unloading state and cross-linking studies. We envision that the double-locked loop is part of the extrusion reaction, as proposed previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Consistent with this notion, cross-linking experiments with condensin and Smc5/6 suggest that these complexes also insert double-locked loops <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">Although the exact mechanism of loop extrusion is unknown, it is conceivable that it involves the opening of the SMC arms.

The loading mode is specifically activated in DNA-free MukBEF, and once loaded, MukBEF can insert DNA into the clamp. This switches the complex to loop extrusion mode by suppressing further gate opening events, which may then become dependent on specialized unloading factors such as MatP.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Inhibition of SMC complexes by pathogens</title><p id="P32">Several SMC complexes contribute to the defense against pathogens: Smc5/6 silences transcription of some viral genomes, cohesin participates in the recombination of immunoglobulin loci, and many members of the Wadjet group clear plasmid infections by specific activation of a nuclease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>.

We obtained 1.2 M particles from 9,063 micrographs for the ATP/Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> dataset, 1.5 M particles from 10,704 micrographs for the ATP/BeF dataset, and 1.7 M particles from 10,031 micrographs for the ATP dataset. Subsets of particles were selected by multiple rounds 2D classification, which were analyzed by 3D classification in RELION using a low-pass filtered map of apo-MukBEF as a reference. This revealed the presence of the open-gate state in all datasets. We then pooled the particles from all datasets and processed them further as follows.</p><p id="P78">We performed non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC followed by one round of 3D classification without alignment in RELION, two rounds of focused classification without alignment using a mask around the heads to select 210,000 particles that reconstructed good density in the core of the head module. All datasets contributed to the density, and reconstructions split by dataset showed similar densities for the bound nucleotides, which were modeled as MgATP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2F</xref>). The map was improved by Bayesian polishing split by dataset, by per-particle defocus refinement, and by focused refinement with local pose search and Blush regularization. This resulted in the head core map at 3.5 Å resolution. To improve the density of the open gate, we performed focused classification without alignment using a mask that incorporated the gate. A subset of 34,000 particles was selected for refinement with local pose search and Blush regularization. This resulted in the open-gate map at 3.9 Å resolution. The MukBEF monomer was reconstructed from the same particles using flexible refinement in cryoSPARC. This resulted in the open-gate monomer map at 4.3 Å nominal resolution. The DNA capture state was obtained by further 3D classification in cryoSPARC using a threshold resolution of 9 Å. This selected 3,750 particles that reconstructed clear density for DNA. Re-centering on the DNA-bound gate and refinement revealed the dimeric nature of the capture state, yielding the dimer map at 9.1 Å nominal resolution. The map was then refined with C2 symmetry imposed, and the particle set was expanded in C2 to 7,500 particles. Particles were re-centered on the monomer, and the capture state was refined in C1 with local pose search and a mask around the head module and DNA binding site. This resulted in the DNA capture state map at 7.8 Å nominal resolution.</p></sec><sec id="S52"><title>gp5.9/MukEF</title><p id="P79">Particles were automatically picked using a crYOLO model trained on manually picked examples. Subsets of particles were selected by two rounds of 2D classification and were then subjected to 3D classification in Relion using an initial model based on a MukEF crystal structure (PDB: 3EUH) filtered to 60 Å resolution. Selected particles were then subjected to <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction and 3D classification in cryoSPARC. This was followed by non-uniform refinement with C2 symmetry imposed, and symmetry expansion in C2. The structure was then refined without symmetry using a mask around one MukEF monomer, using local pose search with an alignment threshold of 6 Å. The gp5.9 protein was not visible at this stage but became apparent after one round of 3D classification in cryoSPARC. Particles were subsequently subjected to Bayesian polishing in Relion. We encountered occasional flipping of particles during local refinements, and thus reinstated the dataset to C1. Next, we refined the structure with global pose search using Blush regularization, yielding the gp5.9/MukEF map at 4.1 Å nominal resolution. We then subtracted the signal of the MukF core, and re-centered on the gp5.9/MukE region. This was subjected to a final focused refinement with global pose search and Blush regularization, yielding the gp5.9/MukEF focus map with improved gp5.9 density at 4 Å nominal resolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S53"><title>Structural model building</title><p id="P80">Map sharpening was performed by B-factor compensation and FSC weighting <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref></sup> where indicated.

The model was then trimmed to the region of interest and subjected to a single macro-cycle in phenix.real_space_refine with restraints for the prosthetic group phosphopantetheine, secondary structure restraints, and Ramachandran restraints.

Next, the model was refined in phenix.real_space_refine with secondary structure and Ramachandran restraints. In a parallel approach, the same strategy was applied to build into the sharpened non-focused gp5.9/MukEF map, which showed good density for the MukF MD and nWHD. We then merged the MD and nWHD from the non-focused model into the focused model, re-build the transition in ISOLDE, trimmed the model, and subjected it to phenix.real_space_refine with secondary structure and Ramachandran restraints to generate the final focused model.
