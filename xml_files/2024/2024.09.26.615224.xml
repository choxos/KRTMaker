substrate Lgl is key to the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity across metazoa. Although aPKC-Par6 can phosphorylate Lgl at three serine sites to exclude it from the apical domain, paradoxically, aPKC-Par6 and Lgl can also form a stable kinase-substrate complex whose function remains unclear and with conflicting roles proposed for Par6. We report the structure of human aPKCι-Par6α bound to full-length Llgl1, captured through an aPKCι docking site and a Par6<sup>PDZ</sup> contact. This soluble tripartite complex traps a phospho-S663 Llgl1 intermediate bridging between aPKC and Par6, impeding phosphorylation progression. Thus, aPKCι is effectively inhibited by Llgl1<sup>pS663</sup> whilst Llgl1 is captured by aPKCι-Par6. Mutational disruption of Lgl-aPKC interaction impedes complex assembly and Lgl phosphorylation, whereas disrupting the Lgl-Par6<sup>PDZ</sup> contact promotes complex dissociation and completion of Lgl phosphorylation cycle. We incorporate these findings into a Par6<sup>PDZ</sup>-regulated substrate capture-and-release model that we demonstrate requires binding by Cdc42-GTP and the apical partner Crumbs to drive complex disassembly. Our results provide an explanation for the opposing roles of Par6 underpinning the spatial control of aPKC-Par6 activity by Lgl relevant to polarised membrane contexts across multi-cellular organisms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Apical-basal polarity in epithelial cells is formed by the action of a conserved network of partitioning defective (Par) proteins and their multi-protein complexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. This network exhibits properties of mutual membrane exclusion (also known as mutual antagonism) and feedback to form polarised membrane domains with unique identities and sizes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. How these emergent and dynamic properties arise from the formation of multi-protein Par assemblies is not fully understood, but phosphorylation of membrane-bound substrates is believed to be key. Within the apical membrane domain, the kinase-substrate relationships of the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and two isoforms aPKCι/aPKCζ in human) dominate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. aPKC associates with the PDZ-protein Par6 to phosphorylate substrates such as Par1, Par2 and Par3, that frequently bear an F-X-R docking motif, driving them off apical membranes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The precise contribution of Par6 in this process is unclear however, with both activating and inhibitory roles towards aPKC kinase activity having been proposed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Polarity components oppose and repress aPKC activity in the cytoplasm or at lateral membranes restricting aPKC-Par6 activation to apical membranes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. A well characterised example of a spatially-controlled antagonist of aPKC is Lethal (2) giant larvae (Lgl in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Llgl1/2 in mammals; in this study we will use Lgl generically across all species to refer to Lgl/Llgl1/Llgl2, other than where we explicitly refer to Lgl in experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic>). Lgl restrains aPKC activity except at the apical membrane where Lgl is removed directly by aPKC-Par6 through phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Lgl has a double ß-propeller structure and contains multiple phosphorylation sites for aPKC-Par6 with at least three serine phospho-acceptor sites (S655, S659, S663 in human Llgl1, within a segment defined hereafter as the P-site) that map within a key membrane-binding loop <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. These highly conserved sites are required for efficient cortical displacement of Lgl but are both functionally and kinetically distinct <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Active apical aPKC suppresses apical action of Lgl by phosphorylating its P-site, and displacing it from the membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Lgl is consequently localised to the basolateral membrane at steady state (together with Scribble and Discs Large (Dlg)) in a manner mutually exclusive with aPKC localisation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. This reciprocal localisation depends on Lgl phosphorylation by aPKC as an Lgl mutant lacking the three phospho-sites invades the apical membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Paradoxically, Lgl forms a stable tripartite complex with aPKC-Par6 in a manner mutually exclusive with Par3, suggesting a more complex regulation than a simple hit-and-run phosphorylation mechanism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. The molecular mechanism for mutual inhibition is not understood despite its key role in many cell polarity contexts including epithelial polarity, asymmetric cell division, and neuronal polarisation.</p><p id="P4">To understand the antagonism between Lgl substrate and aPKC-Par6 kinase, the basis for multi-site phosphorylation and how this stable three-way kinase-substrate complex is assembled, we determined a cryo-EM structure of an aPKC-Par6-Lgl tripartite complex. The structure reveals the intricate interplay between aPKC-Par6 and its substrate Lgl, which together with <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data support a capture and release mechanism involving a stable phospho-intermediate. In this mechanism, the Par6<sup>PDZ</sup> domain is uncovered as the missing molecular link explaining exquisite substrate targeting of Lgl, the mutual inhibition of aPKC and its role as an apical sensor coupled to an allosteric release mechanism. Thus, we provide a description of a near complete kinase-substrate multi-site phosphorylation reaction cycle.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Structure of a mutually-antagonised stalled polarity complex</title><p id="P5">To obtain the structure of an aPKC-Par6-Lgl tripartite complex, we expressed and purified a complex containing human aPKCι, Par6α, and Llgl1, from Freestyle HEK293-F cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data Figure 1a</xref>). Formation of a soluble complex was confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography. The structure of human aPKCι-Par6α-Llgl1 polarity complex was then determined at a nominal resolution of 3.44Å using cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data Figure 1b-d</xref>). Maps were of sufficient quality to reliably dock the Par6 PDZ domain (salmon, PDB code 1RZX), the aPKCι kinase domain (yellow, PDB code 5LI9) and a crystal structure of full-length Llgl2 (blue, PDB code 6N8Q) with the readily recognisable double beta-propeller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data Figure 1e-f</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. After fitting each component and adjusting their sequences to the correct isoform, the molecular interfaces were rebuilt <italic>de novo</italic>, including all conserved parts of the previously unseen Llgl1 membrane-binding loop (10-11) harbouring the P-site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c-e</xref>). This gave a reliable atomic model for the aPKCι-Par6α-Llgl1 tripartite assembly showing reciprocal interactions between all three components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). The nucleotide pocket was occupied with AMP-PNP added to the sample prior to grid preparation to stabilize the kinase core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data Figure 1g</xref>) and two known phospho-threonine sites in aPKC (pT412<sup>aPKCι</sup> and pT564<sup>aPKCι</sup>) and one phospho-serine in Llgl1 (Llgl1<sup>pS663</sup>) were unequivocally identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data Figure 1h-k</xref>). Regions towards the periphery of the cryo-EM map were less well resolved, including the pseudo-substrate (PS) membrane-binding element of aPKCι, as well as the PB1 domains of aPKCι and Par6α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data Figure 1l</xref>). Additional density proximal to the αC-helix of the kinase domain N-lobe was observed in cryo-EM 2D class averages and 3D reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended data Figure 1l</xref>), which matched the overall shape and size of the aPKCι C1 domain but could not be fit reliably.</p><p id="P6">The resulting aPKCι-Par6α-Llgl1 structure reveals the basis for coordinated capture of Llgl1 by Par6 and aPKCι, leading to a stably associated (stalled) phospho-intermediate of Llgl1. Multiple interactions stabilise the complex, mapping onto the second Llgl1 ß-propeller and its central membrane-binding loop (10-11) that contains the P-site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c-e</xref>). The second ß-propeller of Llgl1 makes the largest contact with the aPKCι kinase domain (aPKCι<sup>KD</sup>) insert (residues G457 to D468). This insert is located between the F and G helices of the kinase C-lobe extending away from the kinase to penetrate into the ß-propellor cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). This contact involves both acidic and hydrophobic contacts to bury a total surface area of ∼2374Å<sup>2</sup> (calculated at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/</ext-link>) providing an extensive landing pad for the aPKCι<sup>KD</sup>. A second Llgl1-aPKCι<sup>KD</sup> contact involves the aPKC RIPR motif (residues R480 to R483) in the loop between the αG and αH-helix also at the base of the kinase C-lobe. This element straddles a complementarily charged DPYSD motif on Llgl1 located within loop (8-9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). This satisfyingly explains our previous observations that the RIPR motif is a necessary contact site for Llgl1/2 phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Both these contacts help orient the aPKCι kinase domain with its substrate-binding cleft facing towards and anchoring part of the ∼72 aa-long membrane-binding loop (10-11) of Llgl1 containing the P-site. Residues L640-S641-R642 at the amino-terminus of the Llgl1 P-site engage a high affinity docking site on aPKCι that was previously shown to be occupied by Par3 FXR-motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The C-terminus of Llgl1 loop (10-11) is bound to the Par6 PDZ domain (Par6α<sup>PDZ</sup>) through a previously unrecognised internal <bold>P</bold>DZ-<bold><underline>b</underline></bold>inding <bold><underline>m</underline></bold>otif (Llgl1<sup>PBM</sup>) spanning residues V706-P712 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>). The Llgl1<sup>PBM</sup> is highly conserved in Lgl homologues explaining the strong sequence constraints at the C-terminal side of Llgl1 loop (10-11). The Llgl1<sup>PBM</sup> adopts a short ß-strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>) that completes the central Par6 PDZ domain ß-sheet as observed for other PDZ ligands <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Internal PBMs are poorly characterised, but typically consist of a hydrophobic amino acid followed by an acidic residue (mimicking the carboxy-terminal interaction of canonical PBMs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The key Llgl1 residue I710 occupies a hydrophobic pocket formed by L169, F171, I173 and M235 within the PDZ cleft and is followed by E711 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). P712 inserts towards the PDZ core disfavouring the PDZ conformation that binds carboxy-terminal PBM motifs with high affinity (see further).</p><p id="P7">Tethering of either end of the Llgl1 loop (10-11) to aPKCι<sup>KD</sup> and Par6<sup>PDZ</sup> respectively as described above has three consequences. First, it separates the extremities of the loop and guides both into a deep cleft formed between aPKCι<sup>KD</sup> and Par6<sup>PDZ</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Second, it brings two segments of the loop into close proximity to bridge between aPKCι<sup>KD</sup> and Par6<sup>PDZ</sup> by forming a molecular “plug” domain nucleated around the single site phosphorylation at Llgl1<sup>pS663</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). The phospho-serine 663 site (Llgl1<sup>pS663</sup>) identified in the cryo-EM potential map forms a salt bridge with R661<sup>Llgl1</sup> which packs against the F664<sup>Llgl1</sup> sidechain. These two residues in turn engage a conserved hydrophobic pocket within the aPKCι<sup>KD</sup> C-lobe (involving residues F413, F471, L475). The plug domain itself has a small hydrophobic core made up of L660 and V706 and the aliphatic parts of several basic residues (K658/R665/R708) that cross from one side of the cleft to the other.</p><p id="P8">The third consequence of the tethered ends of Llgl1 loop (10-11) is to trap the P-site in a non-productive conformation for phosphorylation progression. By forming the plug domain around Llgl1<sup>pS663</sup>, the P-site effectively blocks access of S655 and S659 phospho-acceptor sites to the aPKCι substrate cleft and catalytic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). The organization of this tripartite structure argues that the aPKCι-Par6α heterodimer captures Llgl1, preventing its critical membrane-interaction motif within the P-site from binding to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the identification of this inhibited state further argues that additional steps must take place to promote multisite phosphorylation and in turn release Lgl from the complex.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Evidence for an Lgl multi-site phosphorylation trajectory</title><p id="P9">The observation that only Llgl1<sup>S663</sup> in the P-site was phosphorylated within the cryo-EM structure agrees with previous <italic>in vitro</italic> peptide substrate studies that the C-terminal phosphorylation of the P-site is catalytically favoured <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and presented first to aPKC. To support these findings, we investigated how the P-site is presented in its unphosphorylated state. A peptide spanning the Llgl1 P-site binds the aPKCι<sup>KD</sup> with an apparent affinity (K<sub>d</sub>) of 48nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Figure 2a</xref>). We then screened for crystals of the Llgl1 and Llgl2 P-site peptides and determined a medium resolution structure for the Llgl2 P-site peptide spanning residues 634-662 bound to aPKCι<sup>KD</sup> in the absence of nucleotide. Llgl2 P-site is identical to the Llgl1 sequence in this region but is ten residues shorter in numbering. The co-crystal structure of aPKCι<sup>KD</sup>- Llgl2<sup>P-site</sup> revealed ordered contacts between residues 650-656 of the Llgl P-site, including the C-terminal S653 (equivalent to Llgl1 S663). In this poise, Llgl2<sup>S653</sup> is bound ready for phospho-transfer, with Llgl2<sup>F654</sup> in the hydrophobic +1 pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Figure 2b</xref>). The R655 sidechain hydrogen bonds to the G398 carbonyl and a phosphate oxygen from phospho-T412, while R651 sidechain at the -2 position, relative to the phospho-acceptor, lies in a pocket formed between Y419 and E445 of aPKCι (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Figure 2b</xref>). The structure confirms the Llgl P-site binds aPKC thereby presenting Llgl2<sup>S653</sup> (equivalent to Llgl1<sup>S663</sup>) for initial phosphorylation, consistent with the cryo-EM structure. Absent from the X-ray structure is the L640-S641-R642 motif, suggesting that this motif may not be crucial for the initial C-terminal Llgl1/Llgl2 phosphorylation. We propose phosphorylation progression of the two amino-terminal sites can be modelled from previous substrate peptide structures (PDB codes 5LIH and 4DC2) corresponding a short (F<sup>-5</sup>)-X-(R<sup>-3</sup>) motif or a long (F<sup>-9</sup>)-X-(R<sup>-7</sup>) motif binding mode respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. These modes differ in the register between the bound L-S-R motif and phospho-acceptor sites Llgl1 S655 and S659, which individually fit the (F<sup>-5</sup>)-X-(R<sup>-3</sup>) and (F<sup>-9</sup>)-X-(R<sup>-7</sup>) motif. Superposition of previous substrate structures (PDB codes 4DC2 and 5LIH) indicate the precise conformational movement required to position the two N-terminal phospho-acceptor serine residues S655 and S659 close to the gamma-phosphate of ATP. In each case the phospho-acceptor C-alpha position would need a substantial conformational shift of 9.7Å and 13.4Å respectively from the cryo-EM structure to be available for phospho-transfer. Thus, we can predict the phosphorylation trajectory from snapshots of unphosphorylated peptide (X-ray structure) to a stalled initial site phosphorylation (cryo-EM structure) and predicting the S655 and S659 phosphorylation binding poses based on related substrate peptide structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Although the C-terminal P-site phosphorylation (mono-phosphorylated at Llgl1<sup>S663</sup>) state is the predominant form captured within the complex, further phosphorylation can be driven <italic>in vitro</italic> by adding ATP.Mg<sup>2+</sup> to the complex. This increases the phosphorylation on the N-terminal S655/659 sites, but not on the C-terminal S663 site as it is already stoichiometrically phosphorylated as judged by immunoblot with antibodies specifically recognizing these phospho-sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended data Figure 2c</xref>), supporting our structure of the single mono-phosphorylated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2h</xref>). Interestingly, previous <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have shown that overexpression of the S656A/S660A double mutation (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Lgl numbering for the N-terminal sites) acts as a potent inhibitor of aPKC, but did not clarify the underlying reason for the specific impact of this mutant version <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Phosphorylation at the available C-terminal serine would mimic the stalled phospho-intermediate, effectively trapping aPKC-Par6-Lgl in a state equivalent to that observed in our cryo-EM analysis, thereby explaining the increased ability of this mutant to inhibit aPKC.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Behaviour of Llgl interface mutations <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="P11">We then explored how different contacts within the complex contribute to stabilization of the stalled enzyme-intermediate state. To do this we prepared disruptive mutations at the different conserved interfaces within Llgl2, a close human homologue to Llgl1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> whose structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> and function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> is better characterised <italic>in cellulo</italic>. We interrogated interaction site mutants of Llgl2 expressed in HEK cells designed from the Llgl1 tripartite structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>) by assessing their impact on the formation of the tripartite complex. Knowledge of the Llgl1 interaction site with the aPKCι RIPR-motif, allowed us to assess the impact of mutations on either partner through engineering charge reversal mutations to disrupt Llgl2 interaction with the aPKCι RIPR-motif. Consistent with our Llgl1-containing complex structure, we observed that formation of a stable complex between aPKCι and Llgl2 required co-expression with Par6α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). When only aPKCι and Llgl2 were co-expressed, very low levels of aPKCι were recovered bound to GFP-Llgl2. Mutating the RIPR motif in aPKCι to DIPD (or a corresponding DPYSD&gt;RPYSR mutation in Llgl2) suppressed the ability of Par6 to stabilize the tripartite complex, validating the structurally observed interface, in line with previous observations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Evidence that the stability of the three-way complex is governed primarily by the Par6 contact is shown by mutation of the PBM residue in Llgl2 at I700 (hereafter Llgl2<sup>IE&gt;NE</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). Disrupting this key hydrophobic contact to the Par6 PDZ completely abolished the interaction with aPKCι and Par6 in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). These data indicate that formation of a stable complex at steady state requires a three-way interaction involving an aPKC kinase domain-Lgl contact (driven by the aPKCι RIPR motif) and crucially a Par6-Lgl contact (driven by the Par6 PDZ domain).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Impact of Lgl mutations in polarised cells and <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P12">To explore the behaviour of the validated interface mutants in the context of polarised cells, we expanded on a published phenotype in cultured epithelial cells, whereby wild type Llgl2 overexpression causes a loss of polarity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. We engineered human DLD1 epithelial colorectal cancer cells to overexpress either wild type (WT) GFP-Llgl2 or variants harbouring interface mutations that we had characterised in the kinase-docking DPYSD motif (Llgl2<sup>DPYSD&gt;RPYSR</sup>), the PBM motif (Llgl2<sup>IE&gt;NE</sup>) as well as the substrate docking LSR motif (Llgl2<sup>LSR&gt;ASA</sup>). Each mutant expression was driven from a doxycycline-inducible promotor. In the absence of doxycycline, these cells display a largely polarized phenotype with intact ZO-1 staining indicating properly formed tight junctions and polarised cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a,c</xref>). Inducing WT Llgl2 expression results in a dominant membrane localization of the overexpressed protein and loss of polarity, as evidenced by a complete loss of intact ZO-1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a,c</xref>). By contrast, when expression of the PBM Llgl2<sup>IE&gt;NE</sup> mutant is induced, no dominant phenotype is observed, and levels of intact ZO-1 staining are similar to the non-induced condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b,c</xref>). Although a subfraction of the mutated protein does localize to the plasma membrane, the majority remains in the cytoplasm and notably also clusters in foci that stain positive for the trans-Golgi marker TGN46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Figure 3a</xref>). Lgl has initially been shown to localize at the Golgi, and the localization of this mutant may therefore reflect a distinct state of this protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. By contrast, overexpressing either the kinase domain contacting Llgl2<sup>DPYSD&gt;RPYSR</sup> or Llgl2<sup>LSR&gt;ASA</sup> variants – or a non-phosphorylatable triple serine to alanine mutant (Llgl2<sup>SSS&gt;AAA</sup>) – resulted in a similar phenotype to that seen with overexpressed WT Llgl2, with a predominant membrane localization and loss of intact ZO1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Figure 3b,c</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In parallel with these observations, we studied tripartite complex formation and Llgl2 phosphorylation at steady state in these cells. The WT Llgl2 protein forms a stable complex with aPKCι and Par6, similar to a non-phosphorylatable Llgl2<sup>SSS&gt;AAA</sup> mutant. This indicates that overexpressed Llgl2 accumulates endogenous aPKCι-Par6 into a stalled complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>). The Llgl2<sup>IE&gt;NE</sup> mutant on the other hand did not form a stable complex with aPKCι-Par6 at steady state in the DLD1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>), consistent with our observations in HEK293 cells. However, compared to the WT protein, the PBM mutant Llgl2<sup>IE&gt;NE</sup> shows increased phosphorylation, predominantly at the N-terminal serine sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>). This observation argues that the Llgl2<sup>IE&gt;NE</sup> protein forms only a transient phosphorylation complex with aPKCι, and conversely that stable interaction of WT Llgl2 with Par6 suppresses catalytic activity – mainly at the N-terminal Ser-645/649 phosphorylation sites. Additionally, the transient interaction of the Llgl2<sup>IE&gt;NE</sup> mutant allows for the phosphorylation of endogenous Llgl1/2 by aPKC-Par6, while the overexpressed WT mutant supresses this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended data Figure 3d</xref>). The third mutant Llgl2<sup>LSR&gt;ASA</sup> displays slightly elevated levels of phosphorylation skewed towards its C-terminal phosphorylation sites, while exhibiting wild type levels of N-terminal Ser phosphorylation and tripartite complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d,e</xref>). The fact that this mutation results in higher relative levels of C-terminally phosphorylated Llgl2 argues that there is an increased turnover rate compared to the WT protein and supports the notion that the LSR motif aids phosphorylation of the N-terminal Ser-645/649 sites, but appears dispensable under these conditions. The Llgl2<sup>DPYSD&gt;RPYSR</sup> mutant breaks the aPKCι docking contact, leading to reduced Llgl2 binding to aPKCι and reduced levels of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d,e</xref>). In contrast to the HEK293 cells in the context of co-expression with Par6α, in DLD1 polarised cells the loss of the aPKC-Llgl2 contact is less disruptive to the three-way complex, with residual binding likely mediated by Par6. This is supported by the observation that treatment with an aPKC-selective chemical inhibitor CRT0329868 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> traps the PBM-defective Llgl2<sup>IE&gt;NE</sup> variant in the tripartite complex, whereas it has no such effect on the kinase contact Llgl2<sup>DPYSD&gt;RPYSR</sup> variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>), highlighting that binding to the kinase domain is impaired in the latter case and not in the former.</p><p id="P14">Taken together, these data suggest that overexpressed WT Llgl2 forms stable complexes with aPKCι-Par6, trapping it in an auto-inhibited complex with low turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f</xref>, <styled-content style="color:#FF0000">top row</styled-content>). The PBM mutant Llgl2<sup>IE&gt;NE</sup> instead forms a transient complex with aPKCι that is efficiently phosphorylated and released, resulting in a higher stoichiometry of phosphorylation and cytosolic protein that accumulates in the Golgi compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f</xref>, <styled-content style="color:#FF0000">middle row</styled-content>). The kinase docking Llgl2<sup>DPYSD&gt;RPYSR</sup> variant, in contrast, displays reduced levels of complex formation in the DLD1 cells and reduced capacity to form a productive enzyme-substrate complex with aPKCι-Par-6, resulting in reduced phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4f</xref>, <styled-content style="color:#FF0000">bottom row</styled-content>). Produced in excess, this mutant can disrupt polarity likely because it shows residual binding to aPKC, and cannot be cleared from membranes by phosphorylation, resulting in an increased pool of membrane-bound Llgl-2 acting on aPKC and other downstream effectors such as Myosin II <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">To characterise these Lgl mutants <italic>in vivo</italic>, we investigated whether these Lgl mutants could support epithelial apical-basal polarity in the monolayered follicular epithelium of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary.

However, these mutants have distinct functional and localization properties. First, the PBM mutant Lgl<sup>IE&gt;NE</sup> retains some ability to sustain apical-basal polarization as indicated by the polarized enrichment of aPKC in monolayered patches that lack endogenous Lgl but express Lgl<sup>IE&gt;NE</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4h</xref>, <styled-content style="color:#FF0000">closeup</styled-content>). In contrast, the mutant disrupting the kinase domain contacts, Lgl<sup>DPYSD&gt;RPYSR</sup>, is unable to support polarity. Second, whereas Lgl<sup>IE&gt;NE</sup> is cleared from the apical compartment and restricted to the basolateral cortex in polarized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4i</xref> <styled-content style="color:#FF0000">panel C</styled-content>), the Lgl<sup>DPYSD&gt;RPYSR</sup> mutant distributes all over the cell, invading the apical domain even in control nlsRFP positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4j</xref>, <styled-content style="color:#FF0000">closeup</styled-content>). Apical invasion by the Lgl<sup>DPYSD&gt;RPYSR</sup> mutant is consistent with the lack of Lgl phosphorylation, since it cannot form a productive tripartite complex with aPKC-Par6 promoting its removal. Taken together, these data stress the <italic>in vivo</italic> significance of the stability of the aPKC-Par6-Lgl complex and the dynamics of complex turnover in relation to the phenotype. Inappropriate early release of the Par6 PDZ domain in the Lgl<sup>IE&gt;NE</sup> mutant likely promotes untimely complex disassembly and reduces the ability of Lgl to antagonize aPKC to maintain apical-basal organization.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Cdc42 and Crb trigger ATP exchange and complex disassembly</title><p id="P17">Having established that the Par6<sup>PDZ</sup> engagement is crucial for stalling the complex, we investigated possible triggers for its release. A prime candidate is Cdc42-GTP that has been shown to induce a conformational switch in Par6<sup>PDZ</sup> to alter its PDZ specificity for C-terminal PBM partners <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). However, the biological significance and context for this allosteric switch mechanism has not been demonstrated. Comparison of the PDZ domain conformation bound to the internal Llgl1 PBM shows close similarity to the previously reported complex with an internal Pals1 PBM ligand <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). However, comparison to the Crumbs3 (Crb3) C-terminal PBM bound complex revealed a steric clash between P712 of Llgl1 (within the PBM at I710-E711) and a lysine in Par6 (K165 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Par6, equivalent to K162 of human Par6). This lysine is part of an allosteric dipeptide switch motif (L164/K165 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Par6 and H161/K162 in human Par6) that has been proposed to bind Crb3 with high affinity in the presence of Cdc42-GTP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data Figure 4a</xref>). Furthermore, the overall conformation of the carboxylate binding loop between β-strands 1 and 2 of the PDZ domain also contributes to the affinity switch by sterically hindering internal PBM ligands. We therefore considered whether Cdc42-GTP could act as a trigger to release Par6<sup>PDZ</sup> within the aPKC-Par6-Lgl complex, enabling an apical PBM partner such as Crumbs to bind Par6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). Consistent with this, a study by Dong et al. indeed proposed that Crumbs was required to switch Par6 from an inhibitory role to an activating role <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P18">To test these ideas, we co-expressed aPKCι-Par6α together with GFP-Llgl2 in cells, immobilised the tripartite complex on GFP-Trap beads, and then added recombinant Cdc42-GTPγS with a Q61L mutant preventing GTP hydrolysis and/or Crb3 PBM peptide. Comparing the residual bound protein fraction, we observed that the stability of the aPKCι-Par6α-Llgl2 complex was compromised by Cdc42-GTP but also required Crb3 PBM, leading to a 50% reduction in aPKCι-Par6α binding after 20 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). ATP alone also disassembled the complex, presumably by driving phosphorylation to completion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2g</xref>). Adding both Cdc42/Crb3 and ATP led to an even more efficient release of aPKCι-Par6α with very low residual binding remaining after 20 minutes. These data indicate that Cdc42 and Crb3 PBM can destabilize the tripartite complex and that phosphorylation drives full dissociation. We therefore wondered if Cdc42-mediated PBM release impacted the ATP-driven release of aPKCι-Par6α. In order to probe this effect, we followed complex dissociation kinetics with ATP, Cdc42/Crb3 or both at 16°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). In these assays, the complex was preloaded with ADP to reflect the product state of the complex after the first reaction step. ATP or Cdc42/Crb3 PBM alone dissociates only a small fraction of the complex under these reaction conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data Figure 4b-d</xref>). Adding both Cdc42/Crb3 PBM and ATP to the ADP-preloaded complex resulted in a full release of aPKCι-Par6α after 15 minutes. Importantly when the complex was not preloaded with ADP, ATP itself was sufficient to drive a large proportion of aPKCι-Par6α release, which occurred very rapidly after addition – with about 20% of the complex remaining intact after 2.5 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data Figure 4e-g</xref>). This indicates that in the apo state of the complex obtained during immunoprecipitation (∼80%), ATP loading, phosphorylation and release are efficient, while in the ADP-bound state (∼20%), reflecting the likely nucleotide-pocket status of the stalled complex within the cell, requires both Cdc42/Crb3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data Figure 4e-h</xref>). The reaction rate is thus limited by ADP release and we conclude that Cdc42/Crb3 PBM binding to the Par6 PDZ enhances this rate limiting nucleotide release step. The ATP-bound conformation in itself is not sufficient to drive release, as AMP-PNP loading does not result in release of aPKC-Par6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended data Figure 4i</xref>). Also the cryo-EM structure was prepared with AMP-PNP, indicating that processive phosphorylation is required for release.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S9"><title>Mechanistic model for Lgl capture by aPKC-Par6, mutual inhibition and release</title><p id="P19">Using cryo-EM, biochemical, cellular and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, we have identified and validated key interaction sites and their functional roles within the tripartite aPKC-Par-6-Lgl complex, leading to an integrated mechanistic model of complex assembly, mutual inhibition and dissolution. Our data reveal how Lgl is initially captured and oriented in a coordinated fashion by aPKC and Par6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>). aPKC docks onto the second beta-propeller of Lgl using a crucial previously-identified RIPR-docking motif and a large interface consisting of an aPKC-specific C-lobe insert <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The complex is held together by the Par6 PDZ domain interaction with the C-terminal part of the (10-11) loop harbouring an internal PBM motif. A single C-terminal P-site phosphorylation event promotes contacts with aPKC<sup>KD</sup> proximal to the activation loop in the C-lobe, driving formation of a molecular plug that bridges aPKC and Par6. This plug maintains the N-terminal phosphorylation sites oriented away from the substrate cleft and catalytic site. In this complexed and inhibited state, phosphorylation progression is inefficient as the P-site and PBM motifs are tethered – effectively stalling phosphorylation. When the Par6 PDZ domain dissociates to release the Lgl<sup>PBM</sup>, however, an event that can be triggered by a Cdc42-dependent conformational change (assisted by an apical protein with a high affinity C-terminal PBM), Lgl P-site phosphorylation is allowed to progress. This model explains why interface mutations that block aPKCι docking with Lgl prevent phosphorylation and disrupt monolayer organization and polarity <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas mutations that perturb Par6 PDZ domain capture of the Lgl protein also do not support maintenance of normal apical-basal organization <italic>in vivo</italic>, yet substantially enhance Lgl phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended data Figure 5</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Several models (reviewed in Ref 1.) have proposed that the aPKCι-Par6 complex antagonises Lgl by displacing it from the apical membrane by Cdc42-induced phosphorylation and dissolution, but how then does Lgl reciprocally antagonise aPKC in the bound state? Our structure suggests that disassembly of the tripartite complex requires both multi-site phosphorylation of the Lgl P-site <italic><underline>and</underline></italic> release of the Par6<sup>PDZ</sup> from Lgl. When the Par6 PDZ domain is engaged, we find that the progression of P-site multi-site phosphorylation is impeded. Lgl thus effectively antagonises aPKC-Par6 by trapping it in a tethered product state. We propose that controlled release of Par6 under normal circumstances arises through a Cdc42 induced conformational change and/or competition with binding partners of Par6 at the apical membrane, such as Crumbs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> leading to plug domain dissolution, rapid ADP to ATP exchange and progression of phosphorylation and disassembly of the tripartite complex. An important implication of this model is that if Lgl encounters aPKC at the basolateral membrane, it inhibits its activity and escorts aPKC away. Such a repressed tripartite aPKC-Par6-Llgl complex would therefore be able to “sense” the apical membrane compartment that contains multiple (competing) partners of Par6 and could respond accordingly unleashing aPKC-Par6 catalytic activity. Our model can also explain the apparently conflicting roles of Par6 as an auxiliary subunit of aPKC – where it is able both to activate and to repress aPKC activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, in addition to contributing to substrate targeting of Lgl.</p><p id="P21">The precedent set by the existence of the stalled intermediate state that we describe here, as well as the requirement for additional regulatory inputs to facilitate nucleotide exchange has broader implications for kinases.

Mutational interrogation of the interfaces that define this complex confirms their critical role in determining polarity. Completion of the reaction cycle based on mutagenesis and reconstitution experiments demonstrate that the subsequent engagement of Cdc42.GTP, switching the Par6 PDZ domain to engage with a Crumbs C-terminal PBM, promotes nucleotide exchange, creating an efficient ATP-dependent completion of phosphorylation and dissociation of the complex. These unprecedented properties revealed through structural analysis provide a comprehensive view of mutual inhibition of aPKC-Par6 and Lgl, the regulatory inputs that determine the dynamics of their engagement and set a series of important precedents informing on kinase-substrate relationships in this system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell lines and reagents</title><p id="P23">HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) Fetal Bovine serum (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 100U/ml Penicillin and 100µg/ml Streptomycin (ThermoFisher scientific).

The IE&gt;NE mutant in the PBM bypasses the plugged state of the complex, leading to rapid phosphorylation progression and complex dissolution. The LSR&gt;ASA mutant of the high-affinity kinase docking motif is less stably tethered to the kinase domain as the wild-type protein, resulting in more rapid release combined with less efficient N-terminal Ser phosphorylation, while C-terminal phosphorylation is unaffected. The RPYSR mutant displays a decreased kinase domain interaction and is unable to correctly position the kinase domain for efficient phospho-transfer, resulting in an overall suppression of phosphorylation. The SSS&gt;AAA non-phosphorylatable mutant is trapped in the capture state as it cannot be phosphorylated to form the initial product state required to assemble the plug. It behaves similar to the WT protein in overexpressed conditions, which is trapped in the plugged state, as it likely saturates the endogenous release mechanism impeding the progression of the reaction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199063-f010"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Extended data figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS199063-supplement-Extended_data_figure_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d20aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Extended data figure 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS199063-supplement-Extended_data_figure_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d20aAcFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Extended data figure 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS199063-supplement-Extended_data_figure_3.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d20aAcFdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Extended data figure 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS199063-supplement-Extended_data_figure_4.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d20aAcFeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Extended data figure 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS199063-supplement-Extended_data_figure_5.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d20aAcFfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Extended data figure legends</label><media xlink:href="EMS199063-supplement-Extended_data_figure_legends.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" id="d20aAcFgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the McDonald laboratory for helpful comments.

The superposition reflects the likely ground state of the Lgl P-site in its unphosphorylated state and the conformational change induced upon phosphorylation of the initial pS663 site referred to as the “stalled” state. (f) Proposed reconstruction of phosphorylation progression trajectory from the unphosphorylated state to the “stalled” state (pS663) to a double (pS659-pS663) then triple phosphorylation state (pS655-pS659-pS663). Previous structures have shown how substrates with an F<sup>-9</sup>XR<sup>-7</sup> motif drive phospho-acceptor phosphorylation or through an F<sup>-5</sup>XR<sup>-3</sup> motif (PDB codes 4DC2 and 5LIH). The LSR motif of Llgl1/2 conformation adopts an identical pose to the FSR motif within the Par3 CR3 domain, we propose that release of the “captured” poise (see later) enables rotation of the P-site into the substrate binding pocket for double (pS659-pS663) and subsequent triple phosphorylation (pS655-pS659-pS663).

(d) Model for a full phosphorylation cycle for Lgl driven by aPKC-Par6 integrating findings reported here. Lgl is captured through the DPYSD motif interaction with the aPKC kinase domain RIPR motif. The complex is stabilized through the Par6<sup>PDZ</sup>-Lgl<sup>PBM</sup> contact and an initial phosphorylation event at the C-terminal Ser residue setting up the formation of the plug domain. Further phosphorylation in this stable complex is proposed to be inefficient as the P-site is rotated away from the active site and stabilized by the molecular plug. When the PDZ contact is released by Cdc42-GTP and by a competing PBM-containing protein, the Lgl P-site can be efficiently phosphorylated leading to kinase release (for details see text).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199063-f005"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM data collection, refinement and validation statistics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" style="border-top: 2px solid green;border-bottom: 1px solid #008000"/><th valign="top" align="left" style="border-top: 2px solid #008000;border-bottom: 1px solid #008000">aPKCiota-Par6-Llgl1<break/>(EMDB-18877)<break/>(PDB 8R3Y)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><bold>Data collection and processing</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Magnification</td><td valign="top" align="left">165000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Voltage (kV)</td><td valign="top" align="left">300</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Electron exposure (e–/Å<sup>2</sup>)</td><td valign="top" align="left">48.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Defocus range (µm)</td><td valign="top" align="left">1.2-3.0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Pixel size (Å)</td><td valign="top" align="left">0.82</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Symmetry imposed</td><td valign="top" align="left">C1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Initial particle images (no.)</td><td valign="top" align="left">48000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Final particle images (no.)</td><td valign="top" align="left">121194</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Map resolution (Å)</td><td valign="top" align="left">3.6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">     FSC threshold</td><td valign="top" align="left">0.143</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Map resolution range (Å)</td><td valign="top" align="left">10.6-2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"/><td valign="top" align="left"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><bold>Refinement</bold></td><td valign="top" align="left"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Initial model used (PDB code)</td><td valign="top" align="left">6N8Q, 8R3X, 1NF3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Model resolution (Å)</td><td valign="top" align="left">3.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">     FSC threshold</td><td valign="top" align="left">0.143</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Map sharpening <italic>B</italic> factor (Å<sup>2</sup>)</td><td valign="top" align="left">67.0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Model composition</td><td valign="top" align="left"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">     Non-hydrogen atoms</td><td valign="top" align="left">10132</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">     Protein residues</td><td valign="top" align="left">1374</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">     Ligands</td><td valign="top" align="left">1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left"><italic>B</italic> factors (Å<sup>2</sup>)</td><td valign="top" align="left"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">     Protein</td><td valign="top" align="left">52.95</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">     Ligand</td><td valign="top" align="left">51.30</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">R.m.s. deviations</td><td valign="top" align="left"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">     Bond lengths (Å)</td><td valign="top" align="left">0.024</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">     Bond angles (°)</td><td valign="top" align="left">3.170</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Validation</td><td valign="top" align="left"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">     MolProbity score</td><td valign="top" align="left">2.27</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">      Clashscore</td><td valign="top" align="left">0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">     Poor rotamers (%)</td><td valign="top" align="left">3%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">Ramachandran plot</td><td valign="top" align="left"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">     Favored (%)</td><td valign="top" align="left">92%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left">     Allowed (%)</td><td valign="top" align="left">8%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-bottom: 2px solid #008000">     Disallowed (%)</td><td valign="top" align="left" style="border-bottom: 2px solid #008000">0%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
