Increasing evidence supports a role of CAP proteins in lipid binding. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> CAP protein LON-1 is known to regulate body size and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling. LON-1 is a secreted protein with a conserved CAP domain and a C-terminal unstructured domain with no homology to other proteins. In this study, we report that the C-Terminal Domain (CTD) of LON-1 is dispensable for its function. Instead, key conserved residues located in the CAP domain are critical for LON-1 function in vivo. We further showed that LON-1 is capable of binding sterol, but not fatty acid, in vitro, and that certain key residues implicated in LON-1 function in vivo are also important for LON-1 sterol binding in vitro.

LON-1 is known as a negative regulator of body size, as <italic>lon-1</italic> mutant alleles produce worms with a long body length, and that <italic>lon-1</italic> transcription is negatively regulated by the BMP signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">M<sc>ADUZIA</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">M<sc>ORITA</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>). However, how LON-1 acts to regulate body size and modulate BMP signaling is not well understood. In this study, we carried out structure-function analysis of LON-1, with the goal of understanding its mechanism of action.</p><p id="P5">LON-1 is a predicted secreted protein belonging to the CAP protein superfamily, with an additional C-terminal tail that is predicted to be unstructured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). CAP (Cysteine-rich secretory proteins, Antigen-5, Pathogenesis-Related 1) superfamily (pfam PF00188) members are present in every kingdom of life, and they share a conserved CAP domain of approximately 150 amino acids that forms a characteristic alpha-beta-alpha structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">G<sc>IBBS</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">S<sc>CHNEITER AND</sc> D<sc>I</sc> P<sc>IETRO</sc> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">A<sc>BRAHAM AND</sc> C<sc>HANDLER</sc> 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">G<sc>AIKWAD</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).

One of the best studied CAP proteins is yeast Pry1. Pry1 is known to transport sterols and fatty acids out of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">C<sc>HOUDHARY AND</sc> S<sc>CHNEITER</sc> 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">D<sc>ARWICHE</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">D<sc>ARWICHE</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>).

This small molecule binding activity of the CAP domain seems to be conserved despite the diversity of the CAP superfamily, as human CRISP2, for example, can bind cholesterol in vitro and can rescue the cholesterol accumulation phenotype seen in Pry1 deficient yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">C<sc>HOUDHARY AND</sc> S<sc>CHNEITER</sc> 2012</xref>).

These additional domains are thought to confer specificity to CAP protein functions, such as the ion channel regulatory domain (ICR) within the CRISP (Cysteine-rich secretory protein) subfamily of CAP proteins that confers ion channel blocking activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">G<sc>AIKWAD</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>).

Since LON-1 is a secreted protein, it may carry sterols with it as it is transported through the secretory pathway to either deliver sterols to either the cellular membranes or to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Several members of the tetraspanin family, such as TSP-12, TSP-14 and TSP-21, are known regulators of the BMP signaling pathway and localize to both the cell surface and intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">L<sc>IU</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">W<sc>ANG</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">L<sc>IU</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">L<sc>IU</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2022</xref>).

LON-1 could use an affinity for sterols to associate with the TEMs or transport sterols to the TEMs.</p><p id="P35">Alternatively, and not mutually exclusively, LON-1 may help transport/deliver sterols to the apical extracellular matrix (aECM). <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms are known to be coated with a cuticle that is composed of multiple layers of aECM components that include lipids and lipid-modified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">S<sc>UNDARAM AND</sc> P<sc>UJOL</sc> 2024</xref>).

Such a role of LON-1 could help shape the worm body and regulate body size. Consistent with this idea, a number of cuticle collagen genes have been implicated in body size regulation, and reciprocal interactions between BMP signaling and cuticle collagens have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">N<sc>YSTROM</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">S<sc>UZUKI</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Y<sc>IN</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">M<sc>ADAAN</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">L<sc>AKDAWALA</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">M<sc>ADAAN</sc> <italic>et al</italic>. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">G<sc>OODMAN AND</sc> S<sc>AVAGE</sc>-D<sc>UNN</sc> 2022</xref>).

In this case, free cholesterol released by SCL-12 and SCL-13-dependent internal deposits allows the activation of the mTORC1 pathway during the transition from quiescence to growth.

LON-1 may play a role in mediating these interactions via its ability to bind sterol. Finally, LON-1 is likely to have sterol-independent functions as well, given the observations that LON-1(E153A) did not exhibit any sterol-binding defects in vitro yet caused severe body size and Susm phenotypes in vivo. E153 could be one of the key residues mediating interactions between LON-1 and its non-sterol binding partners. Ultimately, further investigation is needed to determine LON-1’s mechanism of action in both body size regulation and in BMP signal transduction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS199211-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d53aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S19"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Josh Arribere, Dan Dickinson, Andy Fire, Bob Goldstein for plasmids, Erika Beyrent and Gunther Hollopeter for sharing CRISPR protocol, our late technician Herong Shi for generating the <italic>lon-1</italic> expression construct in S2 cells, and members of the Liu lab for helpful discussions and critical comments on the manuscript.

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Article Summary</title></caption><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> LON-1 protein is known to regulate body size and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling. However, its molecular mode of action remains elusive. This study shows that LON-1 can bind sterol, but not fatty acid, in vitro. Furthermore, key conserved residues in the CAP domain of LON-1 are required for LON-1 function in vivo. These findings suggest a role of LON-1 in regulating body size and BMP signaling via sterol binding.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Summary of null and endogenously tagged <italic>lon-1</italic> alleles.</title><p>(A) Schematic of the <italic>lon-1</italic> gene, including the canonical <italic>e185</italic> allele, and the null allele generated in this study, <italic>jj284</italic>.
