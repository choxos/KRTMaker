tumorigenesis. DSBs are mainly repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). The selection of the DSB repair pathway primarily depends on the DNA resection of the DSB ends. Indeed, HR is initiated by resection at the DSB generating 3' single stranded extension. The shieldin complex prevents resection fostering DSB repair toward NHEJ. Here, we reveal that the inflammasome sensor NLRP3 facilitates DNA end resection to promote the HR pathway in an inflammasome-independent manner. Strikingly, NLRP3 silencing decreases HR efficiency, as evidenced by RAD51 foci and functional HR assays. Mechanistically, we describe that NLRP3 interacts with REV7, a subunit of the shieldin complex, and its depletion increases REV7 recruitment to IR-induced DSBs. Similar to cancer cells harboring HR mutated genes, we find that NLRP3 deficient cells are sensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPi) and exhibit an epistatic relationship with BRCA1 deficiency. Remarkably, loss of REV7 in NLRP3-depleted cells induces PARPi resistance by restoring HR. This study unravels the crucial role of the innate immune receptor NLRP3 in regulating the selection of DSB repair pathways to maintain genome integrity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Maintaining genomic integrity is critical for tissue homeostasis. Genomic DNA is constantly exposed to stresses of exogenous and endogenous origin. DNA damage is detected by a sensing machinery called the DNA damage response (DDR), which promotes DNA repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most toxic lesions as defects in their repair result in increased chromosomal instability, premature aging and tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. These breaks are repaired by two major pathways: non homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). The HR pathway is considered to be the most faithful DDR, since it uses homologous sequences from the sister chromatid as a repair template. Cancer cells harboring mutations in genes affecting this pathway, such as <italic>BRCA1/2</italic>, are HR deficient (HRD) and vulnerable to PARP inhibitors (PARPi)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Although PARPi have improved patient survival, resistance mechanisms have emerged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. One of them, in the <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutated background, relies on the inactivation of the shieldin complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, which is composed of the SHLD-1,-2,-3 and REV7 proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. This complex acts downstream of 53BP1 and favors NHEJ by inhibiting DNA resection, a key step in HR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Assembly and disassembly of this complex is regulated by TRIP13 that entraps REV7 to decrease its dimerizing ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">NLRP3 is a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that fosters the formation of the inflammasome complex in response to pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or DAMPs), inducing the production of mature IL-1α and IL-18, and pyroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. NLRP3 plays a critical role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, by sensing a wide range of stresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Though this PRR is mostly considered as a cytosolic protein, nuclear and inflammasome-independent functions are emerging. In the context of genome stability, NLRP3 was recently reported to interact with ATM and to enhance its activation in response to DNA DSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Whether NLRP3 controls the DSB repair machinery remains unknown.</p><p id="P4">Here, we report that NLRP3 is located in close proximity to γH2AX foci, and demonstrate that it promotes the HR pathway by inhibiting REV7 to allow DNA end resection. HR deficiency is further supported by showing that NLRP3 expression is inversely correlated with the homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) score in breast cancers and by PARPi test sensitivity. Lastly, PARPi sensitivity is abolished by co-depletion of NLRP3/REV7, as previously demonstrated for BRCA1, re-enforcing the notion that NLRP3 and BRCA1 participate in the same functional pathway.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>NLRP3 facilitates homologous recombination</title><p id="P5">To test whether NLRP3 is involved in DSB repair, we first induced DNA damage by ionizing radiation (IR) in control or NLRP3-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells (HR-proficient triple-negative breast cancer cell line expressing NLRP3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>) and performed a comet assay. At the single-cell level, NLRP3 depletion by shRNA resulted in a significantly increase in tail moment suggesting an altered DNA repair capacity compared with control conditions after IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). To strengthen this observation, DNA damage was induced using etoposide (Eto) treatment (inhibitor of topoisomerase II), and produced similar results in NLRP3-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that NLRP3 plays a role in maintaining genome stability. Although, we previously showed that a fraction of NLRP3 is present in the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, whether it is recruited to the site of damage was not known. We next asked whether NLRP3 was located in the vicinity of DSBs by performing proximity-ligation assays (PLA) using antibodies directed against NLRP3 and gH2AX, a DSB marker. We specifically detected nuclear PLA signals only in response to IR treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1B</xref>) that were absent in shNLRP3- or siH2AX-treated cells, indicating that NLRP3 is in close proximity to DSBs following DNA damage.</p><p id="P6">To determine the mechanism underlying the defect in DSB repair in the absence of NLRP3, we next examined the formation of RAD51 and 53BP1 foci as markers of HR and NHEJ respectively in response to IR. We observed a strong decrease in RAD51 foci in cells lacking NLRP3 compared with controls and a small increase in 53BP1 foci suggesting a defect in HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1C</xref>). This defect in RAD51 foci was also observed in response to Eto treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1D</xref>). Consistently, the use of another shRNA targeting the 3’UTR sequence of NLRP3 together with the expression of exogenous NLRP3 rescued RAD51 foci formation demonstrating that NLRP3 acts on HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P7">To assess the role of NLRP3 on HR, we performed cell line-based reporter assays with U-2 OS cells containing one stable copy of the DR-GFP reporter cassette<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> in which the expression of the enzyme HA-I-SceI induces a site-specific DSB. There were significantly fewer GFP+ cells following transfection with siNLRP3 and I-Sce1 compared to the siCTRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref> et <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1F</xref>). As a control, knock-down of CtIP, a nuclease of the resection step, results in decrease GFP+ cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Conversely, in cells displaying exogenous NLRP3 expression, an increase in the number of GFP+ cells was observed compared to the control, after I-SceI transfection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1G</xref>). Taken together, these results show that NLRP3 positively regulates HR.</p><p id="P8">We next wondered whether NLRP3-depleted cells were sensitive to PARPi treatment, as <italic>BRCA1</italic>-deficient tumors are HR-deficient (HRD) and PARPi sensitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the sensitivity of NLRP3-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells to talazoparib and olaparib, two PARPi with varying PARP trapping efficacies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. siBRCA1 was used as positive control, and as expected, BRCA1 depletion strongly sensitized cells to PARPi treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1H</xref>). Although milder than BRCA1 depletion, NLRP3 depletion resulted in significant sensitivity to both PARPi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1H</xref>). NLRP3 and BRCA1 co-depletion resulted in a similar level of sensitivity than BRCA1 alone, suggesting an epistatic relationship. Finally, U-2 OS cells expressing shNLRP3 were also sensitive to talazoparib (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1I</xref>), reinforcing the direct role of NLRP3 in this effect. Mutations in the <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> gene were originally associated with HRD. However, the notion of BRCAness phenotype has since been broadened and the HR-deficiency score is now calculated using the HRD and genome scarring score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Here, we investigated the correlation between NLRP3 expression and the HRD score in breast cancers. Tumors expressing a high HRD score displayed lower levels of NLRP3, substantiating our findings that reduced NLRP3 expression is correlated with HR deficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 1J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>NLRP3 is required for DNA end resection in HR</title><p id="P9">HR is initiated at DSBs by 5’ DNA end resection generating 3’ single stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhangs and bound by replication factor A (RPA) complex which can be visualized by immunofluorescence as RPA2 foci. Here, IR-induced RPA2 foci formation was strongly reduced upon NLRP3 depletion by respectively shRNA or siRNA in MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and U-2 OS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 2A</xref>) compared to control. In line with these observations, the absence of NLRP3 also resulted in reduced etoposide-induced phosphorylation of RPA2 on Ser4/8, suggesting a defect in resection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 2B</xref>). To test whether NLRP3’s role on resection was an inflammasome-independent function, we quantified RPA2 foci formation in the presence of MCC950, a specific NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. We found that MCC950 did not affect RPA2 foci recruitment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 2C</xref>). Given that MDA-MB- 231 cells do not express the inflammasome core protein ASC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, which is required for inflammasome function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 2D</xref>), these results collectively support the notion that NLRP3, and not the inflammasome, is required for DSB repair via HR.</p><p id="P10">It was recently reported that NLRP3 regulates part of the activity of ATM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Since ATM inhibition is known to decrease RPA2 foci formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, we examined whether the impact of NLRP3 on RPA2 recruitment following IR was due to its effect on ATM. As previously described, the ATM inhibitor (ATMi KU55933) impaired RPA2 recruitment to DSBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, and this effect was even stronger in the absence of NLRP3, albeit at residual ATM activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 2F</xref>). We also confirmed the impact of ATMi on RAD51 recruitment compared with NLRP3 depletion. We similarly observed that the absence of NLRP3 dramatically reduced RAD51 foci formation compared with ATMi and the combination of both synergize, suggesting a possible role for NLRP3 independent of ATM regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To determine whether this phenotype was due to reduced DNA end resection, we used a resection assay jointly developed by T. Paull and G. Legube on DIvA cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. The amount of ssDNA decreased in the absence of CtIP used as a positive control for resection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. NLRP3 depletion also significantly decreased the amount of resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Altogether these results suggest that NLRP3 positively regulates the HR pathway by facilitating DNA end resection.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>NLRP3 associates with TRIP13 and REV7, two known actors of DSB repair</title><p id="P12">To further elucidate the function of NLRP3 in DDR, we sought NLRP3-binding partners by screening proteins that bind to FLAG-tagged NLRP3 (FLAG-NLRP3) in HeLa cells by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We identified TRIP13 among a group of proteins including the kinase NEK7, IPO5 and SUGT1 previously characterized as NLRP3-interactants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, validating our findings. Recently, the AAA+ ATPase remodeler TRIP13 has been reported to function in the DSB repair pathways via its control of REV7 conformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. TRIP13 acts on HORMA family proteins, such as REV7 or MAD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> by unwinding them to promote their conformational transition from closed to open, thereby inactivating them. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of FLAG-NLRP3 confirmed its interaction with endogenous TRIP13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We then performed a reciprocal IP by co-transfecting vectors expressing HA-tagged TRIP13 (HA-TRIP13) with FLAG-NLRP3 and showed that TRIP13 interacted with NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Since TRIP13 acts in DSB repair via its binding to REV7, we tested whether REV7 co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-NLRP3, and confirmed that NLRP3 pulled down endogenous REV7 but not MAD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). We then used FLAG-tagged REV7 and immunoprecipitated NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). To further explore these interactions, we generated a C-terminal deletion mutant of REV7 lacking the seatbelt region (REV7 1-152). As suggested in the literature, immunoprecipitation of REV7 1-152 did not pull-down TRIP13<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, while it did pull-down NLRP3 implying that NLRP3 and TRIP13 interact with REV7 through different motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F-G</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To determine whether the NLRP3 interaction with TRIP13 and REV7 is direct, we co-expressed MBP-NLRP3 and GST-REV7 or the three proteins MBP-NLRP3, GST-REV7 and GFP-TRIP13 in insect cells and purified the proteins via MBP affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Purified NLRP3 elutes in two peaks from SEC, peak 2 containing NLRP3 decamers involved in inflammasome assembly, while peak 1 contains more heterogeneous NLRP3 assemblies that exhibit ATP-hydrolysis activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Using Coomassie-stained SDS PAGE analysis we find that REV7 coeluted with NLRP3 species from peak 1, and to a lesser extend from peak 2, in the absence and in the presence of TRIP13, suggesting that NLRP3 does not require TRIP13 for binding to REV7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). The protein identity was confirmed by peptide mass fingerprint analysis which also identified known cofactors HSP90α/β and α/β-Tubulin. In addition, we purified recombinant MBP-NLRP3 peak 1, GST-REV7 and GST proteins separately, incubated both protein pairs and performed MBP pull-down experiments using amylose beads. After three washing steps, a faint band of GST-REV7, but not the control GST, comigrated with MBP-NLRP3 indicating the direct binary interaction of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup Figure 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>NLRP3 and TRIP13 display distinct functions on HR</title><p id="P15">Given that TRIP13 loss was previously reported to either sensitize cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> or not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> to PARPi, we compared the response of cells depleted in TRIP13 or in NLRP3 to control MDA-MB-231 cells using two PARPi.

Moreover, new functions in genome stability and DNA repair pathways are emerging.

Here, we discovered that NLRP3 is located at the vicinity of DSBs and is part of the machinery involved in selecting the DSB repair pathway to promote the HR pathway. This new function is independent of the inflammasome complex. It is also independent of its role on ATM activation as ATMi only moderately altered RPA and RAD51 foci formation compared to the strong phenotype obtained after NLRP3 knockdown, which only dampens a fraction of ATM activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Moreover, though REV7 recruitment was shown to rely partly on ATM activity, the increased REV7 foci formation in the absence of NLRP3 rules out a role via ATM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. In the literature, PRRs such as cGAS or AIM2 have been reported to play a role in DNA repair pathways. However, both receptors were shown to inhibit HR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.

However, we discovered that REV7 interacts with NLRP3 independently of TRIP13 and reported a functional interaction between both proteins.

For q-PCR, 40 ng of DNA per well was taken in triplicate to amplify the specific region of genomic DNA and the results were compared to the control sample. To calculate the percentage of ssDNA generated for each sample, we applied the following the formula described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> % ssDNA = 1/((POWER(2,Ct of BanI digested sample – Ct of non-digested sample – 1) + 0.5)) × 100. For normalization, tamoxifen-treated siCTRL cells were considered as 100 percent.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Comet Assay</title><p id="P46">Alkaline comet assay was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions (Biotechne, catalog no.4250-050-K). MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 3 h with etoposide (100 μM) or irradiated 4 h (5 Gy) before being pelleted and resuspended in cold PBS at a concentration of 2x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. Resuspended cells were then mixed with prewarmed 1% low-melting point agarose. The mix was then spread on a warm slide precoated with agarose. After 30 min at 4°C, slides were immersed in cold lysis solution for 1 h at 4°C in a dark chamber. The slides were then denatured in an alkaline buffer (NaOH 0.3 M, EDTA 1 mM) for 1 h in the dark at 4°C. The slides were subjected to electrophoresis in alkaline buffer for 30 min at 25 volts/300 mA at 4°C. After migration, slides were immersed in neutralizing buffer (0.4 M Tris, pH 7.5) for 10 min at 4°C. Finally, the cells were stained with Sybr Gold (Invitrogen, catalog no.S11494). Images were observed using a Nikon Eclipse Ni-E fluorescence microscope at 40x and analysis was performed on at least 50 comets per condition with OpenComet on ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p id="P47">Cells were washed with PBS and lysed directly on ice in Laemmli 2x buffer (0.125 M Tris HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.5 M DTE).
