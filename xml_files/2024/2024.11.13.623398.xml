Here, we map the state of the signaling network of B-cell lymphoma cells via simultaneous quantification of 111 (phospho-)proteins. We demonstrate that the B-cell signaling network can be disrupted with specific clinical small molecule inhibitors (iBTK, iSYK, iNFκB), thereby inducing a repressed state of the network. Principal component analysis identifies how the three inhibitors work along subtly different repression axes through the signaling state landscape. Finally, we observe that 1 μM combination treatment with all three inhibitors is more effective in inducing the repressed state than 10 μM of the single inhibitors. These results emphasize that cellular signaling occurs in complex networks, and underscore how quantification of the signaling state landscape provides insights into how combination drug treatments can bring cells in a desired network state.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Cells process information from their environment through intracellular signaling pathways. Classically, these pathways are perceived as linear cascades: signaling activation occurs upon binding of an extracellular ligand to its receptor, which triggers a cascade of sequentially activated signaling proteins, until the signal is propagated to the effector proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. For instance, Nunns <italic>et al.</italic> (2018) have shown that three signaling pathways with distinct architectures all act as linear input-output transmitters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. However, high-throughput datasets have elucidated that this linear cascade paradigm is often too simplistic as direct and indirect crosstalk occurs between many signaling pathways, and that a signaling network view with various branches and modules is more appropriate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">In the linear cascade representation, the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway initiates with antigen engagement of the receptor followed by activation of membrane-proximal kinases LYN, SYK, and BTK, propagating until downstream effector proteins such as NFκB, ERK or p38 are activated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. However, many signaling proteins, including SYK, BTK, and PLCγ are highly interconnected and form a multitude of feedback and feedforward loops and interact with other signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S1</xref>). For instance, active BCR signaling through SYK is required for optimal Toll-like receptor signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and BTK is required for chemokine-mediated cell migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">As signaling is often organized in complex, interconnected networks, it has been proposed as early as 1999 that we should study the state of the overall network rather than individual signaling proteins - nodes in the signaling network - to understand how cells respond to various input conditions and perturbations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. As malignant cells rely on intracellular signaling pathways for their growth and survival, a network approach to understand signaling may also aid in the development and evaluation of clinical drugs, since the inhibition of a single node in an interconnected network can disrupt the balance across a large part of a signaling pathway. The seminal study of Rukhlenko <italic>et al.</italic> (2022) demonstrated purposeful control over cell state transitions by first mapping various cell states, modeling transitions between these states and then predicting perturbations that push cells from one state into another<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Similarly, to unravel the mode of action of inhibitory drugs on signaling, quantification of the complete activity state of the signaling network (that is the specific levels of protein phosphorylation across the network) is crucial. As current methods do not map changes in the overall signaling state, many disease models and drugs lack a clear view of how drugs affect cellular signaling.</p><p id="P6">Here, we studied the interconnectivity of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling network in context of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and treatment with three small molecule inhibitory drugs. DLBCL is a common and aggressive type of mature B-cell lymphoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Up to 40% of DLBCL patients do not respond or relapse after first line treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. In particular, the activated B-cell (ABC) subtype of DLBCL is dependent on dysfunctional BCR and NFκB signaling for survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. To obtain a complete view of the signaling state of the BCR network and examine the effects of drugs on this signaling state, we employed immunodetection by sequencing (ID-seq), a method that enables simultaneous quantification of hundreds of (phospho-)proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In our study, we investigated three therapeutic inhibitors targeting signaling proteins BTK, SYK and NFκB. BTK can be effectively blocked by ibrutinib (referred to hereafter as iBTK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, an inhibitor that is clinically approved for several hematological malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and under investigation for the treatment of DLBCL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. The SYK inhibitor R406 (precursor: fostamatinib; iSYK) is approved for immune thrombocytopenia treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> and under clinical investigation for DLBCL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Lastly, the inhibitor QNZ (EVP4593; iNFκB) is a pre-clinical inhibitor described to block NFκB transcriptional activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, which is a relevant target in ABC-DLBCL due to its dependency on NFκB signaling. Exactly how these three therapeutic drugs affect the B-cell signaling state in context of DLBCL is unknown.</p><p id="P7">We performed comprehensive ID-seq experiments with varying inhibitor doses and combinations, which allowed us to define a DLBCL-specific signaling state landscape. Our experiments elucidate that the three inhibitors work along subtly different repression axes through the signaling state landscape. We demonstrated that combination treatment with low doses of iBTK, iSYK and iNFκB together propels the B-cell network towards a repressed signaling state more effectively than high doses of the single inhibitors. These findings improve our understanding of cell signaling organization into complex and interconnected networks and highlight the ability of (combination) cancer drug treatment to induce desired signaling network states.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>ID-seq enables detailed characterization of B-cell activation and inhibition by iBTK</title><p id="P8">To determine the signaling state and interconnectivity of the B-cell signaling network in different cellular contexts, we selected the HBL1 cell line as ABC-DLBCL model and treated the cells with BTK inhibitor ibrutinib at varying doses (0.1-100 μM) in the context of basal and activated signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). To activate B-cell signaling, cells were treated with a combination of anti-Ig F(ab)’2 fragment, to activate the BCR receptor, and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to inhibit phosphatases. Anti-Ig is classically used as proxy for antigen-BCR engagement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is a crucial second messenger in BCR signaling and present in the lymphoma tumor microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Phospho flow cytometry confirmed that the activation with both anti-Ig and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced significantly higher phosphorylation levels of CD79a and SYK than anti-Ig or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We used immunodetection by sequencing (ID-seq), a method that combines antibody-based target recognition and DNA sequencing through DNA-tagged antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S3</xref>), to measure the phosphorylation state of the B-cell network upon activating and inhibiting treatments. For this, we composed a panel of 111 antibodies that target total protein and phospho-protein levels of B-cell specific signaling proteins, downstream signaling pathways (NFκB, MAPK, PI3K, JAK/STAT), cell cycle proteins, and apoptosis markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S1 and Suppl. Table S1</xref> for targets and detailed antibody information). The measured (phospho-)proteins in ID-seq included B-cell surface markers and components of the BCR signaling network such as CD79a (receptor complex), LYN and BTK (core BCR signaling hub), SHP2 (phosphatase), VAV1 (BCR internalization), and S6 (protein synthesis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S1</xref>). To confirm the ID-seq findings, we demonstrated phosphorylation levels of CD79a using phospho flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Next, we investigated the network-wide signaling response upon activation and inhibition with 100 μM iBTK. Differential (phospho-)protein expression analysis (DEA) provides a network-wide view of the signaling state which was used to compare the basal (resting) and activated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This analysis demonstrated significantly increased phosphorylation levels of the core BCR signaling hub, consisting of CD79a, LYN, SYK, BTK, and BLNK, as well as increased phospho-levels of VAV1 and PYK2, which are involved in BCR internalization. In addition, downstream effector proteins ERK1/2, p38, and MKK4 were increased to a lesser extent. Treatment with 100 μM iBTK in the activated state resulted in substantially decreased phosphorylation of the core BCR proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Notably, CD22, an inhibitory receptor, showed significantly decreased phosphorylation upon activation, and iBTK treatment reversed the response to a significant increase. DMSO and PBS treatment resulted in no significant changes in signaling protein levels, indicating that changes in signaling proteins were due to inhibition by iBTK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Figure S5</xref>). Thus, we found that phosphorylation levels of proteins across the entire B-cell network were disrupted by iBTK treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>B-cell activation and inhibition by iBTK results in distinct signaling states</title><p id="P11">To obtain a generalized and dimensionality-reduced representation of the signaling states, we employed principal component analysis (PCA). The signaling state landscape was first mapped with all input conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S6</xref>), and conditions of interest were subsequently sampled for visualization. PCA confirmed that BCR activation induced a highly activated signaling state that is distinct from the basal state of the B-cell signaling network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, captured mostly in PC1; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S7</xref> for PC1 to PC3). Moreover, treatment with 100 μM iBTK pushed the signaling network towards a repressed state: signaling did not revert back to the basal state upon iBTK treatment but instead reached a new, repressed state, even for the basal-inhibited condition (captured mostly in PC3).</p><p id="P12">PCA allowed us to extract which proteins contributed most to each PC and thus to the distinct signaling states. In agreement with the DEA, phospho-proteins contributing to PC1, capturing the differences between the basal and activated signaling states, included BLNK, BTK (Y551), LYN, and VAV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The proteins contributing to PC3, capturing the difference between the conditions with and without inhibitors, were CD79a, GAPDH, IgM, and phospho-S6. Analyzing the phosphorylation levels of the top contributing proteins to each PC sheds light on the PCA findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). VAV1 exhibited high phosphorylation (Y174) upon activation and reverted to basal levels upon treatment with iBTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> left). Total IgM levels were slightly increased in the activated state and increased even more upon iBTK treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> middle). S6 (S235/S236) phosphorylation was strongly decreased by iBTK in both the basal and activated conditions, reaching new levels, and thereby illustrating how this phospho-protein especially contributed to the repressed signaling state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> right). To summarize, the core BCR phospho-proteins contributed to the activated signaling state, while more downstream phospho-proteins and non-phospho-proteins made the repressed signaling state different from the basal or activated states, indicating that different parts of this interconnected B-cell signaling network contribute to different overall outcomes or states of the network.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>iBTK disrupts parts of the B-cell signaling network in a dose-dependent manner</title><p id="P13">To further understand how iBTK affects the change from basal to activated to repressed state, we included different doses of iBTK (10-fold increments from 0.1 μM to 100 μM). We then determined the effect of each iBTK dose on the signaling activation using DEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S8</xref>; log2(fold change) &gt; log2(1.1), p-adjusted &lt; 0.05). 15 phospho-proteins were significantly more abundant in the activated state compared to the basal state, and 14 of these 15 protein levels were significantly decreased by 100 μM iBTK treatment.</p><p id="P14">Hierarchical clustering of the significantly affected proteins revealed two main clusters that responded differently to iBTK: the top cluster of phospho-proteins was decreased by low doses of iBTK (1 μM and higher) and the bottom cluster was only significantly decreased by high doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). BTK phospho-site Y223 clustered together in the inhibitor sensitive cluster, together with LYN and SYK, while BTK phosphosite Y551 clustered in the less sensitive cluster, together with BLNK and VAV1. Indeed, the individual phospho-protein data showed a drastically different dose-dependent pattern of inhibition for the two BTK phospho-sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Notably, BTK-Y223 is involved in the catalytic activity of BTK, and previous research has shown inhibition of BTK-Y223 by ibrutinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">Next, we focused on the activated signaling state only and compared (phospho-)protein levels in inhibitor-treated samples with the untreated DMSO control. This analysis identified any (phospho-)proteins that were significantly altered by iBTK treatment, regardless of their activation compared to basal signaling. For instance, phosphorylation levels of S6 (both phospho-sites) did not change upon activating treatment, and thus, no effect of iBTK on the activated versus basal signaling of S6 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). However, phosphorylation of S6 was significantly decreased upon iBTK treatment when comparing the iBTK treatment versus DMSO control in activated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Broadly, this analysis showed that higher iBTK doses led to increases in the number of proteins affected, the magnitude of the effect, and the significance level.</p><p id="P16">We then analyzed the PCA signaling state landscape to map along what axis iBTK propelled cells from the activated state without inhibitor towards the repressed state induced by high iBTK. Visual inspection of the intermediate iBTK conditions demonstrated that these samples map approximately equidistant between the activated and repressed state, and imply a repression trajectory that is slightly more along PC3 at low doses and then moves along PC1 at higher doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Together, we observed that the clinically approved and well-characterized inhibitor iBTK disrupts the entire B-cell signaling network, rather than only its target BTK and proteins downstream of BTK, even at low doses, and that this inhibition dose-dependently induces a repressed signaling state. These observations underscore that different pathways within the B-cell signaling network are tightly interconnected.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Network-wide signaling disruptions along different repression axes by iSYK and iNFκB</title><p id="P18">To corroborate whether other small molecule inhibitors also provoked network-wide signaling disruptions in DLBCL, we investigated iSYK, which is under investigation in clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, and iNFκB, which is a pre-clinical inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In line with iBTK, both iSYK and iNFκB were able to disrupt activated B-cell signaling across the network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S9</xref>). When the signaling network was inhibited maximally (100 μM), considerable overlap in signaling proteins affected by the different inhibitors was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), illustrating the high degree of crosstalk and connectivity in the network. However, at intermediate doses, we observed that iSYK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) and iNFκB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S10</xref>) presented subtle but definite differences in dose-dependent inhibition patterns compared to iBTK. For instance, DEA of the effect of iSYK doses on the activated versus basal signaling state, followed by heatmap visualization and hierarchical clustering revealed three main clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>): one strongly inhibited cluster, with SYK and PLCγ1, one weakly inhibited cluster even at high iSYK doses, which included BTK-Y551 and VAV1, and one moderately inhibited cluster (from 1 μM iSYK onwards), which included BTK-Y223 and LYN. Noteworthy, JAK1 clustered together with BTK-Y223 under iSYK treatment, but clustered together with BTK-Y551 under iBTK treatment. Indeed, the protein data confirmed that JAK1 phosphorylation was decreased only by the highest dose of iBTK, steadily decreased by increasing doses of iSYK, and decreased equally by 0.1, 1 and 10 μM iNFκB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Likewise, phospho-proteins CD79a, IKKa/b and MAPK p38 highlight that these three inhibitors demonstrated markedly different dose-dependent effects on phospho-protein levels at intermediate doses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S11</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Since all three inhibitors demonstrated the ability to disrupt the entire B-cell network at high doses but exhibit varying effects at intermediate doses, we explored how iSYK and iNFκB treatment acted within the PCA signaling state landscape compared to iBTK. We observed that iSYK, and to a lesser extent iNFκB, at high doses indeed pushed the cells towards the repressed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Furthermore, treatment with low and intermediate doses of iSYK pushed cells along a PC1-PC3-oriented axis towards the repressed state, while iBTK treatment pushed cells along a PC3-PC1-oriented axis. iNFκB treatment pushed cells mostly along a PC1-oriented axis, and fully iNFκB-inhibited samples resembled the basal state more than iBTK or iSYK inhibited samples. Taken together, the inhibitors repressed the entire B-cell signaling network along distinct repression axes within the signaling state landscape.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Combinatory inhibitor treatments effectively induce repressed signaling states</title><p id="P20">Inspired by the work of Kholodenko and co-workers who demonstrated how cells states could be transformed along state transition vectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that combinatory treatment at low doses would also propel cells towards the repressed signaling state. Indeed, some synergistic effects have been described for iBTK and a PI3K inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, and for iSYK and a LYN inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Thus, combinatory treatment could result in more effective disruptions of the B-cell signaling network than high doses of the single inhibitors. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the (phospho-)protein responses with ID-seq after treating DLBCL cells with different combinations of iBTK, iSYK, and iNFκB.</p><p id="P21">First, we mapped the entire signaling state landscape of this experiment with PCA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S12</xref>). In line with the single inhibitor experiment, PC1 captured the main differences between the basal and activated signaling states and PC2 captured the differences between the basal state and the repressed state that is induced by combining all three inhibitors. Moreover, BLNK, BTK (Y551), and VAV1 contributed most to the difference between the basal and activated states, while BLNK, IgM, and LYN contributed most to reaching the three-inhibitor repressed state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S13</xref>).</p><p id="P22">As reference, we treated cells with 10 μM of the single inhibitors. In the signaling state landscape, these conditions mapped approximately equidistant between the basal and activated states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S14</xref>). Subsequently, we studied the effect of combining two inhibitors, each at 2.5 μM. The samples treated with iBTK + iSYK and with iBTK + iNFκB clustered closely together with the 10 μM iSYK treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). The iSYK + iNFκB combination was slightly shifted compared to the single inhibitor treated samples, suggesting stronger inhibition by this combinatory treatment. When we combined the three inhibitors together at equal doses, we observed an even larger shift in the signaling state landscape, in the extended direction as seen with the two-inhibitor treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). As expected, higher doses of the inhibitors induced a more repressed state.</p><p id="P23">The above-described effects of combining two or three inhibitors at equal doses on the signaling state prompted the question if we can manipulate how the cells move through the signaling state landscape by combining the three inhibitors at mixed doses. We tested one inhibitor at 5 μM while keeping the other two inhibitors at 1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>). As expected, the mixed three-inhibitor conditions mapped in between the conditions with 1 μM or 10 μM of each inhibitor. Moreover, we observed the strongest repression when iSYK was added at 5 μM, compared to when iBTK or iNFκB were added at 5 μM, which is in line with the two-inhibitor treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Thus, we found that low dose combinations of iSYK, iBTK and iNFκB together were more effective in inducing a repressed signaling state than 10 μM of a single inhibitor.</p><p id="P24">To place the combinatory inhibitor results in the context of the B-cell signaling network, we performed DEA, comparing the basal and activated states, and the effect of the inhibitor treatments on the activated state. As shown before, the activated state consisted of network-wide phosphorylation events, especially in the core BCR signaling hub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Treatment of the activated state with 10 μM iBTK alone resulted in substantial inhibition of the network, mainly in the core BCR hub, but also in MAPK p38 signaling and JAK1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5F</xref>). Strikingly, combinatory treatment with 1 μM of iBTK + iSYK + iNFκB disrupted the signaling network more strongly than the single inhibitor treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig S15</xref>). Individual protein data exemplified either strong repression across all inhibitor combinations that were investigated, or inhibitor-dependent differences in the strength of repression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. S16</xref>). Together, combinatory treatment with low doses of multiple inhibitors was more effective in disrupting activated B-cell signaling in these malignant B-cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">Malignant cells can hijack signaling pathways for their growth, which complicates defining the effects of drugs. We have shown that ID-seq can be a powerful tool to capture the phosphorylation state of signaling networks, and study cellular signaling in the context of larger networks. Using a panel of 111 antibodies, we uncovered major cellular signaling state changes in aggressive B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) in the context of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A+B</xref>) and BTK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Decreased phosphorylation of the core BCR signaling hub was observed, where also proteins that are classically depicted upstream of BTK were inhibited. Moreover, inhibition of the activated signaling state did not revert to the basal state, but instead induced a new, repressed state. Exploring two other therapeutic inhibitors, iSYK and iNFκB, confirmed that these inhibitors perform equally well regarding the disruption of the entire B-cell signaling network and propelling cells towards a repressed signaling state, although each inhibitor had a unique axis of repression. When we applied combinatory inhibitor treatments, thus pushing the network from multiple angles, we observed strong inhibitory effects with low doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). These findings show that cellular signaling occurs in complex networks, and underscore how quantification of the signaling state landscape provides insights into how combination drug treatments can bring cells in a desired network state.</p><p id="P26">A major advantage of ID-seq is the vast number of targets that can be measured. In this study, we have used a panel of 111 antibodies, broadly covering the B-cell network and additional pathways of interest, and this panel could be expanded even further. In addition, the ID-seq method can be expanded towards single-cell measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, combined with RNA-seq measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>, and has the potential to be integrated with commercial kits due to the antibody barcode design. ID-seq and other large-scale high-throughput approaches are key in transitioning from a linear cascade view of cellular signaling to an integrated network view. For instance, our work elucidated that iBTK treatment resulted in two sets of proteins that had different dose-response curves to the inhibitor, suggesting two interconnected modules in the signaling network that are regulated somewhat separately. The two measured phospho-sites of BTK (Y223 and Y551) clustered in the different sets, hinting at a regulatory mechanism that works through BTK phosphorylation. BTK-Y551 is phosphorylated by LYN and plays a role in BTK activation, while BTK-Y223 is an autophosphorylation step and essential for the catalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, and iBTK (ibrutinib) has been described to reduce Y223 phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. It is also known that BTK is a key signaling protein in B-cell signaling, connecting different pathways, such as chemokine, integrin, TLR and Fc receptor signaling, to BCR signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. These results confirm an important role for BTK, which should be explored further.</p><p id="P27">The observation that iBTK, iSYK and iNFκB all caused major disruptions of activated B-cell signaling and induced a repressed signaling state was striking. As SYK is located in proximity to BTK in the B-cell signaling network, both physically and functionally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, we expected that inhibiting these two proteins would have comparable effects. In addition, both proteins are located relatively upstream in the B-cell signaling network. NFκB, on the other hand, is located much more distally in the network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, and yet, our data revealed many changes in proximal B-cell signaling upon NFκB inhibition. iNFκB is a preclinical drug, described to block NFκB transcriptional activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, although the exact mechanism is not fully elucidated. Although off-target effects of iNFκB are a possibility, this has not been described in previous studies on iNFκB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, and we observed significant effects at low doses. For these reasons, we believe that these findings illustrate the interconnectivity of the B-cell signaling network. Indeed, many reverse connections and feedback loops have been reported in the B-cell signaling network: reverse interactions between LYN and SYK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, an autoactivation loop on SYK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, interactions between PDK1 and MALT (PI3K branch and NFκB branch)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and various inhibitory phosphatase interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>, and there could be many more. The question then arises whether it is necessary that an inhibitor is specific for one target, or whether it is more important that the overall desired effect on the signaling network is achieved. As also proposed by other researchers, drug development research might benefit from focusing on the signaling state effects of inhibitors rather than specific protein inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">The signaling state landscape of iBTK, iSYK and iNFκB described distinct axes of repression for these inhibitors across a concentration range. These different axes of repression, together with the different dose-response patterns between sets of proteins, suggest a balancing act of B-cell signaling proteins that can be shifted towards a more activated or repressed state from different angles by different inhibitors. The development of new and improved treatment options for DLBCL is a research topic still requiring attention since many patients do not respond to or relapse with chemo(immuno)therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Previous work on combinatory treatment for DLBCL has either focused on the clinical effects of combining a small molecule inhibitor with standard chemo(immuno)therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> or on combining ibrutinib (iBTK) with other small molecule inhibitors in viability screens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup>. A few studies have investigated other small molecule inhibitor combinations, such as BTK + PI3K inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, LYN + SYK inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, or PI3Kδ + PI3Kα inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>, with promising results and synergistic effects at the molecular level. Our findings on two- and three-inhibitor combinatory treatments offer additional insights in drug effects at the signaling level.</p><p id="P29">In conclusion, we have demonstrated how quantification of the B-cell signaling state allows us to explore the interconnectivity of signaling networks. Our findings indicate that B-cell signaling acts as a network rather than a linear cascade and highlight the potential for combination treatment to obtain effective results using low doses, thus opening up avenues for more effective therapies with fewer side effects.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p id="P30">All reagents and materials are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P31">HBL1 cell line (RRID: CVCL_4213) was used as model for B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL).
