There is an increasing need to better understand the regulation of macrophage responses to cancer to inform the development of novel therapeutic approaches and to increase the efficacy of current immunotherapies.</p><p id="P6">Macrophages represent a major orchestrator of immune responses in a plethora of pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. While residing in the tumour microenvironment, macrophages display remarkable heterogeneity and plasticity turning into essential components that can either promote or suppress tumour growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The tightly coordinated recognition and uptake of ‘foreign’ material through the process of phagocytosis is a major macrophage effector function that shapes host immune responses to both microbial and sterile stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. In the tumour setting, macrophages can engulf cancer cells, that are opsonised with antibodies recognising surface tumour antigens, through antibody dependent-cellular phagocytosis (ADCP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and mediate the clearance of apoptotic cancer cells through the specialised type of phagocytosis called efferocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. These two different types of phagocytosis, that represent a cardinal function of macrophages, have been linked to distinct effects on tumour growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. While ADCP promotes anti-tumour effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, efferocytosis promotes a tumour-tolerant condition by inducing the release of immunosuppressive mediators such as interleukin 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Inhibition of signaling pathways or phagocyte receptors that upregulate efferocytosis, such as Mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK), has therefore been effective in reducing tumour growth in several experimental cancer models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Trained innate immunity (TII or trained immunity) defines long-lasting adaptations of innate immune cells based on transcriptional and epigenetic modifications of myeloid cells and their bone marrow progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Specifically, TII represents a state of enhanced immune responsiveness of the myeloid compartment to secondary challenges. We have previously shown that TII contributes to tumour suppression using experimental models of melanoma and lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The anti-tumour effects of TII were attributed at least in part to epigenetic and transcriptomic reprograming in neutrophils and enhanced tumour cell killing by release of reactive oxygen species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. The tumour suppressive phenotype of TII has been corroborated by several studies employing different tumour models and utilising different agents to induce TII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. While the role of TII in promoting anti-tumour immunity is established, the impact of TII in efferocytosis or ADCP to shape anti-tumour immunity remains poorly explored.</p><p id="P8">The application of immunotherapies including checkpoint inhibitors that target the adaptive immune compartment for the treatment of melanoma has significantly improved the clinical management of this malignancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.

Of note, macrophages have been shown to contribute to ADCP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> of melanoma cells. In addition, targeted inhibition of efferocytosis incites anti-tumour immunity in melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">Here, we studied the role of TII on macrophage phagocytosis of melanoma cells and the cytokine profile of phagocytic macrophages.

We also found that <italic>Gas6, Lxra, Abca1</italic> and MerTK, all previously linked to enhanced efferocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, were downregulated by trained macrophages. Under the tested conditions, levels of ADCP were comparable between trained and control macrophages. Use of antibodies recognising alternative melanoma surface antigens may promote ADCP by trained macrophages.</p><p id="P41">Further studies would be useful to address why trained macrophages demonstrate a cargo-dependent phagocytic behaviour, i.e. decreased efferocytosis of tumour cells, unaltered ADCP and enhanced phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils and <italic>E. coli</italic> particles. In agreement with the literature, although using a different approach to induce TII, enhanced phagocytosis of pathogen particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and apoptotic neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> by trained phagocytes has been demonstrated. Our findings on trained macrophage efferocytosis of different apoptotic cargos further support previous reports suggesting that the cellular identity of the engulfed apoptotic cell instruct distinct macrophage phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> that may be potentially linked to enhanced effectiveness of macrophage-based cell therapies.</p><p id="P42">Targeting efferocytosis to bolster anti-tumour immunity has recently attracted attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Of note, efferocytosis has been linked to cancer therapeutic resistance among several types of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. The role of TII on attenuating macrophage efferocytosis in the tumour setting was corroborated by showing that inhibition of the efferocytosis receptor MerTK further decreased the uptake of apoptotic tumour cells in co-cultures with trained macrophages. As blockade of MerTK may have a direct impact in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>, further studies are required to address whether MerTK inhibition affects solely efferocytosis in our experimental setting.</p><p id="P43">The decreased caspase-1 activity in trained efferocytic macrophages was reflected by lower levels of IL-1β levels. Efferocytosis has been shown to induce the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in myeloid cells thereby promoting IL-1β secretion and tumour growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Further focus on the identification of specific inflammasomes that contribute to the attenuated efferocytosis by trained macrophages may support the development of novel cancer immunotherapeutic targets. In addition, future studies will provide further insight into the potential role of MerTK inhibition on macrophage IL-1β secretion during efferocytosis.</p><p id="P44">Given the macrophage heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup> and the different types of central and peripheral trained innate immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>, the use of BMDMs as the only source of macrophages may represent a limitation of this study. However, BMDMs have been utilised extensively for the elucidation of mechanisms orchestrating cargo-dependent macrophage phagocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Future validation experiments using different types of macrophages will strengthen the impact of this study.</p><p id="P45">Lack of <italic>in vivo</italic> data on macrophage efferocytosis is another limitation of our study. Further analyses are required to address the physiological relevance of trained macrophages in efferocytosis of tumour cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P46">Cancer combination therapies, including the administration of immunotherapy, have contributed to the improvement of the clinical management of cancer particularly in aggressive types such as melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> and also breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P47">The anti-tumour effect of β-glucan and the vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, both inducers of TII, is being tested in clinicals trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. TII - dependent decrease of efferocytosis may be a promising adjuvant immunotherapeutic strategy to complement existing cancer therapies and enhance treatment success.</p><p id="P48">In summary, the present study pinpoints a novel role for trained innate immunity in attenuating macrophage efferocytosis of tumour cells and demonstrates that the decreased efferocytosis by trained macrophages is associated with lower levels of active caspase-1 and IL-1β secretion. This novel role of trained innate immunity could be therapeutically exploited in pre-clinical models to expand our current mechanistic and translational understanding of the anti-tumour potential of trained immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figure 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS200099-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_1.tiff" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d2aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figure 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS200099-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_2.tiff" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d2aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Figure 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS200099-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_3.tiff" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d2aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Figure 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS200099-supplement-Supplementary_Figure_4.tiff" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" id="d2aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Figure</label><media xlink:href="EMS200099-supplement-Supplementary_Figure.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAcEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank staff at the Imaging and Cytometry Lab in the University of York Bioscience Technology.
