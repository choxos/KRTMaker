Passive finger movement – which involves refraining from actively performing or resisting movement – is a robust approach to investigate the neural representation of kinesthesia and proprioception in the brain. While some studies have characterized the neural correlates of passive finger movement, they have relied solely on mass univariate analysis, potentially affecting result sensitivity. Additionally, limited consideration has been given to stimulus duration, a factor closely tied to some kinematic features (amplitude and velocity), which recently proposed modeling approaches now take into account. Here, we reanalyzed previously published data using univariate and multivariate analysis to understand how kinesthesia is neurally encoded in neurotypical subjects in two separate experiments. Systematic passive stimulation of the fingers was provided using an MR-compatible robot while functional magnetic resonance imaging data was recorded. Our analyses consisted of univariate and multivariate approaches, conducted separately for each kinematic feature and adjusted for stimulus duration, regardless of whether brain activation scales with it. We provide a detailed mapping of brain areas related to amplitude, velocity, and direction of passive finger movement, including sensorimotor, subcortical, and cerebellar areas. In general, multivariate pattern analysis was more sensitive than the univariate approach in identifying brain regions associated with passive finger movement. Our univariate analysis demonstrated that activity in sensorimotor and subcortical areas was higher for larger amplitudes and slower velocities, which opposes to the original study’s results, likely due to our treatment of stimulus duration as a confounder specified as a parametric modulator. A novel result, we also demonstrated that brain activity in sensorimotor areas was higher for extension compared to flexion of passive finger movement. In terms of kinematic features, a larger neural representation was found for amplitude and direction compared to velocity of passive finger movement. This indicates that kinesthesia and proprioception may be more reliant on displacement than kinematic aspects of passive finger movement. While univariate analyses are limited in addressing spatial heterogeneity and subject-level variability, our multivariate analyses showed increased sensitivity in identifying brain regions encoding passive movement. Our findings may extend the knowledge of how the brain encodes physical movements and may help design neurorehabilitation strategies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Passive movement entails moving the body part of an individual, who refrains from performing active movement and from resisting against an external source of movement. At a neuroscientific level, passive movement of body parts can be employed to study kinesthesia and proprioceptive processes in the brain and to consolidate neuroscientific theories of motor control. The brain correlates of passive movement have been studied extensively using various neuroimaging techniques for several body parts, such as the wrist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bae et al., 2017</xref>), hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Boscolo Galazzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Guzzetta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Zhavoronkova et al., 2017</xref>), arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Estévez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Weiller et al., 1996</xref>), lower limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Jaeger et al., 2014</xref>), and finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dueñas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lolli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Mima et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Nurmi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Sugawara et al., 2016</xref>). Hand and fingers have a proportionally large somatotopic representation compared to other body parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Penfield and Rasmussen, 1950</xref>). Passive finger movement commonly elicits responses in the supplementary motor area (SMA), the contralateral postcentral (primary somatosensory cortex – S1) and precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex – M1), and the bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), thalamus, putamen, and ipsilateral cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dueñas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lolli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Mima et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Nurmi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Sugawara et al., 2016</xref>). This pattern for passive movement is similar to the one associated with active movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Boscolo Galazzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Guzzetta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Weiller et al., 1996</xref>), but with a relatively weaker strength of brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Lolli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Mima et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Zhavoronkova et al., 2017</xref>). Early work on peripheral receptors showed that kinematic features of passive movement are dissociated from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">McCloskey, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Proske and Gandevia, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Sittig et al., 1985</xref>), suggesting that kinematic features (such as amplitude, velocity, and direction) could also be represented differentially in the brain.</p><p id="P3">Proprioception is especially important for the dexterous movements of the hand and fingers, as it enables precise control and awareness of position without visual guidance. Robotically-driven motion, compared to manual stimulation by an experimenter, offers a systematic way to provide subjects with reproducible and stereotyped passive movement of body parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aggogeri et al., 2019</xref>). When robotics is used in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) through an adapted and compatible construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gassert et al., 2006</xref>), one can study the passive finger movement using high-resolution imaging and well-controlled kinesthetic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dueñas et al., 2018</xref>). However, despite the high spatial resolution, the characterization of passive finger movement in the brain has only been studied using mass univariate analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Boscolo Galazzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dueñas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lolli et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Nurmi et al., 2018</xref>), i.e., obtaining large clusters of spatially convergent voxels across subjects with concordant activity magnitude.</p><p id="P4">Furthermore, mass univariate analyses may be insensitive to patterns of activity across spatially distributed voxels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Davis et al., 2014</xref>), i.e., their results depend on how spatially homogeneous the activation is. Alternatively, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) applied to fMRI offers greater sensitivity for characterizing the neural underpinnings of a given task, stimulation, or behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Haxby et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hebart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kriegeskorte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Norman et al., 2006</xref>). Such an approach uses machine learning methods to discriminate between conditions that are reliably associated with more distributed encoded brain patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kriegeskorte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Riggall and Postle, 2012</xref>). Compared to univariate analysis, MVPA can detect spatial heterogeneity and neglects subject-level variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Coutanche, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Davis et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, MVPA is powerful to differentiate between conditions that would be intertwined with traditional univariate approaches and generate spatially accurate brain maps that extend our understanding of neural functioning across subtle experimental variations.</p><p id="P5">Employing and comparing univariate and multivariate methods, as well as modeling inherent confounds, may substantially advance our comprehension of brain correlates of passive finger movement. Here we performed new analysis on a previously recorded dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dueñas et al., 2018</xref>). This dataset comprised of high-resolution fMRI data from 41 healthy subjects in two independent experiments while an MRI-compatible robotic system provided finger displacement according to different kinematic features. Using univariate and multivariate techniques, we identified neural responses associated with three different kinematic features (amplitude, velocity, and direction) of passive finger movement. We hypothesized that the univariate and multivariate representations would exhibit heightened sensitivity to amplitude of passive finger movement compared to other kinematic features, reflecting brain responses that rely primarily on the proprioceptive input to interpret passive movement. This hypothesis is based on previous findings showing that sensorimotor activity (measured by a univariate analysis and controlled by stimulus duration) due to active finger movements is more specific to amplitude than other kinematic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Shirinbayan et al., 2019</xref>). By providing linear (and not oscillatory) movements experimentally and by using a model that controls for false positive rates regardless of whether brain activation scales with stimulus duration, we provide unique insights on the neural responses to passive finger movement. Our directional results of univariate analysis and improved sensitivity of multivariate analyses deepen our understanding of how neural correlates of passive finger movement are characterized.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>2.</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><label>2.1.</label><title>Participants</title><p id="P6">We performed new analyses of a previously recorded dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dueñas et al., 2018</xref>). The data consisted of anatomical and functional MR images collected at the MRI Center of the Psychiatric Hospital of Zurich, University of Zurich, Switzerland. Data were obtained from 41 right-handed healthy subjects who participated in two experiments, hereafter referred to as Exp 1 and Exp 2 (following the nomenclature of the original publication) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dueñas et al., 2018</xref>). The dataset used for the present study contained only subjects whose head displacement during functional runs was no greater than 3 mm, filtered out in the original study. Nineteen subjects participated in Exp 1 (14 females, 27.8 ± 8.9 years) and 22 subjects (11 females, 25.2 ± 2.9 years) participated in Exp 2. The mean age of the participants was not different between the two experiments (two-sample t-test, p = 0.20).

Prior to the MRI recording, we measured the maximum aperture between right thumb and index finger for each subject with a ruler outside the scanner room. Subjects were laid on the scanner table in a supine position with the wrist in the anatomically neutral position. We attached the distal phalanges of the subjects’ right thumb and index finger using Velcro straps to the slave part of the robot (MRI-compatible), previously mounted on the right side of the scanner table. This part of the robot was controlled by the master part (non-MRI-compatible), lying outside the scanner room, and connected to each other through a hydraulic transmission. The robot was designed provide individuals with flexion and extension of the index finger relative to the thumb. The motion of the index finger was controlled during the experiments through an optical encoder. The robotic system has been validated against artifacts for concomitant fMRI recording and poses no safety concerns for participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Gassert et al., 2006</xref>). A dedicated computer with custom code written in LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench, National Instruments) controlled the robot. Subjects were familiarized with the experimental procedure before being positioned in the MRI scanner. They were instructed to remain relaxed, to not exert active movement in reaction to passive movement, to keep their eyes open, and to not fall asleep during the measurement.</p><p id="P8">Each trial (robotically-driven passive movement) consisted of a single displacement of right thumb and index finger relative to each other for a combination of levels of kinematic features – amplitude, velocity, and direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The order of the trials and the interval between trials were pseudorandomized for each subject prior to scanning. For Exp 1, trials consisted of a 3 x 3 x 2 combination of amplitudes of 10, 20, or 40% of the maximum aperture (A<sub>10</sub>, A<sub>20</sub>, and A<sub>40</sub>), velocities of 20, 40, or 80% of the maximum aperture per second (V<sub>20</sub>, V<sub>40</sub>, and V<sub>80</sub>), and directions of extension or flexion. The interval between trials was 4 ± 2 s for Exp 1, which constituted a fast event-related design. Each unique combination was repeated eight times per run in Exp 1. The run length was 13.5 min for Exp 1. The mean ± standard deviation of the amplitudes in Exp 1 across individuals was 9.6 ± 1.3 mm for A<sub>10</sub>, 18.1 ± 2.6 mm for A<sub>20</sub>, and 37.0 ± 5.3 mm for A<sub>40</sub>. The mean ± standard deviation of the (average) velocities in Exp 1 across individuals was 26.4 ± 3 mm/s for V<sub>20</sub>, 56.7 ± 7.1 mm/s for V<sub>40</sub>, and 134.6 ± 17.0 mm/s for V<sub>80</sub>.</p><p id="P9">For Exp 2, trials consisted of a 2 x 2 x 2 combination of amplitudes of 10 or 40% (A<sub>10</sub> and A<sub>40</sub>) of the maximum aperture, velocities of 5 or 20% of a maximum aperture per second (V<sub>5</sub> and V<sub>20</sub>), and directions of extension or flexion. The interval between trials was 12 ± 2 s for Exp 2, which constituted a slow event-related design. Each unique combination was repeated five times per run in Exp 2.

For both experiments, we first acquired functional volumes covering the whole cerebrum and the superior part of the cerebellum, obtained with a gradient-echo planar imaging sequence, 35 axial slices, repetition time/echo time (TR/TE) = 2000/35 ms, matrix size = 240 × 240 mm<sup>2</sup>, voxel size = 3 x 3 x 4.07 mm<sup>3</sup>, 1.1 mm slice gap, and 400 and 306 volumes for Exps 1 and 2, respectively. Next, we acquired high-resolution three-dimensional anatomical images covering the whole brain, obtained with a T1-weighted sequence, 180 sagittal slices, TR/TE = 6.9/3.1 ms, flip angle = 8°, matrix size = 256 × 256 mm<sup>2</sup>, voxel size = 1 mm<sup>3</sup>).

We first slice-time corrected the functional images for each run and subject. We then estimated the six translation and rotation parameters of head motion and used them to spatially realign the functional images to a mean referential image. Next, we coregistered the anatomical image to the mean functional image. Thus, we used the coregistered anatomical image to create a deformation field, which was used to normalize all functional images to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. In this process, we resampled the voxel size to 3 mm<sup>3</sup>. Finally, functional images were spatially smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 6 mm<sup>3</sup> full-width at half maximum, to be used only for univariate analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><label>2.4.2.</label><title>Estimation of activation for factorial design</title><p id="P12">We estimated voxel-wise activation for each unique combination of kinematic feature levels using a general linear model (GLM) for each subject. The estimation process was performed twice: once with unsmoothed functional MR images for MVPA, and once with smoothed images for univariate analysis. For each run, we designed a matrix with eighteen regressors (3 amplitude x 3 velocity x 2 direction levels) for Exp 1 and eight regressors (2 amplitude x 2 velocity x 2 direction levels) for Exp 2. Depending on the scientific question, time-on-task effects can act as confounding factors in univariate analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Domagalik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Yarkoni et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, stimulus duration can confound MVPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Todd et al., 2013</xref>), potentially causing the classifier to be trained on stimulus duration rather than the condition of interest per se. To account for this confound, we adjusted the activation estimation in run-specific regressors by treating stimulus duration as a covariate of no-interest. Accounting for trial-specific time-on-task differences in the model was first proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Grinband et al. (2008)</xref>, in which the trials were modeled as boxcar functions with varying durations, according to the trial – the so-called variable epoch model. This modeling approach was initially applied in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dueñas et al. (2018)</xref>, which first described the data used in our present study. However, recent methodological work demonstrates that, while the variable epoch model effectively controls for false positives in cases where neural activity duration scales with time-on-task, it leads to a high rate of false positives when neural activity duration does not scale with time-on task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Mumford et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, a model that minimizes false positives in both scenarios – whether neural activity duration scales or does not scale with time-on-task – is desired. Fulfilling these requirements, a proposed solution is a model uses constant regressors modulated by stimulus duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Mumford et al., 2024</xref>). We adopted this approach to account for stimulus duration to keep the rate of false positives low, regardless of whether activation correlates with stimulus duration. Furthermore, we assumed a full interaction model, in which we accounted for neural activation that could vary with stimulus durations at different levels for each condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Mumford et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, we modulated each condition-specific constant regressor separately by stimulus duration. These constant regressors were constructed using boxcar functions, based on the onset of each robotic displacement and the mean stimulus duration across all trials within a run for each subject. For each constant regressor, a parametric modulator was added by specifying the mean-centered stimulus duration for each trial within each run. All parametric modulators were modeled as first-order (i.e., linearly associated). Additional regressors representing the covariates of no-interest, namely six head motion parameters and the runs, completed the design matrix. Each regressor was convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function provided in SPM. We then simultaneously estimated voxel-wise the subject-specific GLM betas for each regressor. For each GLM, simple contrast maps of interest were created using the beta estimates for the constant regressors representing the unique combinations of kinematic feature levels. We used a high-pass filter of 128 s, a liberal masking threshold of 0.1, and an auto-regressive model of first degree to remove autocorrelation in the signal.</p><p id="P13">As described, we assumed that BOLD signals could potentially relate to stimulus durations at different levels for each condition in our model, which constitutes a full interaction model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Mumford et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, modulated regressors were added to each condition-specific regressor. However, one could also assume that BOLD signals would relate to stimulus durations equally across conditions, without an interaction effect. To explore this possibility further in a complementary analysis, we also designed a model in which a single modulated regressor was added to the design matrix, representing all trials collapsed across conditions. To implement this, we constructed design matrices with condition-specific constant regressors and one condition-unspecific parametric modulator representing all trials within a run. All other specification and estimation procedures were identical to those used in the model described above. This estimation was performed for all kinematic features and experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>2.4.3.</label><title>Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)</title><p id="P14">We used MVPA to find the brain regions that code kinematic features of passive finger movement, controlled for the influence of the stimulus duration. For the first-level multivariate analysis, we used the activation beta maps for each unique combination of kinematic features within a run obtained for the unsmoothed functional images. This method increases classification performance and power in MVPA and it is a recommended procedure for event-related experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hebart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Mourão-Miranda et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Mumford et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we used The Decoding Toolbox (TDT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Hebart et al., 2015</xref>) for MVPA, written for MATLAB and using SPM functions. We used the searchlight approach with an 8-mm-radius sphere. The searchlight approach trains and test a classifier considering all voxels within a roving region-of-interest (ROI) centered on each voxel and assigning the prediction value to that voxel, until all the voxels in the brain are covered. We used a leave-one-run-out cross-validation for the classification analyses, in which we trained a model with three runs (a cross-validation fold) and validated its prediction performance of the condition level in the remaining run. The classification is performed iteratively for all runs and the average performance is assigned to the central voxel of the searchlight ROI, therefore creating a map of cross-validation accuracies based on the local information around each voxel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kriegeskorte et al., 2006</xref>). To avoid overfitting, the classification was performed through a support-vector machine, i.e., by finding an optimal hyperplane constituted by voxels (features) to define the decision boundary between conditions (classes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Cortes and Vapnik, 1995</xref>). All data was scaled in advance between 0 and 1, which is the recommendation for ‘LIBSVM’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chang and Lin, 2007</xref>). For each subject, experiment, and kinematic feature, we obtained whole-brain maps of accuracy minus chance (in which the chance was 33.33% (3-class classification) for amplitude and velocity in Exp 1 and 50% (2-class classification) for direction in Exp 1 and for all the conditions in Exp 2). Next, we spatially smoothed the resulting individual maps using a 6-mm isometric Gaussian kernel.</p><p id="P15">Next, the individual accuracy maps were included in second-level random-effects analyses to compute one-sample t-tests. We thus obtained group-level t-maps in which positive values represent accuracies above chance level for each kinematic feature and experiment.

For Exp 2 and the amplitude condition, we used a voxel-wise statistical threshold of p &lt; 5×10<sup>-5</sup>, corrected for multiple comparisons using the FWE method, because the statistical threshold used for other maps resulted in too many significant voxels for this analysis. An explicit mask was included, considering the whole cerebrum and the superior part of the cerebellum.

We considered a maximum of six peaks, sorted by the highest accuracy values and labeled with a valid region according to the Anatomy Toolbox.

We generated subject-specific confusion matrices of accuracy performance for each ROI, experiment, and kinematic feature. The average performance for each true/predicted value in the confusion matrix was considered different from chance according to a bootstrapping approach of 1×10<sup>5</sup> permutations of subjects. The significance level was set to 0.05 and corrected for multiple comparisons (i.e., the square of the number of condition levels) according to the Bonferroni method.

In two experiments, we investigated how kinesthesia is encoded in the brain by using an MRI-compatible robot to provide subjects with systematic finger stimulation. Our analyses consisted of univariate and multivariate approaches, performed separately for each kinematic feature and using a model that accounts for the influence of stimulus duration. This model mitigates the false positive rates regardless of whether neural activity scales with stimulus duration. Previous research on muscle spindles and skin receptors in kinesthesia has suggested that proprioception can be dissociated into position, velocity, and direction senses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Proske and Gandevia, 2009</xref>). Therefore, such evidence has led to the hypothesis that kinematic features might also be spatially dissociated in the brain. We confirmed previous findings that a number of somatosensory and motor regions are related to the amplitude and direction of passive finger movement. In contrast, we observed fewer brain regions associated with the perception of velocity. Thus, we provide evidence that brain responses to passive finger movements are primarily reliant on amplitude, i.e., the change in finger positioning relative to a starting point. Other kinematic features are also represented in the brain, but to a lesser extent. As we will discuss in detail in the following sections, the finding that brain responses are primarily sensitive to changes in position, rather than to the rate or direction of these spatial changes, suggests that passive movement relies mainly on the measurement of finger position through muscle spindles and on the constant updating of expected position.</p><sec id="S24"><label>4.1.</label><title>Interpretation of univariate and multivariate results in fMRI</title><p id="P30">Univariate and multivariate approaches based on the high spatial resolution of fMRI can be used to study brain regions involved in psychological or physical aspects. A univariate approach estimates the extent to which the BOLD time-course of a single voxel fits a predefined model for a given condition of interest. Thus, higher activation is interpreted as a higher level of processing or resource utilization for one condition compared to another in a brain region. This approach, however, can be insensitive to processing patterns of activity that follow a set of distributed voxels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Davis et al., 2014</xref>). A multivariate approach to fMRI brain mapping considers patterns of activity distributed across voxels, rather than separately within individual voxels, and trains a model using a machine-learning algorithm to classify patterns into psychological or physical conditions. The model’s successful classification performance then reflects that the brain region is associated with the condition in question. MVPA is more sensitive in mapping functional correlates of brain regions compared to univariate approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Coutanche, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Davis and Poldrack, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kriegeskorte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Norman et al., 2006</xref>), and is therefore a powerful approach for investigating how the brain encodes behaviors of interest.</p><p id="P31">It is hence crucial to properly interpret the different outcomes of univariate and multivariate approaches to fMRI. It is possible that a univariate approach shows no activation for a region while that region contains multivariate information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Harrison and Tong, 2009</xref>), meaning that the condition of interest is represented across distributed voxels rather than spatially localized. On the other hand, the presence of a univariate activity difference means that the condition of interest can be differentiated by activity patterns with a lower spatial variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Coutanche, 2013</xref>). It has been suggested that multivoxel patterns reflect representational content within a region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Mur et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Riggall and Postle, 2012</xref>), but MVPA does not necessarily reveal details about the dimensionality of a representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Davis et al., 2014</xref>). Essentially, it is thought that the increased sensitivity of MVPA derives from greater spatial heterogeneity that is undetectable by a univariate approach, and from neglecting subject-level variability accounted for in univariate analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Coutanche, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Davis et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we applied both approaches to understand and complement the neural basis of kinematic passive movement features.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><label>4.2.</label><title>Amplitude of passive finger movement</title><p id="P32">We investigated brain regions associated with amplitude of passive finger movement. We confirmed previous findings of a network comprised of sensorimotor and subcortical regions associated with amplitude of passive finger movement and other body parts in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Boscolo Galazzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Francis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Jaeger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Mima et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Szameitat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Weiller et al., 1996</xref>). Overall, univariate analysis confirmed that activity in these regions increases with amplitude, concordant with studies on active movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Shirinbayan et al., 2019</xref>) and afferent firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Edin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Knibestöl, 1975</xref>). Compared to other kinematic features, we associated amplitude of passive movement with strong univariate differences across conditions and large discriminative areas in multivariate analysis. Limb position is first detected by muscle spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Goodwin et al., 1972</xref>) and skin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Edin, 1992</xref>) and this information is then carried to the brain. Static discharges that proportionally change according to stretch of muscle spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Roll and Vedel, 1982</xref>). Stronger brain activity in response to amplitude than to velocity seems congruent with evidence that information about the sense of position comes from muscle spindles. Although the primary endings of muscle spindles respond to both length and velocity changes, the secondary endings are only sensitive to length change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Matthews, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Proske and Gandevia, 2009</xref>). As an alternative interpretation, during passive movement, the final position is unknown and the expectation of position is continuously updated by proprioception until the movement ends. Greater proprioceptive updating of positional expectation would therefore be required for estimating larger displacements during passive movement. Our results suggest that brain activation in the somatosensory cortex scales with proprioceptive inputs from passive finger movement, leading to an association between somatosensory activity and amplitude of passive movement, independent of stimulus duration.</p><p id="P33">We observed an association between contralateral S1 activity and amplitude of passive finger movement in Exps 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), which is consistent with previous studies on passive and active movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Boscolo Galazzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Guzzetta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lolli et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Shirinbayan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Weiller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Zhavoronkova et al., 2017</xref>). S1 activity was also observed in early studies of cortical recordings in nonhuman primates during passive finger movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gardner and Costanzo, 1981</xref>). In addition, we observed ipsilateral S1 activity associated with amplitude, but only for MVPA in Exp 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The S1 activity increasing with amplitude is consistent with previous studies on active and passive finger movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Nurmi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Shirinbayan et al., 2019</xref>). The proprioceptive and somatosensory information that S1 receives during movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Mountcastle et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Yousry et al., 1997</xref>) may provide finger localization during passive movement. We also observed bilateral S2 activity associated with amplitude, for MVPA in Exp 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A,C</xref>) and for both MVPA and univariate analysis in Exp 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). S2 has been associated with passive finger movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dueñas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Mima et al., 1999</xref>), but less sensitive than S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Backes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Nurmi et al., 2018</xref>). While S1 receives rather simple peripheral sensory information, S2 may be related to higher aspects of sensory processing and retention of relevant afferent aspects in working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Lemus et al., 2010</xref>). For Exp 1, we observed results in S2 only for MVPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>), which may reflect that the amplitude-related S2 activity is more spatially distributed compared with S1.</p><p id="P34">We observed that the SMA, the contralateral SMG, the posterior part of the STG, and the contralateral M1 were also involved in the amplitude of passive finger movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The SMA is involved in movement preparation, planning, and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Tanji, 1994</xref>) and has been reported to be associated with passive movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alary et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Guzzetta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Nurmi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Weiller et al., 1996</xref>). As reported in other studies on active and passive movement, we confirmed that SMA activation was more dominant in the contralateral hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Pool et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Zhavoronkova et al., 2017</xref>). It has been suggested that the SMA receives information from the somatosensory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cadoret and Smith, 1997</xref>) and its activation (as well as the contralateral S1) is lower during passive compared to active movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Lolli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Mima et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">Zhavoronkova et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the SMA would be more sensitive to afferent information during active than passive movement and would differentiate between intentional and involuntary movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Mima et al., 1999</xref>). In a different vein, the SMG is part of the somatosensory cortex, processes proprioceptive information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Ben-Shabat et al., 2015</xref>), and is involved in spatial perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bjoertomt et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, M1 is known to be primarily involved in motor execution of body parts. Consistent with our results, single-cell recordings from non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Schwartz, 1992</xref>), and estimation of BOLD activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Shirinbayan et al., 2019</xref>) showed that M1 is associated with movement amplitude, but not velocity (<xref rid="S17" ref-type="sec">Section 3.2</xref>). Interestingly, while M1 remains silent during tactile stimulation, it is active during both active and passive movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Goldring and Ratcheson, 1972</xref>). Therefore, M1 is thought to be involved in proprioceptive feedback independent of skin stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Jansma et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Besides the cortical regions, we also observed that the thalamus and the ipsilateral cerebellum were involved in the amplitude of passive finger movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In Exp 1, the thalamus and ipsilateral cerebellum was associated with amplitude only for the univariate analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). That the thalamus and cerebellum are primarily involved in differential activity, rather than fine coding, may be due to their less specialized involvement, compared to the higher aspects of sensory processing in S2. The thalamus has been associated with active and passive movement, more prominently in the contralateral hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Boscolo Galazzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Shirinbayan et al., 2019</xref>), and sends direct projections to the somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">Viaene et al., 2011</xref>).

Passive movement features may be processed in these regions, likely due to afferent nerves in the brainstem reaching both the cerebellum and the cortex (the latter, crossing the thalamus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Landgren and Silfvenius, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Proske and Gandevia, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S26"><label>4.3.</label><title>Velocity of passive finger movement</title><p id="P36">We also examined brain regions associated with the velocity of passive finger movement. We observed that sensorimotor network regions (contralateral S1 and SMA) showed a negative relationship between activation and velocity, whereas the precuneus showed a positive relationship with velocity. Compared to amplitude, fewer cortical brain regions were associated with velocity during passive movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), which is consistent with previous evidence from spike train recordings in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Golub et al., 2014</xref>) and studies in humans using fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Shirinbayan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Wenzel et al., 2014</xref>) during active movement. In addition, whole-brain univariate analysis yielded significant results in sensorimotor regions that, surprisingly, were not found in whole-brain MVPA.</p><p id="P37">Univariate activity in contralateral S1 and SMA was associated with velocity of passive movement, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Boscolo Galazzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dueñas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Mima et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">Szameitat et al., 2012</xref>). A study on active movement showed that the contralateral S1 is more specific for amplitude than for velocity, congruent to our hypothesis, whereas the SMA is equally involved in both amplitude and velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Shirinbayan et al., 2019</xref>). The peak coordinates for the main effect of velocity were more frontal than for amplitude. In contrast to S1, we observed no evidence for S2 involvement with velocity, similar to findings using nerve stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Backes et al., 2000</xref>) or peripheral stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>). We found a negative relationship between velocity and activation in the contralateral S1 and SMA. This inverse relationship between activity and velocity, independent of stimulus duration, may be due to increased proprioceptive updating during slower trajectories of passive movement. Therefore, we suggest that proprioceptive afferent information during passive movement may depend on velocity, with slower trajectories carrying more proprioceptive information.</p><p id="P38">Some studies have reported the relationship between velocity of passive movement and brain activity based on oscillatory frequencies. Here, we argue that this movement pattern is fundamentally different from linear displacement and may not be directly comparable to our results. During passive linear displacement, the fingers start and end at different positions in space, and proprioception plays a more critical role in spatial localization than in the case of oscillatory stimulation. This experimental difference may be the reason why studies on passive and active movement reported that the sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum were strongly related to movement rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Nurmi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Riecker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">Taniwaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Turner et al., 1998</xref>) while our results with linear velocity were less sensitive. Similar to our study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Shirinbayan et al. (2019)</xref> found less sensitive results for velocity of linear displacements during active movements compared to amplitude. It is also possible that, during rapid oscillatory movements, the neural mechanisms of proprioception for frequency and amplitude are blended. For instance, an early study showed that muscle vibration, initially perceived as movement during rapid oscillatory vibration, was perceived as a change in position at slower frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">McCloskey, 1973</xref>), with position and velocity dissociated in muscle spindles. In fact, it has been proposed that a moderate oscillation rate (and therefore dissociation of position and velocity) is optimal to generate the greatest activation in sensorimotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bae et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, the univariate approach showed that the precuneus was positively related to the velocity of passive movement. The precuneus has also been implicated in passive movement in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Jaeger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Sahyoun et al., 2004</xref>). The precuneus is part of a network that is activated by higher levels of internally-focused attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we can only speculate that the faster passive movement may have induced heightened internally-oriented attention and, consequently, elicited precuneus activity.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><label>4.4.</label><title>Direction of passive finger movement</title><p id="P39">Finally, we also investigated brain regions associated with the direction of passive finger movement, i.e., extension or flexion. We found a set of regions associated with passive movement direction located in the somatosensory cortex, roughly similar to the regions associated with amplitude. We found that contralateral S1 and M1, bilateral STG, ipsilateral S2, SMA, and thalamus were associated with passive movement direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). From the univariate analysis, we found that SMA activity was higher during extension than flexion. Results regarding movement direction are less common in the literature compared to other kinematic features, with some studies reporting no findings for direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dueñas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Shirinbayan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P40">The contralateral S1 related to the direction of passive movement was identified only by MVPA and not by the univariate approach. This finding may imply that the spatial representation for direction is diffuse rather than locally concentrated, which differs from our amplitude and velocity results. In fact, Hammer et al. suggested that directional tuning is better represented neurally by large populations of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hammer et al., 2016</xref>); Eisenberg et al. also showed that directional tuning follows a complex spatial organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Eisenberg et al., 2010</xref>), which is likely lost in second-level group analyses. Previous evidence suggests that directional afferents are primarily based on skin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Proske and Gandevia, 2009</xref>). Here, we speculate that directional afferent information from skin receptors may have a more diffuse brain representation than amplitude, but further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Clinically, when the proprioception is assessed, patients are typically asked to indicate the direction of a passive movement (usually, up or down) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lincoln et al., 1998</xref>). Our results indicate that the amplitude of passive finger movement is more broadly represented in the brain, suggesting that this kinematic feature could also be advantageously used to design more sensitive clinical assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">Zbytniewska et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S28"><label>4.5.</label><title>Methodological considerations</title><p id="P41">Here we would like to address some points related to the modeling strategy used in this study. Of all the combinations of experiments and kinematic features, only the data from Exp 2 for amplitude led to acceptable stability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>, bottom row), i.e., the model trained with these data was reproducible across subjects. We argue that the increased sensitivity combined with the reduced number of levels was important for achieving acceptable stability. Furthermore, Exp 2 yielded results with higher sensitivity to velocity than Exp 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs. S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">4</xref>), thus fewer levels may be appropriate to study the brain correlates of velocity. However, in contrast to amplitude and velocity, data from Exp 1 yielded more sensitive results for direction than Exp 2. This discrepancy may be because Exp 2 had fewer trials available to estimate run-specific betas than Exp 1.</p><p id="P42">Amplitude, velocity, and stimulus duration are inherently related, and varying one feature inevitably implies varying another. In block designs, varying velocity, for example, implies that data will be confounded with frequency or number of repetitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Shirinbayan et al., 2019</xref>). In an event-related design, varying, for example, amplitude implies that velocity or stimulus duration will also vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Turner et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, it is desirable to control results for stimulus duration when studying brain activation related to physical movement. Time-on-task is positively correlated with BOLD activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Yarkoni et al., 2009</xref>) and can confound the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Mumford et al., 2015</xref>). While reaction time in cognitive neuroscience may carry relevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Pamplona et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Woolgar et al., 2014</xref>), stimulus duration in physical stimulation may be of less physiological interest. Stimulus duration can also potentially be a confounder in MVPA, i.e., the classification will also identify brain regions that are associated not only with a condition of interest, but also with stimulus duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Todd et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, MVPA is very sensitive to any differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">Woolgar et al., 2014</xref>), and thus addressing confounders is important to obtain reliable results and accurate interpretations.</p><p id="P43">The first study to analyze the present dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Dueñas et al., 2018</xref>) estimated activation using variable epochs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Grinband et al., 2008</xref>) to account for stimulus duration in the model. This model appropriately scales the estimate when neural activation scales with stimulus duration, but leads to inflated error rates when neural activation does not scale with stimulus duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Mumford et al., 2024</xref>), which may be fundamentally the case when characterizing brain regions that are intrinsically related to sensorimotor components of passive movement rather than simply stimulus duration. In the present study, we constructed the regressors with constant-duration boxcar functions modulated by stimulus duration, which accounts for stimulus duration and mitigates false positives regardless of whether neural activation scales with stimulus duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Mumford et al., 2024</xref>). This methodological difference may explain the differences in univariate results between the seminal study and ours. For instance, our study found a positive relationship between contralateral S1 activation and amplitude, whereas the previous study found a negative relationship. In the current study, the model accounted for stimulus duration and controlled for false positives when neural activation either scales or does not scale with stimulus duration. Our estimate is also unbiased, but contains high variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Mumford et al., 2015</xref>) due to the degree of collinearity between stimulus duration and amplitude/velocity. This variability affects the sensitivity of univariate analysis, but the high sensitivity of MVPA can still identify relevant brain regions. In addition, our model assumed that neural activations in our study could potentially be related to stimulus duration at different levels for each condition, representing a full interaction model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Mumford et al., 2024</xref>). In a complementary analysis, we assessed whether assuming that neural activations relate to stimulus duration independent of condition would alter the trend of our results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). In this alternative model, increased variance prevented the inference of significant differences, though activation remained positively associated with amplitude and negatively associated with velocity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref> A-D). A trend for higher activation during extension compared to flexion was also reproduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7E</xref>). Therefore, our full-interaction model effectively accounts for stimulus duration regardless of whether brain activation scales with it, and it retains power to infer significant differences across condition levels in univariate analysis.</p><p id="P44">Exps 1 and 2 used slow and rapid event-related designs, respectively. Rapid (compared to slow) event-related designs have a higher hemodynamic response functions (HRF), which can increase the variance of the estimate and consequently decrease sensitivity. On the other hand, rapid event-related designs are often preferred experimentally and analytically because they allow the inclusion of more trials and consequently more condition levels within a run. This was likely the reason why we observed idiosyncrasies between approaches only for this experiment for Exp 1. For example, amplitude was associated with S2 response in MVPA but not in univariate analysis and with thalamus and cerebellum in univariate but not in MVPA.</p><p id="P45">Finally, an alternative explanation for the negative association between activation and passive movement velocity may be due to the estimation procedure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Nurmi et al. (2018)</xref> reported that, in a block design, S1 activity gradually increased with movement rate, but plateaued or even decreased at higher rates. The authors observed that relatively lower rates better tracked the convolved HRF. Since both the univariate analysis and the MVPA in our study relied on the GLM, the results depend on how well the BOLD signal followed the convolved HRF. However, we argue that such a degradation of estimation may be less likely in an event-related design. Further studies may help clarify this point.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><label>4.6.</label><title>Limitations</title><p id="P46">The present study has several limitations. First, moving the index finger in opposition to the thumb is only one of a multitude of possible finger movements. Solutions in MRI-compatible robotics may use more degrees of freedom to explore and characterize the kinaesthetics of passive movement for other hand movements. Second, on a methodological level, only four runs were available for the cross-validation procedure to determine the performance of the predictive model, and a larger number of runs could have led to more robust results. Third, for training the model, we used a linear support vector machine (SVM) for the separation between classes, which might have led to relatively low accuracy values compared to non-linear models; however, the use of SVM improves interpretability and minimizes concerns about overfitting. Fourth, we used ROIs based on coordinates previously reported in related literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Boscolo Galazzo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="P47">Individualizing the definition of the ROIs, using functional or anatomical strategies, would presumably lead to more sensitive results for ROI analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Pamplona et al., 2020</xref>). Fifth, a previous study showed that MVPA classification performance is improved for rapid event-related designs through running separate GLMs for each trial and combining all the other trials into nuisance regressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Mumford et al., 2012</xref>). The GLM approach we used, which consisted of estimating all the regressors of interest simultaneously, is a common procedure, but leads to higher estimation variability compared to separate GLMs. However, the same study concluded that estimating regressors of interest either separately or simultaneously results in similar classification performance when the design contains inter-stimulus intervals of at least 4 s on average, which was the case for Exp 1.</p></sec><sec id="S30" sec-type="conclusions"><label>4.7.</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P48">Here, we studied the association between brain regions and kinematic features of passive index finger movement, independently of each other. This was achieved through univariate and multivariate analyses, systematic robotically-driven passive movement stimulation, and controlling for stimulus duration, regardless of whether brain activation scales with it. We found that a large network of sensorimotor and motor regions encode the amplitude of passive finger movements, but neural correlates for velocity and direction of passive movement were weaker. The predominance of amplitude over other kinematic features suggests that brain activity related to passive movement is primarily related to the measurement of finger position through muscle spindles and to the constant updating of expected position. Understanding how passive movement is translated into neural responses is essential for designing neurally-guided passive movement therapy after brain injury. The findings presented here may help track neural reorganization and guide how neurorehabilitation can use neural representation of kinematic features to promote brain recovery.</p></sec></sec><sec

Adduction and abduction of right thumb and index finger relative to each other were provided to the subjects, while they were lying in the MRI scanner, with the wrist positioned in the anatomically neutral position. We show two static positions of the fingers between event-related trials. Relative to a null aperture (Velcro straps touching each other), the left/right image shows an aperture of 20%/80% of the subject’s maximum amplitude, respectively. (B) Factorial designs for Exps 1 and 2, respectively. Each element of the 3-D representation is a possible combination of levels of kinematic features (amplitude, velocity, and direction) in an event-related trial. Exp 1 was designed as a 3×3×2 factorial design, with three levels of amplitude, three levels of velocity, and two levels of direction. Exp 2 was designed as a 2×2×2 factorial design, with two levels of amplitude, two levels of velocity, and two levels of direction.
