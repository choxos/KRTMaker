One method of activation is to use Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a well-established B cell mitogen that can drive proliferation <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Using quantitative proteomics, we identify an upregulation of proteins following LPS stimulation involved in metabolic pathways including amino acid uptake and cholesterol biosynthesis.

LPS stimulation increased cellular cholesterol levels and inhibition of the rate-limiting enzymes HMG-CoA-reductase (HMGCR) and Squalene monooxygenase in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway significantly reduced proliferation. The critical role of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway was not limited to LPS. Stimulation via TLR7, TLR9, CD40 and the B Cell Receptor also increased cholesterol levels and inhibition of HMGCR reduced proliferation.

Naïve B cells express IgM and potentially IgD. Following activation, B cells have the potential to switch from IgM to either IgG, IgA or IgE production, depending on the mechanism of activation and cytokine environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Two main classes of activation have been described; T cell-dependent (TD) and T-independent (TI). In TD activation, following recognition of a protein antigen via the B cell receptor (BCR), the B cell can present peptides from the antigen to CD4 T cells, resulting in T cell activation. At the same time, stimulation of CD40 on the B cell via CD154 (CD40L) promotes B cell maturation, including proliferation, class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. This results in the production of high-affinity class-switched antibodies. <italic>In vivo</italic>, T-dependent activation occurs in germinal centres and has been proposed to be the major way in which high-affinity antibodies and B cell memory are generated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. In contrast, TI antigens are usually not proteins, with most being polysaccharides and frequently activate B cells via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) potentially in combination with the BCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Unlike TD antigens, TI antigens are not classically associated with geminal centre formation <italic>in vivo</italic> and are instead associated with the production of low-affinity IgM antibodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">A well-established model to study TI B cell activation <italic>ex vivo</italic> is to use Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which stimulates TLR4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and induces robust B cell proliferation and antibody secretion both <italic>ex vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> and <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. LPS is a major constituent of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria which is composed of three domains: lipid A, the core oligosaccharide, and the O antigen <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Upon activation, TLR4 propagates downstream signalling through the adaptor proteins MyD88 and TRIF, which in turn activates pathways including MAPK and NF-κB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. While this pathway has been most extensively studied in innate immune cells it can also elicit a range of responses, including proliferation and cytokine production in B cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The essential role of TLR4 in LPS-induced activation of B cells has been demonstrated by studies using TLR4-deficient mice. In contrast to B cells from wild-type mice, B cells from TLR4 knockout mice did not proliferate in response to LPS or lipid A stimulation <italic>ex vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. A similar result was also found using B cells from Myd88 knockout mice, an adaptor protein that links TLRs to downstream signalling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">An important component of both TD and TI responses is B cell proliferation. It is likely that changes in metabolic requirements and energy demand to support proliferation will require changes in the proteome of the B cells. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Naïve B cells have been shown to remain in a quiescent state with low metabolic demand <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, upon activation using LPS or anti-IgM to stimulate the BCR, both glucose uptake and oxygen consumption rate are increased <sup>18 19</sup>.</p><p id="P5">In the present study, we use Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) based mass spectrometry to map proteomic changes in B cells following activation with LPS and Interleukin 4 (IL-4) <italic>ex vivo</italic>. This revealed important roles for amino acid uptake and cholesterol metabolism in the proliferative response to LPS stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>LPS + IL-4 stimulation of naïve B cells promotes proliferation and changes the expression of enzymes involved in cell metabolism</title><p id="P6">Previous studies have shown that <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation of murine B cells with LPS and IL-4 can drive B cell proliferation and class switching to IgG1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Consistent with this we found that stimulation of lymphocytes isolated from lymph nodes and subsequently stimulated with LPS + IL-4 resulted in the proliferation of CD19+ B cells, as judged by dilution of Cell Trace Violet (CTV) labelling. LPS + IL-4 stimulation leads to extensive proliferation with up to 6 generations of B cells present after 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Proliferation itself is thought to be a prerequisite for cells to undergo class-switching <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In line with this, only LPS + IL-4 stimulated B cells found in later generations were positive for IgG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). On a similar note, cell size is considered a key regulator of the G1/S transition, as progression through the cell cycle can only continue once a certain threshold in size has been reached <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we found that 72 hours of LPS + IL-4 stimulation led to a marked increase in cell size and granularity as indicated by a higher forward/side scatter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-D</xref>). Stimulation with IL-4 alone resulted in a smaller increase in cell size than a combination of LPS and IL-4 but did not give rise to a strong proliferative response or class switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-D</xref>).</p><p id="P7">These functional changes seen following activation suggest a significant change in regulation is occurring at the protein level. To investigate this further, we performed DIA-based mass spectrometry to compare the proteome of B cells after 24 hours of LPS + IL-4 stimulation to that of naive B cells. Using this approach a total of 8030 protein species were identified, of which 7187 were quantified in both naïve and LPS + IL-4 stimulated cells. Based on the mass spectrometry data, the predicted total protein mass in the B cells increased by approximately 2-fold following stimulation with a combination of LPS + IL-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). The proteomic ruler method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, was used to estimate protein copy numbers and concentration then used to calculate fold changes between naïve and LPS + IL-4 stimulated B cells. This change in mass was due to an increased copy number of most proteins in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>), with a median log2 fold increase of 1.04. To adjust for the increase in cell size, the fold change in protein concentration was used as this could provide an indication of which proteins may be enriched, up or down, following LPS + IL-4 treatment, over those changing proportionally with cell size.</p><p id="P8">Using cutoffs of <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05 and a log2 fold change more than one standard deviation away from the median, 863 proteins were found to be enriched following activation while a further 301 were detected in all the stimulated B cells but none of the naïve ones. 409 proteins were downregulated in the LPS + IL-4 stimulated cells in comparison to naïve B cells, while a further 57 were detected in the naïve B cells but none of the activated B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To identify the biological pathways which were affected by LPS + IL-4 stimulation, the enriched proteins were searched against the Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Processes, Uniprot Keyword Biological Process and <italic>Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes</italic> (KEGG) databases. Enrichment analysis on the downregulated proteins did not highlight any specific processes. However, upregulated proteins were associated with terms related to the cell cycle, ribosome biogenesis, protein translation and steroid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">While these processes would make sense in terms of cell proliferation, it was notable that changes in the glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were not highlighted in this analysis. Previous studies have indicated that there is an increased demand for glucose in LPS activated B cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Isotope tracing experiments following CD40L and IL-4 activation to stimulate proliferation have suggested that this increased glucose uptake is used in the pentose phosphate pathway, potentially to provide NADPH and precursors for nucleotide biosynthesis while alternative carbon sources are used to drive an increase in the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The levels of enzymes involved in glucose metabolism was examined in the proteomic data.</p><p id="P11">B cells express the SLC2A1 (Glut1) glucose transporter and deletion of this gene has been shown to reduce B cell activation <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. There was a small increase in the concentration of SLC2A1, which would be consistent with an elevated ability to take up glucose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). In addition, there was a 25-fold increase in hexokinase 2 (HK2), one of the enzymes involved in catalysing the 1<sup>st</sup> committed step for glucose to enter the glycolytic or pentose phosphate pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F</xref>) and which has recently been shown to be required for maximal B cells responses to <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation with LPS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. In general, large changes in the estimated concentrations of proteins involved in glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle or oxidative phosphorylation were not observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A, B</xref>), although their copy numbers did increase in proportion to the increase in cell size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C, D</xref>). To investigate if the increased copy number of ETC proteins correlated with changes in mitochondrial mass, B cells were stained with MitoTracker, a fluorescent dye that binds to mitochondria. We found that mitochondrial mass was significantly increased following 24 hours of LPS + IL-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1G, H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>B cell activation upregulates proteins involved in the cell cycle</title><p id="P12">Stimulation with LPS + IL-4 causes B cells to exit from a quiescent state and start to proliferate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). This was confirmed using DAPI staining, which demonstrated that while naïve B cells were predominantly in a G0/1 state, after 24 hours of LPS + IL-4 stimulation the proportion of B cells in the S and G2 stages of the cell cycle was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Progression through G1 is associated with an increase in Cyclin D expression, and activation of CDK4 and 6 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. At the same time inhibitory cell cycle proteins such as p27Kip1 (Cdkn1b) are downregulated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We therefore analysed the proteomic data for evidence of these changes. In naïve B cells, Cyclin D was not detected while levels of CDK4 and 6 were low. The levels of Cyclin D, CDK4 and CDK6 were all increased following stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-E</xref>). Naïve B cells expressed high levels of p27Kip1, and this was reduced by LPS + IL-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Unphosphorylated RB1 binds to the E2F1/2/3 transcription factor, preventing the transcription of genes required for cell cycle progression. Increased CDK4/6 activity initiates RB1 phosphorylation, reducing its interaction with E2F, and resulting in the induction of E2F target genes, allowing progression through G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Increased phosphorylation of RB1 was observed in B cells following LPS+ IL-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G, H</xref>). In line with the increased RB1 phosphorylation, the levels of protein expressed from known E2F target genes, such as <italic>Mcm2-7, Pcna, Dhfr, Rrm1/2</italic> and <italic>Pola</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, were increased following LPS + IL-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>). Further progression through the cell cycle requires Cyclins E, A and B as well as CDK2 and CDK1. While Cyclin E was not detected in the proteomic data, the levels of Cyclin A, Cyclin B, CDK2 and CDK1 were all increased by LPS + IL-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2J-M</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Protein synthesis in LPS + IL-4 stimulated B cells is dependent on the uptake of amino acids</title><p id="P14">The cell growth and proliferation promoted by LPS + IL-4 stimulation would be expected to require an increased rate of protein synthesis. This is consistent with the proteomic analysis, which demonstrated an increase in total protein content within activated B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>) and an enrichment of proteins associated with protein translation including proteins that regulate ribosome biogenesis and the ribosomes themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). The ribosome is composed of the 40S and 60S subunits, each of which is composed of multiple protein subunits <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. LPS + IL-4 stimulation increased the total concentration of ribosomal proteins that make up both the 40S and 60S subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). This overall increase was due to higher expression of most of the individual proteins that make up the subunits, rather than a large increase in one or two of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E, F</xref>). In line with the increase in ribosomal proteins, there was also an upregulation of proteins associated with ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C, D, G</xref>). To determine if this correlated with an increased rate of protein synthesis, we measured the incorporation of the puromycin analog o-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) into newly synthesised proteins. Consistent with the upregulation of ribosomal proteins and biogenesis, OPP incorporation was significantly higher in B cells stimulated with LPS + IL-4 for 24 hours compared to naive B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H-I</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Elevated protein synthesis during rapid proliferation would require an increased <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> supply of amino acids, which could not be completely satisfied by internal sources of amino acids within the B cell. Several amino acid transporters were detected in the proteomic analysis, and these were all found to be upregulated in response to stimulation with LPS + IL-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). To look at the requirement for increased amino acid uptake for B cell proliferation more closely we focused on the Lat1 transporter, a member of the System L transporters. Lat1 is a heterodimer composed of an amino acid transporting light chain subunit, SLC7A5, and a chaperone heavy chain subunit, SLC3A2 (CD98) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. SLC3A2 can also dimerise with some other amino acid transporters. Both of these subunits were upregulated in the proteomic data following LPS + IL-4 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B, C</xref>), and the upregulation of SLC3A2 was confirmed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D, E</xref>).</p><p id="P16"><italic>Slc7a5</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>/Vav-iCre<sup>+/-</sup> mice, which have a deletion of SLC7A5 in all hematopoietic cells, have a comparable number of naive B cells to wild-type (WT), littermate controls, indicating that SLC7A5 is not critical for initial B cell development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. To examine how the loss of SLC7A5 affects B cell proliferation in response to LPS + IL-4 stimulation, B cells were isolated from wild-type (WT) and <italic>Slc7a5</italic> <sup>fl/fl</sup>/Vav-iCre<sup>+/-</sup> mice, labelled with CTV, and stimulated for 72 hours <italic>ex vivo</italic> with LPS + IL-4. While WT B cells proliferated, the majority of the <italic>Slc7a5</italic> <sup>fl/fl</sup>/Vav-iCre<sup>+/-</sup> B cells failed to divide, and the number of viable B cells after 72 hours was much lower compared to WT B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F, G</xref>). In line with the failure to proliferate, there was no evidence of class switching in the remaining <italic>Slc7a5</italic> <sup>fl/fl</sup>/Vav-iCre<sup>+/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H, I</xref>). SLC7A5 transports large neutral amino acids, including phenylalanine, histidine, methionine, tryptophan and isoleucine, as well as the tryptophan metabolite kynurenine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. As kynurenine is fluorescent and its uptake can be measured by flow cytometry, the effect of LPS + IL-4 treatment on kynurenine uptake in B cells was determined. In line with the increased expression of SLC7A5 in LPS + IL-4 treated B cells; kynurenine uptake was also higher in B cells treated with LPS + IL-4 for 24 hours compared to naive B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J</xref>). Kynurenine uptake in the LPS+IL-4 stimulated B cells was reduced by the competitive substrate 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)- heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), which inhibits uptake through System L transporters. Kynurenine uptake in <italic>Slc7a5</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>/Vav-iCre<sup>+/-</sup> B cells was similar to the uptake in BCH-treated WT cells suggesting that SLC7A5 was the major system L transporter in LPS + IL-4 stimulated B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J</xref>). BCH or SLC7A5 knockout did not reduce kynurenine uptake to baseline levels indicating that other transport mechanisms for kynurenine uptake exists in B cells. Incubation of the LPS + IL-4 stimulated B without kynurenine was used as an uptake control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J</xref>). Similar results were obtained for B cells stimulated with LPS in the absence of IL-4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Cholesterol metabolism is upregulated in activated B cells</title><p id="P17">The enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>) suggested that sterol biosynthesis may be upregulated by LPS + IL-4 stimulation. Sterol biosynthesis allows the generation of cholesterol from Acetyl CoA within the cell via a complex multistep process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). The 1<sup>st</sup> half of this pathway, often referred to as the mevalonate pathway, results in the production of farnesyl pyrophosphate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. This can then be used for several purposes in the cell including the synthesis of cholesterol via the Bloch or Kandutsch- Russell pathways <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, prompting us to investigate this pathway further. Analysis of proteomic data showed that the majority of enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis were increased in LPS + IL-4 stimulated cells relative to naive B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Cholesterol biosynthesis is controlled by 2 rate-limiting steps, the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid which is catalysed by HMG-CoA-reductase (HMGCR) and the conversion of squalene to 2,3(<italic>S</italic>)-oxidosqualene catalysed by squalene monooxygenase (SQLE) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>; while neither of these enzymes were detected in the proteomic dataset for the naive B cells they were both robustly expressed in the LPS + IL-4 stimulated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B, C</xref>). Cells can also obtain cholesterol via the uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) through the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Similar to HMGCR and SQLE, the LDLR was not found in naive B cells but was detected in B cells following LPS + IL-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Together the above results suggest that LPS + IL-4 treatment would drive an increase in cellular cholesterol.</p><p id="P18">To test this, B cells were stained with the fluorescent dye filipin which binds to cellular cholesterol. LPS + IL-4 stimulation resulted in a gradual increase in cholesterol levels from 8 hours to 24 hours of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). As cells can obtain cholesterol via <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis or uptake of LDL from serum, we compared the effects of culturing B cells in normal serum or serum treated with fumed silica to remove LDL <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Analysis of the serum indicated that this treatment successfully removed LDL and HDL but did not affect the levels of triglycerides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>). Since culturing B cells in cholesterol free media resulted in a higher level of filipin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>) we titrated inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis in this, to see what concentration was required to reduce filipin staining.</p><p id="P19">This increase in cholesterol could be blocked by the HMGCR inhibitors Fluvastatin or Rosuvastatin or by NB-598, an inhibitor of SQLE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F-H</xref>). Cells remained viable after 24 hours of inhibitor treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>).

While these changes are not unexpected, it illustrates the potential of the proteomic dataset to highlight processes important for B cell proliferation. GO term Enrichment analysis indicated that proteins involved in protein synthesis, amino acid uptake and cholesterol metabolism were highly upregulated, thus these processes were investigated further.</p><p id="P26">One of the most apparent effects of LPS + IL-4 stimulation was to increase the protein mass of the individual B cells, which was accompanied by an increase in ribosomal proteins and the rate of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In order to synthesise new proteins, get bigger and divide, B cells would require more amino acids than they would be able to generate by protein recycling. For essential amino acids, this would require the import of amino acids from the environment. Upon activation, B cells upregulated several amino acid transporters including the system L transporters SLC7A5 and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), which can import large neutral amino acids, including the essential amino acids histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Of these, SLC7A5 was expressed at a higher level and was responsible for the majority of amino acid uptake via system 1 transporters. Amino acid uptake was sensitive to the competitive substrate BCH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J</xref>), which blocks both SLC7A5 and 6. The cationic amino acid transporter SLC7A1, which can import the conditionally essential amino acids lysine and arginine, was also upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Knockout of SLC7A5 in either hematopoietic cells or B cells has been previously shown not to affect the number of splenic B cells in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, although a decrease in the number of peritoneal B1 cells was reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.

This suggests that the B cells may rely on different amino acid transporters at different points in their development.

Furthermore, these proteins, as well as serine biosynthesis, were found to be increased by stimuli, such as anti-IgM, CD40L and CpG, that are known to induce B cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. While not directly addressed in the current study, the proteomic data reported here also demonstrates the upregulation of serine biosynthetic enzymes, including the rate limiting enzyme PHDGH, in response to LPS + IL-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Proliferating cells also need to generate new membranes as they increase in size, before undergoing cell division. Consistent with this, lipidomic studies have reported that LPS activated B cells have a higher total lipid content than naive B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. In addition to phospholipids and sphingolipids, cell membranes also contain cholesterol. Interestingly while LPS + IL-4 upregulated proteins were not enriched for proteins involved in phospholipid and sphingolipid biosynthesis, there was a strong enrichment for proteins involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, H</xref>). In line with this, there was also an increase in the cholesterol content of B cells following stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

The importance of SREBP regulation <italic>in vivo</italic> for B cell function has recently been demonstrated using B cell specific knockouts of SCAP. In these mice, geminal centre formation and antibody responses to immunisation were compromised. Furthermore, B cells from these mice did not respond to mitogenic stimulation in part due to an inability to increase cellular cholesterol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P32">B cells can obtain cholesterol either via biosynthesis or uptake, the main route for which would be the uptake of LDL via the LDLR.

Interestingly, B cells proliferated faster in cholesterol free media in response to LPS + IL-4 stimulation, whereas deletion of the LDLR resulted in B cells that proliferated more slowly than WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D, E</xref>). Previous work in CD8 T cells has shown that signalling pathways downstream of mTORC1 were differentially regulated between <italic>Ldlr-/-</italic> CD8 T cells and WT CD8 T cells. Additionally, the delivery of cholesterol to the lysosome by lipoproteins via the LDLR triggered mORC1 activation resulting in CD8 T cell activation, proliferation and metabolic reprogramming <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>.

As a result, HMGCR inhibitors will block prenylation in addition to protein synthesis. Canonical prenylation pathways typically involves the addition of farnesyl or geranylgeranyl lipids onto the cysteine residue in a CAAX motif in target proteins via the enzymes protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) or protein geranlygeranyltransferase I (GGTase I)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. We found that FGTI-2734, an inhibitor of FTase and GGTase, blocked LPS induced B cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G-I</xref>), suggesting an important role for prenylation in B cells. As inhibition of SQLE, which is downstream of farnesyl-pyrophosphate in cholesterol biosynthesis also blocked B cell proliferation it is likely that HMGCR inhibition will have a dual effect on B cell activation via both cholesterol synthesis and prenylation. Of note, the inhibition of HMGCR with Atorvastatin has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of B cells isolated from human blood following CD40L stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>.
