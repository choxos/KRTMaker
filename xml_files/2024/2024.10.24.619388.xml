In mammals, the pathways supporting cell proliferation in nutrient-limiting conditions have not been fully elucidated, although cancers are known to display metabolic dependencies that can be targeted for therapy. Here, we combine systematic nutrient and genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening to provide a comprehensive map of the signaling and metabolic pathways that support cell proliferation in glutamine-limited conditions. We focus on pyruvate anaplerosis and discover a mechanism by which the tumor suppressor FBXW7 controls a MYC-dependent cluster of epigenetic repressors that bind the pyruvate carboxylase (<italic>PC</italic>) promoter, leading to histone deacetylation, reduced <italic>PC</italic> expression and glutamine addiction. Our work sheds light on the molecular mechanisms that support metabolic flexibility, and on the nutrients and pathways involved in glutamine dependency, a hallmark of several cancers.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F6" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS199697-f005"/></fig>

Amino acids are among the nutrients that show the highest variation both in our diet and across tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, and among them glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in plasma and one of the most highly utilized amino acids in cells in culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Besides its role as an essential constituent of proteins, glutamine acts as a major contributor both in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, where it participates in ATP generation and amino acids synthesis, and in nitrogen metabolism, serving as an amine donor in multiple metabolic reactions.</p><p id="P4">While glutamine is classically viewed as a non-essential amino acid, it has long been known that mammalian cells can become dependent on its extracellular availability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This phenomenon, sometimes referred to as “glutamine addiction” has been observed both in cell culture and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and it is thought to be the result of high proliferation rates which exceed the capacity for its intracellular biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. In tumors, glutamine addiction is mainly driven by the oncogene c-MYC (<italic>MYC</italic>), which promotes the expression of glutamine transporters and glutaminase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, thereby converting glutamine into glutamate and facilitating its entry into the TCA cycle. This process has been exploited for cancer therapy based on glutaminase inhibition, although with only limited success in pre-clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, partly due to the metabolic flexibility of cancer cells and the presence of alternative nutrients in the complex tumor microenvironment. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that promote cell survival in a glutamine-limited environment could help to identify novel approaches to limit cancer cell proliferation.</p><p id="P5">Earlier studies have highlighted certain nutrients and metabolic pathways that can sustain proliferation of glutamine-deprived cells, including pyruvate carboxylation, the malate-aspartate shuttle and asparagine synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, as well as other pathways that become detrimental in the absence of glutamine, such as proline synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. However, despite this important work, we still lack a global view of the nutrients and metabolic pathways involved in cell survival when glutamine is scarce. Here, we combine large-scale nutrient and genetic screens to provide a unified model of the metabolites and molecular pathways that sustain viability upon glutamine starvation. We further reveal an epigenetic mechanism whereby the tumor suppressor <italic>FBXW7</italic> alleviates glutamine dependency by promoting expression of pyruvate carboxylase (<italic>PC</italic>), thus favoring pyruvate anaplerosis and proliferation in nutrient-limiting conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Nutrient screening identifies molecules increasing proliferation in a glutamine-limited environment</title><p id="P6">We sought to explore the mechanisms that maintain proliferation during glutamine deprivation, and observed that glutamine depletion led to a rapid loss of proliferation and viability in K562 myelogenous leukemia cells, indicating strict dependency on glutamine availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). Reasoning that the cell culture medium represents only a fraction of the molecules available to cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, we designed a nutrient screen where we supplemented the medium with 371 carbon and nitrogen sources in order to identify nutrients able to compensate for glutamine depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). We found a wide range of metabolites able to sustain proliferation to various extents, including carboxylic acids such as α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and α-ketobutyrate (α-KB), and amino acids chemically related to glutamine, some of which had previously been observed in the context of glutamine deprivation or glutaminase inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). In our screen, we found that pyruvate provided the most robust increase in proliferation in glutamine-deprived medium, a result that we could validate in additional cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Since nutrient availability has been well-characterized as a limiting factor in solid tumors due to poor vascularization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> we tested our findings using a three-dimensional spheroid model to determine whether pyruvate could also increase cell proliferation in a more physiological model of glutamine deprivation. We grew HEK293T cells in medium supplemented with either glutamine or pyruvate and measured spheroid diameter at regular time intervals. As expected, we found that in the absence of glutamine spheroids failed to grow and developed morphological characteristics consistent with cell death, while growth of spheroids was restored in the presence of glutamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G, H</xref>). Furthermore, addition of pyruvate also significantly rescued both the growth and appearance of spheroids in glutamine-depleted medium, consistent with the results obtained using K562 cells.</p><p id="P8">We next examined which metabolic pathways were most affected by glutamine and pyruvate. In cells with certain mitochondrial defects, pyruvate and the enzyme prosthetic <italic>Lb</italic>NOX are able to correct the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio and restore cell growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, we found that <italic>Lb</italic>NOX had only a minimal effect in our glutamine-restricted conditions, indicating that restoring the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio is not the primary effect of pyruvate under glutamine deprivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). We therefore performed steady-state metabolomics following glutamine restriction and found that it severely decreased the abundance of all TCA cycle intermediates, as well as certain amino acids such as glutamate, aspartate and asparagine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). The levels of metabolites related to glycolysis, nucleotide synthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, as well as other amino acids showed little to no variation in the absence of glutamine. We then repeated this experiment using medium supplemented with pyruvate and observed a significant rescue in all detected TCA cycle intermediates and in the same three amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>), suggesting that the anaplerotic contribution of pyruvate to the mitochondrial TCA cycle increased during glutamine deprivation.</p><p id="P9">To test this hypothesis, we treated cells with the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibitor UK5099 and observed that while cells grown in glutamine-rich medium did not show any decrease in proliferation, the growth advantage conferred by pyruvate supplementation in the absence of glutamine was almost completely abolished in the presence of this inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>). Furthermore, to investigate a possible effect of pyruvate in anaplerosis we performed <sup>13</sup>C pyruvate-based isotope labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1K</xref>) and found increased <sup>13</sup>C incorporation in all detected TCA cycle intermediates in absence of glutamine, as well as in glutamate, aspartate, asparagine and in glutamine itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1L</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). Combining the results from our nutrient screen and stable isotope-assisted profiling experiment, we conclude that the contribution of pyruvate to the TCA cycle and to the synthesis of selected amino acids increases during glutamine deprivation to restore cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Genetic screening reveals metabolic networks promoting pyruvate anaplerosis in absence of glutamine</title><p id="P10">We next designed a genome-wide screen aimed at identifying the molecular pathways able to maintain proliferation in glutamine-free, pyruvate-rich conditions. We infected K562 cells with the Brunello lentiviral genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 library with 76,441 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting 19,114 distinct human genes and 1,000 controls. After incubation for 10 days to allow for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout, we transferred the cells to a DMEM-based medium containing glucose and pyruvate, either with or without glutamine. After 21 days we harvested the cells and performed next-generation sequencing to determine the abundance of sgRNAs in each condition. We analyzed the data using a Z score-based method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, highlighting genes that were either required (negative ΔZ score) or detrimental (positive ΔZ score) for growth of the glutamine-starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Our screen highlighted several pathways known to participate in central carbon metabolism, including the malate-aspartate shuttle, the plasma membrane cystine/glutamate exchanger system X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> biotin import and conjugation, pyruvate carboxylation, as well as signaling molecules from the integrated stress response (ISR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). To validate the robustness of our approach, we confirmed experimentally that blocking ISR signaling downstream of the amino acid-sensing arm (genes <italic>GCN1, GCN2</italic>) using ISRIB, a drug that reverses the effect of eIF2α phosphorylation, was detrimental to cell growth in the absence of glutamine, while inhibition of the system X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> (<italic>SLC3A2, SLC7A11</italic>) involved in glutamate extracellular export, was beneficial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). We also focused on a subset of genes involved in the malate-aspartate shuttle and found that our screen not only confirmed the requirement for the mitochondrial arm of the shuttle (<italic>GOT2, MDH2, SLC25A13</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, but it also revealed that deleting the cytosolic arm (<italic>GOT1, MDH1, SLC25A11</italic>), involved in bringing intermediates back to mitochondria, was beneficial in conditions of glutamine deprivation. This screen further confirmed an important role for the <italic>ASNS</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, required for asparagine synthesis. These observations, along with earlier literature, strongly suggested an important role for aspartate synthesis and cytosolic export, as well as for synthesis of asparagine. We confirmed this hypothesis by providing these two amino acids to cells grown in glutamine-deprived medium and expressing <italic>SLC1A3</italic>, a plasma membrane transporter required for aspartate import<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, upon which we observed a partial rescue in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Notably, our screen identified a requirement for biotin-related genes for the growth of glutamine-deprived cells. Biotin, also known as vitamin B7 or vitamin H, is the substrate for biotinylation, a post-translational modification that occurs in 4 different classes of mitochondrial carboxylases, one of which, pyruvate carboxylase (<italic>PC</italic>), was identified in our screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). PC converts pyruvate and CO<sub>2</sub> into oxaloacetate, and a beneficial role for pyruvate carboxylation in glutamine-limited environment has previously been noted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Importantly, our <sup>13</sup>C pyruvate tracer analysis showed increased fraction of the m+3 isotopologues of malate, aspartate and asparagine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1L</xref>), all of which are compatible with increased PC activity in glutamine-limiting conditions. Consistent with this, we confirmed experimentally that, in addition to <italic>PC</italic>, the biotin plasma membrane transporter (<italic>SLC5A6</italic>) and the biotin conjugating enzyme (<italic>HLCS</italic>) were both required for the proliferation of cells in the absence of glutamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>). We further validated these observations using biotin supplementation in glutamine-deprived cells and confirmed a requirement for both pyruvate and biotin to sustain K562 cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>) and HEK293T spheroid formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H, I</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Together, our genetic and nutrient screens provide a wide range of factors whose depletion is either deleterious, or in some cases beneficial, for the proliferation of cells in the absence of glutamine. Importantly, the genes and nutrients we have identified highlight interconnecting pathways and, together with earlier literature, point to a unified model where glutamine-restricted cells rely on import of pyruvate into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>) and its conversion to oxaloacetate by the biotin-dependent carboxylase PC, thereby supporting mitochondrial aspartate synthesis, its export via the malate-aspartate shuttle, and asparagine synthesis in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>FBXW7</italic> supports PC expression and pyruvate anaplerosis</title><p id="P14">While most hits from our genetic screen are involved in central carbon metabolism, the gene that scored the highest in the absence of glutamine was the tumor suppressor <italic>FBXW7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). FBXW7 is a well-characterized substrate recognition component for the cytosolic SKP1-CUL1-F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, involved in degradation of the protein products of oncogenes such as c-MYC, c-JUN, and cyclin E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">Since a role for <italic>FBXW7</italic> in central carbon metabolism was unexpected, we depleted <italic>FBXW7</italic> in K562 cells using CRISPR/Cas9. We observed that while <italic>FBXW7</italic>-depleted cells showed no proliferation defects in glutamine-rich medium, they grew more slowly in the absence of glutamine, regardless of the presence of pyruvate in the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). To investigate whether this difference was specifically due to pyruvate metabolism, we supplemented the cell medium with α-KG and we found that this metabolite was able to rescue cell proliferation independently of the presence of <italic>FBXW7</italic>, pointing to a defect in pyruvate metabolism, rather than a global defect in central carbon metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly, <italic>FBXW7</italic>-depleted HEK293T spheroids failed to grow in glutamine-free conditions, even after pyruvate supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). To clarify the fate of pyruvate in <italic>FBXW7</italic>-depleted cells, we repeated our <sup>13</sup>C pyruvate tracer experiment and focused on malate and aspartate, whose relative fractions of m+3 isotopologue increased in glutamine-limited conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1L</xref>). Importantly, while we confirmed increased enrichment in m+3 isotopologue (following direct conversion of <sup>13</sup>C pyruvate to oxaloacetate) in the absence of glutamine, we found a significant reduction in the same pool in <italic>FBXW7</italic>-depleted cells, irrespective of the presence of glutamine, further suggestive of impaired pyruvate metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>).</p><p id="P16">As the primary function of FBXW7 is known to be in protein degradation, we performed a global cell proteomics analysis to understand how this tumor suppressor and glutamine deprivation affect the proteome. We observed only a few changes in either condition, but importantly, we found that PC was among the most significantly decreased proteins in <italic>FBXW7</italic>-depleted cells, again independently of the presence of glutamine, and common to multiple cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G, H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S7-9</xref>). <italic>PC</italic> was one of the best hits of the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), and low PC expression is fully compatible with both the defects in pyruvate metabolism and the impaired growth in the absence of glutamine seen in cells lacking <italic>FBXW7</italic>. To test for a causal role, we expressed a <italic>PC</italic> cDNA in <italic>FBXW7</italic>-depleted cells. We found that <italic>PC</italic> overexpression not only conferred a growth advantage to cells during glutamine deprivation, it also rescued the proliferation of <italic>FBXW7</italic>-depleted cells to the same extent as in control cells, suggestive of an epistatic effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H, I</xref>). Taking these results together, we propose that <italic>FBXW7</italic> supports the proliferation of cells in the absence of glutamine by promoting PC expression and subsequently pyruvate anaplerosis.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>An FBXW7-MYC-MNT-SIN3A axis controls the expression of PC via histone deacetylation</title><p id="P17">Our observation that PC protein abundance is reduced in the absence of <italic>FBXW7</italic> was unanticipated, firstly because FBXW7 is considered to be mainly involved in protein degradation, and secondly because the two proteins are not localized in the same cellular compartment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. To investigate this further, we measured the transcript levels of <italic>PC</italic> and observed that they were significantly decreased in <italic>FBXW7</italic>-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), mirroring the effect observed in immunoblotting experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). Intriguingly, PC mRNA stability was not affected, suggesting a decrease in its rate of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We reasoned that additional factors involved in <italic>PC</italic> expression might also affect proliferation in the absence of glutamine, and we mined our genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify transcription-related factors. We found a cluster of epigenetic modifiers whose depletion is beneficial for growth in the absence of glutamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>) that included <italic>MNT</italic> and its binding partners <italic>MAX, MLX</italic> and <italic>SIN3A</italic>, as well as <italic>MLXIP</italic>, all of which are involved in transcriptional repression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Notably, this “MNT cluster” lies downstream of c-MYC, an FBXW7 target that can skew the proportion of MAX, MNT and MLX dimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, and we confirmed that c-MYC accumulates in <italic>FBXW7</italic>-depleted K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). As <italic>MYC</italic> is in the top 1% essential genes in K562<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, we first focused on the effects of its overexpression, rather than depletion. To this aim, we employed the tamoxifen-inducible MycER mouse embryonic fibroblast line, which has extensively been used to study <italic>MYC</italic>-dependent glutamine dependency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Importantly, we found that <italic>MYC</italic> overexpression reduced PC protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>), mirroring the results obtained in <italic>FBXW7</italic>-depleted K562. Furthermore, depletion of <italic>MNT</italic> or <italic>SIN3A</italic> (acting downstream of c-MYC) was sufficient to rescue expression of PC in a <italic>FBXW7</italic>-depleted background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>), thus confirming regulation of <italic>PC</italic> by MYC and the MNT cluster.</p><p id="P19">Genes from the MNT cluster act as transcriptional repressors that bind genomic DNA and recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs) to lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. This prompted us to probe for H3K27 acetylation, one of the main epigenetic alterations in cancers driven by <italic>FBXW7</italic> loss of function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We first analyzed the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and sequencing data from the ENCODE project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and observed a clear signature for binding of c-MYC, MNT and SIN3A on the <italic>PC</italic> promoter in K562 cells, as well as H3K27Ac peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>). We next performed our own ChIP experiment using a set of qPCR primers designed specifically to measure H3K27Ac on the <italic>PC</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G</xref>, red bar). We found that while the H3K27Ac profile of control genes with either high (<italic>GAPDH, ALDOA</italic>) or low (<italic>MYOD</italic>) acetylation was unaffected, acetylation on the <italic>PC</italic> promoter was significantly reduced in <italic>FBXW7</italic>-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4H</xref>), again mirroring transcript and protein abundance. Taken together, our data indicate that upon increased c-MYC expression in <italic>FBXW7</italic>-depleted cells, an MNT-related cluster of transcriptional repressors recruits HDACs on the <italic>PC</italic> promoter, leading to decreased H3K27 acetylation, low <italic>PC</italic> expression, impaired pyruvate anaplerosis, and glutamine dependency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">Glutamine is one of the most versatile and highly consumed amino acids. Here, we have employed parallel nutrient and genetic screening to provide a comprehensive inventory of metabolites and molecular pathways required for the proliferation of cells in glutamine-deprived environments. Previous efforts had identified nutrients that could partially compensate for glutamine depletion, or glutaminase inhibition, including carboxylic acids, aspartate and asparagine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Our systematic approach has confirmed the role of some of these metabolites, and in addition provides a direct comparison between hundreds of nutrients, covering most of the diversity found in the plasma or in the tumor interstitial fluid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Our data highlight pyruvate and TCA cycle-related metabolites as the main determinants for cell proliferation in absence of glutamine. While glutamine is considered both a carbon and a nitrogen source, our findings indicate that its involvement in central carbon metabolism outweighs its role as a nitrogen donor, possibly due to the presence of other nitrogen-containing molecules, such as amino acids, in the environment. We confirmed the role of pyruvate in carbon metabolism using a <sup>13</sup>C-labeled tracer, which showed significant incorporation of pyruvate-derived carbon in the TCA cycle intermediates as well as in aspartate and asparagine, two amino acids essential for proliferation. In agreement with earlier studies, we could show that supplementation with aspartate or asparagine was sufficient to restore proliferation in glutamine-restricted cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P21">To extend this analysis we took advantage of the observation that pyruvate-supplemented cells are able to survive glutamine starvation to design a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen aimed at identifying the genes involved in the proliferation of glutamine-restricted cells in the presence of pyruvate. Integrating data from our nutrient and genetic screens with our <sup>13</sup>C pyruvate tracer analysis and earlier literature, we can now propose a unified model in which pyruvate rescues cell proliferation in glutamine-limiting conditions by serving as an anaplerotic substrate for PC, thus promoting mitochondrial aspartate biogenesis, its subsequent export to the cytosol via the malate-aspartate shuttle, and its utilization in asparagine, protein and nucleotide synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2J</xref>). In support of this model, we showed that while depleting the mitochondrial arm of the malate-aspartate shuttle, involved in aspartate export, is detrimental in glutamine-limited conditions, depleting its cytosolic arm, involved in bringing carbon back into mitochondria, is beneficial. Similarly, we report that inhibiting the plasma membrane cystine/glutamate exchanger system X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> is beneficial to cell growth when glutamine is limiting. This observation could be explained by conservation of intracellular glutamine-derived glutamate and warrants caution in the use of system X<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibitors that are currently being developed for cancer therapy, as they could promote the survival of cells in the glutamine-limited tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, our work also highlights the need for the vitamin biotin, and the machinery for biotin import and conjugation to proteins, which provides an essential co-factor for PC.

Our results provide a unified model of the molecular mechanisms which allow proliferation of glutamine-starved cells, as well as an important resource for further investigations in the field. Glutamine depletion, and nutrient fluctuations in general, are constantly faced by mammalian cells according to both diet and changing physiological states, such as tissue migration, cell growth and differentiation. Investigating how cells cope with such heterogenous conditions will increase our understanding of the factors supporting metabolic flexibility, and could provide applications in pathological settings such as nutrient scarcity upon pathogen infection and malignant cell adaptation to the cancer microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="P24">The present work provides a systematic analysis of both nutrients and molecular pathways required to sustain proliferation of cells in a glutamine-restricted environment. A common limitation of genetic screens performed in a pooled format is cross-feeding (namely the transfer of nutrients between cells via the culture medium) and competition between cells in the population. While we have validated many of the hits from our screens, future work should include continuing the experimental validation of the additional genes and metabolites highlighted by these approaches. Our work thus far has focused on seven adherent and suspension cancer cell lines grown in two or three dimensions.

All tables containing peak areas of detected metabolites were processed and filtered based on CV calculated across QC samples. Data was discarded when peaks showed analytical variability with CV above 30%. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was performed using the Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli method. Metabolites with FDR&lt;1% were loaded on MetaboAnalyst 6.0 for Pathway Impact Analysis using the Homo sapiens KEGG pathway library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.

Cell extracts were prepared and quantified as above (see “Multiple pathway targeted analysis of polar metabolites”) and analyzed using Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HILIC-HRMS) in negative ionization mode with a 6550 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight (Q-TOF) system interfaced with 1290 UHPLC system (Agilent Technology), as detailed elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Metabolite separation was achieved via an iHILIC-(P) Classic PEEK column (100 x 2.1 mm, 5 μm particle size, HILICON AB, Umea, Sweden) column. Mobile phase composition was A = 20 mM ammonium acetate and 20 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OH in water at pH 9.7 and B = 100% ACN. Linear gradient elution: 90% B (0-1.5 min) to 50% B (8-11 min) down to 45% B (12-15 min). For column re-equilibration, the initial chromatographic conditions were set during 9 min post-run (flow rate 300 μL/min, column temperature 30°C, injection volume 2 μl). ESI conditions were the following: dry gas temperature 290°C and flow 14 L/min, fragmentor voltage 380 V, sheath gas temperature 350°C and flow 12 L/min, nozzle voltage 0 V, and capillary voltage -2000 V. Acquisition was set over the full <italic>m/z</italic> range 50-1000 at the MS acquisition rate of 2 spectra/s.
