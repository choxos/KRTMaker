Previous studies have shown that frontal cortical neurons encode these variables, but how this encoding is structured across different frontal regions and projection pathways remains unclear. We developed a decision-making task for head-fixed mice in which we varied the expected value and risk associated with reward-predicting stimuli. Using large-scale electrophysiology and projection-specific optotagging across multiple frontal regions, we identified distinct spatial gradients for these variables, with stronger expected value coding in dorsal regions and stronger risk coding in medial regions. We then demonstrated that this encoding further depends on the neuronal projections: frontal neurons projecting to the dorsomedial striatum and claustrum differentially encoded economic variables. Our findings illustrate that frontal cortical representation of economic variables is jointly determined by spatial organization and downstream connectivity of neurons, revealing a structured, multi-scale code for economic variables.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Making an economic decision involves evaluating options that might vary in several dimensions such as reward magnitude, probability, or delay. A fundamental question in neuroscience is how the brain represents such economic variables to guide successful behavior. Past studies have revealed that neural activity in the frontal cortex encodes economic variables<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, and that these signals are necessary for economic decision-making<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Despite this progress, the principles governing frontal cortical representations of economic variables remain elusive.</p><p id="P3">Some studies have identified localized frontal cortical signals representing economic variables<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Other experiments have proposed that neuronal representations may be distributed across the frontal cortex, with neurons in different regions encoding an overlapping array of variables<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. More recently, several studies have suggested that select projection-defined populations of frontal cortical neurons are engaged during economic decision-making behavior, suggesting that frontal neural representations may be structured according to downstream connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. However, a limitation of this body of work is that past studies have typically focused on a small number of neurons in isolated regions using a variety of behavioral tasks, making it challenging to compare neuronal activity across different frontal regions and projections. As such, it remains unclear how representations of economic decision variables are structured within the frontal cortex.</p><p id="P4">To address this question, we developed a visually-guided economic decision-making task for head-fixed mice, akin to past studies in non-human primates. In this task, we manipulated two main variables in behavioral economics: the expected value (mathematical expectation of reward) and risk (reward variance) associated with abstract reward-predicting stimuli. We recorded the activity of large numbers of neurons across different regions and projection pathways of the frontal cortex during this task. We found that the frontal cortex showed orthogonal spatial gradients for the representation of expected value and risk. Moreover, we found that representations of these variables are further shaped by downstream connectivity to the striatum and claustrum, two major frontal projection pathways. Together, our results demonstrate that the structure of frontal cortical activity underlying economic valuation spans multiple scales of representation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mice learn the economic value of abstract visual stimuli</title><p id="P5">To study visually-guided economic valuation in head-fixed mice, we utilized a standardized visual psychophysics setup<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and developed a behavioral task akin to those previously used for studying economic decision-making in non-human primates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Mice were head-fixed in front of a computer screen with their forepaws on a rotatable wheel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). On each trial, mice were presented with a visual stimulus on the left or the right side of the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mice were required to move the stimulus to the center of the screen by rotating the wheel, prompting the delivery of a water reward. An incorrect choice, triggered by rotating the wheel in the opposite direction, resulted in no reward. Three visual stimuli were randomly interleaved throughout the task, corresponding to different magnitudes and probabilities of reward for a correct choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). One stimulus predicted a large reward (3 μL) delivered with a probability of 100%. Another predicted a small reward (1.5 μL) delivered with a probability of 100%. Finally, a third stimulus predicted a risky 50-50 gamble between a large reward (3 μL) and no reward. These stimuli will be referred to as ‘Large’, ‘Small’, and ‘Gamble’ henceforth. We chose the combination of reward magnitudes and risk (derived from reward probabilities) such that the Small and Gamble stimuli signaled the same expected value (EV; 1.5 μL), but different levels of risk (0 v.s. 50%). Conversely, the Large and Small stimuli signaled different EVs (3 v.s. 1.5 μL), with the same level of risk (0%). This combination enabled us to compare the neural encoding of either economic variable - risk or EV - while holding the other variable constant.</p><p id="P6">Mice learned to perform the task successfully, exhibiting high levels of choice accuracy across all three stimulus conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>; 0.92 ± 0.01, 0.88 ± 0.01 and 0.87 ± 0.01, mean ± s.e.m. for Large, Gamble and Small, respectively). Crucially however, animals’ performance scaled with the expected value of stimuli: mice displayed higher accuracy on Large compared to Small and Gamble trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, accuracy difference: ΔLarge - Small: t(34) = 5.50, p &lt; 0.0001; ΔLarge - Gamble: t(34) = 5.14, p &lt; 0.0001). By contrast, mice exhibited similar accuracy for Small and Gamble stimuli, corresponding to the same EV (ΔSmall - Gamble: t(34) = 1.67, p = 0.11). Importantly, the mapping between visual stimuli and their associated rewards was counterbalanced across mice, allowing us to confirm that choice accuracy was not influenced by the identity of the visual stimulus per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Finally, response times were fastest for Large trials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>), and mice showed increased lick rates for Large compared to Small rewards upon reward delivery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). These results demonstrate that mice learned and discriminated the value of visual stimuli.</p><p id="P7">To further probe whether animals learned the value of the stimuli, we trained a subset of mice (n = 13) in another version of the task including a choice between two stimuli. In each trial, mice were simultaneously presented with two different visual stimuli on opposite sides of the screen, and had to make a choice between them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>). In these trials, mice consistently selected the higher EV stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>; P(‘Choose higher EV’); Large v.s. Small: 0.72 ± 0.03, mean ± SEM, t(12) = 7.71, p &lt; 0.0001; Large v.s. Gamble: 0.659 ± 0.035, t(12) = 4.47, p &lt; 0.001), and satisfied choice transitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Moreover, in a control experiment in which mice (n = 5) were trained to make choices among two Large and one Small stimulus, mice preferred both Large stimuli over the Small stimulus, providing further evidence that animals successfully learned the value of stimuli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). Finally, to evaluate mice’s risk attitude, we focused on mice that could choose the Large over the Small stimulus on more than 65% of trials (n = 11), and inspected their choice preferences between two stimuli with the same EV but different risk (Small v.s. Gamble trials). We found that, at a group level, mice did not display a significant preference for either stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>; P(‘choose Gamble’) = 0.55 ± 0.02, t(10) = 0.93, p = 0.37). However, examining the preference of individual mice revealed a gradient of risk sensitivities from substantial risk-seeking to risk-aversive behavior. Across all recording sessions, 6/11 mice were consistently risk-seeking (p &lt; 0.05, one-sample t-test of session-wise risk preference), whereas 3/11 mice were consistently risk-averse (p &lt; 0.05). Two mice were risk-neutral with no consistent risk preference. Together, these results further demonstrate that mice learned the economic value of visual stimuli, and suggest that mice express diverse attitudes towards economic risk.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Frontal neuronal responses reflect the economic value of stimuli</title><p id="P8">To examine neuronal representations of economic value during our task, we recorded the activity of thousands of neurons (n = 8611 neurons, 134 sessions, 27 mice, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref> for details of neuronal pre-processing) across the frontal cortex using Neuropixels probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). A large fraction (6982/8611) of neurons across different frontal regions responded during the task, displaying a significant modulation of their activity between stimulus onset and trial outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Frontal neuronal responses distinguished stimuli from each other. To examine whether neurons showed different responses to different stimuli, we first inspected the activity of individual neurons. Single neurons exhibited stimulus-driven responses that appeared modulated by trial conditions, for instance responding more strongly to the high-compared to low-EV stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, left), or more strongly for risk-free stimuli compared to the risky Gamble stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>, right). Overall, 28.5% of task responsive neurons showed differential responses to distinct stimuli. As animals displayed subtle differences in response times across stimulus conditions, for further analyses we preemptively regressed out general stimulus- and action-related neural responses, independent of economic value condition, using reduced rank regression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A-E</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). However, we note that while this regression mitigated a small confounding effect by action-related signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4C</xref>), the decoding of stimulus conditions from response times was already generally poor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A-B</xref>). We then employed a linear population decoding technique (Support Vector Machine, SVM) on the residuals of this regression, and tested how well stimulus conditions could be decoded from the neuronal signals (three-class decoding of correct trials, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). We found that stimulus conditions could be decoded significantly above chance shortly after stimulus onset (cluster-based permutation test, p &lt; 0.001), but were most robustly and stably decodable in a time window from 150 to 350 ms after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Thus, frontal population responses differentiated between visual stimuli.</p><p id="P10">We next asked whether the stimulus-aligned population activity reflected the economic value. To address this, we trained binary classifiers on neuronal signals to distinguish pairs of stimuli with the same or different EV. Decoding accuracy was indeed higher when classifying pairs of stimuli with different EVs rather than stimuli with the same EV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting that neural activity carried information about the economic value rather than the identity of the visual stimulus per se. Moreover,the accuracy of the classifier for stimuli with the same EV depended on animals’ risk attitude: Decoding accuracy exceeded chance level in risk-sensitive mice (i.e. both risk-seeking and risk-averse; permutation test, p &lt; 0.001), but not in risk-neutral mice (p = 0.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that population activity across the frontal cortex encoded economic value, reflecting animals’ preference among stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Neuronal representations exhibit distinct spatial gradients for expected value and risk</title><p id="P11">Having established that population activity of frontal neurons encoded the economic value of stimuli, we next asked how these representations are structured across the frontal cortex. To do so, we repeated our two-class SVM analysis for neuronal subpopulations recorded from different frontal regions. We observed that stimuli with different EV but the same risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>; Large v.s. Small) and stimuli with the same EV but different risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>; Small v.s. Gamble) were significantly decodable across all regions. However, the distribution of region-specific decoding accuracy differed between EV and risk classifiers. While secondary motor cortex (MOs) showed second best decoding for EV, it exhibited worst decoding for risk. Conversely, infralimbic cortex (ILA) provided the markedly worst decoding for EV, but showed relatively better decoding for risk. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). Anterior cingulate area (ACA) exhibited consistently high accuracy for both EV and risk decoding. Importantly, these relative differences in decoding accuracy were largely maintained in recording sessions in which pairs of regions were recorded simultaneously, precluding individual variability as a main driver of these regional differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3F-G</xref>). These results thus show that neural representations of different economic variables, EV and risk, are differentially distributed across regions of the frontal cortex.</p><p id="P12">The representation of EV and risk exhibited distinct spatial gradients across the frontal cortex. Having observed differential representation of EV and risk in different frontal regions, we next sought to better understand the spatial structure of these representations. To do so, we abandoned region labels and investigated neuronal activation patterns for EV and risk in cartesian spatial maps of the frontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Specifically, we contrasted the spatial activation patterns for stimuli with different EVs or different risk, to probe where differences in these economic variables were most strongly encoded. Strikingly, EV coding was most robust in dorsal, but not ventral areas of the frontal cortex, therefore exhibiting a dorsal-to-ventral gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, risk coding was more pronounced in medial, but not lateral frontal areas, thus exhibiting a medial-to-lateral gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Quantitative analyses confirmed that EV coding significantly decreased in the dorsal-to-ventral direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>; permutation test of linear slope against zero, p &lt; 0.001), while risk coding did not (permutation test of linear slope against zero, p = 0.086; EV v.s. risk slope, p &lt; 0.001). Conversely, EV coding was stable across the ML axis (permutation test of linear slope against zero, p = 0.69), whereas risk coding significantly decreased from medial to lateral areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>; permutation test of linear slope against zero, p = 0.012; EV v.s. risk slope, p = 0.016). Differential spatial gradients for EV and risk emerged over time after the stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>). Moreover, these spatial gradients held across the posterior-to-anterior axes of the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-D</xref>), and were largely driven by neuronal responses to contralateral stimuli (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B-G</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that the frontal cortex exhibits orthogonal spatial gradients for the representation of EV and risk.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Distinct representations of economic variables in frontal projections to claustrum and dorsomedial striatum</title><p id="P13">The results thus far have shown a medial-to-lateral gradient for representation of risk and a dorsal-to-ventral gradient for representation of EV, hence demonstrating the strongest representation of these variables in the neuronal activity of dorsomedial frontal cortex (dmFC). We next asked whether these representations depend on the projection target of dmFC neurons. To investigate this, we recorded dmFC neuronal signals projecting to specific downstream targets: the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and the claustrum (CLA) - two areas which receive substantial axonal projections from the dmFC and are implicated in valuation, decision making and higher cognitive functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). We first confirmed the presence of axonal projections from frontal cortical regions to the DMS and CLA histologically, showing that frontal neurons have substantial projections to the DMS or the CLA, with a subset of neurons projecting to both regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). We then combined our large-scale electrophysiological recordings during the decision-making task with an <italic>in vivo</italic> optotagging protocol (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref>). This protocol involved delivering a series of laser pulses to antidromically stimulate the axons of opsin-expressing frontal cortical neurons projecting to CLA or DMS. This was achieved by unilaterally injecting a channelrhodopsin-expressing AAV adjoined with a GFP fluorescence tag (AAV1-Syn-Chronos-GFP) in the dmFC, and implanting optic fibers above DMS and CLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Delivering a series of brief laser pulses via the implanted optic fibers revealed a subset of frontal neurons that displayed robust responses to laser onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). We applied strict criteria to reliably identify these laser-responsive projection-defined neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A-B</xref>). Critically, these neurons had to display a short latency and high-reliability response to laser onset that was significantly different from their baseline activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7C-D</xref>). This method allowed us to identify and monitor the activity of a sub-population of dmFC neurons projecting to the CLA and DMS during our task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Relative to all recorded neurons, dmFC neurons projecting to CLA or DMS better encoded stimulus EV and risk, respectively. The majority of optotagged cells were responsive during our task (78.3%), and the responses of individual neurons were differentially modulated by different trial conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). For instance, the DMS-projecting example neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref> (left) showed higher spiking activity for Large and Small compared to the risky Gamble stimulus, and thus differentiated risk. Conversely, the CLA-projecting example neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>, right), showed the highest firing rate for Large stimuli, intermediate firing rate for Small stimuli and lowest firing rate for Gamble stimuli, and thus differentiated both EV and risk variables. This distinction between DMS and CLA projections held true at the population level. Relative to all recorded neurons in the same mice, the population of CLA-projecting neurons more strongly encoded both EV and risk, while DMS-projecting neurons only encoded risk. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>, z-test relative to all neurons, CLA-projecting EV coding, p = 0.002; CLA-projecting risk coding, p = 0.034; DMS-projecting risk coding, p = 0.033; DMS-projecting EV coding, p = 0.258). Taken together, these results show that the representation of economic variables in frontal neuronal activity depend on the projection target.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P15">Extensive research has indicated that the frontal cortex plays a crucial role in the neural computations underlying economic decision-making<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. However, past studies typically focused on a small number of neurons in select regions of the frontal cortex across different behavioral tasks. As such, it is unclear how the neural correlates of economic decision-making are structured in frontal cortical circuits. To address this, we investigated the encoding of economic variables across regions and projections of the frontal cortex during decision-making behavior in mice. We demonstrated that mice are able to accurately assess the value of visual stimuli, varying in reward expected value (EV) and economic risk, and make decisions accordingly. The neuronal representations of EV and risk formed orthogonal gradients across the frontal cortex, with neurons in the dorsomedial frontal cortex (dmFC) showing strongest encoding of both variables. Furthermore, we showed that neurons projecting from dmFC to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and claustrum (CLA) exhibit distinct representations of EV and risk.</p><p id="P16">We established a novel visually-guided economic decision-making task to study decision-making behavior in head-fixed mice. In this task, mice were required to make choices in response to visual stimuli predictive of different outcomes, with reward magnitude and probability systematically manipulated between trials. Mice showed signatures of economic valuation in their choice accuracy and response times. Moreover, when choosing between two simultaneous stimuli, mice consistently selected the stimulus with higher EV. Our results showing diverse risk attitudes across animals mirror past studies in rats showing similar individual diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. While several value-based decision-making paradigms have been reported in previous rodent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, our task required mice to make choices in response to abstract visual stimuli whose sensory features do not directly correlate with the rewards they represent. This simplifies the interpretation of the resulting neural activity, as the neural encoding of differences in the economic features of the presented options will be less confounded by commensurate variations in the sensory features. However, our task has also limitations; it only includes a small number of abstract stimuli, not allowing for graded variation of EV and risk, and thus not readily suitable for comprehensive investigation of variables such as chosen value.</p><p id="P17">Large-scale electrophysiological recordings revealed signatures of EV and risk coding across multiple regions of the frontal cortex. Despite this, we observed substantial quantitative differences in the extent to which different frontal regions encoded these variables. This resembles the findings of other studies comparing the coding of economic variables in different regions of the frontal cortex, which have observed widespread coding of multiple decision variables, but with significant differences in the nature of this coding between regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Notably, our results did not highlight the same dominance of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in encoding of economic variables reported in several previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Rather, our results identified dorsomedial regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACA) as displaying particularly strong coding of EV and risk, consistent with past results that recorded OFC and ACC signals simultanously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. While various factors such as the use of over-trained mice, as opposed to animals that were still learning, may offer an alternative explanation for weaker engagement of OFC compared to dmFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, these results nonetheless suggest that other structures in the frontal cortex may play an important role in the encoding of reward EV and risk.</p><p id="P18">Examining the spatial structure of EV and risk coding across the frontal cortex further revealed distinct spatial gradients underlying the representation of these variables, with EV coding displaying a dorsal-to-ventral gradient and risk coding a medial-to-lateral gradient. These results echo a recent study demonstrating comparable coding gradients across the dorso-ventral axis in macaques’ medial frontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. The medial-to-lateral gradient in risk coding is also congruent with findings from meta-analysis of human studies demonstrating stronger coding of subjective value in medial, rather than lateral, regions of the frontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>.

Neurons projecting to the DMS primarily encoded risk, while those projecting to the CLA encoded both EV and risk. Importantly, differential coding of EV and risk across projections cannot be explained by differences in the spatial location of neurons, as recordings took place in the same area of dmFC where EV- and risk-coding were highest. While neuronal signals in the DMS, and OFC neurons projecting to DMS, have been implicated in risky decision-making<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, our results suggest that projections from dmFC to DMS could also be critical in shaping risky decisions. While the CLA has been linked to cognitive and attentional control via modulation of frontal circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, its involvement in encoding economic decision variables has not been previously explored. Our findings that frontal neurons convey information about both EV and risk to CLA provides a basis for future studies investigating the role of this circuit in economic decision-making.

These connectivity-defined neuronal signals, alongside the spatial gradients of frontal neuronal signals, indicate that variables integral to shaping economic decisions are represented across multiple scales in the frontal cortex. Future work could expand on these by systematically investigating other frontal cortical projections, and exploring how other factors such as diversity in frontal cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> may further contribute to shaping frontal neuronal representations. Ultimately, it will be important to understand how representations at different scales are interlinked and jointly enable economic decision-making.</p><p id="P20">Taken together, our results show that encoding of economic variables in the frontal cortex is both spatially organized and dependent on projections to downstream brain regions, revealing the multi-scale neuronal structure underlying economic decision-making.

On each trial, an abstract visual stimulus was presented on the right or left-hand side of the screen (±35° azimuth, 0° altitude). The visual stimulus remained in a fixed position for a brief period (0.2 - 0.3s). Mice were then able to turn the wheel left or right to ‘select’ the stimulus by moving it to the center of the screen. A correct selection prompted the delivery of the corresponding water reward. Moving the stimulus to the far side of the screen was considered an incorrect selection and resulted in no reward. There were three possible visual stimuli, each corresponding to a specific value and probability of reward: a large, guaranteed reward condition (3 μL, 100% of correct trials rewarded), a small, guaranteed reward condition (1.5 μL, 100% of correct trials rewarded) and a gamble condition (3 μL, 50% of correct trials rewarded). These stimuli will be referred to as ‘Large’, ‘Small’, and ‘Gamble’. The correspondence between abstract visual stimuli and trial conditions was randomized across mice. All stimuli were presented in a pseudo-randomized order throughout the session. The inter-trial interval varied from 1 – 3 s. Before the start of each trial, there was a variable time window (0.2 - 0.5 s) in which no movement of the wheel was permitted. The task was stopped when the mouse lost motivation, indicated by a slowing of response time, or had completed sufficient trials to meet its daily water requirement (0.6 – 1.5 ml, adjusted for current body weight).</p><p id="P29">To learn the task, mice were trained for approximately half an hour each day for 4-8 weeks.

In the second control task (n = 5), a new ‘Large’ condition - predicting the same reward as the original ‘Large’ condition but associated with a different visual stimulus - was introduced in a subset of trials.

The protective material covering the craniotomy was removed and the head cone was filled with saline. An Ag/AgCl grounding wire was connected to the recording probe and placed in the saline bath near the craniotomy. To verify the location of the probe tract during post-hoc histology, probes were coated in a lipophilic red-fluorescent dye before recording (Invitrogen, Vybrant Dil Cell-Labeling Solution, V22885). The probe was then inserted at a low speed through the dura and into the brain using a manipulator (Sensapex Micromanipulator).

The CLA and DMS stimulation blocks occurred in series. On each trial within a stimulation block, a laser pulse (wavelength = 470 nm, duration = 1 ms, laser power = ~50 mW) was delivered via the optic fiber. Stimulation blocks consisted of 50, 150, or 500 laser pulse trials, the inter pulse interval varied from 4 - 6s. Five recording sessions were discarded due to technical faults. An additional session was discarded due to the observation that no neurons were found to be task-responsive. Finally, the CLA-stimulation data collected from three mice were discarded due to incorrectly targeted optic fibers or Neuropixels implantation trajectories, as confirmed by histological examination.

The goal of this analysis was to remove this overall activity from trial-by-trial responses, in order to address a potential confound arising from small, but systematic differences in response times between conditions. In particular, removing overall action-related activity mitigated the risk of decoding timed movement-related activity rather than neural representations of economic variables. We modeled stimulus kernels covering a window from -0.1 to 0.4 s relative to stimulus onset, while action kernels covered a window from -0.25 to 0.25 s relative to choice onset. The firing rate of each neuron was calculated by binning their spiking activity into 10ms bins and smoothing with a causal half-Gaussian filter (σ = 0.025 s). To fit each kernel, we constructed a Toeplitz predictor matrix of size T x L, where T is the number of time points in the training set and L the number of lags of each kernel (L = 50 for both stimulus- and action-kernels). Each matrix consisted of diagonal stripes (delta functions with a value of 1), with each stripe initiated by the presentation of a stimulus or initiation of an action, and was zero otherwise. We horizontally concatenated stimulus and action predictor matrices, resulting in a global predictor matrix P of size T x 100. We then estimated the kernel shapes using reduced rank regression, which exploits the large number of neurons in the current dataset (for more details see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>). Briefly, we factorized the kernel matrix K (100 kernel lags x N neurons) into the product of a 100 x r matrix B and a r x N matrix W, minimizing the total error E = ||F - PBW||<sup>2</sup>, where F is a T x N matrix containing the binned spiking activity of all recorded neurons.

Trials in each respective condition were then paired across sessions, to form a large surrogate recording with 30 trials per condition.

Performing this procedure for all combinations of training and testing time points yielded a temporal generalization matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, revealing the time course and dynamics of the neural representations differentiating between trial conditions. To statistically assess decoding performance, a cluster-based permutation test was performed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup> by randomly shuffling trial labels and repeating the above decoding procedure. The size of the largest spatial cluster in the temporal generalization matrix was recorded for each of 1,000 permutation iterations. Spatial clusters were defined as contiguous training-testing bins exceeding 5% decoding accuracy above the nominal chance level of 1/3. The size of a cluster was defined as the summed decoding accuracy across all training-testing bins in the cluster.

To statistically assess differences in decoding accuracy between binary decoders (e.g. Large-Gamble v.s. Small-Gamble) a similar permutation test was used. For example, when testing Large-Gamble versus Small-Gamble classifiers, the trial labels between Large and Small trials were randomly shuffled and the decoding procedure was repeated with these shuffled trial labels.

When comparing average lick rates between different trial types such as rewarded versus unrewarded trials, cluster permutation tests were conducted at the group-level (i.e., at the level of mice). The cluster-forming threshold was set to α = 0.05. Permutations were computed by shuffling trial labels (e.g. rewarded and unrewarded) per mouse, and recording the maximum cluster statistic (summed t-values). This permutation procedure was repeated 1000 times. P-values were calculated as the proportion of permutations in which the maximum cluster statistic exceeded that of the largest empirical cluster. The alpha-level was set to 0.025 (two-sided test). Further analysis focused on the mean lick rate within a time window of -0.1 to 0 seconds relative to outcome, which was taken as the ‘pre-outcome’ time period. Paired t-tests were carried out to determine if there were statistically significant differences in mean lick rate between the three single stimulus conditions during this pre-outcome time period.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS199798-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" id="d53aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was funded by a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship from the Wellcome Trust (213465), and a ERC grant (funded by UKRI, EP/X026655/1) to A.L.

(<bold>C)</bold> Three abstract visual stimuli were used in this task, predicting different magnitudes and probabilities of reward (risk).

(<bold>D)</bold> Choice accuracy for all three conditions (n = 35 mice). Gray dots denote individual mice, black dots denote group averages. Error bars in all panels depict s.e.m.. Mice exhibited high accuracy across all three conditions. This accuracy was independent of the position of the stimulus (left v.s. right) on the screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>). (<bold>E)</bold> Differences in accuracy between stimulus conditions. Mice displayed higher accuracy for the Large stimulus (high EV) compared to the Small or Gamble stimuli (low EV).
