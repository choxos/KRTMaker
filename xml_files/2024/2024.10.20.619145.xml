The presence of interfaces can affect their aggregation mechanism, often speeding up aggregation. α-Synuclein (αSyn) can adsorb to biomolecular condensates, leading to heterogenous nucleation and faster aggregation. Understanding the mechanism underlying localization of amyloidogenic proteins at condensate interfaces is crucial for developing strategies to prevent or reverse their binding. We show that αSyn localization to the surface of peptide-based heterotypic condensates is an adsorption process governed by the protein’s condensate-amphiphilic nature. Adsorption occurs in multiple layers and levels off at micromolar concentrations. Based on these findings, we design three strategies to modulate αSyn accumulation: (i) addition of biomolecules that decrease the condensate ζ-potential, such as NTPs and RNA, (ii) competitive adsorption of proteins targeting the condensate interface, such as G3BP1, DDX4-YFP, EGFP-NPM1, Hsp70, Hsc70, and (iii) preferential adsorption of αSyn to membranes. Removing αSyn from the condensate interface slows aggregation, highlighting potential cellular control over protein adsorption and implications for therapeutic strategies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P2"><fig id="F7" position="anchor"><label>Graphical abstract</label><graphic xlink:href="EMS199625-f007"/></fig>

Interfaces can influence protein aggregation by serving as catalysts for heterogeneous nucleation. The influence and importance of interfaces on aggregation of proteins related to neurodegenerative diseases has been studied in the past<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, using solid surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, lipid membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and water-air interfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. More recently, biomolecular condensate interfaces were found to also accumulate these proteins, and nucleate protein aggregation at their interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Linsenmeier et al. showed that formation of hnRNPA1 fibrils on idemic condensates consisting of hnRNPA1 takes place at the condensate interface, and that this process could be reduced by introducing protein-based surfactants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Shen at al. observed that liquid-to-solid transition of FUS condensates is also initiated at their interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. He et al. showed that FUS aggregates grow on the condensate’s surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism underlying interfacial localization remains poorly understood, and general strategies to prevent or reverse interfacial protein localization are lacking.</p><p id="P4">Biomolecular condensates have a non-zero surface charge, either because they are composed of charged biomolecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, or because of asymmetric binding of ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Many disordered, aggregation-prone proteins have charged patches, such as α-synuclein (αSyn)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, tau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, FUS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, prion protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and TDP-43<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, which could lead to attraction to the charged interface of the condensates. We hypothesize that surface charge of condensates can govern the interfacial localization of (disordered) proteins, and thus holds a key to preventing or reversing localization and heterogeneous nucleation-based aggregation.</p><p id="P5">Here, we study how model condensates with tunable ζ-potential accumulate wild-type αSyn at their interface, and how it can be controlled. We specifically investigate how the condensate ζ-potential is a driver in localization proteins, including αSyn and TDP-43, by measuring the charge of the interface prior to and after addition of the proteins. We show that protein adsorption follows a Freundlich-type adsorption isotherm, suggesting that the condensate interface exhibits heterogeneous binding sites arranged in multiple layers with a finite overall binding capacity. More importantly, it indicates that protein adsorption at condensate interfaces is an equilibrium process that can be reversed. Using these insights, we present three biologically relevant strategies to control αSyn interfacial localization and aggregation: (i) addition of biomolecules that can alter the ζ-potential of condensates, such as NTPs or RNA, (ii) competitive adsorption of proteins targeting the condensate interface, such as G3BP1, DDX4-YFP, EGFP-NPM1, Hsp70, and Hsc70, (iii) preferential adsorption of αSyn to membranes, sequestering them away from the condensate interface. These findings indicate that condensate ζ-potential and electrostatic interactions can govern accumulation of proteins at condensate interfaces and pave the way for strategies to control protein localization to condensate interfaces and prevent protein aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>αSyn localization is governed by ζ-potential and protein amphiphilicity</title><p id="P6">We use model condensates with tunable ζ-potential, consisting of poly-D,L-lysine with 100 residues and poly-D,L-glutamate with 100 residues (further termed pLys/pGlu) to investigate the role of ζ-potential in the localization of amyloidogenic proteins at condensate interfaces. We recently showed that wild-type αSyn can be accumulated at the interface of pLys/pGlu condensates, leading to substantially enhanced rates of αSyn aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. αSyn is a protein consisting of an active aggregation core, flanked by a positively charged disordered N-terminal fragment and a negatively charged disordered C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. To gain more insight in αSyn interfacial localization, we first measured the localization of various αSyn mutants. Removal of the C-terminal domain drastically changes αSyn localization: the wildtype protein (computed pI=4.67; charge at pH 7.4 is -9.7) accumulates at the surface of pLys/pGlu droplets, while a variant without the negatively charged C-terminal domain, αSyn(1-108) (computed pI=9.16; charge at pH 7.4 is +2.29)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, was excluded from both the surface and the droplet interior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. We also studied the partitioning of αSyn(60-140), which lacks the disordered, positively charged N-terminal domain (computed pI=4.05; charge at pH 7.4 is -12.44). αSyn(60-140) partitioned into droplets but did not accumulate at the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). αSyn is thus amphiphilic to condensates, containing charged patches that prefer the interior of the condensate (residues 1-59) and parts that prefer the dilute phase (residues 109-140), causing its interfacial accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">We then assessed how the accumulation of αSyn at the surface of condensates affects their ζ-potential by microelectrophoresis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. pLys/pGlu condensates had a ζ-potential of +8.1 ± 0.9 mV, which decreased to zero upon addition of αSyn in a sigmoidal manner, characteristic of an adsorption isotherm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). To investigate the mode of interfacial adsorption, we measured the partitioning of αSyn at different concentrations, keeping the concentration of Alexa Fluor 647-labeled S9C αSyn (Alexa-647-αSyn) constant when the total concentration was above 3 μM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). From this, a partition coefficient (<italic>K</italic><sub>P</sub>) was calculated, which shows that the relative concentration of αSyn at the interface decreases as the total concentration increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, e</xref>).</p><p id="P8">With increasing total concentration of αSyn, the amount of αSyn at the interface starts to level off, as can be seen upon plotting the interfacial concentration against total concentration of αSyn. We found that the amount of αSyn at the condensate interface is described best with the adapted Freundlich isotherm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Alternative adsorption isotherms, such as Langmuir or BET models performed worse as judged by the Bayesian information criterion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3 &amp; 4</xref>). This suggests that the binding sites at the condensate interface are heterogenous and multilayered. We interpret this as a reflection of the presence of a transition region in between the condensate interior and the surrounding solution. Based on the magnitude of the condensate interfacial tension, the width of the condensate interfacial region of condensates is estimated to be large compared to the size of a single protein.</p><p id="P9">Across this interfacial region, the density and conformation of condensate components changes gradually<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, and proteins such as αSyn can adsorb both close to the surrounding dilute phase where the interaction density is low, and deeper into the interfacial region, closer to the condensate bulk where the interaction density density is higher and the number of unbound sites that are available for binding may be lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Taking the interfacial heterogeneity into account, the condensate interface has a finite overall capacity for adsorption, and the Freundlich isotherm allows us to compare the binding capacity of the condensates (reflected by the parameter <italic>S</italic><sub>sat</sub>), as well as the characteristic interaction strength between the studied systems (reflected by <italic>n</italic>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref>, Explanation of fitting of adapted Freundlich model).</p><p id="P10">Neutralization of the positive ζ-potential by negatively charged αSyn suggests that the adsorption is driven by electrostatic attraction. To test this hypothesis, we altered the condensate ζ-potential by changing the mixing ratio of pLys and pGlu. The ζ-potential of pLys/pGlu condensates at a 1:2 mixing ratio is negative (-1.3 ± 0.3 mV), at a 1.6:1 mixing ratio it is highly positive (+8.1 ± 0.5 mV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Theoretical work by Majee et al. showed that at equal molar ratios, charged condensate interfaces can occur due to unequal gradients of charged molecules at the interface, leading to a net charge, explaining the positive ζ-potential of pLys/pGlu condensates at 1:1 ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. We found that αSyn remained in the dilute phase for ratios lower than 1:1.4 pLys/pGlu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). The relative amount of αSyn at the condensate interface and its interior, reflected by <italic>K</italic><sub>P</sub>, increased with increasing ζ-potential and reached a plateau at the mixing ratio where the ζ-potential also reached a plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Fitting Freundlich isotherms to the data at different pLys/pGlu ratios shows that changing the ratio of condensate components alters the affinity of the surface to αSyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Both the interaction strength and binding capacity increase drastically with increasing pLys (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P11">If αSyn localization is driven by electrostatic interactions, charge screening would weaken the attraction and reduce αSyn accumulation at the interface. Indeed, increasing NaCl only slightly reduced ζ-potential, but it drastically reduced αSyn adsorption at the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e-f</xref>). Above 250 mM NaCl, αSyn did not adsorb at all, while the <italic>K</italic><sub>P</sub> of αSyn inside the condensates decreased to approximately 0.15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g</xref>). Freundlich fits show that increasing NaCl concentration also reduces both the binding capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>, <italic>S</italic><sub>sat</sub> = 333 µM to <italic>S</italic><sub>sat</sub> = 9.69 µM) and interaction strength (<italic>n</italic> = 1.86 to <italic>n</italic> = 1.15, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). We confirmed that this NaCl concentration could effectively screen the electrostatic interactions between αSyn and pLys by measuring the diffusion of fluorescently labelled αSyn bound to pLys with increasing NaCl concentration using Raster Image Correlation Spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. At 200 mM NaCl, αSyn diffusion in the presence of pLys was comparable to its diffusion without pLys, indicating that αSyn is no longer bound to pLys.</p><p id="P12">We hypothesized that similar driving forces can also cause interfacial localization of other condensate-amphiphilic proteins with charged patches. We therefore also examined the partitioning of TDP-43-TEV-mCherry, which is known to exhibit disordered domains with a net negative and positive charge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, in combination with pLys/pGlu condensates. Similar to αSyn, TDP-43-TEV-mCherry preferentially partitioned to the interface of the droplets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>NTPs and oligonucleotides can regulate condensate ζ-potential and remove αSyn</title><p id="P13">Our results indicate that condensate interfaces exhibit heterogeneous, multilayered adsorption sites, and that adsorption to these interfaces is an equilibrium process driven by charge complexation that can be reversed. Therefore, we set out to design strategies to regulate the adsorption and investigate the possibility of selective removal of αSyn from the interface. In a biological context, cells could (i) modulate condensate ζ-potential by regulating the levels of NTPs and metabolites, (ii) express proteins that compete for adsorption to condensate interfaces or form a new condensed phase at interface, or (iii) exploit the sequestration of proteins by other cellular interfaces, such as membranes.</p><p id="P14">We first tested the effect of NTPs, which are present at relatively high concentrations within cells, with ATP being the most abundant at concentrations of ~2mM, surpassing the Michaelis constant of enzymes by two orders of magnitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.We added ATP to pLys/pGlu condensates at physiologically plausible concentrations, and found that above 0.5 mM ATP, αSyn was excluded from the condensate interface, resulting in a three-fold decrease in <italic>K</italic><sub>P</sub> at the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a-b</xref>). Addition of ATP also caused a decrease in αSyn partitioning inside the condensate, with a <italic>K</italic><sub>P</sub> of 0.5 in the absence of ATP and 0.1 at ATP concentrations of 1 mM and higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3b</xref>). The condensate ζ-potential also decreased from +8.1 ± 0.9 mV at 0 mM ATP to -3.0 ± 0.8 mV at 5 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). This lower and negative ζ-potential weakens the electrostatic interactions of αSyn with the condensate surface, causing αSyn to be released into the surrounding dilute phase. Furthermore, αSyn localization is reversible, as most of the αSyn releases from the interface after adding ATP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). We also observed that partitioning of αSyn(60-140) was not substantially affected by the addition of ATP, confirming that ATP mainly affects interfacial accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Addition of ATP increased both the surface tension and viscosity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 7, 11</xref>). Interfacial αSyn with increasing ATP can also be described by the Freundlich isotherm, reaching a <italic>S</italic><sub>sat</sub> value of ~20 μM and <italic>n</italic> of 1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Besides ATP, we added other NTPs to see if they have a similar effect on the ζ-potential of pLys/pGlu condensates. Addition of 5 mM GTP led to droplets with a ζ-potential of -3.5 ± 0.2 mV, similar to ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). The pyrimidines CTP and UTP had a weaker effect than the purines, but still lowered the ζ-potential. All NTPs prevented αSyn interfacial accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). Next, we set out to study the influence of short RNA oligonucleotides on the condensate ζ-potential, as their multivalency could enhance the charge reversal observed with NTPs. We selected A<sub>15</sub>, C<sub>15</sub> and U<sub>15</sub> and added them to pLys/pGlu condensates. As expected, oligonucleotides could also invert the ζ-potential of condensates at a concentration of 0.1 mM, and they were able to displace αSyn from the droplet interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e-f</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We also compared the interfacial accumulation of TDP-43-TEV-mCherry on pLys/pGlu condensates with and without 5 mM ATP. Supporting our previous findings, ATP also decreased the accumulation of TDP-43-TEV-mCherry, although it did not completely remove the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>), possibly because TDP-43 was already partially aggregated.</p><p id="P17">The effect of low concentrations of NTPs and oligonucleotides on protein adsorption to condensates shows the potential to control protein localization based on electrostatic interactions, which could prevent heterogeneous nucleation at the condensate interface. These results suggest that electrostatic interactions may be a common factor in determining protein localization and that cells may use strategies like ATP production to manipulate condensate interface properties and protein localization.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Proteins can displace αSyn by competitive adsorption</title><p id="P18">We then investigated if competitive adsorption at the condensate interface is possible, and if other proteins could displace αSyn from the interface. We investigated the condensate surface targeting potential of a number of commonly studied, partially disordered proteins with negatively charged patches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>), namely GFP-G3BP1, DDX4-YFP, EGFP-NPM1, and TDP-43-TEV-mCherry, and two heat shock proteins, Hsc70 and Hsp70, which are known to interact with αSyn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">Interestingly, most of these proteins were found to localize at the interface of pLys/pGlu condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The degree of displacement of αSyn (as measured by reduction in the <italic>K</italic><sub>P</sub> to the interface) varied between proteins, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>) and many co-localized with αSyn (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13a</xref>), suggesting that their binding strength to the interface was comparable to αSyn. The molecular chaperones, Hsc70 and Hsp70, also co-localize with αSyn at the interface, potentially allowing for enhanced chaperone functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> and reducing the aggregation propensity of αSyn, without necessarily displacing it completely from the condensate interface. We also observe that the chaperones localize to the interface more strongly when αSyn is present, showing potentially targeted accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Surprisingly, addition of DDX4-YFP, GFP-G3BP1, and EGFP-NPM1 led to the formation of multiphase condensates when added to the pLys/pGlu condensates, resulting in αSyn partitioning in the newly formed outer phase with high colocalization. A reason for this additional phase separation is the amphiphilic nature of these proteins, as they contain a phase separating domain and a solubilizing domain in the form of the fluorescent tag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. For EGFP-NPM1, we observe multiphase condensate formation at 12.5 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13a</xref>), and high partitioning of αSyn into the new phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>, <italic>K</italic><sub>P</sub> = 12). The colocalization of NPM1 and αSyn increases with NPM1 concentration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 13b and 15</xref>). The multiphase condensates can potentially function as a compartment capable of sequestering αSyn to remove it from the condensate interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. We found that the ζ-potential decreased with increasing EGFP-NPM1 and became negative around 2.5 μM, even before the separate new phase is visible by microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>). This is remarkable, as αSyn was not able to invert the droplet ζ-potential. We hypothesize that EGFP-NPM1 already forms a new microphase that is spread on the interface of the pLys/pGlu condensates and that sequesters αSyn. This newly formed liquid phase has a negative ζ-potential, providing a separate mechanism of removing αSyn from the pLys/pGlu condensate interface.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Membranes can sequester αSyn away from condensate interfaces</title><p id="P21">Lastly, we investigated αSyn localization in the presence of a second interface to which the protein could adsorb. Preferential adsorption to the second interface could lead to removal of αSyn from the condensate interface. The role of αSyn is thought to involve membrane binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Membrane-bound αSyn displays distinct conformations from monomeric αSyn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, sometimes leading to delayed aggregation and nonparticipation in aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. In vitro, it has been shown that αSyn can also bind cooperatively to unilamellar liposomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. We prepared vesicles with two lipid compositions, DOPG/DOPC 1:1 and DOPG/DOPC/DOPE 1:2:1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 16</xref>) and added them to the condensates with αSyn.</p><p id="P22">Using labeled liposomes, we observed that liposomes of both compositions partition to the interface at low concentrations, and into the condensates at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). We found that the liposomes lowered the ζ-potential of the condensates, but that they remained net positively charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). However, αSyn no longer localized to the condensate interface when the liposomes partition into the condensates. In contrast to other experiments with such positive condensates, αSyn partitions into the condensates and colocalizes with the liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). We hypothesize that αSyn is sequestered by the membrane surface and is pulled into the condensates by the vesicles. It remains to be investigated whether the vesicles remain intact upon partitioning into the condensates. No substantial differences between the two compositions of liposomes was observed in the partitioning, despite a difference in ζ-potential of the droplets. These results show that competition between interfaces can alter protein localization, which could also serve as a regulatory mechanism in cells, as these interactions are likely protein and condensate specific.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Displacement of αSyn from the condensate interface slows down aggregation</title><p id="P23">We have previously reported that condensate interfaces can act as heterogeneous nucleation sites for αSyn aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. It has also been reported that positively charged interfaces accelerate aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. We therefore expected that removal of αSyn from pLys/pGlu interface can affect the aggregation kinetics, and lead to a reduction in aggregation rates. We used Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assays to follow αSyn aggregation with condensates in the different scenarios investigated above to remove αSyn from the condensate interface. Addition of 3 mM ATP substantially slows down αSyn aggregation in the presence of condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). This effect is observed over a range of αSyn concentrations, from 5 to 80 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Increasing the ATP concentration could further slow down αSyn aggregation up to fivefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). While addition of ATP changes the aggregation half-time substantially in the presence of condensates, we find no major influence on the half-time in the absence of condensates, confirming that ATP acts as a modifier of αSyn-condensate interactions, rather than interacting with αSyn directly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 17</xref>). As negative control, we examined aggregation of αSyn(60-140) – which does partition to the interface – and observe that aggregation is not substantially altered due to addition of ATP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 18</xref>). These findings correspond to the observations of ATP concentration-dependent αSyn removal from the condensate interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Since we observed removal of αSyn not only for ATP but also for other NTPs and small RNA oligos, we investigated whether they could also reduce the aggregation rates. As expected, all of the strategies that removed αSyn from the interface also slowed down aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). One of the proteins was also able to slow down aggregation – 20 μM EGFP-NPM1 – by forming multiphase condensates that sequester αSyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). In the case of smaller multiphase compartments, we hypothesize that the physicochemical environment did not induce aggregation-slowing conformational changes in αSyn. We also measured the aggregation kinetics in the presence of liposomes. On average, the addition of liposomes had no substantial effect on the aggregation rate of αSyn. This can be explained by the fact that αSyn aggregation can also be enhanced by binding to membranes, similar to its binding to condensate interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>).</p><p id="P25">We also examined the kinetics of αSyn aggregation with increased NaCl and altered condensate composition. Interestingly, while NaCl accelerates αSyn aggregation in solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, it suppresses aggregation of αSyn in the presence of condensates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 19</xref>), by removing αSyn from the interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Altering the condensate composition also influences αSyn aggregation rates. As expected, neutral or negatively charged condensates slow down aggregation, whereas positively charged condensates accelerate it (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 19</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Finally, we analyzed how nucleation rates and elongation rates change when αSyn no longer accumulated at the interface of the condensates.

This applies to aggregating proteins that undergo LLPS within cells on their own, but also to systems in which the aggregating protein is a guest molecule in host liquid condensates formed by other components of the cell. To assess their relevance in pathology and to design strategies to prevent or reverse protein binding to condensate interfaces, we must first understand how the complex intracellular environment affects the properties of liquid interfaces and modulates interactions with aggregating proteins.</p><p id="P28">In this work we examined the interactions between a tunable model peptide-based condensate system, pLys/pGlu, and the amyloidogenic protein αSyn. αSyn binds strongly to the condensate interface when it carries a net positive charge, as observed with microscopy and ζ-potential measurements. The interface accumulation is an equilibrium adsorption process that follows a Freundlich isotherm, indicating a multilayered interface with heterogeneous binding sites. We confirmed that the interfacial charge of pLys/pGlu condensates and the amphiphilic nature of αSyn govern the adsorption.</p><p id="P29">We then proposed three biochemically relevant strategies to modulate or reverse αSyn adsorption to condensate interfaces and studied their effect on the kinetics of αSyn aggregation. NTPs and short oligonucleotides decreased the interfacial charge even at low concentrations, and could remove αSyn from the condensate interface in a reversible manner. Adding competitively adsorbing proteins, such as EGFP-NPM1, DDX4-YFP and GFP-G3BP1, was found to result in a reduction of αSyn at the interface and the formation of multiphase condensates, providing a more favorable phase for αSyn to partition into. Molecular chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp70 co-localize with αSyn at the interface of pLys/pGlu condensates, without necessarily displacing αSyn completely from the condensate interface. Finally, liposomes provided an alternative surface for αSyn to which it had a higher affinity, resulting in sequestration of αSyn away from the interface inside the condensates.</p><p id="P30">For some of these strategies, we observed substantially reduced αSyn aggregation rates. Adding NTPs and oligos slowed down aggregation up to fivefold, while NTPs did not affect αSyn in solution. In addition, EGFP-NPM1 multiphase condensates also slowed down αSyn aggregation. In contrast, addition of liposomes did not change the rate of αSyn aggregation, possibly because aggregation can also be enhanced by membrane binding. In summary, our study enhances understanding of protein interactions with the surface of condensates, revealing mechanisms cells might use to control aggregation against heterogeneous nucleation, through regulation of metabolite levels, and expression of RNA and proteins.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Condensate formation</title><p id="P31">All experiments with poly-D,L-lysine and poly-D,L-glutamate condensates were performed using a HEPES buffer (final concentration 50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 100 mM NaCl and 100 μM EDTA unless stated otherwise.
