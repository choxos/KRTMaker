They infect and cause disease in humans, animals and plants but also play crucial roles in the ecology of microbial communities. Tolerance to genetic change, high-mutation rates, adaptations to hosts and immune escape has driven high divergence of viral genes, hampering their functional annotation and phylogenetic inference. The protein structure is more conserved than sequence and can be used for searches of distant homologs and evolutionary analysis of divergent proteins. Structures of viral proteins are traditionally underrepresented in public databases, but recent advances in protein structure prediction allows us to address this issue. Combining two state-of-the-art approaches, AlphaFold2-ColabFold and ESMFold, we predicted models for 85,000 proteins from 4,400 human and animal viruses, expanding the structural coverage for viral proteins by 30 times compared to experimental structures. We also performed structural and network analyses of the models to demonstrate their utility for functional annotation and inference of distant phylogenetic relationships. Taking this approach, we examined the deep evolutionary history of viral class-I fusion glycoproteins, gaining insights on the origins of coronavirus spike protein. To enable further discoveries, we have created <italic>Viro3D</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/">https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/</ext-link>), a virus species-centred protein structure database. It allows users to search, browse and download protein models from a virus of interest and explore similar structures present in other virus species. This resource will facilitate fundamental molecular virology, investigation of virus evolution, and may enable structure-informed design of therapies and vaccines.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites whose replication depends on the metabolism and translational machinery of cellular organisms. Viruses have the capacity to evolve rapidly and infect organisms from all domains of life. They play crucial roles in ocean biogeochemical cycles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and control of prokaryotic populations in the human gut microbiome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> but also infect and cause disease in crops, livestock and humans. Virus particles are the most abundant biological entities on our planet <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup> with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic studies only starting to sample the staggering genetic diversity of viral communities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Intracellular parasites, like viruses and mobile genetic elements, seem to be an inherent property of any replicating system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Viruses likely emerged on multiple independent occasions with the origin of the most ancient lineages probably coinciding with the origin of life and preceding the appearance of the last common ancestor of cellular organisms (LUCA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The genome of LUCA likely already carried an early antiviral defence system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> implying that cellular organisms are inseparable from viruses and have been locked in a continuous arms race for the last 4 billion years. Independent evolutionary origins of viruses are reflected in the modern virus taxonomy by a specific taxonomic rank, realms, which brings together viruses that share a set of conserved genes usually involved in genome replication or virion formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">The diversity of virus genome architectures with their frequent modular organisation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, high mutation rates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, positive selection, and dependency on host-cells drive viruses to evolve faster than cellular organisms. Viruses exchange genetic material with their hosts and other viruses, turning their genomes into a mosaic form where each section has a different evolutionary history <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Countless examples of gene exchange between cellular organisms and viruses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and co-opting of proteins that evolve to fulfil a new function (called exaptations) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> highlight the evolutionary importance of genetic exchange between viruses and their hosts.</p><p id="P5">However, frequent genome reorganisations and high levels of divergence make the identification of gene function, investigation of deep phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic assignments at higher ranks particularly challenging. In cases like these, comparison of protein structures for inference of evolutionary relatedness tends to be more reliable <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Protein function is defined by tertiary structure which is, as a result, more conserved than nucleotide or amino acid sequence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Despite the striking diversity of viral sequences, viral protein structures are underrepresented in public databases. Experimental protein structures from a viral source constitute less than 10% of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Recent advances in machine learning have made it possible to predict protein structures from sequence alone, achieving accuracy similar to that of experimental structure determination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. These state-of-the-art approaches have been applied at scale to produce comprehensive databases of predicted protein structures. The AlphaFold Structural Database (AFDB) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> contains more than 214 million models for proteins from UniProtKB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> predicted using AlphaFold2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. However, viral proteins were excluded from the prediction efforts. Evolutionary Scale Modelling (ESM) Metagenomic Atlas became the largest structural database with more than 600 million models for proteins from metagenomic samples (MGnify database <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>) predicted using ESMFold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Although this database contains some viral structures, they come predominantly from viruses of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes. The database also does not provide an intuitive way of searching for structures from a specific taxonomic group.</p><p id="P7">Systematic exclusion of viral proteins from structure prediction efforts and their underrepresentation in public databases created a gap that is currently being addressed by the scientific community <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. In our study, we have generated 170,000 viral protein structure predictions from 4,400 animal viruses using ColabFold and ESMFold. We assessed the model quality produced by both methods and performed structural analysis of the proteins to expand their functional annotation. We also demonstrate that protein structure can guide the inference of deep phylogenetic relationships between viruses, using class-I membrane fusion glycoproteins as an example. To meet the requirements of the virology community we created Viro3D, a fully-searchable and browsable database, allowing users to visualise and download models for all proteins from a virus of interest and explore similar structures present in other virus species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/">https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/</ext-link>). We expect that this resource will find broad utility, accelerating fundamental molecular virology, enabling studies of virus evolution, and facilitating structure-informed development of therapies and vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Systematic viral protein structure prediction with ColabFold and ESMFold</title><p id="P8">Our initial focus has been on predicting protein structures for human and animal viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). We relied on data from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) Virus Metadata Resource (VMR), which provides a comprehensive list of virus species and representative isolates, along with their GenBank accession numbers and host associations. At the time of our analysis, the latest version of the ICTV VMR included 3,173 virus species infecting vertebrate and/or invertebrate hosts, represented by 4,407 virus isolates/genotypes. These viruses encoded a total of 71,274 proteins, spanning over 29.2 million amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). To simplify the analysis and protein structure prediction procedure, we excluded polyproteins from the dataset replacing them with annotated mature peptides and protein regions that increased the total number of analysed protein records to 85,162.</p><p id="P9">For protein structure prediction, we applied two state-of-the-art approaches: ColabFold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, a method based on AlphaFold2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> and dependent on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), and ESMFold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, a method that uses ESM-2, a transformer protein language model, and infers structure from input protein sequence alone. With ColabFold we successfully predicted structures for all 85,162 records (27.2 million residues, covering 93.1% of total amino acid residues). Due to compute limitations in predicting longer proteins, ESMFold yielded slightly fewer successful predictions – 84,964 protein records (27.0 million residues, covering 92.3% of amino acid residues). Structural coverage varied across viral realms, with most of them achieving coverage between 95% and 100% by both methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1a</xref>). However, because of the lack of mature peptide and region annotation for large sections of <italic>Riboviria</italic> polyproteins, the coverage of this realm did not exceed 79.5% of total amino acid residues when we used ColabFold and 78.7% when we applied ESMFold. Nonetheless, since experimental structures in the PDB cover less than 3.3% of amino acid residues present in proteins of human and animal viruses (approximately 890,000 amino acids), we managed to expand the structural coverage for viral proteins by more than 30 times.</p><p id="P10">Overall, ColabFold models showed higher accuracy than those produced by ESMFold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1b</xref>). A total of 17.2 million residues predicted with ColabFold (63.3% of the modelled residues) were assigned high or very high quality, based on predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) score. This number increased to 87.4% (5.7 million residues) when evaluating models where a sequence homologue was available in the PDB at the time of AlphaFold2 training, dropping to 55.7% (11.5 million residues) for regions without homologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). In contrast, only 31.6% of residues predicted by ESMFold (8.5 million residues) achieved high or very high quality. Nonetheless, ESMFold models followed the same trend: with higher quality predictions for structures where a PDB sequence homologue was available at the time of training (47.6%, or 3.5 million residues) and lower quality for those without a homologue (25.5%, or 5 million residues). This suggests that training data may account for some higher accuracy models but, nonetheless, high confidence predictions can still be achieved for sequences that were not well represented on the PDB (this may be particularly important for viral proteins, which are under-represented in experimental structural data).</p><p id="P11">For 9.1% of the records (7,769 proteins), the ESMFold models demonstrated higher accuracy than the ColabFold models. Although these improvements were typically minor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>), for 2.0% of the records (1,753 proteins), the difference in pLDDT scores exceeded 10 points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). One contributing factor to lower performance of ColabFold was low MSA depth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1c</xref>), confirming the importance of having sufficient similar sequences available in public databases. The protein records where ESMFold outperformed ColabFold also tended to have longer sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1d</xref>).</p><p id="P12">We sought to test the accuracy of predicted models through comparison to experimental structures solved after the AlphaFold2 and ESMFold training dates, and for which there were no sequence homologues available on the PDB at the time of training. Very few targets met these criteria; nonetheless, we found excellent agreement between predicted and experimental structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>), with the only major source of divergence being the positioning of, otherwise, well-folded domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1e</xref>).</p><p id="P13">For all subsequent analysis, we created a non-redundant set of 85,162 models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>) representing each protein record with either ColabFold or ESMFold model depending on which one has the highest confidence (average pLDDT score).</p><p id="P14">In parallel with our work, two other efforts have recently performed systematic structure prediction for viral proteins. Nomburg et al. predicted structures for 67.7K proteins from 4.4K eukaryotic viruses derived from RefSeq entries in the NCBI Viruses portal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The Big Fantastic Virus Database (BFVD) did not consider viral taxonomy but used viral sequences from UniRef30 clusters to generate 351.2K protein structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. We compared our Viro3D dataset to these using Foldseek (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2a</xref>). There was moderate overlap with Nomburg et al.’s dataset with 47.3K structures being unique to Viro3D; whilst only 12.9K BFVD structures were shared with Viro3D (72.3K being unique to Viro3D). To understand this low overlap better, we performed proteome level comparisons for example human pathogens. Here, the majority of entries had a match in the Nomburg et al. dataset, but almost no proteins had a complete counterpart in BFVD, with many appearing only as truncated protein fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2b</xref>). Indeed, comparison of protein lengths for all entries in BFVD and Viro3D, demonstrated that short sequences predominate in BFVD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2c</xref>). This likely reflects the sequence selection and structure prediction strategy underlying BFVD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. The high frequency of matches between Viro3D and the Nomburg et al. dataset permitted side-by-side comparison of model quality, assessed by pLDDT prediction confidence. Here, Viro3D models outperformed their counterparts in Nomburg et al. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2d &amp; e</xref>). This is explained by the MSA generation method (drawing only on RefSeq virus sequences) and structure prediction workflow of Nomburg et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. The benefits of Viro3D are well illustrated by comparisons of proteome structures from influenza A virus, where Viro3D provides complete high-confidence models for all proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2f</xref>). These results demonstrate that Viro3D is the most comprehensive database of high-quality protein structure predictions for human and animal viruses.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Exploration of the viral protein structure space by clustering and network analysis</title><p id="P15">We started with clustering the non-redundant set based on 90% bi-directional sequence overlap and 50% sequence identity that resulted in 33,151 sequence clusters. Then we selected a representative for each cluster, taking the highest confidence model (by average pLDDT score), and clustered this set of structural representatives based on 90% bi-directional structure overlap and 1e<sup>-5</sup> E-value of the structural alignment. This produced 19,067 structural clusters, 64.35% of which contained only one member (singleton clusters). Finally, we performed a Foldseek search among the representatives of these clusters to generate a structure similarity network of the viral proteins.</p><p id="P16">By applying restrictive clustering parameters, we ensured high structural homogeneity and consistency of functional annotation within each cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>) but allowed homologous viral proteins to form multiple structural clusters. For instance, one of the most abundant proteins in our dataset, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), formed at least 110 structural clusters. The structure similarity network allowed us to address this issue by capturing communities of clusters that possess the same general protein fold or share a protein domain.</p><p id="P17">To demonstrate the power of structural network analysis, we examined the distribution of various common and hallmark viral proteins. This includes proteins involved in genome replication: RdRp, Reverse Transcriptase (RT), and Family B DNA polymerase (PolB); virion morphogenesis: Single Jelly Roll (SJR), Double Jelly Roll (DJR), and HK97 major capsid proteins (MCP); and membrane fusion: class I, class II, and class III fusion glycoproteins (FG). Querying against individual experimental structures, representing each of these hallmark proteins, we performed Foldseek analyses across our structural network. This identified communities that match each of our hallmark protein groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Protein communities located in the centre of the network (e.g. RdRp, RT and SJR MCP) tend to be strongly interconnected, likely because of the clusters of polyproteins that possess multiple functional regions and therefore bring different communities together. This network-focussed structural search allowed us to find many more proteins than a similar search against the simple non-redundant set of 85,162 structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), for example we achieved a 90% increase in the number of identified RdRp structures. Therefore, by leveraging the fundamentally conserved nature of structure over sequence, combined with clustering and network analysis, we can achieve extremely sensitive detection of deep evolutionary relatedness. This permits rapid and efficient navigation of viral protein structure space and allows mapping of protein form and function across diverse species.</p><p id="P18">We plotted the distribution of hallmark proteins across viral families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>) and realms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>) successfully identifying RdRp or RT in 91% of <italic>Riboviria</italic> species. We also showed that five members of the <italic>Varidnaviria</italic> realm (<italic>Poxviridae</italic> and <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> families) possess an RT in addition to PolB. Four of these RTs are in a community of RdRp clusters (reflecting their shared ancestry) and therefore can be found using an RdRp probe, while one is clustered with other RTs. PolB is abundant in the realms <italic>Varidnaviria</italic>, <italic>Duplodnaviria</italic> and several viral families that currently do not belong to any realm (e.g. <italic>Baculoviridae</italic>). We also found a PolB in the <italic>Bindnaviridae</italic> family which belongs to the <italic>Monodnaviria</italic> realm. As for major capsid proteins, Double Jelly Roll MCP dominates in <italic>Varidnaviria</italic>, HK97 MCP in <italic>Duplodnaviria</italic>, while Single Jelly Roll MCP is prevalent in realms <italic>Riboviria</italic>, <italic>Monodnaviria</italic> and family <italic>Baculoviridae</italic>. All three classes of fusion glycoprotein are abundant in <italic>Riboviria</italic>, while class III is the dominant glycoprotein in <italic>Duplodnaviria</italic>. Class I and III FGs are also common among members of the <italic>Baculoviridae</italic> family.</p><p id="P19">We also used this approach to expand functional annotation, propagating sequencebased annotation using structural clusters and structural network. Out of 85,162 protein records, 65.6% have at least partial Pfam annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). By propagating Pfam annotations to unannotated cluster members, we expanded the functional coverage by 3.99% (3,395 records). The propagation of Pfam annotation to clusters that do not have any annotated members using the structural network expanded the functional coverage by an additional 3.37% (2,870 records, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>). The consistency of propagated annotation is 100% for the majority (70.3%) of protein records (4,403 out of 6,265 records, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). We also expanded Gene3D and Superfamily annotation which gave an increase of 11.1% and 10.7% respectively. Expansion of gene ontology (GO) annotation for molecular function, biological process and cellular component increased the number of annotated records by 10.9%, 9.2% and 4.4% respectively. Therefore, clustering of structures and network analysis permits the identification and/or functional annotation of as-yet unclassified viral proteins. Nonetheless, it is important to note that despite propagation, there is still a high proportion of proteins with no known function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To estimate the number of protein structures shared between viruses and cellular organisms, we performed a structure similarity search between cluster representatives and the AlphaFold Structural Database (AFDB, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2e</xref>). Consistent with the notion that viruses are a source of novel protein folds <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, the majority of viral proteins do not share detectable homology with cellular life, with only 17.8% of clusters (3,393 out of 19,067) having significant structural similarity to proteins in the AFDB. Of these homologues, 71.5% are coming from Eukaryota, 15.9% from Bacteria, 1.7% from Archaea and 10.9% from metagenomic and environmental samples. However, this number is likely to be an overestimation because in many instances hits are coming from endogenous or symbiotic viruses. For instance, many <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> hits with high sequence identity are proteins from the integrated <italic>Human betaherpesvirus 6A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref>), while hits from <italic>Cotesia congregata</italic> and <italic>Fopius artisans</italic>, two species of parasitoid/parasitic wasps, are proteins from symbiotic viruses of genera <italic>Bracoviriform</italic> and <italic>Alphanudivirus</italic>, respectively.</p><p id="P21">14.4% of the protein records form singleton clusters and potentially represent structural novelty. Our species-focussed approach captured the genomic context of all predicted structures and, therefore, allowed us to investigate the genome positions of singleton and non-singleton clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2g</xref>). Interestingly, unique protein structures are more frequently found at the start or end of viral genomes, while common protein structures (which are likely to be associated with critical functions) tend to have a more uniform distribution across the genome length. The picture is different for some viral realms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>), nonetheless, this suggests that genomic termini are hotspots for evolutionary innovation, which may drive the emergence of novel protein functions and adaptations to hosts.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The deep evolutionary history of class-I fusion glycoproteins</title><p id="P22">Class-I fusion glycoproteins can be found in a wide range of important human pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, HIV, Influenza and Ebola, and have been exapted by mammals to mediate placental morphogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Mechanistic knowledge of these proteins informs rational vaccine design <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. It is thought that class-I fusion glycoproteins share a common origin, however, extensive sequence divergence has all but erased this deep ancestry at the amino acid level. Therefore, classification of fusion glycoproteins is typically achieved through structural and functional characterisation. Indeed, recent experimental structures of retroviral Env class-I glycoproteins suggest shared ancestry with fusion glycoproteins of negative-sense RNA viruses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>; this evolutionary relationship is also supported by analysis of the viral ‘fossil-record’ provided by endogenous viral elements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, traditional structural biology and/or sequence analyses provides only a fragmentary picture of glycoprotein ancestry. We reasoned that ultra-sensitive homology detection, achieved through structural similarity and network analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a &amp; c</xref>), will permit a virosphere-wide survey of class-I fusion glycoproteins and provide a clear view of their deep-evolutionary history.</p><p id="P23">First, to gain a species-level perspective, we generated a structure-informed map of the human and animal virosphere. This allows simultaneous visualisation of all viruses represented in Viro3D, on to which the distribution of proteins can be projected. This was achieved by systematic structural comparison of each virus’ proteome (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>) resulting in a scatter plot, with viruses segregated by structural similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>), which broadly recapitulates viral taxonomy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Mapping the viruses that possess class-I fusion glycoproteins (identified by structural homology to RSV-F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>) demonstrates a distribution across viral realms, indicative of extensive genetic exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>).

This reveals four major clades (designated I-IV in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>).

The second clade contains reverse transcribing viruses, from the <italic>Metaviridae</italic>, which share insect hosts with the <italic>Baculoviridae</italic>, providing a feasible route of genetic exchange <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The third clade is monophyletic for the <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>, this may suggest a single genetic acquisition by an ancestral negative sense RNA virus, from which class-I fusion glycoproteins propagated throughout the order.

The clade IV glycoproteins are particularly long when compared to the rest of the phylogeny (most being &gt;1100 residues; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>), suggesting adaptive diversification.</p><p id="P26">Comparison of structures from across the phylogeny reveals a central structurally-conserved architecture common to all of the identified class-I fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>) consistent with recent experimental studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Example clade IV glycoproteins from an aquatic herpesvirus and a human coronavirus, however, possess very long N-terminal extensions; this includes the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) that constitute the majority of the S1 subunit in coronavirus spike. Moreover, the region conserved across all species broadly corresponds to the fusogenic S2 subunit of spike.

Approximately 64% of the produced protein models are confident predictions with an average pLDDT score above 70. Moreover, 65% of residues in the predicted dataset have high or very high confidence. We confirmed that, in general, ColabFold has a higher chance of producing a confident structure than ESMFold. However, since ESMFold models have higher confidence for almost 10% of protein records, do not require an MSA and are usually much faster to generate, the combination of both approaches is highly beneficial. We also demonstrated that Viro3D exceeds the coverage and quality of existing repositories of viral protein structure predictions.</p><p id="P28">By performing clustering of protein structures encoded by human and animal viruses the diversity of viral proteins was reduced to approximately 19,000 distinct protein structures; almost 65% of these proteins are unique within our dataset. Interestingly, in viruses with linear genomes (realms <italic>Varidnaviria</italic>, <italic>Duplodnaviria</italic> and, to some extent<italic>, Riboviria</italic>), these unique proteins are usually found closer to the ends of the genomes, which probably represent hot spots of gene acquisition or <italic>de novo</italic> gene origination.</p><p id="P29">More than 82% of distinct viral structures are unique to viruses and do not have apparent structural homologs in cellular organisms. This high percentage of unique viral structures may seem surprising given the extensive horizontal gene transfer between viruses and their hosts, and may suggest that even acquired proteins undergo extensive remodelling and diversification in the context of a viral genome. Therefore, we acknowledge that the number of viral proteins retaining more distant structural similarity to cellular components may be higher than that demonstrated in our analysis; indeed parallel studies have identified slightly higher numbers of cellular homologues in viruses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">We showed that structure similarity searches combined with a structural network allowed us to substantially accelerate the search process by increasing the number of homologous structures identified in a single run. For instance, using single RdRp and RT structures we identified RNA-directed polymerases for 90% of viruses in the <italic>Riboviria</italic> realm. This demonstrates that structural searches and network analysis are an extremely efficient means of traversing large evolutionary distances, even where underlying sequence homology may be negligible.</p><p id="P31">Since each viral realm represents an independent origin of an evolutionary distinct virus group <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, protein structures shared across multiple realms can be considered instances of horizontal gene transfer. Genome replication and capsid morphogenesis modules, commonly used for the taxonomic assignment of viruses at higher taxonomic ranks, tend to be hallmark features of specific realms and are rarely shared beyond. RdRp and RT are (almost) unique to members of <italic>Riboviria</italic>, while DJR MCP and HK97 MCP are specific to <italic>Varidnaviria</italic> and <italic>Duplodnaviria</italic>, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. PolB is distributed more broadly: realms <italic>Varidnaviria</italic>, <italic>Duplodnaviria</italic> and some unclassified DNA viruses. Most families in the <italic>Monodnaviria</italic> rely on rolling-circle replication endonuclease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. We found PolB only in one family of this realm: <italic>Bidnaviridae</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. SJR MCP is also widely distributed, including RNA viruses within the realm <italic>Riboviria</italic> and viruses with circular dsDNA genome (realm <italic>Monodnaviria</italic> and unclassified family <italic>Baculoviridae</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Membrane fusion glycoproteins are common but not considered hallmark proteins, and appear to be more mobile being spread across multiple realms. Class III fusion glycoproteins seem to be the most widely distributed among human and animal viruses, being absent only in the realms <italic>Monodnaviria</italic> and <italic>Ribozyviria</italic>.</p><p id="P32">Fusion glycoproteins are fundamentally important for virus transmission, pathogenesis and spillover, and are major targets for host immunity. Viro3D has provided a new opportunity to comprehensively survey the distribution of glycoproteins and, using structure-guided approaches, infer their evolutionary past. Using just a single structural reference to query Viro3D (RSV F glycoprotein), we identified 259 highly-diverse class-I fusion glycoproteins, many sharing &lt;10% sequence identity. This includes both known instances (e.g. in <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>) and newly discovered glycoproteins (e.g. in aquatic herpesviruses). Combined structure and sequence phylogenetics provided the first view of the deep evolutionary history of class-I fusion glycoproteins. This is consistent with multiple independent horizontal gene transfers from an, as yet unidentified, ancestral source.</p><p id="P33">Whilst all of the identified glycoproteins share a structurally conserved central fold, one clade in particular shows signs of extensive adaptive diversification. The phylogenetic topology of this clade suggests that coronaviruses gained their spike glycoprotein by genetic exchange with aquatic herpesviruses. These glycoproteins have doubled in size by gaining novel regulatory elements, such as the NTD and RBD in the S1 subunit of spike. This provides a unique evolutionary explanation for the membrane fusion mechanism of coronaviruses: the S1 subunit is proteolytically separated from spike and is shed following receptor engagement, leaving the structurally-conserved S2 to mediate fusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Thus, to achieve virus entry coronaviruses undergo a regulated unmasking of an ancestral fusogen, which is fundamentally conserved across all class-I fusion glycoproteins. In summary, using class-I fusion glycoproteins as an exemplar, we have demonstrated that structure-guided discovery, enabled by Viro3D, is likely to provide unprecedent new insights on the origins and evolution of viruses.</p><p id="P34">Whether for lab-based investigators wishing to bring three-dimensional context to their molecular virology experiments, researchers performing structure-guided design of therapies, or computational biologists studying deep virus evolution, we expect the rich structural dataset presented here to be valuable resource for the virology community.

Tips and labels are coloured by genome composition. Labels indicate viral genera and, in parentheses, the corresponding average length of glycoprotein. Major clades are labelled, as described in the main text. Node support values are provided at important branch points. <bold>d.</bold> Example structures; ribbon diagrams are colour-coded by structural conservation, assessed by the 3Di alignment, as denoted in the key. Labels indicate N-terminal extensions, present in clade IV glycoproteins, and pertinent regions of spike (N-terminal domain: NTD, receptor binding domain: RBD, and the S2 subunit). Note, predicted structures are monomeric, as opposed to the native trimeric state of class-I fusion glycoproteins, and domain positioning (e.g. NTD and RBD) may be inaccurate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS202333-f003"/></fig></floats-group></article>
