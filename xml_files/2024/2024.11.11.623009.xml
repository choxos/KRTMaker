This study aimed to investigate how beta and gamma activity differs between unimanual and bimanual movements, and how these neural signatures evolve during the learning process. Our motor task incorporated varying levels of bimanual interaction: unimanual, bimanual-equal, and bimanual-unequal. Magnetoencephalography data were recorded during task performance, and beta and gamma dynamics were quantified. As expected, increasing task complexity from unimanual to bimanual-equal, and then to bimanual-unequal movements resulted in slower and less accurate performance. Across all conditions, significant beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) and gamma event-related synchronization (ERS) were observed during movement, as well as beta ERS after movement. Bimanual movements exhibited greater beta ERD, beta ERS, and gamma ERS compared to unimanual movements. With practice, participants demonstrated faster and more accurate movements, accompanied by enhanced beta ERS responses. Furthermore, learning-related reductions in errors correlated with increases in beta ERS. These findings suggest the distinct behavioural and neural demands of unimanual versus bimanual movements and highlight the important role of beta dynamics in motor performance and learning.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Beta ERD</kwd><kwd>beta ERS</kwd><kwd>gamma ERS</kwd><kwd>bimanual movement</kwd><kwd>motor learning</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Complex bimanual movements requiring a finely tuned coordination between the upper limbs are essential for daily activities. However, despite their ubiquity, research into the neural mechanisms underlying motor function has predominantly focused on unimanual motor tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alhussein and Smith, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dekleva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gonzalez Castro et al., 2014</xref>), or simple bimanual motor tasks involving only finger actions, such as finger tapping or figure oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Brandes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Liuzzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Mechsner et al., 2001</xref>). This focus extends to research on motor skill acquisition, which has traditionally prioritized unimanual movements over more complex bimanual movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Andres and Gerloff, 1999</xref>). However, investigating complex bimanual movements that more accurately reflect real-life motor function reveals rich insights into the neural mechanisms of motor control and learning.</p><p id="P3">Behavioural and neurophysiological studies have revealed important distinctions between unimanual and bimanual movements, as well as differences between bimanual tasks. Unimanual movements are generally performed with greater precision and ease than bimanual movements which inherently depend on the coordination between both hands, resulting in longer movement times and larger errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Sisti et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, bimanual movements require greater interhemispheric cooperation, with efficient communication between the motor cortices becoming increasingly crucial as task complexity increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Rueda-Delgado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Serrien, 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Brain activity in the beta band (13-30 Hz) plays a central role in movement, showing a significant decrease in power during movement execution [the event-related desynchronization (ERD)], and an increase in power following movement cessation [the event-related synchronization (ERS)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Pfurtscheller et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pfurtscheller and Aranibar, 1977</xref>). The beta ERD is hypothesised to be related to task complexity: bimanual tasks show stronger beta ERD compared to unimanual tasks, with anti-phase bimanual tasks exhibiting more significant beta ERD than in-phase tasks, and complex, role-differentiated tasks leading to more pronounced beta ERD than simpler, non-role-differentiated tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gross et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Rudisch et al., 2023</xref>). However, some studies report contradictory findings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Houweling et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">2008</xref>), highlighting the complex role of beta activity during different motor tasks.</p><p id="P5">Movement-related beta activity is also postulated to have a role in acquisition of motor skills. Learning-related increases in beta ERS are evident, with stronger beta ERS relating to higher movement accuracy in unimanual tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Tan et al., 2014b</xref>). Additionally, in simple reaching tasks a practice-related strengthening of the beta ERD, the beta ERS, and the modulation depth (i.e., the difference between ERD and ERS) has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Nelson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Ricci et al., 2019</xref>). However, these studies, primarily focused on unimanual movements limiting the generalization of their results to more complex bimanual movements, which constitute most human motor activities in daily life.</p><p id="P6">There is also a growing interest in the role of mid-gamma activity (60-90 Hz) in motor control and motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Nowak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zich et al., 2021</xref>). Gamma is a prokinetic emergent property of the motor cortices, and increases in power during motor execution – the gamma ERS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Crone et al., 1998</xref>), and local gamma power has been linked to motor performance and motor learning in unimanual tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zich et al., 2021</xref>). Conversely, a recent study demonstrated a decrease in gamma ERS after practice, suggesting a potential shift in attentional demands rather than in movement characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Tatti et al., 2023</xref>). However, the role of gamma dynamics in bimanual movements, particularly in bimanual movements of varying complexities, remains largely unexplored.</p><p id="P7">This study was therefore designed with two primary objectives: (1) to investigate beta and gamma dynamics across unimanual and diverse bimanual movements, and (2) to examine how these neural signatures change throughout the learning process. To achieve these goals, we used a motor task we recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Schoenfeld et al., 2021</xref>), where participants were required to move a cursor along an angled path, with each hand controlling movement along orthogonal axes. This approach allowed us to assess different levels of bimanual interaction by incorporating paths that required either a unimanual response, an equal contribution from both hands (bimanual equal), or differing contributions from each hand (bimanual unequal). We investigated beta ERD and gamma ERS during movement, and beta ERS after movement across different conditions, and tracked how these dynamics changed with practice. We hypothesised that these dynamics would differ between movement conditions and would be significantly modulated by practice. Specifically, in line with our previous work, we hypothesised that beta ERD would be more pronounced during learning, and correlate with changes in movement time, and beta ERS would increase during learning and correlate with changes in accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p id="P8">Forty-three healthy participants (27 females; mean age ± SD = 24.1 ± 4.2 years) were recruited for this study. All participants were right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971) and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. All fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (1) no history of neurological or psychiatric disease; (2) no physical disability of the arms or wrists; and (3) no use of drugs affecting the central nervous system. The study was approved by the Central University Research Ethics Committee, University of Oxford (MSD-IDREC-R68649/RE002).

Before the bimanual motor learning task, the force grippers were calibrated for each participant. This calibration required participants to exert maximum effort by squeezing each gripper five times, which established the maximum force for each gripper individually by using the peak maximum relative to the gripper’s system offset. During the motor learning task, participants were first familiarised with the task using one orientation street. This was followed by 50 bimanual motor training trials. Each trial consisted of six streets: two unimanual streets at 0° and 90°, two bimanual-equal streets at 45°, and two bimanual-unequal streets at 22.5° and 67.5° (detailed below). Each street started with a 5-second fixation cross at the centre of the screen. Following this, a street was displayed whereby the angle of the street indicated the required cursor movement. Participants then started navigating the cursor from the start position (bottom-centre of the street) along the ideal path in the middle of the street. If the cursor contacted either side of the street, the cursor was reset to the starting position. Upon reaching the end of the street, there was a 5-second resting interval before the next street was presented. This procedure was repeated for each of the six streets. After each trial feedback on the participant’s performance, i.e., movement time (MT) and accuracy, for that trial was visually presented.</p><p id="P10">Participants were instructed to control the cursor using the left hand for vertical movements and the right hand for horizontal movements. Each street required specific hand contributions based on its angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). In the unimanual condition, the vertical (0°) streets were controlled entirely by the left hand, and the horizontal (90°) streets entirely by the right hand, effectively resulting in hand contributions of 100% from one hand and 0% from the other. In the bimanual-equal condition, the 45° streets required an equal contribution of 50% effort from each hand. In the bimanual-unequal condition, the streets angled at 22.5° and 67.5° required asymmetric contributions, with the 22.5° streets requiring 75% effort from the left hand and 25% from the right, and the 67.5° streets requiring 25% effort from the left and 75% from the right (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-C</xref>). To prevent memorisation of the order of the streets, the order of the six streets was pseudo-randomised across trials, whereby two unimanual streets or two bimanual-equal streets never occurred successively.</p><p id="P11">Cursor movement required at least 15% of the participant’s maximum force. The participant’s maximum force moved the cursor 25 pixels per refresh rate of the monitor (60 Hz). Once the cursor reached the end of a street, participants needed to reduce their grip to less than 2% of their maximum force to proceed to the fixation cross. This task design built upon our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Schoenfeld et al., 2021</xref>), with the primary modification being an extended time between streets allowing for a post-movement beta ERS and a baseline period for the next street.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.3</label><title>Behavioural data analysis</title><p id="P12">Movement time and error were calculated for each street. Movement time was defined as the time between movement onset and movement offset. Movement onset was defined as the time when the gripper force exceeded the threshold, calculated as the mean force plus three standard deviations (SD) from the signal during the “rest” period, and was sustained above this level for at least 100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Tan et al., 2014a</xref>). Similarly, movement offset was defined as the time before the gripper force fell below this threshold and remained there for at least 100 ms. Error was calculated at each time point by determining the distance of the cursor from the ideal line (the midline of the streets) using Heron’s Formula. The total error for each street was constituted by the root mean square of errors at all time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Schoenfeld et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>2.4</label><title>MEG and MRI data acquisition</title><p id="P13">Whole-head MEG recordings were acquired in a magnetically shielded room at the Oxford Centre for Human Brain Activity (OHBA) using a 306-channel MEGIN Triux™ Neo system (MEGIN, Stockholm, Sweden). This system includes 204 planar gradiometers and 102 magnetometers. Head position was monitored using five head position indicator (HPI) coils attached behind the left and right ear lobe, above the right eyebrow, on the left and right forehead just below the hairline. The locations of the HPI coils, three anatomical fiducial points (nasion, left and right pre-auricular points) and at least 200 additional points of the head surface were digitized using a Polhemus FastTrak 3D magnetic digitization system (Polhemus, Vermont, United States) prior to MEG acquisition. Both vertical and horizontal electro-oculograms as well as electrocardiograms were recorded to monitor eye blinks, horizontal eye movements and cardiac activity, respectively. MEG data were sampled at 1000 Hz with a 0.03-330 Hz bandpass filter applied during digitization. Visual stimuli were projected to 31 x 55 cm on a screen placed 120 cm in front of the participant using a Panasonic PT D7700E projector (Panasonic, Osaka, Japan) with a refresh rate of 60 Hz.</p><p id="P14">T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired using a WIN Siemens 3 Tesla Prisma scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) either at the Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) or OHBA. The protocol employed a rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence, which lasted 8 minutes. The scanning parameters were set as follows: time of repetition (TR) = 1900 ms, time of echo (TE) = 3.96 ms, voxel size = 1 x 1 x 1 mm, field of view (FOV) = 256 x 256 mm (including nose and ears), slice thickness = 1 mm, and 192 slices per slab.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><label>2.5</label><title>MEG data analysis</title><p id="P15">MEG data analyses were conducted using Python 3.10. The MEG data were firstly maxfiltered using the “maxwell_filter” function from MNE-Python for noise removal, bad channel detection, and head movement correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Gramfort et al., 2013</xref>). Subsequent preprocessing steps were performed using OHBA Software Library (OSL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Quinn et al., 2022</xref>). The continuous data were downsampled to 250 Hz to reduce computational demands. A bandpass filter from 0.5 to 100 Hz and notch filters at 50 and 100 Hz were applied. Bad segments were identified by segmenting the data into 500 ms chunks and applying a generalized extreme Studentized deviate algorithm at a significance level of 0.1. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based on FastICA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hyvarinen, 1999</xref>) decomposition was employed to automatically correct stereotypical heart and eye movement artefacts by correlating the independent components with ECG and EOG channels. Next, any remaining bad channels were interpolated using spherical spline interpolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Perrin et al., 1989</xref>). Two out of 43 participants were excluded from further analysis due to excessive artefacts.</p><p id="P16">Following preprocessing, source localization was performed to estimate the brain origins of the MEG signal. The MEG data were co-registered with individual T1-weighted MRI images for each participant using headshape points. Three participants lacked individual anatomical scans, for these participants the MNI152-T1 standard template was used. Prior to beamforming, the data were filtered into two distinct frequency bands: 5 to 45 Hz primarily for beta power and 60 to 90 Hz for gamma power. The sensor-level data were then projected onto an 8 mm grid inside the inner skull using a Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamformer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Van Veen and Buckley, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Westner et al., 2022</xref>). A noise covariance matrix used to calculate the beamformer was estimated using the sensor-level data for each subject and regularised to a rank of 60 using principal component analysis (PCA). Then, the MEG data were parcellated into 52 anatomically informed regions of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Kohl et al., 2023</xref>). Following this, symmetric orthogonalization was applied to the time courses of these parcels to minimize spatial leakage, and dipole sign flipping was used to align the signs of each parcel time course across subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gohil et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Next, the data were epoched, aligned to movement onset (from -5 to +10 seconds relative to movement onset for analysing beta ERD and gamma ERS) and movement offset (from -2 to +5 seconds relative to movement offset exclusively for beta ERS analysis). Time-frequency transformation of the MEG data was conducted using the multitaper method, as implemented in MNE-Python. For this analysis, the number of cycles per frequency was dynamically defined to be half of the frequency and the time-bandwidth product was set at 6. Baseline correction was applied to each epoch within the interval from -1.5 to -1 seconds relative to movement onset, and the results were converted to decibel (dB) units to normalize power.</p><p id="P18">In the beta band (13 to 30 Hz), we extracted beta ERD (defined from movement onset to offset) and beta ERS (from movement offset to offset + 1 second, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In the gamma band (60 to 90 Hz), we extracted gamma ERS (from movement onset to onset + 0.5 seconds, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). These analyses were specifically focused on the left and right somatosensory and motor cortex areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Rueda-Delgado et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="P19">For the different movement conditions (unimanual, bimanual-equal, bimanual-unequal), the principal sensorimotor cortex (P-SMC) is defined as the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) contralateral to the hand exerting more or full force, whereas the auxiliary sensorimotor cortex (A-SMC) refers to the SMC ipsilateral to the hand exerting more or full force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). More specifically, in the unimanual condition, the P-SMC is located in the right hemisphere for movements along the 0° street and in the left hemisphere for the 90° street. In the bimanual-equal condition, one 45° street from each trial is randomly assigned to have the right sensorimotor cortex as the P-SMC and the other to have the left sensorimotor cortex as the P-SMC. For the bimanual-unequal condition, the P-SMC is determined by the hand exerting more force, with the right sensorimotor cortex serving as the P-SMC for the 22.5° street and the left sensorimotor cortex serving as the P-SMC for the 67.5° street. Correspondingly, the A-SMC in each condition is the sensorimotor cortex on the opposite side of the P-SMC.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><label>2.6</label><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P20">The movement time and errors were compared between conditions using two-tailed paired t-tests with false discovery rate (FDR) correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

Prior to model fitting, the 50 trials were split into 5 blocks, each containing 10 trials, and trials within blocks were averaged per street angle. Next, the main effect of “block” was tested for each street angle, by including a fixed effect for “block” (five levels, each block corresponding to ten consecutive trials) and a random intercept for “subject”. To test if the “block” main effect differed across different street angles, a fixed effect for “street angle” (five levels: 0°, 22.5°, 45°, 67.5° and 90°) was included in the model to examine the “block” × “street angle” interaction.</p><p id="P22">Additionally, to explore the correlations between the behavioural changes (i.e., MT and error) and the neural changes (i.e., changes in beta ERD, beta ERS, and gamma ERS), further LMMs were employed.

Similarly, the gamma ERS was greater in bimanual conditions than in the unimanual condition, particularly within the auxiliary sensorimotor cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).

As hypothesised, unimanual movements were associated with shorter movement times and higher accuracy than bimanual movements. Among the bimanual movements, the unequal movements, which had a higher degree of complexity, proved more challenging as expected, exhibiting longer movement times and lower accuracy than the bimanual movements which required equal contributions from each hand. On the neural level, as expected, we observed significant movement-related activity in terms of beta ERD, beta ERS, and gamma ERS across all movement conditions, with bimanual movements eliciting enhanced responses.</p><p id="P36">As seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Schoenfeld et al., 2021</xref>), as participants performed the task their performance improved in almost all movement conditions, reflected by a decrease in movement times and errors. These changes suggest that participants were not merely repeating movements, but rather that practice refined their motor skills. As hypothesised, in parallel with this improved behaviour, we observed an increase in beta ERS during learning, which correlated with the reduction in errors in the task. Contrary to our hypothesis, we observed lower power in beta ERD (i.e. a smaller deflection) during learning in conditions where the principal SMC was in the left hemisphere.</p><sec id="S17"><label>4.1</label><title>Neural dynamics are modulated during movement</title><p id="P37">Consistent with previous findings, we observed that beta ERD occurs during movement execution within the 13-30 Hz frequency range. This reduction in beta power is thought to reflect the release of cortical inhibition and activation of the motor network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Pfurtscheller et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Tinkhauser et al., 2019</xref>). Beta ERD is frequently reported bilaterally in electrophysiological (EEG) studies even during unimanual movements. This contrasts with the more pronounced lateralization seen in hemodynamic responses recorded simultaneously with fMRI-EEG. However, further functional MRI studies indicate that ipsilateral activity during unimanual movements likely results from an efference copy of motor signals generated in the contralateral cortex. This activity aids in supressing mirror-symmetric actions and ensures coordinated motor control during unimanual tasks, preventing unintended movements on the opposite side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ames and Churchland, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Diedrichsen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P38">Post-movement beta ERS occurs after movement termination and is believed to reflect a prolonged period of increased corticomuscular coherence following voluntary movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Feige et al., 2000</xref>).

Our findings align with previous magnetoencephalography and electrophysiological studies, which report a bilateral beta ERS, which is greater in the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Devos et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Jurkiewicz et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p id="P39">We observed gamma activity in the 60-90 Hz range coinciding with movement onset and lasting approximately 0.5-1 seconds, which demonstrates strong lateralization to the SMC contralateral to movement.

Additionally, studies on unimanual movements show larger activity changes in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex when moving the left finger compared to the right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jäncke et al., 1998</xref>), supporting hemispheric asymmetries in motor control.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><label>4.2</label><title>Greater task complexity leads to greater movement-related activity</title><p id="P41">Bimanual movements are inherently more demanding than unimanual movements, due to the increased need for temporal coordination between the hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Serrien and Brown, 2002</xref>), which in our task is especially apparent in the bimanual unequal movements.

This study suggested that beta power in both cortices encodes movement-specific information for both hands.

Previous studies have demonstrated that post-movement beta ERS in the sensorimotor cortex is associated with learning processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tan et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Torrecillos et al., 2015</xref>). However, the precise functional role of beta ERS remains unclear.</p><p id="P45">Early theories suggest that beta ERS represents a return to an idling state of the sensorimotor cortex, indicative of reduced sensorimotor cortical excitability. According to these theories, beta ERS serves an active inhibitory function by “clearing out” the motor program after movement execution and resetting the neural network to its baseline state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Kilavik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>). Recent studies, however, propose that the role of beta ERS extends beyond simply reflecting an inactive or inhibited cortical state. Beta ERS has been shown to relate to movement error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Tan et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Torrecillos et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this, our finding that the learning-related increase in beta ERS correlates with learning-related decrease in error, suggests that beta ERS may be involved in the comparison between planned and executed movements. Additional research suggests that enhancements in beta ERS are linked to rule acquisition, stabilizing and amplifying the post-decision “beta-state” to strengthen neural representations of newly learned rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bogaerts et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Pavlova et al., 2023</xref>).

This observation appears to contradict the view that gamma activity plays a prokinetic role in movement, and motor skill acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Muthuraman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Zich et al., 2021</xref>). For instance, studies using 75 Hz or theta-gamma coupling transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) have shown relationships between 75Hz activity and skill acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Akkad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Nowak et al., 2018</xref>). However, they studied thumb abduction acceleration rather than the movement time and error used here; it may therefore be that 75Hz activity more directly reflects force modulation than other aspects of motor performance. Interestingly, it has been proposed that the efficiency of gamma tACS may occur through the modulation of beta activity rather than gamma activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Sugata et al., 2018</xref>), which might at least partially explain the pattern of results observed here.</p><p id="P49">Finally, it has been hypothesised that early changes in GABA inhibition after tACS are linked with motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Nowak et al., 2018</xref>), and gamma ERS typically peaks during early skill acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Madhavan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Perfetti et al., 2011</xref>).

Additionally, as participants learnt our task, their movement times and errors decreased. The differences in neural responses we observe between conditions and across the task might therefore result from variations in movement times, rather than differences in bimanual co-ordination per se, such that task conditions with longer movement times might exhibit more pronounced neural changes due to prolonged neural activity. However, the temporal specificity of significant differences in neural dynamics makes this explanation less likely. For example, the gamma ERS clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) align closely with movement onset. If the differences in gamma ERS across movement conditions were caused by the extended movement time, we would expect the cluster to appear later, during the prolonged movement phase, rather than at the movement onset when both unimanual and bimanual movements share a similar duration. This temporal specificity is in contrast with the variability and delayed onset of significant beta ERD clusters when comparing different task conditions, indicating that movement time may influence beta ERD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, correlation analyses reveal a correlation between changes in movement time and changes in beta ERD but not with changes in gamma or beta ERS, supporting the notion that the observed differences in beta ERD, but not beta ERS or gamma ERS, between conditions could be affected by movement time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P51">This study enhances our understanding of the neural mechanisms distinct to unimanual and bimanual movements, revealing differential responses of beta and gamma activities to these varying task complexities.

behavioural performance.</title><p>(A) Streets are defined at angles of 0°, 22.5°, 45°, 67.5°, and 90° to create varying degrees of bimanual hand contribution. The unimanual condition is represented in orange (0° and 90°), the bimanual-equal condition in green (45°), and the bimanual-unequal condition in purple (22.5° and 67.5°). (B) Example cursor movement path and hand contribution from a single 67.5° street. The purple lines depict the actual cursor movement path, and the dashed purple line represents the ideal path (left). In this instance, the right hand exerts greater force than the left hand to control the cursor along the 67.5° street (right). (C) Hand contribution for streets of different angles. Each hand controls movement along a different axis on the screen: the left hand controls upward movement, and the right hand controls rightward movement. Different angles correspond to specific hand contributions. In the unimanual condition (0° and 90° streets), only one hand is used (left and right hand, respectively). In the bimanual-equal condition (45° street), both hands contribute equally (50%:50%). In the bimanual-unequal condition (22.5° and 67.5° streets), unequal contribution (75%:25% and 25%:75%, respectively) is required. (D) Behavioural performance for unimanual, bimanual-equal, and bimanual-unequal conditions. Movement time and error are smaller in unimanual conditions than in bimanual-equal, and smaller in bimanual-equal than in bimanual-unequal conditions.
