While bottom-up mass spectrometry (MS) is the most widely used proteomics technique for profiling the sequence diversity of circulating antibodies (Ab-seq), it has not been thoroughly benchmarked. We quantified the replicability and robustness of Ab-seq using six monoclonal antibodies with known protein sequences in 70 different combinations of concentration and oligoclonality, both with and without polyclonal serum IgG background. Each combination underwent four protease treatments and was analyzed across four experimental and three technical replicates, totaling 3,360 LC-MS/MS runs. We quantified the dependence of MS-based Ab-seq identification on antibody sequence, concentration, protease, background signal diversity, and bioinformatics setups. Integrating the data from experimental replicates, proteases, and bioinformatics tools enhanced antibody identification. <italic>De novo</italic> peptide sequencing showed similar performance to database-dependent methods for higher antibody concentrations, but <italic>de novo</italic> antibody reconstruction remains challenging.

There exist two forms of Ig: (1) transmembrane B-cell receptors (BCR) when displayed on the surface of B cells and (2) antibodies (Ab) when secreted in a soluble truncated form into the serum and mucosa. BCRs and antibodies possess mostly identical structures of two heavy chains (HC or IGH) and two light chains (LC), where the LCs can be either of the kappa (IGK) or lambda (IGL) type <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Each chain consists of a constant region and a variable region. While the constant region determines effector functions, the variable region determines specificity to antigens and is composed of V, (D), and J genes assembled in a process called V(D)J recombination. The variable region is subdivided into the lower diversity framework regions and the higher diversity complementary determining regions, known as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Most of the diversity in Ig sequences is concentrated in the CDR3, which is often utilized as a unique identifier of clonal lineage amongst Ig molecules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> and has been shown to be crucial for antigen binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. In this manuscript, CDR3 regions of HC and LC are referred to as CDRH3 and CDRL3, respectively. During the response to antigens, the affinity maturation process introduces point mutations that further enhance Ig sequence diversity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The stochastic and combinatorial nature of these processes leads to a theoretical diversity of over 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> human Ig sequences <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Over the last decade, high-throughput BCR sequencing (BCR-seq) has provided unprecedented insights into the genetic diversity of the B-cell immune response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. BCR-seq enabled the study of B-cell repertoires using sequence-based computational methods, such as repertoire similarity, diversity, clonality, and architecture analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In contrast to BCRs, the sequence diversity and antigen-specific dynamics of the mucosal and serological antibody repertoire have remained underexplored <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. The lack of a detailed description of the sequence identities and relative amounts of circulating antibodies in the repertoire prevents the establishment of the fundamental principles of humoral adaptive immunity. This, in turn, has hindered the development of next-generation therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, as well as the profiling of antibody sequence diversity in infection, cancer, and autoimmunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Since antibodies are soluble proteins that circulate freely in body fluids, they cannot be sequenced directly as opposed to BCRs. To analyze the sequence diversity of polyclonal antibody mixtures, mass spectrometry (MS) is required – hereafter referred to as Ab-seq <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Specifically, Ab-seq signifies the use of bottom-up proteomics analysis with LC-MS/MS to recover amino acid sequences from digested Ab molecules, in contrast to intact mass analysis of native Ab molecules in top-down MS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. To enable sequence recovery, BCR-seq data is usually required to build the reference database, from which an <italic>in silico</italic> spectrum as a basis to evaluate the experimental spectra, formally referred to as peptide-spectrum match (PSM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Alternatively, <italic>de novo</italic> peptide sequencing tools may be used <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Bottom-up proteomics is by far the most common approach to capturing the amino acid sequence diversity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, however, recently, other approaches combining both bottom-up and top-down approaches have been introduced <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Ab-seq is a special case of the protein inference problem in bottom-up proteomics, where proteins in a sample are identified based on the detected peptides. While protein inference has been extensively benchmarked in general cases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> and serves as the basis for protein quantification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, Ab-seq poses unique challenges. Unlike standard protein inference, V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation produce a highly degenerate protein database, where two antibodies in the repertoire may differ by only a single mutation. In general protein inference, detecting one or two peptides is often sufficient to confirm the presence of a protein. However, in Ab-seq, the high frequency of shared peptides between similar antibodies means that accurate identification requires the detection of multiple peptides, particularly those covering the CDR3s.</p><p id="P8">While many reports exist on B- and T-cell receptor sequencing standardization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, benchmarking studies for Ab-seq are virtually absent, despite numerous reports on this subject <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Benchmarking of high-throughput technologies depends on ground truth data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, where such data consists of, for example, known cell lines, or known nucleic or protein sequences (i.e., “spike-in” sequences), allowing for estimation of identification accuracy. Indeed, a recent large-scale shotgun proteomics study performed on cell lines established baselines for the correspondence of transcriptome and translated proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. While some previous Ab-seq studies utilized spike-in, their main purpose was relative quantification of sample input rather than benchmarking performance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Thus, as of present, the extent to which bottom-up Ab-seq can accurately recover antibody sequences across a wide range of experimental conditions varying by background, antibody concentration, and complexity of the polyclonal mixture has not been investigated systematically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Additionally, the replicability and robustness of Ab-seq remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Quantifying the impact of these factors could facilitate the joint analysis of BCR sequencing and Ab-seq <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>, with the ultimate goal of achieving accurate and comprehensive characterization of serum antibody diversity.</p><p id="P9">In this study, we devised a large-scale, sequence- and input amount-controlled experimental design with multiple independent repetitions of the entire experiment (experimental replicates) and multiple sample injections into the mass spectrometer (technical replicates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). This experimental design was used to assess the performance of LC-MS/MS for Ab-seq sequence reconstruction with respect to (1) experimental and technical replicability, (2) protease-dependent variation, (3) presence of blood-derived Ig background, (4) antibody input amount, (5) antibody sequence similarity, (6) freely available protein identification and quantification tools, and (7) <italic>de novo</italic> peptide sequencing from MS data. We show that (i) performing experimental replicates improves peptide discovery and sequence coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>), (ii) detection of monoclonal antibodies is affected by sample polyclonal complexity and presence of blood IgG background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>), (iii) antibody concentration differences may be inferred using Ab-seq’s MS1 signal intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>), and (iv) <italic>de novo</italic> Ab-seq remains inferior in performance compared to PSM methods in V(D)J sequence coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). Overall, our Ab-seq dataset, obtained from 3360 MS runs, provides a foundation for future refinement of both experimental and computational Ab-seq workflows.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Experimental design for Ab-seq benchmarking</title><p id="P10">To benchmark the Ab-seq method, we designed an experiment incorporating a diverse source of variations. As ground truth, we used six monoclonal IgG1 antibodies (mAbs) with known amino acid sequence: h9C12 WT (wild type), h9C12 Q97A (mutant), PGT121, and PGDM1400 as well as recombinant forms of Briakinumab (short: Brimab), Ustekinumab (short: Umab), (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The mAbs are well-characterized and have known specificities: h9C12 and its variant h9C12 Q97A bind the hexon surface protein of human adenovirus 5 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>, Brimab and Umab bind human IL12/23 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup> while PGT121 and PGDM1400 target the HIV gp120 envelope protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. Except for h9C12 WT and h9C12 Q97A, which differed by only one amino acid residue in the CDRH3 region, all tested mAbs exhibited low pairwise sequence similarity of 0% to 44.4% within the CDRH3 region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), where CDR3 was defined by the IMGT numbering scheme for the V-REGION <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>. In addition, we verified that none of the six mAbs except h9C12 WT and h9C12 Q97A share common subsequences within CDRH3 regions more than 5 amino acids long (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). The intentional use of diverse antibodies in the experiment was to minimize collisions in peptide detection and quantification among different mAbs.</p><p id="P11">In the main experiment, we varied the mAb input amount across three orders of magnitude (from 10 ng/mL to 10 μg/mL in 100 μL volume), the number of mAbs included (from 1 to 6 mAbs), and the presence of background noise (polyclonal serum IgGs), resulting in a total of 70 unique mAbs combinations, hereafter referred to as samples. We repeated the experiment, starting from digestion to LC-MS/MS analysis, for all 70 samples across four experimental replicates, ensuring a high degree of experimental consistency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). As suggested by findings by Bondt and colleagues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>, the majority of IgG1 and IgA1 repertoires consist of tens to hundreds of the most abundant clones. To approximate clonal complexity, we used six mAbs and varied the clonal composition by adjusting the number of mAbs in each sample. The range of mAb input (from 1 ng to 1 μg) was chosen to reflect the physiological range at which IgG antibody clonotypes would be present in the serum, based on previously measured serum IgG concentration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup> and the estimated number of clonotypes present in the serum <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. Briefly, single Ab clonotypes have been reported to be within the range of 10 ng to 1 μg per 1 mL of human plasma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, while 1 ng of input (equivalent to 6.7 fmol of antibodies) is used to examine the detection limit of bottom-up proteomics for Ab clonotype identification. Polyclonal IgGs isolated from the blood of a healthy donor were added to half of the samples (1 μg in samples 1-35, 65, 67, and 68; 50 μg in samples 69 and 70) to simulate the effect of polyclonal IgG background noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 6</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Each sample was digested separately by four commonly used protease treatments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup>: Trypsin (Tryp), Chymotrypsin alone (Ct), Chymotrypsin followed by Trypsin (Ct+Tryp), or AspN, resulting in a total of 1120 MS samples (70 samples x 4 experimental replicates x 4 protease treatments) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>). The rationale was that aside from Trypsin, the most common choice for protease treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>, Chymotrypsin and AspN can be used to complement Trypsin to achieve a better distribution of cleavage sites peptides in the target sequence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>. In addition to the four proteases, samples 65 and 66 were treated with Fc protease followed by purification of the derived Fab fragments to evaluate whether Fab-only characterization would result in better performance compared to intact mAbs. However, we did not observe that Fc protease increased the detection of mAb-related peptides from the samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). All digested peptides were fractionated with the EvoSep One LC system, followed by detection in QExactive HF mass spectrometer, with each sample analyzed in technical triplicates, resulting in a total of 3360 LC-MS/MS runs (1120 MS samples x 3 technical replicates). The raw output files were searched against a reference database containing the ground truth mAb sequences, along with decoy protein and antibody sequences (details in Methods) using MaxQuant (MQ) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> and MSFragger (MSF) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>, as well as <italic>de novo</italic> peptide sequencing tool Casanovo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, all of which are freely available software packages. Although other computational tools for proteomics analysis exist <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>, our study focused solely on freely available software.</p><p id="P13">To evaluate Ab-seq performance, we examined both its replicability and robustness in identification and quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Here, replicability is defined as the consistency of Ab-seq results across experimental and technical replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>), while robustness refers to the impact of various conditions on Ab-seq performance (with benchmarking metrics illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). These conditions include experimental factors, (such as background noise, mAb input quantity, and mAb mixture complexity) and computational factors (such as the choice between PSM or <italic>de novo</italic> approaches and the selection of computational tools) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). The low variation in signal intensities and peptide detection between technical replicates, chromatography method, and consumables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>) allowed us to better discern the variability across experimental replicates and conditions.

We hypothesized that the presence of these false positive peptides can be attributed to several factors: (i) the presence of polyclonal IgGs in blood IgG-containing samples, which may share common subsequences with the mAbs, particularly in the V or J gene regions, (ii) shared subsequences among different mAbs, and (iii) incomplete removal of previous peptides during the cleaning cycles.</p><p id="P17">To address these issues, we implemented a preprocessing pipeline, with the procedure detailed in the Methods section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>.

Although the number of unique peptides mapped to a mAb sequence can provide insights into Ab-seq performance, applications such as mAb cloning and expression of mAb sequence of interest require full V(D)J sequence characterization. This highlights the need for a more thorough assessment of mAb sequencing performance. For this reason, we prioritized sequence coverage, defined as the percentage of covered positions in the corresponding reference sequence, as the primary performance metric over the number of unique peptides. This choice reflects the fact that peptides of varying lengths can map to the same positions in the reference V(D)J sequence, making sequence coverage a more comprehensive measure of Ab-seq performance (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 12</xref> for a detailed explanation of coverage).

ApsN digestion, however, consistently resulted in the fewest number of unique mAb peptides (2–10 peptides) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). A similar order in protease efficiency was observed for CDRH3 peptides, as well as LC VJ and CDRL3 peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 13a</xref>). Notably, CDRH3 peptides were absent in certain protease treatments from all experimental replicates: h9C12 Q97A, h9C12 WT, Umab, and PGT121 for AspN; Brimab, Umab, and PGDM1400 for Ct; PGT121 and PGDM1400 for Tryp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>), despite the theoretical cleavage predictions indicating the presence of CDRH3 peptides from all four proteases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>).

Each protease treatment contributed differently to the overall sequence coverage, depending on the specific mAb. Ct+Tryp protease provided the highest overall VDJ sequence coverage across all six mAbs (89.39–97.44%), followed by Tryp peptides (64.39–100%), Ct peptides (53.90–100%), and AspN peptides (11.35–60.87%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>).

Our primary focus was on the HC sequence coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b, c</xref>), similar trends were observed for the LC sequence coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 13</xref>).</p><p id="P25">By merging experimental replicates cumulatively and comparing pairwise differences between individual experimental replicates, pairs, triplets, with all replicates merged (3 comparisons in total for each mAb-input group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>), we observed a marked increase in sequence coverage, especially at lower mAb input amounts. At the lowest input of 1 ng, accumulating peptides from an increasing number of experimental replicates led to an increase in median VDJ coverage of 14.54–55.56 %pt, depending on the mAb sequence. The impact of merging replicates diminished at higher input amounts, with the gap in coverage reduced to 9.91–50.84%pt at 10 ng, 3.42–18.08%pt at 100 ng, and 0–26.24%pt at 1000 ng (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>).

In 14 out of 24 mAb-input groups, VDJ coverage was significantly higher in four merged replicates than individual replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>). However, when comparing two merged experimental replicates to four, only 3 out of 24 mAb-input groups showed a statistically significant increase. Finally, no significant difference in VDJ coverage was observed between three merged experimental replicates and four merged experimental replicates.</p><p id="P27">Similar to the VDJ region, CDRH3 coverage improved when experimental replicates were merged. In 8 out of 24 mAb-input groups, merging four experimental replicates significantly increased CDRH3 coverage compared to individual experimental replicates. However, only 1 out of 24 mAb-input groups showed a significant difference in CDRH3 coverage when comparing two versus four merged experimental replicates, largely due to the analytical challenge of samples exhibiting either zero or full CDRH3 coverage. Once again, PGT121 and PGDM1400, which had lower CDRH3 coverage, coincided with their longer CDRH3 length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P28">The highest median VDJ coverages were reported more often in experimental replicates 2 (12/24 mAb-input groups) and 3 (9/24 mAb-input groups), compared to replicates 1 (5/24 mAb-input groups) and 4 (0/24 mAb-input groups). However, no single experimental replicate was universally superior in sequence coverage for all six mAbs surveyed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 18</xref>). Nevertheless, aggregating sequence data from all experimental replications invariably resulted in greater coverage than any single experimental instance, except where coverage had attained completeness at 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b,c</xref>).

To explore this, we divided the samples into two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>): mAb-only samples (samples 36–64, 66) and those containing blood-derived IgG background (samples 1–35, 65, 67–70). We pooled together peptides from technical triplicates, protease treatments, and proteomics software programs. As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, we quantified VDJ and CDRH3 coverage across 24 different mAb-input groups (6 mAbs x 4 input amounts).</p><p id="P31">We found that in three out of six mAbs (h9C12 Q97A, h9C12 WT, and Umab), the VDJ sequence coverage was equal to or higher in mAb-only samples compared to those with blood IgG. This difference was most pronounced at lower mAb inputs of 1 ng and 10 ng, before leveling off at 100 ng and 1000 ng (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>). However, Brimab, PGT121, and PGDM1400 were exceptions to this trend. At the lowest input amount of 1 ng, the median VDJ coverage for Brimab was 67.83%pt higher in samples with blood-derived IgG (adjusted p-value = 0.04), decreasing to increments of 63.92%pt, 55.99%pt, and 12.18%pt with increasing input amounts. Similarly, for PGDM1400, the difference in median VDJ coverage between samples with and without blood IgG was 3.9%pt, 13.83%pt, 10.28%pt, and 6.39%pt at 1 ng, 10 ng, 100 ng, and 1000 ng, respectively, although the differences were not statistically significant. This can be partially attributed to the sequence of Brimab and PGDM1400 themselves, which are made up of common human V genes, IGHV3-33 and IGHV1-2, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Due to the frequent occurrence of these V genes in the population <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>, it is likely that blood IgGs also possess them, thereby impacting the VDJ coverage of Brimab and PGDM1400. Furthermore, the highest number of false positive peptides removed from blood-containing samples corresponded to Brimab and PGDM1400, suggesting the impact of blood IgGs on their identification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>). On the other hand, for PGT121, the median VDJ coverage for samples without blood at 1 ng and 10 ng of input was 6.81%pt and 2.65%pt higher than samples with blood, respectively; but at higher inputs of 100 ng and 1000 ng, the pattern reversed, with samples containing blood showing median VDJ coverage that was 21.21%pt and 4.91%pt higher than samples without blood. These results suggest the effect of blood IgG on sequence coverage is not uniform due to the polyclonal nature of the blood-derived IgGs.</p><p id="P32">CDRH3 coverage followed similar patterns to VDJ coverage when examined with and without blood IgG background. At 1 ng input, blood IgG-containing samples showed no detectable CDRH3 peptides for five of the six mAbs (h9C12 Q97A, h9C12 WT, Brimab, PGT121, and PGDM1400), whereas this occurred in only three of the mAbs for mAb-only samples (Brimab, PGT121, and PGDM1400), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). In addition, in most cases, the median CDHR3 coverage was equal to or lower in samples with blood IgG compared to those without, except for PGDM1400, where its longer CDRH3 (36 amino acids) may have increased the probability of non-specific sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). At higher mAb input levels of 100 ng and 1000 ng, PGDM1400 samples with blood IgG 4.17%pt and 8.33%pt higher median CDRH3 coverage, respectively, compared to samples without blood IgG. These findings collectively highlight the role of background polyclonal antibodies in obscuring CDRH3 peptide detection, with the magnitude of this effect diminishing at higher mAb concentrations.</p><p id="P33">After observing that high-diversity, i.e., polyclonal, sequence background decreases the CDRH3 detection accuracy, we asked whether the number of mAb spike-ins in the sample also impacts sequence coverage. To this end, we only investigated those samples without blood IgG background, and subdivided samples into those containing a single mAb (samples 36–47, containing either h9C12 WT, or Umab, or PGDM1400) versus multiple mAbs (samples 48–64, 66, containing all six mAbs at equal input amount) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4d</xref>). We found that for Umab and PGDM1400, having a single mAb present led to higher VDJ and CDRH3 coverage in most cases compared to samples with multiple mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e, f</xref>). However, h9C12 WT displayed higher sequence coverage in mixed mAb samples, likely due to the peptide alignment overlap with the mutant h9C12 Q97A, which shares all but one amino acid with the wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Similar results were observed for the LC sequence coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 21</xref>).

Quantifying specific peptides of mAbs within a polyclonal mixture using MS1 signal intensity would provide information about the relative abundance of clonotype peptides of interest in the serum antibody repertoire. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether the signal intensities of measured peptides can accurately estimate the corresponding quantities of the original mAbs, allowing the inference of the relative abundance of mAbs in samples, with the expected linear relationship of the two variables in log-log scale to have a slope of 1 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S28">Intensity ratio</xref> section in Methods). To this end, we considered peptide pairs with identical amino acid sequences that mapped to the same mAb, originated from a single experimental replicate, and received the same protease treatment, but differed in the mAb input amount. Furthermore, within each pair, both peptides either came from samples containing blood IgG background or from mAb-only samples to prevent blood IgG-derived peptides from affecting the peptide pairs unevenly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>). Additionally, h9C12 WT and h9C12 Q97A were excluded from this analysis because their nearly identical sequences would skew the MS1 signal intensity ratio on the peptide level, and peptides derived from the protease AspN were excluded due to their low number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 22</xref>). We confirmed the a priori feasibility of MS1 signal intensity to estimate protein input amount using standard BSA protein tryptic digest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p id="P35">For paired samples without blood IgG and equivalent mAb inputs (1:1 ratio), the median of signal intensity ratios conformed closely to the input ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). However, as the input differences increased (10:1 to 1000:1), the median signal intensity ratios deviated further from the input ratios, with the most drastic deviation occurring at 1000:1, where the median signal intensity ratios ranged 1.1–329.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). This result aligns with the findings from our preliminary experiment using standard BSA digest, where the median MS1 signal intensity ratio was also 342.8–368.5 at 1000:1 input ratios (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 2b</xref>). Of note, since the mAb input range in our study varies from 1 ng to 1000 ng, peptide pairs at the highest 1000:1 input ratio are only observed when the same peptide sequence is detected at both the 1 ng and 1000 ng levels. Given the low number of detected peptides at the 1 ng level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), this may introduce potential bias in the estimation of the signal intensities at the 1000:1 input ratio.</p><p id="P36">The signal intensity ratio bias also varied by mAb and protease in samples without blood IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). Specifically, for PGT121 and PGDM1400, there was a clear upward trend in signal intensity ratios corresponding to increasing input ratios, from 1:1 up to 1000:1. The regression lines for PGT121 had slopes ranging 0.22–0.95, while for PGDM1400, they ranged 0.25–1.1. For Umab, the regression lines showed slopes ranging 0.16–0.67, and for Brimab, the slopes ranged 0.16–1.1, with the 1.1 slope value largely due to the absence of two out of four mAb inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). Among the proteases, Tryp provided the most peptide pairs across different mAb input ratios, followed by Ct+Tryp, while Ct had several missing mAb input ratios, and AspN was excluded due to insufficient data points overall. Notably, at the highest contrast of 1000:1 input ratio, the median signal intensity ratios were predominantly well below 1000, and, in some cases, fell beneath those observed at 1:1 input ratios (0.9–1.5 for Brimab, 1.1–22 for Umab, 6.5–895.4 for PGT121, and 0.8–55.1 for PGDM1400).</p><p id="P37">A similar trend was observed in blood-containing samples, although with greater divergence from the anticipated MS1 signal intensity ratios, leading to regression line slopes with reduced values. PGT121, PGDM1400, and Umab regression lines had slopes ranging -0.25–1, -0.16–0.93, and -0.46–0.48, respectively. For Brimab in particular, the MS1 signal intensity ratios did not change even with increasing mAb input. This is evident from the consistent persistence of the median MS1 signal intensity ratios between 0.6 and 3.8, despite the rise in the mAb input ratio, with slopes ranging -0.0073–0.17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>) Similar results were observed for the MS1 signal intensity ratios of LC peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 23</xref>).

In contrast to all prior analyses done with Casanovo peptides which were based on mAb-related peptide, the entirety of the <italic>de novo</italic> peptides produced by Casanovo with prediction score ≥0.8 were used for Stitch-based template-based assembly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.

For Stitch assembly, we selected samples consisting of only one mAb (samples 36–47), which comprise three out of six mAbs (PGDM1400, Umab, and h9C12 WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 30</xref>). This is done because in polyclonal mixtures, reconstructing the CDR3 sequence would be especially difficult for Stitch, since it is mostly designed for monoclonal samples. Additionally, the results would require extensive manual fine-tuning and validation. The fidelity of the assembled sequence was observed to be heavily reliant on the sequence coverage in most cases. The Stitch-assembled VDJ sequences exhibited sequence identities of 64.8%, 88.2%, and 61.6% to the reference sequences for h9C12 WT, Umab, and PGDM1400, respectively. Discrepancies between the assembled sequences and the reference for h9C12 WT and PGDM1400 were found at positions where Casanovo peptides also lacked coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 25</xref>). However, this association did not hold for Umab, as despite having coverage gaps in the VDJ region (primarily from position 39–59), the assembled sequence still maintained a high sequence identity to the reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 25</xref>). This may be owed to the fact that Stitch predicted the V and J genes in agreement with IMGT’s gene assignments for Umab (IMGT-defined/Stitch-predicted: IGHV5-51/IGHV5-51 &amp; IGHJ4/IGHJ4), while being incorrect for h9C12 WT (IMGT-defined/Stitch-predicted: IGHV3-33/IGHV4-31 &amp; IGHJ1/IGHJ4) and PGDM1400 (IMGT-defined/Stitch-predicted: IGHV1-2/IGHV1-18 &amp; IGHJ1/IGHJ5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 30</xref>).</p><p id="P41">For the CDRH3 region, which rarely resembles its germline configuration, Stitch relied on overlapping peptides with residues that start or end outside the CDRH3. Consequently, peptides entirely within the CDRH3, which are crucial for high CDRH3 sequence coverage, are difficult to utilize for Stitch assembly, posing challenges for long CDRH3 sequences such as those found in PGDM1400 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). This reliance led to numerous gaps and errors in the Stitch-assembled CDRH3 sequence, such as the starting 3 residues in h9C12 WT CDRH3 where Casanovo had a coverage gap, or the missing residues in Umab (2 aa) and PGDM1400 (18 aa) CDRH3 despite high sequence coverage due to peptides being fully within the CDRH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 25</xref>). In contrast, on the LC, where the task of template-based assembly is comparatively easier due to the lack of the highly variable D gene, the sequence identity between the assembly and the reference was comparatively higher, with sequence identity for h9C12 WT, Umab, and PGDM1400 being 67.0%, 92.5%, and 96.4%, respectively, the assembled sequences had fewer errors in the CDRL3 sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 30</xref>). Nonetheless, Stitch demonstrated commendable accuracy in sequence assembly, especially considering it was performed without prior knowledge of the mAb sequences.</p><p id="P42">In conclusion, <italic>de novo</italic> sequencing tools such as Casanovo are as yet insufficient for achieving comprehensive antibody sequence coverage, as evidenced by its inferior performance in comparison to PSM tools.

Nonetheless, a discernible difference emerged in the propensity for false positives, where MSFragger exhibited a higher rate of false positive peptides than MaxQuant. This effect was more pronounced or V(D)J peptides and less for CDR3 peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>), suggesting that the filtering criteria in each software suite influence the accuracy of peptide identification. This potential divergence between the software platforms emphasizes the necessity of stringent validation measures, such as filtering for false positives, contaminants, and common peptide sequences among the six mAbs when interpreting Ab-seq data. Consequently, further development of antibody-focused mass spectrometry software tools, along with concerted community efforts to measure and benchmark their performance, is crucial to advancing the accuracy and reliability of Ab-seq.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Observed technological limitations of Ab-seq</title><p id="P47">In our study, the LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using an Evosep One liquid chromatography system connected to a high-resolution quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Given that our benchmarking study included 3360 MS/MS samples, using a standard nano-LC would have been time-consuming and impractical, typically allowing for a throughput of only 14–20 samples per day. In addition, the small microscopic diameter of the nano-LC columns makes them prone to clogs and breakage, which would severely disrupt the workflow. Meanwhile, the Evosep One system is both robust and high throughput – tested in this study with up to 100 samples per day (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), and was thus the LC instrument of choice for our experiments. However, this setup, combined with the stochastic nature of peptide precursor selection in data-dependent acquisition (DDA), raises inherent challenges in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. While this technique holds substantial analytical power, it is nonetheless constrained by the propensity for multiple peptide species to co-elute within a single MS1 scan. When a multitude of peptides are present, DDA inherently favors the most abundant peaks for MS2, leading to a systematic under-representation of low-abundance peptides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. As a result, divergent fragmentation subgroups across different samples are created and introduces significant variability between replicates, particularly evident through the diminished identification of low abundant peptides and, consequently, incorrect quantification of peptides in complex mixtures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Such variability underscores the limitations of reliance on DDA for comprehensive proteomic profiling, highlighting the necessity for advanced analytical strategies to enhance peptide detection, particularly for those of lower abundance in a complex mixture. In response to these shortcomings, employing methods capable of diminishing the effects of stochastic precursor selection and interference susceptibility such as data-independent acquisition (DIA) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>, coupled with DIA-compatible software tools <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref></sup>, may be important for achieving a more complete and reproducible capture of the secreted antibody repertoire in future studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Antibody peptide discovery is protease and Ab-dependent</title><p id="P48">The characterization of antibody peptide sequences using Ab-seq was found to be markedly influenced by both the specificity of protease cleavage and the intrinsic properties of the antibodies themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). For example, PGT121 failed to achieve complete coverage even when peptides from all proteases were pooled, despite substantial mAb inputs of 1000 ng (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>), diverging from the <italic>in silico</italic> predicted digestion of the mAb sequences based on the reported protease specificities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 14</xref>). This attests to a dependency not only on input amount but also on the inherent sequence characteristics of each mAb. To enhance sequence detection, particularly within the highly variable CDR3, the strategic use of specific proteases is crucial — AspN, for instance. Although its standalone performance may not be remarkable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c,d</xref>), AspN proved indispensable for achieving in-depth CDRH3 profiling when used in conjunction with other proteases. Similar recommendations have been made in prior studies advocating for the tandem use of AspN with other proteases for increased coverage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup>. Therefore, protease diversity is a key determinant for coverage enhancement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P49">Protease specificities for peptide generation were also found to be of considerable importance. Specifically, allowing for controlled miscleavages through the concurrent use of chymotrypsin and trypsin — specifically with a shortened chymotrypsin digestion phase — resulted in superior overall coverage compared to using either protease individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d</xref>). This suggests that complementary tandem protease digestion could potentially unlock more complete peptide sequences, an approach also being explored in other studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref></sup>.

While incorrect peptide identification can be mitigated by adjusting the false discovery rate, shared peptides between antibodies, particularly those derived from homologous non-CDR3 regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>), should be reassigned to the correct antibody or removed as false positives during the preprocessing steps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 9e</xref>). In addition, carryover contamination from liquid chromatography effluent can be a serious problem when multiple samples are run sequentially. However, this biological contamination can be mitigated by designing LC/MS-MS experiments where blank run cycles are interspersed after true sample runs. This approach not only helps elute any remaining antibodies from the previous run, but also by using the peptides detected in the effluent of blank cycles to filter out detectable carryover contamination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 9e</xref>).</p><p id="P51">The benchmarking nature of our study allowed us to further filter out false positive peptides, since the sequence of each mAb of interest was known beforehand. In a real-world Ab-seq study, however, the Ab sequence content of each sample is usually unknown, making the peptide preprocessing challenging. Without knowing which antibodies should be present in each sample, it is impossible to determine false positive peptides and further filter shared peptides between different antibodies. In specific cases where particular clonotypes of interest are tracked, prior knowledge of these clonotype sequences can serve as a reference, enabling filtration of false positive peptides for tracked clones. While this type of false positive filtration is typically limited, blank cleaning cycles can still help to reduce carry-over peptides in a real-world Ab-seq study, especially if cleaning cycles are performed after each true sample run.</p><p id="P52">In the context of our benchmarking study, blood-derived polyclonal IgG has been identified as a major deteriorating factor in sequence coverage performance. Not only does it artificially inflate V(D)J sequence coverage for certain mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4b</xref>) — likely a consequence of shared framework region sequences with spiked-in mAbs—but it also diminishes the level of CDR3 coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref>). Furthermore, the interference of blood IgGs has manifested in the diminished detection of CDR3 peptides at lower input amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), an outcome attributable to spectral signal interference discussed in previous sections. Even in the absence of blood IgG components, the detection of CDR3 in samples containing a mixture of six mAbs presented lower coverage compared to individual mAb samples — albeit this reduction was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e</xref>).

The challenge in deducing relative antibody abundances at high input ratios, like 1000:1, is exacerbated by both scarcity of data points at 1 ng (10 ng/ml), due to the limit of quantitation of LC-MS/MS (established at 15 ng/ml in previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref></sup>.

To the four plates 0.5 µg trypsin (Tryp), 0.5 µg chymotrypsin (Ct), 0.5 µg AspN, and a combination of 0.5 µg chymotrypsin and 0.5 µg trypsin (Ct+Tryp) per well was added, respectively. Plates with trypsin, chymotrypsin and AspN were incubated at 37 °C for 18 hours, and the Ct+Tryp treated plate was first incubated with chymotrypsin for 4 hours before trypsin was added for the 18-hour incubation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>).</p><p id="P72">After the incubation, each sample was transferred to Evotips (Evosep) in triplicates for desalting prior to the LC-MS/MS analysis.

For liquid chromatography separation, an 8 cm C18 column (Dr Maisch C18 AQ, 3 μm beads, 100um ID, 8 cm long, Evosep) was used. The standard 100 samples/day method was used. One blank sample run were performed between each numbered sample, and three blank sample runs were performed between samples of different mAb spike-ins with 1000 ng input to reduce carry over contamination, and the peptide data obtained from the blank samples was utilized to remove contaminant peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>).</p><p id="P74">The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode to automatically switch between MS and MS/MS acquisition. Survey full scan MS spectra (from m/z 375 to 1,500) were acquired in the Orbitrap with resolution R = 60,000 at m/z 200 (after accumulation to a target of 3,000,000 ions in the quadruple). The method used allowed sequential isolation of the most intense multiply-charged ions, up to twelve, depending on signal intensity, for fragmentation on the HCD cell using high-energy collision dissociation at a target value of 100,000 charges or maximum acquisition time of 50 ms. MS/MS scans were collected at 30,000 resolution at the Orbitrap cell. Target ions already selected for MS/MS were dynamically excluded for 30 seconds. General mass spectrometry conditions were: electrospray voltage, 2.0 kV; no sheath and auxiliary gas flow, heated capillary temperature of 250 °C, normalized HCD collision energy 28%.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Proteomics software analysis</title><p id="P75">We applied three freely available proteomics software tools to MS raw data — two PSM tools for peptide identification and quantification, MaxQuant <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> and MSFragger <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>, and a reference free (<italic>de novo</italic>) tool for peptide sequencing, Casanovo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.

For replicates produced with trypsin, predictions were made with a model trained on 28 million tryptic PSMs. For non-tryptic replicates, predictions were made with a non-enzymatic model fine-tuned on a dataset of 1M PSMs with uniform distributions of terminal amino acids. All predictions were made using a beam size of 5. An additional post-processing step was applied to Casanovo output peptides, where post-translational modifications (PTMs) were removed from the peptide sequences and after that the identical peptides within each sample and technical replicates were merged. The prediction score of each merged peptide was assigned as the maximum score among all the merged peptides. Finally, peptides with prediction score below 0.8 were eliminated.

Initially, peptide sequences from four experimental replicates and three technical replicates were merged, including Casanovo-predicted peptides, which were further processed as detailed in the “Proteomics Software Analysis” section. All identified peptides were aligned to the six mAb reference sequences, both HC and LC. Peptides that did not align to either the HC or LC sequences of the mAbs were deemed non-mAb peptides and excluded from further analysis. Peptides were considered mAb-related if they matched the reference HC or LC sequences with 100% accuracy or if they overlapped by at least 5 AAs at the beginning or end of HC or LC sequences. CDR3-related peptides were defined as mAb-related peptides overlapping by at least 3 AA within the CDR3 region.</p><p id="P80">All mAb-related peptides were categorized as either false positives (FP) or true positives (TP). A peptide was considered a false positive if it mapped to an mAb not present in the sample by design, and a true positive otherwise. False positive peptides were further filtered based on the following criteria: (i) FP peptides present in samples with blood IgG and aligning to the V, D, or J segments in the IMGT database, or (ii) FP peptides corresponding to multiple mAb, where one mAb is present in the sample design and the other is not present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), or (iii) FP peptides detected during previous cleaning cycles (blank sample runs) interspersed between true sample runs. Only peptides that passed all filtering steps were retained for downstream analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref> shows results for both TP and FP peptides, whereas <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> display only TP peptide results to minimize potential bias from FP peptides.

The resulting set of peptides with length of at least 6 aa were then compared with preprocessed peptides derived from experimental data.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Ab-seq coverage</title><p id="P82">Ab-seq coverage is calculated as the sum of amino acid positions covered by Ab-seq peptides divided by the length of the reference sequence (either the V(D)J region or the CDR3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>). We used Ab-seq sequence coverage and not Ab-seq peptide count as a measure of Ab-seq performance because our focus in this work was on measuring the extent of the recovery of mAb V(D)J sequences. As visualized on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 12</xref>, distinct peptides can cover the same mAb positions and, therefore, meaning that the number of unique peptides may not accurately reflect the true extent of V(D)J sequence recovery. Consequently, an increasing Ab-seq peptide count may not lead to higher recovery of the antibody V(D)J sequence.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Intensity ratio</title><p id="P83">To calculate the MS1 intensity ratio, we selected pairs of peptides aligning to the same mAb with identical amino acid sequences from different MS samples within the same experimental replicate, which were digested using the same protease treatment and were identified using the same tool — either MaxQuant or MSFragger. Additionally, within each pair, both peptides belonged to either blood-containing samples or mAbs-only samples. We did not restrict the peptides to contain the same modification, as most peptides were unmodified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 22</xref>).</p><p id="P84">The intensity ratio for each peptide pair was calculated as the ratio between the MS1 intensity of a peptide (as reported from the output of MaxQuant and MSFragger) from a sample with higher mAb input and that from a sample with lower mAb concentration. In this case, the true concentration ratio will correspond to 1:1, 10:1, 100:1, or 1000:1 input ratios. We excluded h9C12 WT and h9C12 Q97A from the intensity ratio analysis because they co-occurred in most samples and the intensity of peptides not covering position Q97A will sum up from both antibodies, thereby distorting the expected 1:1, 10:1, 100:1, 1000:1 input ratios. Peptides cleaved by AspN were also excluded due to their low abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 22</xref>).</p><p id="P85">For each mAb, protease treatment, and experimental replicate, we calculated the median of log10-transformed intensity ratio within each concentration ratio subgroup (1:1, 10:1, 100:1, 1000:1). To assess how accurately the intensity ratio estimates the concentration ratio, we performed a weighted linear regression using the four log10-transformed MS1 signal intensity ratio medians and the four log10-transformed mAb input amounts, the regression formula is calculated as log(y) = intercept + slope*log(x). The weights of the regression were determined by the number of data points used to calculate each median. If the MS1 signal intensity ratios were perfectly concordant with the mAb input ratios, the regression line would have a slope of 1 and intercept of 0.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Template-based assembly of de novo peptides into V(D)J sequence</title><p id="P86">Only samples with one mAb present and no blood IgG background (samples 36–47) were utilized for assembly with Stitch version 1.5, which was run in monoclonal mode <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. All Casanovo peptides with prediction score ≥0.8 were used as input for Stitch. Template-matching of peptides using mass-based alignments utilized the IMGT database internal to Stitch, with cut-off score 15 (mean segment score per position needed for a path to be included), enforce unique threshold 0.9, and ambiguity threshold 0.9. Assembly of aligned peptides into V(D)J sequence utilized the highest scoring V, (D), and J gene segments, with a cut-off score of 10 (mean score per position required for the gene segment to be included in the recombination).

Our study included 1120 MS samples (70 samples × 4 experimental replicates × 4 protease treatments) and 3360 LC-MS/MS runs (1120 MS samples × 3 technical replicates). The MS samples varied in terms of antibody input amount, antibody sequence similarity, protease treatments, and the presence of blood IgG background.
