While several distinct modes of cell elongation have been described, these studies have largely relied on a handful of model bacterial species. Therefore, we have a limited view of the diversity of cell elongation approaches that are employed by bacteria, and how these vary in response to evolutionary and environmental influences. Here, by employing fluorescent D-amino acids (FDAAs) to track the spatiotemporal dynamics of elongation, we reveal previously unsuspected diversity of elongation modes among closely related species of the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic>, with species-specific combinations of dispersed, midcell and polar elongation that can be either unidirectional or bidirectional. Using genetic, cell biology, and phylogenetic approaches, we demonstrate that evolution of unidirectional-midcell elongation is accompanied by changes in the localization pattern of the peptidoglycan synthase PBP2 and infer that elongation complexes display a high degree of phenotypic plasticity, both among the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic> and more widely among the Alphaproteobacteria. Demonstration that even closely related bacterial species employ highly distinct mechanisms of cell elongation reshapes our understanding of the evolution and regulation of bacterial cell growth, with broad implications for bacterial morphology, adaptation, and antibiotic resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Elongation modes</kwd><kwd>midcell elongation</kwd><kwd>Peptidoglycan</kwd><kwd>Caulobacteraceae</kwd><kwd>Caulobacter</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Cell elongation is a fundamental process in bacteria, underlying cell growth, morphogenesis and division. Mechanisms of cell elongation are strictly regulated but respond dynamically to developmental and environmental cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. For instance, spatiotemporal patterns of cell elongation are modulated over the cell cycle in many bacterial species. In others, nutrient starvation can trigger specialized modes of elongation, resulting in shape changes to improve nutrient uptake. Over the course of evolution, mechanisms of cell elongation have also diversified, as evidenced by the variety of cell shapes, life cycles and mechanisms of growth seen in bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">At the structural level, bacterial cell elongation is driven by the synthesis of the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall, a meshwork of glycan strands crosslinked by peptide chains that confers structural integrity to the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Synthesis of PG is essential to bacterial growth and division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> and is catalyzed by the penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) acting in concert with regulatory protein complexes called the elongasome (for cell elongation) and the divisome (for cell division). Although the PBPs, the elongasome and the divisome are widely conserved among bacteria, different species have been shown to employ distinct sets of proteins to assemble their elongasomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Such modularity and flexibility in the regulation of cell elongation at the molecular level may underlie the evolution and diversification of bacterial cell elongation mechanisms. Indeed, recent studies have found that disparate mechanisms of cell elongation can yield similar shapes: a rod-shaped cell can be generated by a dispersed, a lateral elongation mode, or by zonal elongation from one or both cell poles or the midcell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Conversely, the same elongation mode can generate different cell shapes: spherical, ovoid, rod, and crescent shapes can be generated by bidirectional elongation from the midcell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. However, our understanding of the diversity of elongation modes in bacteria is primarily based on a few distantly related model organisms, leading to the assumption that closely related species share the same elongation strategies. Consequently, the true diversity of bacterial cell elongation mechanisms may be greatly underappreciated, and our insights reveal little about the evolutionary mechanisms driving these differences.</p><p id="P6">To address this knowledge gap, our study explores how distinct elongation modes evolved within closely related, morphologically diverse bacterial species from the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic> family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Within this family, the well-studied model organism <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> uses bidirectional elongation from the midcell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). By studying its related species, we discover two novel elongation modes – unidirectional midcell elongation in the species <italic>Asticcacaulis excentricus</italic>, and polar plus unidirectional midcell elongation <italic>in Asticcacaulis biprosthecum</italic>. Using a multidisciplinary approach that integrates live-cell imaging with genetic and evolutionary analysis, we explore these elongation mechanisms. Our findings reveal that the evolution of these elongation strategies is associated with shifts in the spatial localization of a core elongasome enzyme. Specifically, we show that the penicillin binding protein PBP2, which localizes diffusely in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, concentrates at the midcell in <italic>A. excentricus</italic>, where it serves as the transpeptidase enzyme driving unidirectional PG synthesis. This highlights how the regulation of conserved elongasome machinery can vary even between closely related species, potentially aligning with broader evolutionary pressures. Extending our analysis beyond the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic>, we found that <italic>Rhodobacter capsulatus</italic> shares the unidirectional midcell elongation pattern seen in <italic>A. excentricus</italic>, and we further infer from the phylogeny of the Alphaproteobacteria that bacterial cell elongation mechanisms display far greater phenotypic plasticity than previously anticipated. Ultimately, these results challenge the notion that closely related species share the same elongation mode. Instead, they reveal an unexplored diversity in elongation mechanisms, as cells respond to evolutionary forces to generate diversity in growth modes even at close evolutionary scales.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>C. crescentus</italic> and <italic>A. excentricus</italic> have different patterns of PG synthesis</title><p id="P7">The order <italic>Caulobacterales</italic> exhibits at least three elongation modes – dispersed, polar and midcell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>, suggesting that it could be a good model for studying the evolution of cell elongation. The order comprises three families: the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic>, the <italic>Hyphomonadaceae</italic>, and the <italic>Maricaulaceae</italic>. The <italic>Hyphomonadaceae</italic> elongate polarly through budding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, but the elongation modes in the <italic>Maricaulaceae</italic> and the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic> are unknown, with the exception of the model organism <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, which predominantly grows through bidirectional midcell elongation, with some dispersed elongation during early stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To determine the elongation modes in other <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic>, we analyzed the genus <italic>Asticcacaulis</italic>, comparing <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and <italic>A. excentricus</italic> using pulse-chase experiments with fluorescent D-amino acids (FDAAs). FDAAs are fluorescent dyes that are incorporated into the PG by PG transpeptidases, serving as highly effective tools to observe the dynamics of cell growth in various colors (in this study, we use the dyes BADA, HADA and TADA, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. To track PG synthesis/turnover in real-time relative to the cell division site, we marked the division site in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> using ZapA-mCherry and in <italic>A. excentricus</italic> using ZapA-sfGFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and performed pulse-chase experiments using FDAAs with complementary fluorophores. Briefly, we labeled whole-cell PG with FDAA (the “pulse”) over two generations, washed the cells to remove free FDAA, and observed the cells during a period of growth in the absence of FDAA (the “chase”) by time-lapse microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). During the chase period, the loss of FDAA labeling reveals spatial patterns of new PG incorporation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">In dimorphic bacteria such as <italic>Asticcacaulis</italic> and <italic>Caulobacter</italic> species, the new pole generated by division gives rise to a motile swarmer cell, while the old pole forms the larger, non-motile stalked cell, reflecting the species’ characteristic asymmetric division. In <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, visualizing the retention and loss of the FDAA label throughout the cell cycle, we observed that the loss of FDAA labeling occurred from the division plane defined by ZapA-mCherry, and extended bidirectionally towards both cell poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). Conversely, in <italic>A. excentricus</italic>, the loss of FDAA labeling originated from the division plane but moved predominantly towards the new pole of the dividing cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). Later in the cell cycle, <italic>A. excentricus</italic> cells also began losing FDAA signal on the old pole side of the ZapA-sfGFP signal once constriction was initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>, <bold>white stars</bold>). This loss of FDAA signal on the old pole side of the division plane during constriction likely corresponds to PG synthesis during septation and cell division. Together, these data indicate that PG synthesis/turnover for cell elongation are spatially localized close to the future site of cell division in both <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and <italic>A. excentricus</italic>. Furthermore, they indicate a variation in PG synthesis/turnover dynamics in these two closely related species, in which <italic>C. crescentus</italic> elongates bidirectionally and <italic>A. excentricus</italic> towards the new pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b and 1e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>A. excentricus</italic> elongates unidirectionally from the midcell towards the new pole</title><p id="P10">To further investigate the position and directionality of PG synthesis during midcell elongation in <italic>A. excentricus</italic>, we conducted sequential short-pulse FDAA labeling experiments with differently colored FDAAs. This approach allows us to track active sites of PG synthesis in growing cells based on the spatial pattern of incorporation of the sequentially applied dyes over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. If the signal from the first FDAA (red) pulse appears on both sides of the second FDAA (green), PG incorporation can be inferred to occur bidirectionally, whereas if the first FDAA signal appears on one side of the second signal, it would indicate unidirectional elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P11">For these experiments, <italic>A. excentricus</italic> and <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells were first grown in the presence of one FDAA (shown in red) for 5% of their generation time, washed to remove excess dye, and then subjected to a second pulse with a different FDAA (shown in green) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, the first, red FDAA signal appeared on both sides of the second, green signal, which was approximately located at the midcell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). To analyse these patterns quantitatively, we generated demographs, which are graphical summaries of fluorescence intensities, where cells are sorted by length along the y-axis, and aligned at the center by their midcell as a proxy for cell cycle progression. Demograph analysis of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells confirmed that their first FDAA signal was located on both sides of the second signal in all but the shortest (i.e. most newly divided) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> <bold>bottom-left</bold> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). For further quantification, the fluorescence intensities of the FDAAs were normalized and plotted against their relative positions along the cell length for a subset of cells, from roughly the middle of their cell cycles. As in the demograph, the red signal appeared on both sides of the green signal, confirming bidirectional midcell elongation in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref> <bold>bottom-right</bold>).</p><p id="P12">Contrastingly, in <italic>A. excentricus</italic>, the first, red FDAA signal appeared only on one side of the midcell region, whereas the second, green signal appeared at the midcell region, demonstrating unidirectional PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 2b</xref>). To determine whether the unidirectional midcell elongation observed in <italic>A. excentricus</italic> consistently proceeds towards the new pole, we conducted dual short-pulse FDAA labeling experiments in <italic>A. excentricus</italic> cells in which the old poles were marked. For this, we utilized the dimorphic cell cycle of this species, which features regulated changes in morphology and surface adhesion within the context of the cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Specifically, cells produce a holdfast polysaccharide adhesin at the old pole during cell cycle progression, which can be used as an old-pole marker through labeling with fluorescent wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectin. Dual short-pulse FDAA labeling in <italic>A. excentricus</italic> cells with WGA-labeled holdfasts showed that the first FDAA signal was always on the new-pole side of the second FDAA signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). These results demonstrate that <italic>C. crescentus</italic> has a bidirectional midcell elongation mode while <italic>A. excentricus</italic> has a unidirectional midcell elongation mode in which PG synthesis proceeds towards the new pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The <italic>A. excentricus</italic> class B PG synthase PBP2 localizes to sites of new PG synthesis</title><p id="P13">To understand the evolutionary origins of unidirectional midcell elongation in <italic>A. excentricus</italic>, we investigated the potential molecular determinants driving this novel elongation mode. Bioinformatic analysis using <italic>C. crescentus</italic> PBP2 and PBP1a as queries revealed a limited repertoire of PG synthases in <italic>A. excentricus</italic>: three class A PBPs, including two homologues of PBP1a (Astex_2378 and Astex_2994) and one homologue of PBP1c (Astex_0196); and two monofunctional class B PBPs – PBP2 and PBP3 (FtsI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). This limited repertoire of PBPs in <italic>A. excentricus</italic>, and the conserved neighborhood architecture of the cell elongation loci in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and <italic>A. excentricus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>) suggested that the same canonical elongasome proteins may have evolved to generate different modes of elongation in the two species. Therefore, we hypothesized that localization of PBP2, an essential component of the elongasome, may play a role in the evolution of these different elongation modes.</p><p id="P14">To investigate the role of PBP2 in midcell elongation, we utilized fluorescent protein fusions to track its subcellular localization. We fused PBP2 to mCherry at its native locus in <italic>A. excentricus</italic> and performed fluorescence microscopy (See Extended Text for validation of the mCherry-PBP2 fusion). Across the population, PBP2 exhibited a patchy localization with enrichment near the midcell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Quantifying its localization in a large number of cells in a demograph, or using a population-wide heatmap of subcellular PBP2 localization using the holdfast as a polar marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>), we found that PBP2 accumulates close to the midcell offset towards the new pole, which is similar to the location of new PG synthesis. To further analyze whether PG synthesis at the midcell coincides with PBP2 localization, we labeled <italic>A. excentricus</italic> cells expressing mCherry-PBP2 with a short pulse of FDAA. Fluorescence microscopy and quantification using a population-wide heatmap and density map of the maximal fluorescence intensities of the mCherry-PBP2 and FDAA signals showed that the FDAA signal overlapped with the mCherry-PBP2 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4a-b</xref>). Together, these data indicate that PBP2 localization correlates with sites of PG synthesis during unidirectional midcell elongation in <italic>A. excentricus</italic>.</p><p id="P15">To further probe the link of PBP2’s distinct localization in <italic>A. excentricus</italic> to its novel mode of cell elongation, we investigated PBP2 localization in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, which exhibits bidirectional elongation from the midcell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Using a GFP fusion to PBP2 at its native locus in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, we observed that GFP-PBP2 displayed a dispersed distribution throughout the cell cycle in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, and distinct from PBP2 localization in <italic>A. excentricus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Fig. 4c-d</xref>). To determine whether PBP2 colocalizes with sites of PG synthesis in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, we performed short-pulse FDAA labeling in cells expressing GFP-PBP2. Fluorescence microscopy and population-level quantification of cells in a demograph revealed that, unlike in <italic>A. excentricus</italic>, <italic>C. crescentus</italic> PBP2 did not show significant enrichment at the midcell, and the FDAA labeling did not overlap with the GFP-PBP2 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). This difference in the localization patterns of PBP2 in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and <italic>A. excentricus</italic> suggests that the relocalization of PBP2 may be a critical evolutionary step in the divergence of the elongation modes between these two species.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>PBP2 activity is required for unidirectional elongation at the midcell in <italic>A. excentricus</italic></title><p id="P16">To understand the functional role of the essential protein PBP2 in the unidirectional midcell elongation of <italic>A. excentricus</italic>, we utilized the β-lactam antibiotic mecillinam, a specific inhibitor of PBP2 transpeptidase activity in <italic>E. coli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup></italic>. In <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, mecillinam causes cell bulging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, likely through its inhibition of PBP2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). To determine the target of mecillinam in <italic>A. excentricus</italic>, we conducted competition assays with the β-lactam Bocillin FL, a fluorescent penicillin that covalently binds all PBPs. Using Bocillin gel analysis, we found that mecillinam predominantly inhibited binding of Bocillin to PBP2, even at high concentrations (100 μg ml<sup>-1</sup>), while other PBPs in <italic>A. excentricus</italic> were only partially affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>).

We labeled whole-cell PG with FDAA over two generations without mecillinam, followed by a wash to remove excess FDAA, and a chase period with or without mecillinam for 120 min. In untreated cells, we found robust FDAA signal loss on the new pole side of the ZapA-sfGFP signal, consistent with unidirectional elongation at the midcell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <bold>left</bold>). In contrast, FDAA signal loss in mecillinam-treated cells was observed in bulges on the new pole side of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>, <bold>right</bold>). To quantify the FDAA signal loss and cell bulging upon mecillinam treatment, we measured the subcellular localization of these bulges in relation to the fluorescence signals of ZapA and FDAA in a population-wide analysis. We plotted these features relative to the cell center, generating ShapePlots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> for the whole population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <bold>right panels</bold>), as well as for four categories binned by cell length. Bulging was detected consistently on the new pole side of the midcell across all four categories, with its position shifting closer to midcell as cells progressed through the cell cycle and approached division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <bold>left panels</bold>). These analyses confirmed that bulging occurred primarily on the new pole side of the midcell in <italic>A. excentricus</italic>, i.e. at the site of midcell elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <bold>top panels</bold>). Furthermore, loss of FDAA signal peaked at this site, suggesting that the bulging may be a result of abnormal PG synthesis at the midcell when PBP2 is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>, <bold>bottom panels</bold>).

This observation suggests that <italic>A. biprosthecum</italic> elongates through yet another novel mode – a combination of polar elongation and unidirectional midcell elongation. To further analyze this mode of cell elongation, we sequentially added differently colored FDAAs during short pulses (5% of a generation time, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Demograph and fluorescence profile analyses revealed that the second, green FDAA signal was present at both the pole and the midcell, while the first, red signal was located mainly at the pole.

In parallel, there has been an assumption that closely related species share similar elongation mechanisms, hampering the study of divergence at shorter evolutionary scales. In this study, we challenge this assumption by revealing significant differences in the elongation strategies of closely related species within the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic> family. Our findings indicate that evolutionary changes in cell elongation can occur more frequently and at shorter evolutionary timescales than previously thought, opening new avenues for research into the evolution of bacterial growth and morphogenesis.</p><p id="P24">Among the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic>, the diversity and novelty of elongation modes we observe - ranging from bidirectional midcell elongation in <italic>C. crescentus, C. henricii and B. diminuta</italic>, to the newly described unidirectional midcell elongation in <italic>A. excentricus</italic> and <italic>P. conjunctum</italic> as well as the combination of polar and unidirectional midcell elongation in <italic>A. biprosthecum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), indicate remarkable evolutionary flexibility. They suggest a capacity for closely related species to adapt their elongation mechanisms, possibly in response to evolutionary pressures such as nutrient availability, morphological constraints, competition, predation, etc. It is already known that bacteria can regulate their elongation patterns in response to environmental changes. For instance, <italic>Streptomyces</italic> cells can shift their elongation mechanisms in response to metabolic cues, allowing exploratory growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> encodes two differentially regulated elongasomes, one of which is specialized for pathogenesis, functioning under acidic, intracellular conditions, with slower PG synthesis that may help coordinate cell elongation with host metabolism (although the spatial pattern of elongation remains the same)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Many other bacterial species suppress the highly conserved divisome, using only elongation to produce a filamentous morphology to overcome a range of environmental constraints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Finally, within the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic>, stalk elongation is a well-known response to nutrient limitation, although this specialized mode of PG synthesis at the stalk site is independent of the core elongasome that drives vegetative growth in the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. It would be intriguing to explore whether <italic>A. excentricus</italic> and related species similarly adjust their core elongation modes in response to environmental conditions. Future studies on this topic may shed light on the selective pressures that have led to the divergent elongation modes among the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic>.</p><p id="P25">The plasticity of cell elongation strategies is evident not only under different environmental conditions, but even within a single cell under different regulatory states. For instance, among the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic>, the transition from dispersed elongation in the swarmer cell to localized cell elongation at the midcell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) demonstrates how elongasome components may be modulated by the cell cycle. Even in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which predominantly grows through dispersed elongation along its lateral walls, the elongasome-specific PG synthase PBP2 shows a cell-cycle dependent enrichment at the midcell prior to division, coinciding with a burst of midcell elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Gram-positive coccoid bacteria such as <italic>S. aureus</italic> offer yet another example of the flexibility of the PG synthesis machinery, which functions both peripherally and for septal sidewall synthesis in these bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. These observations underscore that elongation modes are not static in cells, but rather dynamically adaptable through regulatory networks controlling cell growth. Evolutionary forces may drive changes in bacterial elongation by modulating existing molecular mechanisms rather than by introducing new ones.</p><p id="P26">In this study, we provide evidence of novel cell elongation modes beyond the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Indeed, we discovered that <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> demonstrates unidirectional midcell elongation similar to <italic>A. excentricus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f-h</xref>). To understand the evolutionary context of this surprising discovery, we searched the literature for previous reports of elongation modes among the <italic>Rhodobacterales</italic> and found that <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> demonstrates bidirectional midcell elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, in another branch of the Alphaproteobacteria, the loss of the key elongation proteins MreB and PBP2 among members of the <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> has coincided with the evolution of polar elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>), further emphasizing the evolutionary plasticity of bacterial elongation systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, the conservation of elongasome clusters such as <italic>pbp2/rodA</italic> across species with different elongation modes such as <italic>E. coli, C. crescentus</italic>, and <italic>A. excentricus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>), suggests that evolutionary changes in elongation modes stem not only from changes in gene content, but also from differences in the regulation, localization or activity of these conserved proteins.</p><p id="P27">Here, in characterizing the molecular determinants of unidirectional midcell elongation in <italic>A. excentricus</italic>, we discovered that the PG synthase PBP2 is central to the regulation of this elongation strategy. In contrast to its dispersed localization in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, PBP2 in <italic>A. excentricus</italic> concentrates at the midcell, and is required for unidirectional PG synthesis. Upon inhibition of PBP2, cells exhibit abnormal PG synthesis leading to bulging at the midcell elongation site. These results suggest that changes in the specific localization of key enzymes such as PBP2 may be associated with the evolution of distinct cell elongation strategies, enabling bacteria to respond to broader pressures acting on morphology and growth. Notably, in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, PBP2 shifts to the midcell under osmotic stress, illustrating that its localization is subject to regulation both by environmental cues and evolutionary processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">Beyond PBP2, other proteins like FtsZ play versatile roles in regulating localized PG synthesis across bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.

Another interesting example is the conserved outer membrane lipoprotein PapS, which in <italic>Rhodospirillum rubrum</italic> forms molecular cages that confine elongasomes to induce asymmetric cell elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. The diversity of mechanisms by which bacteria spatially regulate growth using conserved proteins supports the idea that evolution likely acts by altering the function of existing proteins rather than by introducing new genes.

Why do some species like <italic>A. excentricus</italic> evolve unidirectional elongation, while others maintain dispersed, bidirectional or polar growth mechanisms? What evolutionary factors drive these changes? It is clear that midcell and polar elongation are widely distributed in the Alphaproteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>), suggesting that localized modes of elongation may be ancestral within this class. However, the distribution of elongation modes in our phylogenetic analysis of the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c-d</xref>) suggests that their evolution is likely shaped by multiple, independent events, implying a high degree of phenotypic plasticity in the regulation of localized elongation modes. In particular, the midcell, directional elongation identified in the current study is observed in <italic>Asticcacaulis</italic> and <italic>Phenylobacterium</italic>, but absent in members of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> and <italic>Brevundimonas</italic>, indicating that this growth mode has been gained and/or lost at least twice among the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). In light of this observed phenotypic diversity, it is intriguing to consider whether localized elongation itself may be a broadly adaptive strategy that bacteria have evolved, allowing greater plasticity under changing evolutionary pressures than dispersed elongation (although these co-exist in many species). Deeper understanding of the diversity of elongation modes among other branches of bacteria should provide further insights into the prevalence and ancestry of localized, dispersed, and septal modes of elongation, helping to identify selective pressures that shape the evolution of growth mode strategies.</p><p id="P30">Additionally, the evolution of distinct elongation modes has implications for the evolution of bacterial morphology. <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, <italic>A. excentricus</italic>, and <italic>A. biprosthecum</italic> display striking morphological differences, especially in the positioning of their stalks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. This raises the possibility that their distinct elongation modes and stalk positioning mechanisms may have co-evolved. In all three species, the site of stalk synthesis corresponds to the region of the oldest PG in the swarmer cell, as it differentiates into a stalked cell. Could the elongation mechanisms of these species thus be driving the placement of their cellular structures? If future studies find this to be true, it would suggest that elongation modes and cellular morphologies are intricately linked, with changes and selective pressures on one likely to influence the other over evolutionary time.</p><p id="P31">In summary, the fundamental finding of this study is that bacterial elongation modes are more diverse than previously thought, even at relatively short evolutionary scales. This challenges the assumption that closely related species share similar elongation modes – an assumption that has prevailed largely because we have not had the right tools to explore the diversity of bacterial elongation modes, even at close evolutionary distances from well-studied model organisms. Combining spatiotemporal analyses of PG synthesis using FDAAs alongside genetic and evolutionary approaches now allows a reexamination of previous assumptions about cell elongation modes across bacterial clades. Consequently, we expect these results to be at the forefront of a paradigm shift in our understanding of the diversity of bacterial cell elongation, its regulation and evolution.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p id="P32">All bacterial strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>. <italic>C. crescentus, B. diminuta</italic>, and <italic>C. henricii were grown at</italic> 30°C in Peptone Yeast Extract (PYE) medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. <italic>A. excentricus</italic>, <italic>A. biprosthecum</italic> and <italic>P. conjunctum</italic> were grown at 26°C in PYE. <italic>R. capsulatus</italic> SB1003 cells were grown at 30°C in PYS (3 g l<sup>−1</sup> peptone, 3 g l<sup>−1</sup>yeast extract, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>.

To quantitatively analyze the pattern of FDAA loss in pulse-chase experiments, or of FDAA incorporation during dual short-pulse experiments, we generated kymographs and/or demographs using the MicrobeJ results interface. In these demographs, each cell is oriented such that the pole with the maximum mean fluorescence is set to the left and cells are aligned at the midcell. Alternatively, where holdfast staining was used, the holdfast signal (old pole) was set to the right. All cells were aligned at the midcell. Using the MicrobeJ demograph tool, 50% of the maximum intensity of each pulse was displayed in the main figures, while the total fluorescence signals are presented in the extended data.

Localization of the bulge was determined using the “feature” option of MicrobeJ. Instead of looking for constriction, we looked for bulging, using the option “inverted” in the feature parameters interface. Using the subcellular localization charts function of the MicrobeJ results interface, we plotted bulge distribution relative to the cell center and generated a ShapePlot based on cell length to localize ZapA fluorescence intensity and FDAA signal loss as a readout for PG synthesis.
