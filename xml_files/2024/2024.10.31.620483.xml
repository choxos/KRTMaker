However, existing protocols often lack confidence in identifying the transcription start site (TSS) and fail to capture non-poly(A) RNA, thereby limiting the discovery of novel genes, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). In this study, we introduce Cap-trap full-length cDNA sequencing (CFC-seq), a comprehensive protocol that combines Cap-trapping and poly(A)-tailing with Oxford Nanopore sequencing. This protocol enables precise identification of TSSs and full-length transcripts. Applying CFC-seq to two <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation time courses resulted in approximately 236 million mappable reads. The transcript Start-site Aware Long-read Assembler (SALA) was developed for <italic>de novo</italic> assembling the transcript models, leading to the identification of 39,425 confident novel genes. Using this dataset, enhancer-derived ncRNAs were re-defined with longer length and more splicing activity, which were correlated with enhancer structure. Compared to enhancers with CpG islands, TATA box enhancers were shown to be more cell type specific with fewer chromatin interaction but produced longer and more stable polyadenylated RNA. A significant proportion of these TATA box-derived eRNAs originated from LTR transposable elements. Overall, this study systematically annotated ~24,000 novel eRNA genes and correlated their transcription properties with enhancer structure.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Long-read sequencing</kwd><kwd>Transcription start site</kwd><kwd>enhancer</kwd><kwd>lncRNA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In the human genome, pervasive transcription results in primary transcripts covering 75% of the genome, yet only 2% contributes to protein coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Djebali et al. 2012</xref>). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are the major product of such pervasive transcription. In contrast to ~20,000 protein coding genes, at least 95,000 lncRNA genes have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Li et al. 2023</xref>). Notably, the transcript models of these lncRNAs are mainly constructed by assembling short-read RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Iyer et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">You et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Hon et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Jiang et al. 2019</xref>). The application of long-read sequencing has proven invaluable in accurately delineating the transcripts of lncRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Lagarde et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Carbonell Sala et al. 2021</xref>). Various long-read protocols have been established to discover novel transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Garalde et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Sharon et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Pardo-Palacios et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Glinos et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Uapinyoying et al. 2020</xref>). These studies primarily focused on identifying novel isoforms from the annotated gene loci instead of novel genes. Indeed, evidence of independent transcription revealed by CAP-trap protocol provides extra confidence in novel gene identification. Unlike protein coding genes, lncRNAs are usually lowly-expressed and often transcribed from the body of another gene. Detection of an accurate transcription start site (TSS) from the long-read sequencing is important to distinguish them from the genes in the same loci and confirm their independent transcription. Additionally, substantial lncRNA candidates are often excluded from standard long-read protocols which adopt poly-dT priming, due to their lack of a poly(A) tail. Therefore, a tailored protocol of long-read sequencing for lncRNAs is needed to comprehensively annotate them in the human genome.</p><p id="P3">From the approximately one million <italic>cis</italic> regulatory elements (CREs) predicted from the human genome (The ENCODE Project Consortium et al. 2020), more than 95% of them were enhancer-like. This suggested that enhancer-derived lncRNAs (eRNAs) represent the majority of lncRNAs. While the activity of enhancers is well-investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Field and Adelman 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Claringbould and Zaugg 2021</xref>), non-negligible functional roles of eRNAs have also been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Arner et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Alvarez-Dominguez et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aguilo et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Nair et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Gorbovytska et al. 2022</xref>). In order to facilitate the functional studies on the RNA derived from enhancers, defining their gene and transcript models is necessary. Genome wide identification of enhancers or CREs is multifaceted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Panigrahi and O’Malley 2021</xref>), approaches relying on chromatin state such as H3K27Ac and/or H3K4me1 (The ENCODE Project Consortium et al. 2020), chromatin accessibility showed by DNase or ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Zhang et al. 2021</xref>) and the act of transcription revealed by 5’ end sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Arner et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hirabayashi et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Kristjánsdóttir et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Moody et al. 2022</xref>) are applied independently or integratively. When identifying enhancers by their acts of transcription, it is essential to distinguish the genuine TSS of the transcripts from technical noise. Thus, a long-read sequencing strategy that identifies enhancers with accurate 5’ends and characterises the eRNAs simultaneously is crucial in identifying novel eRNAs.</p><p id="P4">Since widespread transcription was observed from enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kim et al. 2010</xref>), transcriptional properties of eRNA have been explored by multiple studies. In general, canonical eRNAs refer to short, non-polyadenylated, unspliced, m7G-capped transcripts that are bi-directionally transcribed (2D) from enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Andersson et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Kim et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Schwalb et al. 2016</xref>). Unidirectional (1D) eRNAs (often referred as enhancer-associated lncRNAs) were also identified and they are often longer, spliced and polyadenylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">De Santa et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Vučićević et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Gil and Ulitsky 2018</xref>). While transcribed 2D enhancers were shown to have less CpG islands (CGI) than promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Andersson et al. 2014</xref>), chromatin state-defined enhancers were observed with high GC content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Xiong et al. 2018</xref>) and functionally cooperate with proximal CGI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Pachano et al. 2021</xref>). For non-polyadenylated eRNAs, the termination of the transcripts depends on the integrator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Lai et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Lykke-Andersen et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Welsh and Gardini 2023</xref>). Early termination mediated by WDR82, PNUTS/PP1 and SET1 was also reported to control the termination of eRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Austenaa et al. 2015</xref>). The half-life of eRNAs is as short as a few minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Schwalb et al. 2016</xref>) and are subjected to degradation by the nuclear exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Pefanis et al. 2015</xref>). Therefore, more eRNAs are detected via sequencing nascent transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Schwalb et al. 2016</xref>) or chromatin-bound RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Hirabayashi et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Here, we developed the CFC-seq protocol for sampling full-length cDNA by adopting Cap-trapping and poly(A)-tailing (PAT) on the Oxford Nanopore technologies (ONT) platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We observed the Cap-trap features, including 5’ un-encoded G from the reads while these features allow us to identify genuine transcription start sites (TSSs) and transcribed <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (tCREs) from the long-read sequencing. <italic>In vitro</italic> poly(A)-tailing of total RNA increased the sampling of eRNAs and lncRNAs without a natural poly(A) tail. This protocol identifies TSSs and transcript models derived from the same molecules simultaneously. Thereafter, we investigated the transcriptional properties of non-coding RNAs derived from their specific promoters and enhancers. These properties correlated with the enhancer structure including the presence of CGI and TATA box. While the relatively ubiquitous CGI enhancers generate shorter and more exosome-sensitive RNAs, TATA box derived eRNAs are longer, more stable, frequently spliced and polyadenylated. More than 27% of these TATA box-derived eRNAs are originated from long terminal repeats (LTR) retrotransposons. TATA box was shown to be depleted from the transcribed super enhancer (SE) and 2D enhancer, leading to less spliced eRNAs observed from SE and 2D enhancers. Overall, CFC-seq enabled annotation of eRNA transcript models, while the transcription of these models was correlated with the heterogeneity of the enhancer structure.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CFC-seq shows the best TSS coverage and samples non-poly(A) RNA</title><p id="P6">We developed the CFC-seq protocol by combining Cap-trap technology and PAT with the ONT long-read cDNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). After the pre-processing of the CFC-seq data, 236 million mappable reads were obtained from the 5 cell-types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Ext1a</xref>). We first explored the 5’ end completeness of the CAP trapping-based CFC-seq. Compared with other long-read protocols collected by ENCODE on the same iPS line (WTC11), CFC-seq showed the highest percentage of reads starting from the SCREEN cCRE regions, chromatin-open regions revealed by ATC-seq and FANTOM5 CAGE clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). These results demonstrated the effectiveness of the Cap-trap technology in sampling RNAs with complete 5’ ends, which reflect the TSSs. On the other hand, PAT was incorporated into the protocol to capture non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) devoid of a natural poly(A) tail, by enzymatically adding a stretch of adenines to the 3’ end of the extracted RNA. To address the coverage of non-poly(A) RNA, we performed CFC-seq with or without PAT in THP-1. As PAT allowed the protocol to reveal non-poly(A) RNA molecules, a considerable fraction of the library comprised known non-poly(A) genes including histone genes and small nucleolar RNA, suggesting the effectiveness of the PAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Ext_Fig. 1b</xref>). Internal priming was known to occur in poly-dT priming protocol by binding to the adenine-rich sequence on the RNA body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Svoboda et al. 2022</xref>). We estimated the potential of internal priming of all the sampled 3’ ends according to the percentage of downstream adenines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). After excluding known non-poly(A) genes and reads potentially captured by internal priming, ~98% of mRNA reads without PAT carry a poly(A) signal (PAS) motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>), suggesting poly-dT priming in CFC-seq capture full-length molecules effectively. From the protocol with PAT on THP-1, 96%, 80% and 55% of reads derived from mRNA, promoter-derived ncRNAs and enhancer-derived ncRNAs respectively contain the PAS motif. Therefore, CFC-seq captures non-poly(A) RNAs and many of them are non-coding.</p><p id="P7">Around 4% of the mRNA reads from the PAT protocol were found lacking a PAS motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). We reasoned that they are the nascent RNAs and identified the location of these captured 3’ ends from the coding gene fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Ext_Fig. 1c</xref>). Initially, we explored the mRNA content from the libraries without performing PAT which represents the technical limitation of a poly-dT protocol. From the 2% mRNA reads without a PAS motif, ~28% of these 3’ ends are consistent with the 3’ ends of GENCODE transcripts, suggesting that these RNAs may acquire the poly(A) tail through less conserved PAS motifs or non-canonical pathways. The other 72% potentially resulted from internal priming at a subthreshold level of downstream adenine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Ext_Fig. 1d upper</xref>). To assess the side effects of including PAT, we subtracted the 3’ ends that were captured by the non-PAT THP-1 libraries from the PAT THP-1 libraries. These PAT-specific 3’ ends constitute about 2% of the libraries according to the coding gene fraction. They are independent from internal priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Ext_Fig. 1d lower</xref>) and were dispersed across the transcript body revealing a relatively higher frequency at the donor sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Ext_Fig. 1e</xref>), resembling nascent RNA along the RNA processing pathway. Next, we determined if including PAT increased the ncRNA content. Comparing the lncRNAs sampled from the non-PAT and PAT THP-1 libraries at the read-level, the fraction of lncRNAs increased from 8% to 13% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Ext_Fig. 1f</xref>). Using the raw output from SALA, 25,612 ncRNA gene models are uniquely identified from the PAT library, versus only 6,963 from the non-PAT library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Ext_Fig. 1g</xref>). Overall, PAT incorporation increased the ncRNA content and successfully sampled non-poly(A) RNAs which are mainly ncRNAs, with a side effect of introducing ~2% of reads from the transcriptionally incomplete nascent RNAs.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>PAS motif and random forest comprehensively annotate the 3’ end</title><p id="P8">To quantitatively assess canonical PolII termination events from the transcript models, we introduced a sequence-based random forest classifier trained on highly curated poly(A)-positive 3’ ends as a ground truth.

Trained on sequence features from this dataset, the classifier was applied to the 3’ ends of all the CFC-seq reads and to the GENCODE transcript models, resulting a score for likelihood of each 3’ end to derive from a canonical PolII termination event. This poly(A) score revealed high performance with AUC ~ 93% from the THP-1 non-PAT and PATspecific 3’ ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Ext_Fig. 1h</xref>). Thresholds for defining poly(A)-positive and -negative were extracted from the ROC curve with 95% confidence.

Combining the CFC-seq libraries of the two differentiation time courses, 159,116 genuine TSS clusters were identified by <italic>SCAFE</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Moody et al. 2022</xref>). These TSS clusters were extended and merged into 73,328 transcribed CREs (tCREs) with a median length of 501 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Integrating their genomic locations with the SCREEN cCREs (The ENCODE Project Consortium et al. 2020) revealed 30,695 promoter-like and 32,416 enhancer-like tCREs. Heatmap showing their expression level highlighted the cell-type specific nature of the enhancer-like tRCEs. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Proximal TSS clusters within 75 nt were merged into extended 5’ end clusters (ex5_clusters) to define 5’ end transcript classes in SALA and identify strand-specific summits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Next, the tCREs observed from the Neuron series were intersected with single-cell ATAC-seq peaks derived from the same samples, showing that majority of tCREs overlap with accessible chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). From the tCREs without cCRE support (unclassed), ~29% of them are proximal to the starting sites of GENCODE transcript models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Ext_Fig. 2b</xref>). Apart from these annotated tCREs, around 36% of ATAC-supported unclassed tCREs are specific to NSC, which was not an annotated cell-type in the SCREEN.

About 52% of non-ATAC unclassed tCRE intersected with the <italic>ChromHMM</italic> promoter or enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Ext_Fig. 2c</xref>). The remaining 48% show a higher incidence of tCRE summits originating from exons (n = 104) and 3’ UTRs (n = 246) of annotated genes, regions previously reported as capped 3’ UTR-derived RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Haberman et al. 2023</xref>). The tCREs with and without GENCODE, cCRE or ATAC support are summarised in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>. Notably, transcript models originating from unclassified tCREs were included in the final transcriptome, but labeled as non-independent transcripts when lacking ATAC support for open chromatin. Overall, our approach simultaneously identified TSS clusters and full-length long-read molecules, facilitating the precise definition of independent transcription and linking transcript models to well-defined tCREs and promoter types.</p><p id="P10">The tCRE’s summit represents the major TSS of a tCRE. They were extracted and extended in a strand-specific manner to intersect with various promoter features. The genomic location of these tCREs resemble features of promoter, including high GC content and conserved sequence while the summits were consistent with the feature of transcription start sites revealed by the position of TATA box and initiator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Ext_Fig. 2d</xref>). Enhancer-like tCREs were shown to have all these properties at lower but comparable levels as the promoter-like tCREs, suggesting the identified enhancer-like tCREs are capable to initiate transcription. It is noted that enhancer-like tCREs show enrichment of GC content and CpG island (CGI) downstream of the summit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Ext_Fig. 2d</xref>). As CGI is more accessible by various regulatory factors, this distribution implies that CGIs may play a crucial role in enhancing the activity of target promoters rather than driving the transcription of the eRNAs. Coincidently, CGIs proximal to poised enhancers were found to amplify enhancer activity towards CGI promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Pachano et al. 2021</xref>). To this end, we subset the enhancers which overlap with significant H3K27me3 repressive histone mark identified from our iPSC CUT&amp;Tag data. This group of enhancers represent “transcribed poised enhancers”. It is noted that &gt;50% of these poised enhancers produce eRNAs in the iPSC while others are produced from NSC, Neuron or THP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Poised or bivalent (overlap with both H3K27ac and H3K27me3) enhancers were found significantly enriched with the presence of upstream CGI (uCGI) and downstream CGI (dCGI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). On the contrary, TATA box enhancers were depleted from H3K27me3 but enriched with active state and the state devoid of both H3K27ac and H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Bidirectional enhancers are more conserved, due to CpG islands</title><p id="P11">Bidirectional transcription was reported as a feature of enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Andersson et al. 2014</xref>).

Enhancer-like tCREs were then classified as SE or typical enhancer (TE) in each of the three cell-types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). We then explored if directionality and SE clustering showed differences in CRE conservation. Using the sequence 500 bp upstream the tCRE summit, 2D tCREs are significantly more conserved than 1D tCREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Ext_Fig. 3d</xref>). Super enhancer was reported as more conserved over other enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Khan et al. 2018</xref>) in a context of chromatin state-defined enhancers. In our study of “transcribed” enhancers, TE is comparably conserved as SE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Ext_Fig. 3e</xref>). We reasoned that the presence of uCGI/dCGI contributed to the conservation observed in the 2D tCRE and classified the tCRE for the enrichment of CGI and for containing a TATA box (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S22">Methods</xref>). For both enhancer and promoter, 2D tCREs are enriched with CGI while 1D tCREs are enriched with TATA box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Ext_Fig. 3f</xref>). By comparing the tCREs with or without CGI and TATA box, both 1D and 2D enhancers carrying CGI are significantly more conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Ext_Fig. 3g</xref>). These results indicated that presence of the CGI in the enhancers contributed to the sequence conservation. It is noted that some distal tCREs are strand-independent and the strand with greater summit count was chosen for the analyses. To obtain the signal from both strands and synchronise the analyses with the transcript models, above analyses were also performed on the ex5_clusters (n = 60351) that linked to the finalised transcript models.

Among them, presence of uCGI and dCGI correlated with shorter eRNA significantly while presence of TATA box and more conserved sequence correlated with longer eRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). While bidirectionality and being within SE clusters showed subtle effect on the length of e_ncRNAs, they significantly correlated with less splicing events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Additionally, uCGI and dCGI correlated with less splicing events while TATA box correlated with more splicing events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Since the regulatory elements (TATA box, uCGI and dCGI) sometimes coexist in an enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Ext_Fig. 3f</xref>) and may affect each other, ex5_clusters with only one of these regulatory elements were grouped and compared. Analyses of transcript length and splicing event verified the role of dCGI for shorter length and less splicing events and TATA box for longer length and higher splicing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e-f</xref>). These analyses were also performed on the p_ncRNAs with less obvious enrichment except for the presence of dCGI showing shorter ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Ext_Fig. 6e-h</xref>). To better illustrate the genomic properties of dCGI and TATA box enhancer, we explored their enrichment against the other genomic properties from the ex5_cluster. Both 2D- and super-enhancer showed depletion of TATA box but subtle enrichment of dCGI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>), suggesting the lack of TATA box maybe a factor of the lower splicing activity in 2D- and super-enhancer. Further, ubiquitous enhancers (≥ 1 read from all 5 cell types) are enriched with uCGI/dCGI and depleted with TATA box, consistent to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Carninci et al. 2006</xref>). Overall, enhancer structure (dCGI and TATA box) was found to affect RNA splicing and length while these effects extended to enhancer types (bidirectionality and SE clustering) due to their depletion of TATA box.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Presence of poly(A) tail and splicing enriched with longer ncRNA</title><p id="P22">It is noted that dCGI directly affect sequence conservation downstream of the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>) and the sequence composition of the transcript body. To identify the factors affecting the transcription from the transcript body, the 4 classes of RNA (mRNA, p_ncRNA, e_ncRNA and other_ncRNA) were grouped at the transcript model level. Protein-coding mRNAs (n = 28,230) were defined as any complete and known transcripts annotated as coding genes by GENCODE. Non-coding RNAs (n = 121,834) were noncoding transcript models derived from non-coding genes annotated in this study or by GENCODE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Ext_Fig. 4i</xref>). The presence of poly(A) tail for each transcript model was determined by having the poly(A) prediction positive or the presence of PAS from 5 to 50 nt upstream of the 3’ end. The occurrence of splicing and poly(A) correlated with longer eRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). These transcripts were grouped into the ex5_clusters considering the weighted frequency of transcript models that are poly(A) positive. Dividing the ex5_clusters with the regulatory elements, the ncRNA content derived from dCGI enhancer constituted significantly less poly(A) RNA compared to that of TATA box enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>). This result is specific to enhancer and was not observed from p_ncRNA.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Chromatin-bound and exosome sensitivity</title><p id="P23">As eRNA degrades rapidly in general, we adopted CFC-seq on the chromatin-bound fraction of iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Ext_Fig. 1a</xref>) in order to increase eRNA recovery and assess which RNAs that are specifically enriched from this fraction. We applied <italic>SALA</italic> on the chromatin-bound iPSC using the finalised transcriptome with all the GENCODE transcript models as the reference, where newly identified transcript models were labelled independently from the main dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S7</xref>). This dataset revealed an addition of 10,857 ncRNA genes while 6,476 of them are derived from enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Ext_Fig. 6i</xref>). Using exosome knockdown RNA-seq data from another line of iPSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">Yip et al. 2022</xref>), chromatin-bound eRNAs were found to be more exosome-sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Ext_Fig. 6j</xref>). Further, the genes were grouped by ex5_clusters where one gene was allowed to have multiple ex5_clusters but only those ex5_clusters with one gene were kept. The exosome sensitivity was tested against different enhancer features from the ex5_clusters. Enhancers with uCGI, dCGI, 2D, being clustered as SE and ubiquitously active generate eRNAs that are significantly more sensitive to exosome degradation, while TATA box enhancer generates eRNAs that are significantly less sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4j</xref>). These results agree with our discoveries on the splicing, transcript length, and the presence of ploy(A) tail between CGI and TATA box enhancers. Overall, we grouped the ex5_clusters according to the enhancer structure and observed that dCGI enhancers transcribed shorter RNA with high sensitivity to exosome degradation while TATA box enhancers are more frequently spliced, polyadenylated, longer and more stable.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Non-coding RNA showed low splicing efficiency</title><p id="P24">To extend our observation of ncRNA splicing activity, we investigate the confidence, recurrence and efficiency of the splicing junctions (SJs).

For these remaining novel SJs, their counts and base-calling quality scores nearby the junctions (± 3nt) were used as an indicator of technical confidence.

To address this, we calculated the splicing efficiency of all the junctions and summarised the normalised splicing efficiency at the gene level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Across several different cutoffs of occurrence as the SJ inclusion criteria, splicing efficiency of ncRNAs is significantly lower than mRNAs, where p_ncRNAs showed a significantly lower efficiency compared to the e_ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>).

However, the cleavage position or the RNA motif at the cleavage site is unknown. From the recursive non-poly(A) 3’ end of ncRNA, we observed a very different sequence composition from the ones with poly(A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). In addition to the absence of PAS motif, a relatively high content of cysteine was observed upstream the 3’ end. As the RNA secondary structure was reported to hinder 3’ end cleavage in the canonical poly(A) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Klasens 1998</xref>), we measure the secondary structure score by RNAfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Lorenz et al. 2011</xref>) surrounding the 3’ ends of poly(A) and non-poly(A) eRNAs.

Enhancer with only dCGI was found to have the highest hit rate of eQTL SNPs against background SNPs, with about 2-fold as the TATA box enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). The eQTL results were similar in exons, where the relatively short eRNAs overlap more with the dCGI that regulates enhancer activity. This result may imply a more established enhancer function from the dCGI enhancer. To explore the enhancer function contributed by different enhancer structures, the interaction between these enhancers and protein-coding gene promoters was predicted by Hi-C performed on the Neuron series. Using the interaction from all 3 cell types, the number of coding gene promoters in contact with dCGI and uCGI enhancers were found significantly greater than that of TATA box enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>). This result is consistent when the analysis performed at each cell type separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Ext_Fig. 8b</xref>). This finding echoed the observation from the eQTL SNPs and suggested a broader enhancer role of uCGI/dCGI enhancer than TATA box enhancer. This result also concurs with a previous study that CGI enhancers showed higher Hi-C contacts than classical enhancers, where enhancers were epigenetically defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bell and Vertino 2017</xref>). Further, chromatin accessibility and GC content of the Hi-C contact regions revealed that regions with uCGI/dCGI enhancer were more accessible with higher GC content while both were correlated with contact frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Ext_Fig. 8c-d</xref>).

We intersected repetitive elements with both the ex5_clusters and transcript models (merged exons) and categorized them as dCGI, uCGI, TATA, and Null. Analysis of both ex5_clusters and transcript models revealed that LTRs were specifically enriched in TATA box enhancers and depleted from uCGI/dCGI enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). This enrichment pattern was consistent across the p_ncRNA, CTCF_ncRNA, and other_ncRNA groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Ext_Fig. 8g</xref>). Notably, LTR elements were highly enriched in the other_ncRNA category (unclassified by SCREEN promoter-typing) with TATA box enhancers accounting for 57% (n = 342), suggesting that these elements are a prominent transcription source within this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Ext_Fig. 8g</xref>).

The incorporation of PAT was shown to successfully include non-poly(A) RNA and almost double the number of ncRNA reads.</p><p id="P32">Transcription from enhancers and the presence of eRNAs in the human genome are well-established. However, their low abundance hinders transcript model construction using short-read RNA-seq. Although CFC-seq aids in annotating eRNAs with splicing junctions and relatively precise transcript end sites, creating reliable transcript models with limited sequencing depth remains challenging. Since the majority of the eRNAs lacks a canonical polyadenylation signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Ext_Fig. 4c</xref>), the concept of typical complete mRNA model with both a defined TSS and poly(A) tail, often does not apply to eRNAs. The use of 3’ end clusters to observe recursive transcript end sites provided an additional layer of confidence, albeit hindered by the low expression level of eRNAs. From the analyses showing higher content of “nascent” RNA from the chromatin fraction also suggested that most eRNAs are “incomplete” in nature. Importantly, the eRNAs identified in this study were derived from total RNA under standard cell culture conditions, likely representing the natural, full-length format of these transcripts.</p><p id="P33">Identification of enhancers in a cell type is generally based on chromatin state and transcriptional activity with transcribed enhancers typically being more active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Andersson et al. 2014</xref>). Enhancers are known to exhibit high GC content and are frequently located near orphan CGIs though transcribed enhancers tend to be depleted of CGIs and simple repeats. Because TATA box identification depends on the reference location of the TSS, TATA box-associated enhancers were reliably observed only when transcription was detected. The precise identification of eRNA TSSs also allowed us to observe that enhancer CGIs are often positioned downstream of the TSS, distinguishing them from promoters. By integrating transcriptional activity and chromatin state, our study systematically elucidates these enhancer structures and characterizes the RNA produced from them. From the set of transcribed enhancers, we identified both CGI-specific and TATA box-specific enhancers. TATA box enhancers were observed to produce longer, more stable, and more extensively spliced and polyadenylated eRNAs, though they were less connected compared to CGI enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6h</xref>). CGI enhancers appeared more ubiquitous across cell types, whereas TATA box enhancers were more cell-type-specific, suggesting that ubiquitous enhancers are more connected in enhancer networks. Interestingly, CGI enhancers were enriched with H3K27me3 marks, indicating poised or bivalent states, which implies that they may represent a more readily activated enhancer class. In contrast, TATA box enhancers were characterized as either active or lacking both H3K27Ac and H3K27me3 marks, suggesting that their activation may involve a complex mechanism—potentially initiated by pioneer factor binding followed by subsequent transcription factor regulation.</p><p id="P34">Based on TSSs identified by CFC-seq, eRNAs were observed to be transcribed upstream of CGIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Ext_Fig. 2d</xref>), leading to the identification of a distinct group termed dCGI enhancers.

These qualified alignments (~165 million) were converted into CTSS, which were grouped into TSS clusters. According to the multiple properties of each TSS cluster (percentage of CTSS with unencoded G, corrected expression, read count, summit count and flanking count), a multiple logistic regression model was trained to distinguish TSS clusters that are likely genuine. The identification of these TSS clusters was performed per cell-type where cutoffs of at least 3 reads and at least 1 read with unencoded G were applied. Next, <italic>scafe.tool.cm.aggregate</italic> defines tCREs by extending and merging overlapped TSS clusters defined from different cell-types.

Additional commands including <italic>scafe.tool.cm.directionality</italic> and <italic>scafe.tool.cm.annotate</italic> were used to calculate bi-directional reads in each tCRE and pre-annotate the tCREs with nearby GENCODE transcript model. The tCREs were then classed for the promoter types by intersecting with SCREEN cCREs, in an order of promoter-like, enhancer-like and CTCF-alone. If a tCRE was intersected with both promoter-like and enhancer-like SCREEN cCREs, the tCRE was defined as promoter-like. If no cCRE was found to intersect with the tCREs, these tCREs were defined as “unclassed”. These promoter types were directly transferred to the TSS clusters and transcript models. Expression level of tCREs was measured by CTSS of qualified alignments located inside the genuine TSS clusters, where the per-cluster signal was collapsed into per-tCRE level. The signal was normalised across all the samples with individual replicates by using the RLE method in <italic>edgeR</italic>. In the preparation of running SALA, strand-specific TSS clusters were merged if they are within 75 nt distance.

After assembling, the 5’ and 3’ ends of the transcript models were defined as the most common 5’ and 3’ ends revealed by the corresponding reads.

Traditionally, Bambu constructs read classes based on shared splice junctions. Now, we divide these read classes into subgroups by incorporating transcript annotations with refined start and end sites produced by SALA. Briefly, for each first exon of spliced read classes, the start positions of all exons in the provided annotations that share the 3’ splice site were used as thresholds for grouping reads. A tolerance of 35 bp was applied to each threshold to accommodate small positional variations, and reads were assigned to the largest exon division they matched. Reads longer than the largest annotated first exon were grouped separately. The same process was applied to the last exon, but based on the 5’ splice site. These modifications were implemented in the test_split_read_classes branch. To ensure Bambu recognizes these more granular read classes, we set the opt.discovery = list(min.exonDistance = 0) parameter, reducing the allowance for deviation when assigning read classes to reference transcripts before the Expectation-Maximization (EM) quantification. Additionally, due to the presence of overlapping transcripts from different genes, we preprocessed the SALA gtf file by performing <italic>de novo</italic> gene annotation using the assignGeneIds function from Bambu. This function assigns new gene IDs based on overlapping stranded exon regions, enabling the consideration of overlapping transcripts as a single entity during EM quantification.

The plot shows the percentage of reads with intersection. Long-read data of iPSC WTC11 was downloaded from ENCODE LRGASP (CAP_trap_Pacbio: ENCSR309IKK; uncap_deplete_Pacbio: ENCSR507JOF; TOS_Ont: ENCSR539ZXJ; R2C2_Ont: ENCSR925UQZ; dRNA_Ont: ENCSR392BGY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Pardo-Palacios et al. 2024</xref>). <bold>d,</bold> Read-base assessment of potential internal priming, percentage in grey represent reads without internal priming. <bold>e,</bold> CFC-seq was performed with and without poly(A)-tailing (PAT) on THP-1 cells.

The presence of a PAS motif located between -50 to -5 bp upstream of the 3’ end of the read is considered as PAS-positive.

The enhancer-like tCREs were split into 4 groups as Bivalent (both H3K27ac and H3K27me3), Active (H3K27ac alone), Poised (H3K27me3 alone) and Others (none of the two). Qualified TSS were counted into the tCREs while &gt;=1 count was considered expression from that cell type.

Three key features—5’ end, splicing junction, and 3’ end—of all reads were extracted, aggregated, labelled, and qualified. The 5’ ends were clustered into Transcription Start Site (TSS) clusters, with confident TSS clusters identified by <italic>SCAFE</italic>. Splicing junctions were compared with junctions from GENCODE (v39) and short-read sequencing of the same samples. Base-call quality for each junction was extracted and summarised. The 3’ ends were clustered into Transcription End Site (TES) clusters, with confident clusters selected based on the read count. Additional labels for the 3’ end included the presence of a poly(A) signal (PAS) and internal priming. These features, along with the reference transcriptome and all reads, were applied to assembling. Confident TSS and TES clusters acted as guiding features, while other features were used to label the transcript models. The method for determining the end positions of the transcript models could be chosen according to the data structure. The resulting transcript models were linked to tCREs (transcriptional cis-regulatory elements) with promoter-typing and filtered for downstream analyses.

Transcript models were shown in three groups: ENST (annotated transcript models from GENCODE v39), novel isoforms (novel transcript models that are grouped under GENCODE gene models) and transcripts from novel genes.
