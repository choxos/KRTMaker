In the recessive congenital myopathy, EMARDD (early myopathy, areflexia, respiratory distress and dysphagia), the ability of muscle to regenerate is impaired, but the reason for this is still unclear. Skeletal muscle fibres in EMARDD patients have a reduced diameter, fewer nuclei per fibre and lack Pax7<sup>+</sup> satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Logan et al., 2011</xref>). The disorder is caused by mutations in <italic>MEGF10</italic> (multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains 10). MEGF10, the membrane protein encoded by this gene, has been suggested to be important for satellite cell interaction with the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Logan et al., 2011</xref>). Mutations in <italic>MEGF10</italic> that cause EMARDD appear to reduce proliferation and migration of activated satellite cells, resulting in fewer myogenic cells that can eventually fuse together to form new adult myofibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Holterman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Saha et al., 2017</xref>). MEGF10 has also been suggested to promote satellite cell proliferation, whilst regulating myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Holterman et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In addition to its role in satellite cells, MEGF10 has been reported to be required for engulfment, a similar role to that reported for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> CED-1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Callebaut et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Holterman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Suzuki and Nakayama, 2007b</xref>), an orthologue of MEGF10. Exogenous expression of MEGF10 in Hela cells induces these cells to engulf the protein GULP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hamon et al., 2006</xref>). This role in engulfment is particularly important in the brain, where MEGF10 is highly expressed in astrocytes and likely plays a role in synapse trimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Park and Chung, 2023</xref>). More recently MEGF10 has been found to be enriched in neuromuscular junctions with a possible role in modifying these synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Juros et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P5">MEGF10 has a large extracellular domain that comprises an N-terminal EMI domain followed by 17 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The EMI domain was first described in proteins in the EMILIN family of glycoproteins and is associated with protein multimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Colombatti et al., 2011</xref>). The EMI domain of MEGF10, whilst having the conserved consensus sequence at the C-terminus (WRCCPG(Y/F)xGxxC), has only 6 rather than the 7 cysteine residues found in many EMI domains, and thus is more similar to the EMI domain in multimerin. This domain has been predicted to interact with the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS), which is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells as a signal marking the cell for phagocytosis <italic>via</italic> TTR-52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Tung et al., 2013</xref>), consistent with the potential role of MEGF10 in engulfment. Interestingly, PS is also exposed on the surface of skeletal muscle myoblasts during fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jeong and Conboy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">van den Eijnde et al., 2001</xref>) and the PS receptor BAL1 promotes myoblast fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hochreiter-Hufford et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the EMI domain of MEGF10 could also play a role in myoblast-myoblast adhesion in fusing cells, via PS.</p><p id="P6">The EGF domains of MEGF10 comprise two different forms. There are 12 EGF-like domains composed of 7 conserved cysteine rich residues and 5 laminin-type EGF-domains that contain 8 conserved cysteine residues capable of forming four disulphide bonds. EGF domains may have a role in mediating intercellular signalling and act in receptor-ligand interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Wouters et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, these extracellular domains mediate a role for MEGF10 in cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Suzuki and Nakayama, 2007a</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Satellite cells can contribute to skeletal muscle hypertrophy, in which skeletal muscle fibre diameter increases in response to hormonal, endocrine or mechanical stimuli, resulting in increased girth and strength of the muscle (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bagley et al., 2023</xref>). Hypertrophy commonly results from activities such as resistance training or mechanical overload. It results in transient increases of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which increases muscle protein synthesis, but increases in satellite cell number and in myonuclear accretion can also be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Roberts et al., 2023</xref>). Mechanical overload models in mice and rats can mimic this response. One type of overload model involves surgery to remove the <italic>tibialis anterior</italic> (TA) muscle from one leg, which forces the synergistic <italic>extensor digitorum longus</italic> (EDL) to undergo sustained stretch, and thereby work harder when the animal is ambulant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Egginton et al., 2011</xref>). It results in a mild hypertrophy compared to unloaded muscle. This type of muscle perturbation is more physiological than inducing acute muscle damage by injecting toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Mahdy, 2019</xref>). The muscle overload model is also useful in determining how disease states may affect muscle hypertrophy. Previous work using the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse, which is a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), has shown that overloaded EDL muscle is unable to withstand the added strain resulting from the removal of the TA muscle, and undergoes accelerated deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dick and Vrbova, 1993</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The exact roles and function of MEGF10 in skeletal muscle are still poorly understood. Here, we have explored the role of MEGF10 in myoblast adhesion and fusion <italic>in vitro</italic> using a myoblast clone from the <italic>H-2k</italic><sup><italic>b</italic></sup>-tsA58 transgenic mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Morgan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Richardson et al., 2022</xref>). We tested the effects of overexpressing MEGF10 on fusion and migration. We further tested the effects of MEGF10 by adding expressed and purified exogenous MEGF10 domains to cultured myoblasts to determine effects on cell adhesion, migration and fusion. We then explored the role of Megf10 in hypertrophy and satellite cell activation in response to overload <italic>in vivo</italic>, using a knockout mouse for <italic>Megf10</italic>. Use of the muscle overload model indicates that in humans, MEGF10 has a potential role in satellite cell function that would blunt the overload response, indicating a potential role in the aetiology of EMARDD.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Overexpression of EGFP-MEGF10 reduces fusion and cell motility of cultured myoblasts</title><p id="P9">To explore MEGF10 effect on myoblast differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, we used a single <italic>H-2k</italic><sup><italic>b</italic></sup>-tsA58 myoblast clone (C1F) derived from satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Morgan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Richardson et al., 2022</xref>). We generated an adenovirus to express either eGFP or eGFP-fused to the C-terminus of MEGF10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The resultant constructs were the expected size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>). Tests for the optimal MOI (multiplicity of infection) demonstrated that an MOI of ~100 was optimal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Uninfected wild type C1F myoblasts fused into multinucleated myotubes with high efficiency (fusion index of ~80%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>) when cultured under differentiation conditions. Expression of eGFP, using the adenovirus, significantly reduced fusion to 64% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>), suggesting that viral infection alone may reduce fusion. However, expression of MEGF10-eGFP reduced the fusion index to very low levels (fusion index of 7.5%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Thus, overexpression of MEGF10 inhibits fusion.</p><p id="P11">A reduction in myoblast fusion could arise from effects on cell viability or proliferation resulting from MEGF10-eGFP expression. We found that expression of MEGF10-eGFP significantly reduced cell number at day 7 of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). This effect is unlikely to be due solely to infection with the adenovirus, as expression of GFP alone using an adenoviral construct did not affect cell number. Thus, expression of MEGF10-eGFP is likely to reduce cell proliferation or could also affect cell viability. Expression of MEGF10-eGFP also significantly reduced myoblast motility compared to cells expressing eGFP and uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). This reduction in migration may also contribute to the reduction in fusion.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The extracellular domain of MEGF10 reduces fusion of cultured myoblasts</title><p id="P12">Imaging of C1F myoblasts infected with adenovirus to express MEGF10-eGFP at different MOIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 2B</xref>) showed that the higher the MOI, the more MEGF10-eGFP was localised to the Golgi. At the MOI of 100 used in these experiments, MEGF10-eGFP was localised to intracellular vesicles and Golgi and plasma membrane, and thus we cannot rule out that intracellular as well as membrane localised MEGF10-EGFP contributes to the effects we observe on cell fusion. To rule out intracellular effects, we carried out additional experiments in which we tested the effects of adding expressed and purified MEGF10 extracellular domain constructs to cultured myoblasts. We generated two constructs, an extracellular domain comprising all of the EGF domains together with the N-terminal EMI domain (ECD) and a shorter extracellular domain that lacks the N-terminal EMI domain and thus comprises the EGF domains only (EGF).</p><p id="P13">Pure MEGF10 extracellular domain (ECD) and EGF domain (lacking EMI domain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), was obtained by expression and purification of these constructs in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 3A, B</xref>). The molecular weights of these proteins were higher than predicted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 4A, B</xref>); the molecular weights of both ECD and EGF were found to be approximately 130kDa, whereas the predicted molecular weights are 91kDa and 81kDa, respectively. We confirmed that the expressed and purified protein were the correct MEGF10 constructs by western blotting for the c-myc tag, which showed a band at the same size as that of the purified protein. Mass spectrometry analysis of the purified proteins also confirmed the identity of these two protein domains, providing 14 unique peptides for EDC (27% coverage) and 31 peptides for EGF (77% coverage).</p><p id="P14">The increased molecular weights of the expressed and purified EGF and ECD domains are likely to be the result of post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. Mass spectrometry showed that the ECD contained O-GlcNac modified residues. Using lectin blots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Fig. 3C</xref>), we found that the expressed ECD and EGF were both highly glycosylated. This both explains the increased molecular weight compared to that expected and demonstrates that these domains are likely to be post-translationally modified in a similar way to what would be expected for endogenous MEGF10.</p><p id="P15">Next, we used these purified domains to coat non-adherent culture plates, and tested if they could promote cell attachment, using gelatin as a control. We found that both ECD and EGF domain constructs increased cell adhesion to non-adherent plates, compared to no coating at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>), suggesting that both domains can promote cell adhesion of myoblasts.</p><p id="P16">We then coated glass surfaces with gelatin, ECD and EGF constructs to test if these domains promoted cell adhesion on adherent surfaces and had effects on differentiation as observed for exogenous eGFP-MEGF10 expression. At day 7 of differentiation, the total number of cells per area was significantly reduced for the ECD construct compared to cells differentiated on uncoated surfaces, and the fusion index was also markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B, D</xref>) but there were no significant effects on cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Thus, addition of the external ECD domain has somewhat similar effects to expression of eGFP-MEGF10. However, the EGF construct (which lacks the EMI domain) did not affect number of cells at day 7 of differentiation or fusion, but did reduce cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B-D</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Taken together, these data suggest that MEGF10 expression must be tightly regulated for its correct cellular function and that the EMI domain is more important in modulating cell adhesion and fusion than the EGF domains. The EMI domain appears to be important in promoting adhesion of cells to a non-adhesive surface, but likely inhibits cell-cell adhesion required for fusion, thus reducing cell number at day 7 of differentiation and reducing fusion.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Effect of muscle overload on the EDL muscle in wild type, <italic>Megf10</italic> <sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Megf10</italic> <sup>-/-</sup> mice</title><p id="P18">We next performed experiments using genotyped wild type, <italic>Megf10</italic> <sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Megf10</italic> <sup>-/-</sup> mice to understand the potential <italic>in vivo</italic> roles of MEGF10. The phenotype of MEGF10 knockout mouse has been reported to be relatively mild and exacerbated when crossed to the dystrophin knockout mouse model (mdx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Saha et al., 2017</xref>). The same study showed that injection of barium chloride into the tibialis anterior muscle, an approach that results in severe muscle damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hardy et al., 2016</xref>), reduced the rate of fibre regeneration in MEGF10<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Here, we focussed on the response of skeletal muscle to stimuli that elicit hypertrophy, a milder treatment. In this case, the TA muscle is removed, to induce overload on the EDL (extensor digitorum longus) muscle, which hypertrophies as a response. This can occur both as an increase in protein synthesis and though stimulation of satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Murach et al., 2021</xref>). In all of these experiments, the tibialis anterior muscle is only removed from one leg, resulting in overload (OL) on the EDL muscle in this leg. In the contralateral (CL) muscle, the TA muscle is kept intact, acting as a control.</p><p id="P19">Test experiments revealed that the overload response peaked at 10 days after surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>: D10). The relative mass of the overloaded EDL muscles increased at each of the three time points sampled: D6, 10 and 14 compared to D0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). In contrast, the relative mass of the unloaded contralateral EDL muscles did not change, with no significant difference between contralateral tissue at all time points compared to D0 EDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Expressing the change in weight as % hypertrophy comparing the overloaded muscle (OL) to the contralateral muscle (CL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>) shows that the overloaded muscles hypertrophied by ~40% at D6-14, a significant increase compared to D0. Muscle hypertrophy appeared to plateau between days 10 and day 14.</p><p id="P20">Counting the numbers of nuclei per fields of view for isolated muscle fibres showed that the numbers of nuclei per mm was significantly increased in the overloaded compared to contralateral muscle fibres at D10 and D14. The percentage increase in nuclei per mm in overloaded fibres was significantly increased compared to D0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>). No significant differences were found when number of nuclei on contralateral fibres were compared between time points, or to D0 fibres. The increase in numbers of nuclei shows a similar trend to the increase in EDL mass following overload. As the largest effects of overload were observed at D10, this time point was used in subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The hypertrophy response to overload is reduced in Megf10<sup>-/-</sup> mice</title><p id="P21">After 10 days, the weight of the overloaded EDL muscle from wild type and <italic>Megf10</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice increased significantly compared to the contralateral, unloaded muscles but was not significantly different for homozygote <italic>Megf10</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).

Similarly, there was a significant increase in myonuclear number (myonuclear accretion) in overloaded EDL muscles from all three genotypes, which was similar in magnitude for wild type and <italic>MEGF10</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. However, myonuclear accretion was significantly reduced in overloaded EDL muscles from <italic>Megf10</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). These results suggest the complete loss of MEGF10 reduces the hypertrophic response to muscle overload.

This reduced response may be accounted for by the reduction in Pax7<sup>+</sup> satellite cells, and decreased satellite cell response to overload in Megf10 heterozygous (<italic>Megf10</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup>) and homozygous knockout mice. Finally, homozygous knockout mice were born at a lower mendelian ratio than expected. An analysis of the diaphragm muscle in wild type and heterozygous mice showed more variable and reduced fibre cross-sectional area in the heterozygous mice compared to wild type, and increased laminin deposition between fibres. The lower survival rate in homozygous mice, could arise from increased defects in the diaphragm muscle, which reiterates the main clinical presentation of affected individuals with MEGF10-related EMARDD; respiratory distress due to diaphragmatic paralysis.</p><p id="P26">During myoblast differentiation into myotubes, previous work demonstrated that that <italic>Megf10</italic> is downregulated during differentiation of C2C12 cells, by qPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Holterman et al., 2007</xref>) and in C1F myoblasts differentiated on glass surfaces, by RNAseq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Richardson et al., 2022</xref>). These changes have not been confirmed at the protein level, as a well-validated antibody to Megf10/MEGF10 is lacking. However, if Megf10 is normally downregulated during myoblast differentiation, then overexpression of MEGF10 <italic>in vitro</italic>, either <italic>via</italic> expression of eGFP-MEGF10 or via addition of the purified ECD of MEGF10 might be expected to interfere with fusion and differentiation, as we found here. Our findings for eGFP-MEGF10 are similar to those observed previously for overexpression of HA-tagged Megf10 in C2C12 myoblasts, which also decreased myoblast fusion and differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Holterman et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Addition of purified ECD domain also inhibited fusion of myoblasts in vitro and was more effective at inhibiting fusion than the EGF domain, which lacks the EMI domain. However, the ECD domain was more effective at promoting cell attachment to non-adhesive surfaces than the EGF domain. Thus, the EMI domain seems to be important in both inhibiting fusion (which requires cell-cell adhesion) and in promoting cell-surface adhesion. The EMI domain is found in many other MEGF isoforms, and also in the worm orthologue of human MEGF10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Callebaut et al., 2003</xref>). If the EMI domain is able to recognise and bind to PS, then its presence in fusing cells that expose PS on their surface could potentially block binding of other PS receptors that promote fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chikazawa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Hochreiter-Hufford et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jeong and Conboy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">van den Eijnde et al., 2001</xref>). This suggests a possible role of MEGF10 in preventing premature myoblast fusion. Of note, MEGF10 has also been suggested to interact with Notch <italic>via</italic> its intracellular domain (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Vargas-Franco et al., 2022</xref>)), and thus the effects of the exogenous ECD and EGF domains would be independent of any downstream signalling pathway involving Notch.</p><p id="P28">Our observation of a hypertrophic response of the EDL muscle to overload for wild type mice is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Egginton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Johnson and Klueber, 1991</xref>). The increase in mass of the overloaded EDL as well as the increase in myonuclei has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bruusgaard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Huey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Seiden, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Zhou et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, the activation of satellite cells by overload, with increases in Pax7<sup>+</sup>, MyoD<sup>+</sup> and myogenin<sup>+</sup> satellite cells of wild type mice matches findings from previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hyatt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Sakuma et al., 1999</xref>). However, we did not find a strong effect of overload on fibre cross-sectional area, although this has been observed previously in other overload conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Carter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Rosenblatt et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Snijders et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, our experimental data shows that EDL from wild type mice responds to physiological overload as expected, and that this is a suitable approach to explore the effects of overload in <italic>Megf10</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Megf10</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><p id="P29">The reduction in or loss of Megf10 reduced the hypertrophic response of the EDL muscle to overload for both heterozygous <italic>Megf10</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and homozygous knockout <italic>Megf10</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, compared to wild type mice. This reduction was greatest for the homozygous mice. Moreover, the increase in Pax7, MyoD and myogenin positive cells was reduced, again with the largest effect in homozygous mice. The contribution of satellite cells to hypertrophy has been the subject of much discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Pallafacchina et al., 2013</xref>) and it has been shown that some increase in fibre size is possible without functional satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Murach et al., 2017</xref>). However, Pax7 expression has been reported to contribute to the activation and subsequent expansion of satellite cells in response to stimuli such as overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Wang and Rudnicki, 2011</xref>). Moreover, our findings agree with a previous report that found Megf10 deficient mice to have reduced expression of Pax7 and MyoD, resulting in inadequate regeneration of EDL muscle following acute injury due to barium chloride treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Li et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P30">In addition to the reduced hypertrophic response, we also found that muscle fibres in the diaphragm were highly variable in size, and that there was increased fibrosis. Loss of MEGF10 in humans causes respiratory distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Logan et al., 2011</xref>). The change to the structure in the diaphragm of Megf10<sup>+/-</sup> mice we observed could also lead to respiratory distress and could help to account for the lower numbers of homozygous mice that we obtained. Further work is needed to confirm if the diaphragm of Megf10<sup>-/-</sup> mice is affected more severely. Interestingly, a recent report described defects in the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in the tibialis anterior and diaphragm muscles in Megf10<sup>+/-</sup> mice, consistent with its role in glial cells in synapse remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Juros et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting altered NMJs may also contribute to the phenotype of the diaphragm muscle seen here. However, the NMJ of the EDL muscle was not affected in Megf10<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Juros et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that alterations to the NMJ do not have a major contribution to the reduced hypertrophic response we observed here.</p><p id="P31">Overall, our results demonstrate that MEGF10 is likely to be important in myoblast-surface adhesion but can potentially block fusion of myoblasts when present at high levels, thus possibly preventing premature fusion of satellite cells. The reduction in numbers of Pax7<sup>+</sup> satellite cells, and the reduction in their activation in response to muscle overload in <italic>Megf10</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice broadly supports this idea. Satellite cells could be lost through poor adhesion and/or premature fusion. The overall phenotype of the <italic>Megf10</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice recapitulates the human phenotype observed in EMARDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Logan et al., 2011</xref>), resulting from homozygous nonsense mutations in the <italic>MEGF10</italic> gene. In addition to respiratory distress resulting from paralysis of the diaphragm muscle, the reduced numbers of Pax7<sup>+</sup> satellite cells, reduced skeletal muscle fibre growth and reduced satellite cell activation in the mouse model, are reminiscent of the reduced number of Pax7<sup>+</sup> satellite cells, small muscle fibres, fibre necrosis and fibre replacement by fibrous or adipose tissue in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Logan et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> experiments: cell culture and staining</title><p id="P32">To explore muscle differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, we used a clone of satellite cells (C1F) derived from the <italic>H-2k</italic><sup><italic>b</italic></sup>-tsA58 mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Morgan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Richardson et al., 2022</xref>).

Slides were left overnight at room temperature in the dark overnight, and then stored at 4 °C.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Quantification of transcription factor expression and fibre cross-sectional area</title><p id="P49">Stained fibres were imaged using a widefield Olympus IX-70 microscope, using a 40x, N.A. 1.4 objective lens. For measuring myonuclear accretion, 15 x DAPI stained fibres were imaged per condition (three fibres per EDL sample). Numbers of nuclei were counted from 1 mm sections using ImageJ (Fiji).</p><p id="P50">For transcription factor staining, the number of nuclei positively stained for a transcription factor (Pax7, MyoD or myogenin) per 50 myonuclei along the fibre was measured from three fibres per EDL sample, stained for DAPI and the transcription factor. The numbers of positive nuclei per fibre were expressed as a percentage of 50 myonuclei, and the number per fibre was averaged.</p><p id="P51">Cross-sectional area of individual muscle fibres was also determined using ImageJ (FIJI). Outlines of each individual fibre were drawn around on each image using the freehand selection tool, and area in µm<sup>2</sup> was automatically calculated.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Measurement of laminin thickness</title><p id="P52">The width of the basement membrane between fibres in stained diaphragm cross sections was measured using ImageJ processing software (NIH). The ‘straight line’ tool was used to take orthogonal measurements of laminin (visualised with anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate) normal to the sarcolemma, and this value recorded. Five measurements were taken per fibre, and five fibres were measured for 3 wild-type and 3 <italic>Megf10</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P53">Statistical tests were performed, and graphs generated, using GraphPad Prism for Mac (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>).
