However, identifying microbes that provide plant protection remains challenging in complex microbial communities. In this study, we analysed samples from natural <italic>A. thaliana</italic> populations, including both plants infected with the pathogenic oomycete <italic>Albugo laibachii</italic> and uninfected plants, over six years. Using machine learning classification models, we achieved high accuracy in distinguishing infected and uninfected plants based on microbiome abundance. We identified 80 key taxa associated with health and disease. Among the health-associated microbes (HCom), we selected bacteria, fungi, and cercozoa that effectively reduced pathogen presence in co-inoculation assays. In comparison, disease-associated microbes (DCom) were less effective in conferring protection. Our findings highlight the complexity of plant-microbe interactions and advance our understanding of microbial roles in plant disease ecology. By integrating ecological insights with machine learning, we take a significant step towards designing robust microbial consortia that enhance plant resilience against pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Microbe-microbe interaction</kwd><kwd>infected and uninfected leaves</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>plant pathogen</kwd><kwd>natural probiotic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Similar to higher organisms such as humans, plant tissues are colonized by a wide range of microbes known as microbiota or microbiome. The microbiome associated with the plant leaves, i.e., the phyllosphere, is thought to play an important role in the physiology, fitness, and defense mechanism of the host against various biotic and abiotic perturbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Leaves are inhabited mainly by commensal species but can also harbor pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes, which can significantly harm natural plants and crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], thereby causing annual crop yield losses and reducing food availability. Climate change is accelerating the spread of pathogens, thereby affecting forest health globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Therefore, it is crucial to develop strategies that protect from pathogens in a changing environment.</p><p id="P3">Biological control is an effective and environmentally friendly alternative to pesticides for combating microbial plant diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. For example, <italic>Trichoderma</italic>, an opportunistic fungal genus, is widely used as a biological control agent against phytopathogens and is studied for its role in helping plants manage biotic and abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. However, identifying and experimentally validating biocontrol microbes through traditional methods can be slow and challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Another approach to biocontrol involves identifying healthy microbiomes. While healthy plant communities are characterized by diverse and balanced microorganisms, as seen in comparisons between healthy and diseased plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. However, it remains unclear what defines a healthy or beneficial microbiome. One promising solution to this challenge is the use of machine learning. Machine learning techniques have been used in microbiome research to accomplish various tasks, such as predicting host or environmental phenotypes and categorizing microbial properties, including monitoring changes in microbiome composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Machine learning classifiers were used to identify soil microbial patterns predicting the presence of <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, the pathogen causing Fusarium wilt disease under field conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Similarly, the random forest method accurately predicted productivity based on microbiome composition at the order level. Significant differences in crop yield were associated with bulk soil microbiome composition, with many taxa contributing to nitrogen utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Machine learning was used to identify bacterial strains important in reducing leaf infection with the pathogenic bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> DC3000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. However, few studies have investigated the different taxonomic groups of bacteria and eukaryotes in the microbiota of natural plants attacked by obligate biotrophic pathogens.</p><p id="P4">The obligate biotrophic oomycete <italic>Albugo laibachii</italic> is a common pathogen of the <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> family and the causal agent of the white rust disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. This pathogen was identified as a potential core and hub microbe in the leaf microbiome of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> since it showed persistence over several years and high interconnection in the microbial interaction network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. <italic>Albugo</italic> infection was also shown to affect both epiphytic and endophytic bacterial colonization by reducing alpha diversity and secretion of antimicrobial peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. However, it is not clear how the microbiome of the leaf differs in plants infected or not with <italic>Albugo</italic>, and which microbial strains have the potential to promote or reduce infection with <italic>Albugo</italic>.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we analysed the microbiome of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> over a period of six years as collected and described by Mahmoudi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed differences in the microbiota composition associated with <italic>Albugo</italic>-infected and uninfected plants across host genotypes and sampling sites. Using statistical and machine learning classification algorithms, we identified candidate microbes predictive of infected and uninfected states. Candidate microbes were shown to be distributed in different clusters in microbial interaction networks, highlighting their importance in the community’s stability. Co-inoculation assays in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> confirmed the potential of the health-associated microbial communities (HCom) to reduce <italic>Albugo</italic> infection. In comparison, disease-associated microbial communities (DCom) exhibited a range of functions, from minimal effects to partial pathogen suppression, likely through niche competition. These findings highlight the functional redundancy of microbial communities from different phylogenetic groups in manipulating plant health outcomes and demonstrate the power of machine learning in informing biocontrol strategies.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Comparison of phyllosphere microbiome in natural <italic>A. thaliana</italic> populations: uninfected vs. infected with the obligate biotrophic oomycete pathogen <italic>Albugo</italic></title><p id="P6">To investigate the diversity and compositional dynamics of the phyllosphere microbiome in the presence of the obligate biotrophic oomycete pathogen <italic>Albugo</italic>, we used a microbiome dataset described in Mahmoudi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. In their study, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> samples were collected from six sites near Tübingen (southern Germany) with stable <italic>A. thaliana</italic> populations, with sampling repeated over six consecutive years (2014-2019). Genomic DNA was extracted from epiphytic and endophytic microbial communities, followed by amplicon sequencing for bacterial 16S rRNA, fungal ITS2, and eukaryotic 18S rRNA. For the 18S eukaryotic data, fungal microbes were excluded, resulting in the nonfungal eukaryotes (NFEuk) dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Here, we used the endophytic microbiomes for further analysis. Since <italic>Albugo</italic> was the major pathogen associated with <italic>A. thaliana</italic> at the time of sampling, the samples were categorized as infected or uninfected based on the presence or absence of white rust on the leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P7">A diversity analysis was conducted to compare the leaf-associated microbial communities between infected and uninfected plants. Alpha diversity (within-sample diversity, measured by Shannon’s index) demonstrated that, on average, infected plants exhibited a 1.1-fold and 2.8-fold reduction in bacterial and NFEuk community diversity, respectively, in comparison to uninfected plants (Tukey’s HSD test, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in fungal communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). A permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) demonstrated that the ‘infection status’ of the plants explained 1.8% of the variation in bacteria, 0.5% in fungi, and 12.8% in nonfungal eukaryotes. These variations were further visualized using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), which revealed that the infected plants were most clearly separated from the uninfected groups in the NFEuk communities, followed by bacteria and less so in the fungal communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Differences between infected and uninfected communities were found to be associated with the enrichment of major microbial orders over sampling years (Wilcoxon test, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Among bacteria, <italic>Sphingomonadales</italic>, which has been demonstrated to be beneficial for plant health and productivity, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] was 1.3 times more abundant in uninfected plants, whereas <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic> was 1.5 times more abundant in infected samples, based on a comparison of mean relative abundances. Among the fungal orders, only the Basidiomycete yeast <italic>Cystofilobasidiales</italic> exhibited a slightly higher significant abundance in infected plants (1.02 times more). Among nonfungal eukaryotic orders, as expected, the order <italic>Albuginales</italic> (including <italic>Albugo</italic>) showed a 6.7 times increase in infected plants. Interestingly, the most abundant orders of green algae (<italic>Watanabeales, Xanthophyceae</italic> and <italic>Chlamydomonadales</italic>) were 5.9-14.5 times more abundance in uninfected plants, similar to <italic>Cercozoa</italic> (<italic>Glissomonadida</italic> and <italic>Cryomonadida</italic>), with 3.0 and 7.6 times higher abundance in uninfected plants, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Genotype variation in infected and uninfected <italic>A. thaliana</italic> correlates with microbiome diversity</title><p id="P9">To investigate whether leaf microbiome infection varies by host genotype, we used the whole genome sequencing data that was conducted to identify genotype clusters based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Among the five identified clusters, three (clusters 1, 2, and 4) contain samples susceptible to <italic>Albugo</italic> infection. Clusters (2 and 4) exhibited significantly lower alpha diversity in NFEuk communities of infected plants as compared to uninfected clusters (Dunn test, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). A similar pattern was observed in the variability within clusters (i.e., how far each sample was from the group’s central point or centroid). Specifically, the clusters that were susceptible to infection showed less variability in this distance, meaning the samples in these groups were more similar to each other (Dunn test, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, no significant differences were found in fungal communities. Microbiome compositional variation, visualized using NMDS, showed that samples from cluster 4 more clearly separated the infected plants, while cluster 5 distinguished uninfected samples in the NFEuk community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, PERMANOVA, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05). These patterns were less pronounced in bacterial communities (explaining 10.9% of the variation vs. 22.2% variation in NFEuk community) and were not significant in fungal communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Interestingly, the susceptible clusters were distributed across different sampling sites, suggesting that, in addition to host genotypes, other abiotic factors might contribute to plant susceptibility to infection. Notably, genotype cluster 5, which contained only uninfected plants, was exclusively found at the ERG site (Table. S1). Patterns related to sampling sites were observed: two sites (K69 and PFN) had no infected plants, while four sites (EY, WH, JUG, and ERG) contained both infected and uninfected plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Site EY exhibited lower alpha diversity in bacterial communities of infected plants compared to uninfected plants in the same group, while in NFEuk communities, three sites (EY, WH, and JUG) showed lower alpha diversity in infected plants (Dunn test, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>). Regarding community variability, only site ERG showed reduced variability in infected plants within bacterial communities. In contrast, in NFEuk communities, the variability of infected plants was consistently lower than that of uninfected plants across all sites (Dunn test, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). The combination of infection status and sampling site explained 8.4%, 7.8% and 21.2% of the variation in microbial communities for bacteria, fungi and NFEuk, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Identification of a microbial signature for predicting infected and uninfected leaves using machine learning models</title><p id="P11">We hypothesized that the plant microbiome is composed of distinct health-associated microbial communities (HCom) in uninfected plants and disease-associated microbial communities (DCom) in infected plants. These distinct microbial communities can serve as robust indicators of infection, enabling accurate discrimination between infected and uninfected samples. To investigate this hypothesis, we used machine learning classification models, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR), which are well-known for their interpretability and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). The training phase used 70% of the sample set, consisting of 169 uninfected and 66 infected samples with 2,543 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The remaining 30% (73 uninfected and 29 infected samples) served as the test set to assess predictive performance. Four different evaluation metrics were employed, resulting in accuracies ranging from 75% to 86% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). The SVM and LR models achieved the highest accuracy of 85% and 86% respectively, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 93% and 94%, outperforming the MLP and RF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B and 3C</xref>). We then analysed the predictive role of each microbe by calculating and comparing the feature importance of all the OTUs in the trained classification models (SVM, RF, and LR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Comparison of the three models revealed that they shared 2,253 OTUs, indicating consistent microbial signatures associated with both groups (infected/uninfected) that contributed significantly to the classification process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). Using recursive feature elimination with cross-validation, we identified the most crucial OTUs for classification, referring to them as HCom and DCom. The results showed that RF had the highest accuracy, achieving 91% accuracy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>) with 40 selected OTUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The LR model reached 87% accuracy with 4 selected characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). In contrast, the SVM reached 86% accuracy with 53 selected OTUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). It is interesting to note that four OTUs were shared by all three models that originated from LR, and 13 OTUs were shared by SVM and RF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3C</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Additionally, we hypothesized that HCom microbes can reduce the pathogenicity of <italic>Albugo</italic>, in contrast to DCom microbes. To test this hypothesis, we selected four candidate microbes from bacterial, fungal, and non-fungal eukaryotic groups within each category (HCom and DCom) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, microbes in bold). The SVM and LR models provide both positive and negative coefficients to determine microbial importance in classifying infected versus uninfected leaves. We assigned scores based on these coefficients, with negative scores indicating HCom OTUs as indicators of the uninfected class and positive scores representing DCom OTUs as indicators of the infected class (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B and 4C</xref>). However, the RF model only provides positive scores, necessitating further examination of the relationship between the selected OTUs and their respective classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Other selection criteria included diverse representations of bacteria and eukaryotes, as well as laboratory availability. Among the HCom bacterial candidates, <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> OTU3 (<italic>Methylobacterium goesingense</italic>) and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> OTU15 (<italic>Sphingomonas melonis</italic>) were selected, while <italic>Cystofilobasidium</italic> OTU126 (<italic>Cystofilobasidium macerans</italic>) and <italic>Rhogostoma</italic> OTU3 (<italic>Rhogostoma epiphylla</italic>) were selected for fungi and nonfungal eukaryotes, respectively. The Dcom candidates included <italic>Duganella</italic> OTU4 (<italic>Duganella zoogloeoides</italic>) and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> OTU6 (<italic>Pseudomonas viridiflava</italic>) from the bacterial group, <italic>Plectosphaerella</italic> OTU16 (<italic>Plectosphaerella niemeijerarum</italic>) as fungal representative, and <italic>Albugo</italic> OTU5 (<italic>Albugo</italic>), representing nonfungal eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A-C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Infection reduces microbial network complexity and increases compartmentalization in community structure</title><p id="P13">Microbial networks are valuable for identifying potential interactions among microorganisms within a given community. This is achieved by correlating the abundances of different species. Therefore, we investigated the microbial networks in both infected and uninfected samples. The network resulting from the uninfected samples showed 1.9 times greater number of nodes (OTUs) and 3.3 times more edges (connections between OTUs) when compared to the one generated from the infected samples (2,024 nodes and 73,511 edges vs. 1058 nodes and 22,089 edges, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Notably, the topological characteristics of the uninfected network showed higher degree (more connections between microbes) and closeness centrality (microbes more closely connected to others) values (<italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C and 5D</xref>). To assess the effect of infection on the microbial communities’ compartmentalization, we compared the modularity of the constructed networks, a feature representing the degree of functional division and ecological niches within the microbial community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. The results showed that both networks contained a comparable number of modules, with the uninfected network having ten modules and the infected network having nine modules. However, the modularity value of the network derived from infected samples (0.31) was slightly higher than that of the network derived from uninfected samples (0.24) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B and 5A</xref>), which indicates that infected generated network is more segmented, suggesting a stronger tendency to division of microbial communities into distinct functional groups or ecological niches. Notably, all the modules contained OTUs from different taxonomic categories of bacteria, fungi, and nonfungal eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E and 5F</xref>). We examined the microbial interactions of HCom and DCom OTUs in both uninfected and infected networks. Results showed that these OTUs displayed distinct connectivity patterns. In the network generated from uninfected samples, the OTUs formed 72 OTUs with 493 edges (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4A</xref>). In contrast, these OTUs exhibited fewer connections in the infected network, resulting in 64 nodes with 193 edges (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4B</xref>). Moreover, those OTUs are more sparsely distributed across different modules in the infected generated network compared to the uninfected network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4D vs. Fig. S4C</xref>). The changes in connectivity patterns, particularly among the OTUs in the infected network, further highlight the reduced complexity and increased structural division in networks generated from infected samples.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>HCom confer protection against <italic>Albugo</italic> infection to varying degrees</title><p id="P14">To investigate the protective effects of the selected microbes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) against the infection caused by <italic>Albugo</italic>, first, a mixture of <italic>Albugo</italic> and each of the four microbes from HCom was sprayed onto <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). The level of protection was determined by measuring the percentage of infected leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). All four candidates significantly decreased the infection caused by <italic>Albugo</italic> (Dunn test, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05). <italic>Cystofilobasidium</italic> exhibited the most pronounced effect, reducing <italic>Albugo</italic> levels by an average of 73%. <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> caused a 66% reduction, followed by <italic>Rhogostoma</italic> and <italic>Methylobacterium</italic>, which resulted in 53% and 40% decreases in <italic>Albugo</italic> infection, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). These observations were further confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis, which demonstrated that samples exposed to the uninfected-associated microbes exhibited substantially lower amounts of <italic>Albugo</italic> as compared to control samples (Dunn test, <italic>P &lt;</italic> 0.05), with the average biomass of <italic>Albugo</italic> ranging from 72% to 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). These results demonstrate that all the selected candidates associated with uninfected plants, namely, <italic>Cystofilobasidium, Methylobacterium, Rhogostoma</italic>, and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic>, significantly decreased the infection levels of <italic>Albugo</italic>.

Three distinct phenotypes were observed. Plants colonized with the DCom bacteria <italic>Duganella</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> exhibited high mortality rates, with 10.0% and 11.3% survival, respectively, within three weeks post-colonization. As expected, the filamentous pathogenic <italic>Plectospherella</italic> and <italic>Albugo</italic> caused characteristic infection symptoms, namely, brownish leaves and roots and white rust disease, respectively. Forty-nine percent of the plants treated with HCom <italic>Cystophilobasidium</italic> survived three weeks post-colonization. The healthiest plants were those colonized by the remaining HCom microbes—<italic>Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium</italic>, and <italic>Rhogostoma</italic>-with over 88% of the plants showing no discernible negative consequences. Overall, these results indicate that most HCom microbes lead to healthier plants than DCom microbes, underscoring the importance of specific microbial candidates in enhancing plant vitality and resistance to pathogen <italic>Albugo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">In this study, we identify microbial signatures that distinguish between infected and uninfected plants and explore their potential for developing effective probiotics to promote plant health. The management of plant health through natural probiotics has gained significant ecological and economic interest. Various microbes and synthetic microbial communities have been found to increase plant resistance to pathogens under laboratory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Pathogens are known to impact the phyllosphere microbiome to establish their niche [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Recent studies show that pathogens, including <italic>Verticillium</italic> and <italic>Albugo</italic>, release effector proteins to manipulate the microbial landscape, affecting microbiome composition and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. However, there is a gap in understanding these interactions under natural field conditions, where pathogens face a complex and heterogeneous host microbiome and abiotic stressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Our study addresses this by investigating microbial communities associated with <italic>A. thaliana</italic> under natural field conditions over six years, focusing on changes in the presence or absence of <italic>Albugo</italic> infection.</p><p id="P18">Agler et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] reported that the diversity of bacterial communities was lower in <italic>Albugo</italic>-infected plants. Extending this observation, our analysis of six-year time series data, along with 18S eukaryotic data, revealed that not only bacterial and fungal diversity affected by infection, but there was an even more pronounced loss of diversity within 18S nonfungal eukaryotic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). This loss was observed in 3 out of 5 host genotypes that showed susceptibility to infection, leading to up to a 22% variation in the microbiome composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). We attribute this reduction in diversity to a significant increase in the pathogen population, which can disrupt the balance of the established microbial community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. In the case of <italic>Albugo</italic> infection, this imbalance may result from the pathogen’s efficient suppression of host defenses, allowing non-host pathogens to proliferate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], or from the release of microbial-modulating effector proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Both mechanisms likely contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the pathogen’s niche within the host.</p><p id="P19">To identify signatures, the pathogen <italic>Albugo</italic> imposes on the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> microbiome, we used machine learning prediction models to identify non-linear relationships and manage the complexity of the high-dimensional data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Therefore, we conducted a systematic analysis of variations between uninfected and infected plant statuses, achieving highly accurate classifications up to 91% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). These findings suggest the presence of predictive microbial signatures in these groups. Using the feature selection technique, we pinpointed 3.1% of OTUs, including bacteria, fungi, and nonfungal eukaryotes, as key discriminators between infected and uninfected plants, corresponding to HCom and DCom microbes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). These results highlight that, despite the vast microbial diversity, only a small subset is significantly associated with plant health outcomes. Interestingly, we found that HCom and DCom microbes are distributed across various network modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Modularity in microbial interaction networks can indicate diverse habitats, varying selective pressures, and phylogenetic clustering of related species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], highlighting the crucial role of these microbes in the functionality of different community modules within the overall microbial community.</p><p id="P20">Building on these findings, we aimed to test whether microbial isolates matching the taxa identified by our machine learning prediction models could promote health or disease status in field conditions. Here, we could show that the predicted HCom and DCom microbiome comprises distinct phylogenetic groups of bacteria, fungi, and nonfungal eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Interestingly, some taxa were represented in both infected and uninfected samples. These included known pathogens like the fungal Ascomycetes genus <italic>Alternaria</italic>, saprophytic fungi such as the Basidiomycete yeast genera <italic>Dioszegia</italic> and <italic>Cystofilobasidium</italic> and the Ascomycetes order <italic>Heliotales</italic>. In addition, the bacterial genera <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> were also present in both groups. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> is particularly notable for its ambivalent behavior, with a broad range of sublineages that can be either pathogenic or protective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], either through microbe-microbe interactions or host interactions ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. This diversity was reflected in our dataset, where <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> OTU5 and OTU6 were predicted to be associated with infected samples, while <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> OTU110 was associated with health. A similar diversity has been reported for <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], which, similar to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, can protect <italic>A. thaliana</italic> from pathogenic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].</p><p id="P21">Given their relevance to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> health, we selected <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> isolates for testing. Our tests confirmed that the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolate was pathogenic, while the <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> isolate did not harm the plant when colonizing the host alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). From our HCom microbes, <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> showed further robust suppressive effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). This is consistent with previous observations that <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> is able to suppress <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> disease symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Further to the genera of <italic>Spnignomonas</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, members of the <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> genus and the family <italic>Oxalobacteriaceae</italic> are highly adapted to live on plants with high abundance and diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. While <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> was predicted to be HCom in our analyses, the <italic>Oxalobacteriaceae</italic> genus <italic>Duganella</italic> was strongly associated with <italic>Albugo</italic> infection. Our experiment validated that the <italic>Duganella</italic> isolate exhibited pathogenic behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>).</p><p id="P22">Among the HCom selected microbes, the basidiomycete yeast <italic>Cystofilobasidium</italic> exhibited the strongest protective effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). <italic>Cystofilobasidium</italic> is particularly note-worthy, as several basidiomycete yeasts have been empirically identified as biocontrol agents against postharvest diseases in various fruits. This includes our computationally identified yeasts <italic>Vishniacozyma</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] and <italic>Leucosporidium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], as well as our experimentally validated yeast, <italic>Cystofilobasidium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. Beyond yeast, another crucial group influencing plant health is the <italic>Cercozoa</italic>, which plays a significant role in shaping bacterial and fungal communities through selective predation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Our study demonstrates that the HCom <italic>Rhogostoma</italic> can suppress infection. As primary microbial predators, <italic>Rhogostoma</italic> directly targets bacterial and fungal pathogens, exerting a consumptive effect on various pathogenic strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. The reduction in infection levels may occur through direct consumption of <italic>Albugo</italic> zoospores or by preying on bacterial and fungal species that facilitate <italic>Albugo</italic> infection. Additionally, <italic>Rhogostoma</italic> may indirectly contribute to plant health by promoting beneficial microbes and enhancing interactive activities, such as biofilm formation, as has been recently shown for the protist <italic>Cercomonas lenta</italic> in the rhizosphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>].</p><p id="P23">In summary, our findings support the concept of functional similarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], where diverse microbial taxa, including bacteria, fungi, and nonfungal eukaryotes, share over-lapping ecological roles that contribute to plant health. This concept suggests that while different microbial species can perform similar functions, their effectiveness may vary depending on environmental conditions. Therefore, if abiotic factors (e.g., radiation and humidity) become unfavorable for one group, others can compensate, ensuring continued protection against pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Leveraging functional similarity presents promising opportunities for biocontrol methods to reduce pathogen pressure across diverse environmental conditions. As climate change increases the frequency of environmental fluctuations, leading to greater stress on plants, enhancing environmental resilience through the use of robust probiotics will be essential for future food security.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="S10"><title>Diversity analysis</title><p id="P24">The OTU tables for bacteria, fungi, and nonfungal eukaryotes, along with the corresponding genotype clusters for each sample, were obtained from the study by Mahmoudi et al.

Subsequently, OTU abundance tables were utilized to compute Shannon’s H diversity index using the ‘estimate-richness’ function in the Phyloseq R package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>] for estimating alpha-diversity. To assess between-sample diversity, relative abundance OTU tables were computed and transformed using log10 (x + 1) before calculating Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, which were then employed for nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination (NMDS) using the ‘ordinate’ function in Phyloseq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>] R package. Three PERMANOVA analysis on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities were conducted to identify the primary factors (‘infection stages’, ‘combined infection stages and genotype’ and ‘combined infection stages and sampling sites’) influencing the leaf microbiome’s structure, utilizing the ‘adonis2’ function in the Vegan package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] with 10,000 permutations (P &lt; 0.05). A beta-dispersion analysis on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities was conducted to compare sample-to-sample variation within each group (genotype clusters and sampling sites) (multivariate homogeneity of group dispersion analysis, “betadisper”; Vegan package).

A processed dataset was created using two binary labels, ‘infected’ and ‘uninfected,’ corresponding to the phenotype of the collected plants. Plants were labeled ‘infected’ if white rust disease caused by <italic>Albugo</italic> was observed and ‘uninfected’ if it was not. The scikit-learn package in the Python programming environment was used to train and validate machine learning classifiers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>].

The prediction results were compared with the actual labels of the samples to calculate the models’ performance in terms of accuracy (accuracy_score function), f-measure (f1_score function, average=‘macro’), precision (precision_score, average=‘macro’), and recall (recall_score function). The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using false positive and true positive rates (roc_curve function) and plotted using the matplotlib package. The importance of each OTU in the trained models was obtained using model.coef_ (for Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression) and model.feature_importances_ (for Random Forest).
