In this sense, also the RNA Polymerase complexes responsible for transcription can be affected in cancers. We find that upregulations of RNA Polymerase II subunits, especially the largest ones, correlates with poor cancer patients’ outcome across a range of tumor types, presenting increased genome instability. Overexpressing the subunits RPB1, RPB3 and RPB4 in cells we find that these induce DNA damage. However, the mechanisms behind this increased genome instability are specific for each subunit, linked to the unique transcription alterations generated by the subunit overexpression. Importantly, we find significant overlap between the genes with more DNA damage in our cell line models and those more affected in cancers with subunit upregulation, indicating that upregulations could be responsible for some of the phenotypes present in these patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Deregulated transcription is a well-established hallmark of cancer cells, consequence of deregulated signaling pathways or altered expression of transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. However, in it has become evident that together with sequence specific DNA-binding factors, also the basal transcription machinery of general transcription factors and RNA Polymerase complexes can be deregulated in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. For example, RNA Polymerase I (RNAPI) is induced by the oncogene MYC to support cell growth, making cells reliant on RNAPI activity and sensitizing them to RNAPI inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Equally, RNA Polymerase III (RNAPIII) has been long known to be highly expressed in cancer tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Regarding RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII), several publications have highlighted how single subunits present deregulated expression levels and/or are mutated in many cancer types (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>). Nevertheless, it remains still unclear whether deregulations of the subunits in cancers are associated with specific oncogenic drivers, or whether they could directly affect patients’ outcome contributing to specific cancer phenotypes. In the RNAPII, 3 out of the 12 subunits form the active site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, with structural studies showing that the largest subunits are central for the interaction with several transcription-associated complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, recent data have highlighted how each subunit may have specific roles during transcription, as degron degradation of any of the 12 RNAPII subunits presented specific transcription defects, even though degron degradation of one subunit was sometimes associated with destabilization of multiple subunits together<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, to determine which deregulations of the RNAPII complex subunits correlated more with reduced cancer patients’ survival, and whether they shared specific phenotypes across different cancer types, we performed an analysis of all The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets available through cBioPortal. This analysis found that in particular upregulations of the four largest subunits of the complex (genes POLR2A-D/subunits RPB1-4) correlated with poor outcomes in a range of tumors, characterized by increased genome instability, and not linked to a specific oncogenic driver. We also found poor to no correlation between the expression levels of the subunits, indicating that cancer cells would be experiencing deregulated expression of one subunit at the time. We hypothesized that non-stochiometric expression of single subunits could compete with the RNAPII on chromatin for transcription factors, consequently deregulating RNAPII transcription. To test this hypothesis, we established doxycycline inducible cell line models able to overexpress three of the largest subunits of the complex, RPB1/POLR2A, RPB3/POLR2C and RPB4/POLR2D. Using these systems and a combination of cell biology and genome-wide approaches, we found that overexpression of each subunit induced increased transcription activity, increased DNA damage levels and altered C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylation patterns of the RNAPII. Importantly, the DNA damage was specifically linked to the deregulations of the CTD induced by the overexpression of the single subunit. Moreover, we showed that the transcription defects and genome instability induced by RPB3/POLR3C overexpression were mainly caused by defective recruitment of BRD4 to the RNAPII complex. Finally, we uncovered that the genes with increased DNA damage levels in cells when we overexpressed a subunit, often presented higher levels of genomic alterations particularly in cancer patients with subunits’ upregulations. All in all, this study has identified how deregulated expressions of the RNAPII subunits could contribute directly to some of the phenotypes found in the affected patients. Moreover, it highlighted how deregulation of subunits of the complex might affect the interchange of transcription factors with the RNAPII complex on chromatin because of altered CTD phosphorylation patterns. This would lead to defective transcription, important for the efficient transcription of genes but also for genome stability maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cancer genomic databases analysis</title><p id="P4">For the analysis of RPB1-12/POLR2A-L deregulations we assessed data through cBioPortal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cbioportal.org">http://cbioportal.org</ext-link>) updated in September 2024.

However, in many of these studies only the impact of one kind of deregulation was analyzed, and/or any effect of the RNAPII subunit was assessed in the context of the specific cancer type, and not compared across different cancer types or datasets. Therefore, to determine which deregulations are associated with altered patients’ survival, we performed a systematic analysis of all RNAPII subunits deregulations across all TCGA studies available through cBioPortal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, to identify the deregulations with the biggest impact. This analysis determined that deregulations of single subunits are frequently found, with 21% of all cancer samples in the TCGA studies presenting a deregulation of at least one subunit, with genomic amplifications the most frequent events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>). Importantly, subunits’ deregulations correlated with reduced overall survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). When patients were clustered according to the deregulation subtype in “mutations”, “amplifications” or “homozygous deletions”, it was specifically genomic amplifications of any of the 12 subunits that was associated with poor survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). At the same time, mutations had no effect on survival and patients with genomic homozygous deletions presented a slightly improved survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). Therefore, we further investigated the impact of gain of functions deregulations of the subunits, combining genomic amplifications with transcriptional upregulations. This allowed us to identify seven separate cancers, where upregulations of the subunits correlated with reduced survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>). Intriguingly, this was almost invariably due to upregulations of any of the 4 largest subunits clustered together (RPB1-4), separated from the upregulations of the other 7 subunits (RPB5-12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). This indicated that perhaps upregulations of the largest subunits of the complex could have a bigger impact on patients’ survival than the remaining subunits. To determine whether upregulation of a subunit was associated with increased expression levels of the whole RNAPII complex, we analyzed how the expression levels of RPB1-4 correlated with each other, finding that these were very variable across the characterized cancers, and generally not very high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). To further address this point we determined the correlations between mRNA and protein expression levels of all subunits across hundreds of cancer cell lines using DepMap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/portal/">https://depmap.org/portal/</ext-link>), finding again overall poor correlations across all subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1C</xref>). This would indicate that in a specific cancer patient, we would be observing higher levels of the single subunit rather than upregulation of the whole complex. Next, we determined whether upregulations of single subunits were associated with specific cancer driver mutations, and whether this was the reason for the correlation with reduced survival. To do this, we analyzed the co-occurrence of subunits upregulations with deregulations with any of the five major cancer drivers specific to the cancer type according to IntOGen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.intogen.org/search">https://www.intogen.org/search</ext-link>). This showed upregulations of RPB1-4 co-occurring in several cases together with p53 deregulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1D</xref>). However, patients with deregulations in p53 alone had similar survival rates to patients with only RPB1-4 upregulations in the cancers analyzed, and it was patients with combined deregulation in p53 and upregulation of RPB1-4 that had significantly worse survival than the others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1E</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We hypothesized therefore that upregulations would lead to non-stochiometric expression of single subunits of the RNAPII. The overexpressed subunit could compete with the RNAPII complex on chromatin for specific transcription factors, potentially affecting RNAPII progression and/or transcription regulation. Deregulated transcription can lead to increased DNA damage in the form of transcription-associated mutagenesis and transcription-associated recombination, consequence of the interference of RNAPII transcription with other processes taking place on chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Hence, we determined whether indeed patients with upregulations of RPB1-4 presented also increased genome instability, finding that overall, they presented higher levels of copy number alterations (CNA) and mutational counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1F</xref>). Altogether, this analysis identified that upregulations of the four largest RNAPII subunits correlated with poor cancer patients’ outcome across a range of cancers, presenting increased genome instability, with upregulations appearing not associated with well-established oncogenic deregulations.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Overexpression of single RNAPII subunits increases DNA damage levels on genes</title><p id="P17">To test whether overexpression of single subunits affected RNAPII transcription inducing DNA damage, we generated doxycycline-responsive cell lines able to overexpress three RNAPII subunits at the time, RPB1, RPB3 and RPB4, plus empty vector control cell lines. Following doxycycline induction, mRNA levels of the subunits by real-time PCR raised by similar levels in all three cell lines compared to the control cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>), visible also at the protein level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2A</xref>). Moreover, the increase in mRNA levels was comparable with the higher expression levels observed in cancer patients with upregulations of the subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2B</xref>). First, we analyzed DNA damage markers levels by immunofluorescence. A common DNA damage marker is Ser139-phosphorylation of histone H2A.X (γH2AX), whose phosphorylation is carried out in a redundant manner by different DNA damage sensor kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Following overexpression of RPB1/3/4 for 48h we observed in all cases increased global γH2AX, indicating an overall increase in DNA damage levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). We also quantified γH2AX foci numbers fold change following doxycycline addition compared to the control cell line, to take into account the effect of doxycycline alone on foci formation, finding that only with RPB3 overexpression there was a significant increase in the γH2AX foci number per cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2C</xref>). Next, we analyzed 53BP1, that forms discreet foci at sites of DNA double strand breaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and bigger structures called bodies evidence of unresolved DNA lesions caused by replication stress which are not correctly repaired before cell division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. We found that 53BP1 foci fold changes were significantly increased following overexpression of all subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2C</xref>), with bodies also increased but not significantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2D</xref>). Analysis of other markers of DNA damage like micronuclei and mitotic errors (anaphase bridges and lagging chromosomes), showed that these increased only following overexpression of RPB3 and RPB4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2E</xref>). These data indicated that while the overexpression of all subunits induced DNA damage, the specific type of DNA damage could be different between the three subunits, indicating potentially different mechanisms behind the genome instability. Often, deregulated transcription increases DNA damage because of accumulation or persistence of R-loops, three-stranded secondary structures formed by the nascent RNA hybridized with the DNA template strand which can lead to transcription associated mutagenesis and recombination events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Analysis with the S9.6 antibody which recognizes R-loop structures did not show increased R-loop intensity upon doxycycline induced overexpression of RPB1 and RPB3, and if anything, a 15% average reduction in signal following RPB4 overexpression, indicating that increased R-loops formation is unlikely responsible for the increased genome instability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2F</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Therefore, to identify and characterize where DNA damage occurred, we performed a chromatin immuno-precipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) of γH2AX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. γH2AX average metagene profiles over transcribed genes showed that overexpression of all three subunits generally increased DNA damage levels, but the actual profiles were different between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>). This agreed with the analysis of the DNA damage markers, highlighting differences between the overexpression of the three subunits induced DNA damage. We found that when we assessed genes with a &gt;1.5 fold-change (FC) increase in γH2AX levels there was a strong significant overlap between genes affected by RPB3 and RPB4 overexpressions, while those affected by RPB1 overexpression where different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>). In support of this, we found an overall significant correlation between γH2AX fold changes over all transcribed genes following RPB3 and RPB4 overexpression, but no correlations between γH2AX fold changes following RPB3 or RPB4 overexpression and RPB1 induced DNA damage levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2G</xref>). On average, genes with more DNA damage were enriched in short genes compared to all transcribed ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2G</xref>) and were involved in similar biological processes according to their gene ontology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2H</xref>). Altogether, our data indicated that small overexpression of a single subunit was sufficient to induce genome instability in cells, with differences in the DNA damage observed indicating that the mechanisms driving this DNA damage could be potentially diverse between the three subunits. Deregulated transcription can interfere with DNA replication inducing DNA damage, with DNA damage often arising more likely at sites with the most pronounced transcription defect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, or at the first gene encountered by the replication forks proceeding from replication origins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. To test for the latter, we compared the distance from the genes we found accumulating γH2AX following overexpression of the subunits to the nearest replication origin identified in HeLa cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, finding that genes with more DNA damage were not significantly closer to origins than the average transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2H</xref>). This was indicating that these genes were perhaps those more transcriptionally affected by the overexpression of the subunit. Hence, we analyzed into details how RNAPII transcription is deregulated following subunits overexpression.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Overexpression of single subunits alters nascent transcription activity</title><p id="P19">To analyze RNAPII nascent transcription activity, we performed a transient transcription sequencing, TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.

Yeast spike-ins were used for normalization to allow quantification of global changes in nascent transcription levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Average metagene TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq profiles following subunits’ overexpression showed that they all increased nascent transcription activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Upon closer gene to gene analysis and analysis along different gene regions, it appeared that each subunit had slightly different effects on transcription activity. Overexpression of RPB1 increased TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq levels of over 50% from the transcription start site (TSS) to the gene body and the transcription termination site (TTS)+2kb region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>) compared to the uninduced samples. In the case of RPB3, TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq levels increased of 36% around the TSS and 30% in the gene body, while only 22% in the 2kb downstream the TTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). Finally, RPB4 overexpression resulted in increased TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq signal at the TSS and the gene body of 18% and 14% respectively, and 7.4% downstream of the TTS. Based on these observations, we analyzed transcription progression comparing the TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq levels around the TSS (-50/+300bp) to the rest of the gene body (+300bp-TTS) performing a travel ratio analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, finding small differences following subunits overexpression, more pronounced following RPB3 overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3A</xref>). This indicated that on average, subunits’ overexpression increased RNAPII activity on genes with potential effects also on the transition rate between initiation and elongation and/or altering elongation rates.</p><p id="P20">Given that increased transcription activity has been previously linked to increased DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, we analyzed whether genes with increased DNA damage were also those more affected by the changes in transcription activity. To do so, we compared the changes in TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq levels on the genes with &gt;1.5 FC in γH2AX levels following the overexpression of the single subunits against all the remaining genes. Intriguingly, there was no difference on how much TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq levels changed around the TSS or within gene bodies on the genes most affected by the DNA damage against all other genes, except for a very small but significant lower FC following RPB3 overexpression in the gene body of genes with more DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig 3B</xref>). This indicated that there was no direct link between the increased transcription activity on these genes and the increased DNA damage levels. Therefore, we investigated into more details the impact of subunits overexpressions on RNAPII regulation.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Overexpressions of RPB1, RPB3 and RPB4 alter differently CTD phosphorylation and transcription elongation</title><p id="P21">To determine the impact of RPB1, RPB3 and RPB4 overexpression on RNAPII transcription, we performed an analysis of RNAPII and its CTD phosphorylated forms Ser2 and Ser5. Ser2-phosphorylation (Ser2-P) and Ser5-phosphorylation (Ser5-P) occur at specific stages of the transcription process and are the best characterized CTD-phosphorylation modifications, important to regulate the interchange of RNAPII-associated factors during transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. First of all, performing a gene-to-gene fold change of the ChIP-Seq levels upon addition of doxycycline in the EV control cell lines, we found that even 10ng/ml of doxycycline was sufficient to alter RNAPII levels on chromatin and the phosphorylation of the CTD domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4A</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed the impact of the overexpression of each subunit normalizing for the effect of doxycycline in the empty vector cell lines, as previously done with the DNA damage markers analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>). This analysis found that the overexpression of each subunit affected in a different way RNAPII levels and CTD-phosphorylation. RPB1 overexpression increased globally RNAPII levels on chromatin, on average of 34% in a gene-to-gene comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>), similarly to what was shown by the TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). At the same time, there was almost no change in Ser2 or Ser5 phosphorylation levels, indicating that when normalized to the total RNAPII levels on genes, this was not properly phosphorylated on Ser2 and Ser5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">FigS2A</xref>). In agreement with the increased TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq signal downstream of the TTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>), we also observed increased total RNAPII levels downstream of specific genes, like highly transcribed ribosomal genes or NABP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4B</xref>). This same gene was found similarly affected also upon degron degradation of RPB1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, indicating that RPB1 levels, either degron degradation or overexpression, influenced transcription termination. The overexpression of RPB3 presented instead a mixed phenotype. On average we found a global reduction in total RNAPII levels and a profound increase in Ser2-P levels, also visible at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>), with almost no change in Ser5-P. At a more careful analysis, we found that 16.3% of the genes presented a different phenotype, with increased total RNAPII levels and only slightly increased Ser2-P levels instead, and a more pronounced increase in Ser5-P (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4C</xref>). Cross-correlating these two groups with the TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq data, we found that they were nearly identical in their TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq level changes either at the TSS or the gene body (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4D</xref>), although there was a clear separation in the gene lengths between the two groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4E</xref>). Altogether, this indicated that following the overexpression of RPB3, a smaller group of genes presented increased RNAPII levels and increased transcription output, while most genes presented increased transcription output with reduced RNAPII occupancy. Finally, overexpression of RPB4 reduced total RNAPII levels on chromatin, slightly increased Ser2 levels and presented a more marked reduction in Ser5-P levels, both in the average metagene and by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>). Also in this case, we distinguished two classes of genes, both with reduced Ser5-P levels, 10.7% of genes with increased RNAPII and unaffected Ser2-P, and the rest with decreased RNAPII and increased Ser2-P (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4F</xref>).

Therefore, the uncoupling between the TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq and RNAPII ChIP-Seq signals would indicate that overexpression of either RPB3 or RPB4 could also affect transcription elongation rates, accelerating RNAPII progression especially along shorter genes.</p><p id="P22">Given the complexity of the impact of the subunits’ overexpression on RNAPII regulation and elongation, we analyzed whether the increased genome instability was associated with a specific deregulation. In the case of RPB1 overexpression, we found that genes with a &gt;1.5FC in γH2AX levels presented an even more marked increase in total RNAPII and reduction of Ser2-P, but there was no correlation with the changes in Ser5-P levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4E</xref>). When we analyzed genes with higher γH2AX levels following RPB3 overexpression we found that these presented overall a more marked reduction in total RNAPII levels, even higher levels of Ser2-P levels and slightly lower Ser5-P levels compared to the rest of the genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4F</xref>). Indeed, the genes with increased γH2AX levels were almost exclusively within the group of genes with lower total RNAPII levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4I</xref>). Likewise, genes with increased DNA damage levels following RPB4 overexpression presented overall a more pronounced defect in total RNAPII, Ser2-P and Ser-5 compared to the other genes analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4G</xref>) and were almost exclusively within genes with lower total RNAPII levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4J</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Altogether, the ChIP-Seq analysis of RNAPII and RNAPII-CTD phosphorylation patterns showed multiple transcriptional deregulations induced by the overexpression of each single subunit.

Therefore, considering the widespread changes induced by the overexpressed subunits to the CTD phosphorylation patterns, it was not surprising finding that many transcription factors presented altered chromatin recruitment following subunits overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5A</xref>). More noticeable, BRD4 presented reduced chromatin recruitment following overexpression of RPB3, and reduced interaction with the RNAPII on chromatin by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). BRD4, a member of the BET protein family, regulates and activates p-TEFb for Ser2-P on the RNAPII CTD, and it was previously shown that inhibition or down-regulation of BRD4 increased Ser2-P and DNA damage levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Thus, we analyzed into more details whether the deregulated chromatin recruitment of BRD4 was responsible for the phenotypes found following RPB3 overexpression. To do this, we overexpressed BRD4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5B</xref>), finding that this reduced significantly the genome instability and transcription activity induced by RPB3 overexpression, measured by immunofluorescence levels of γH2AX and EU Click-iT incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>). Next, we analyzed whether genes with &gt;1.5 FC γH2AX levels following RPB3 overexpression were also those more affected by the loss of BRD4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, finding a significant overlap specifically with genes increasing expression following BRD4 loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref>). These data therefore would indicate that the overexpression of RPB3 affects the recruitment of BRD4 with the RNAPII, and this can then alter transcription activity and regulation on a subset of specific genes, leading to increased genome instability. Finally, we tested whether this defect in BRD4 recruitment was also sensitizing cells to the BET protein family inhibitor JQ1. In agreement with all the previous data, cells overexpressing RPB3 were specifically sensitive to JQ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5D</xref>), further supported by data analysis on the DepMap portal, finding a significant correlation between RPB3 expression levels in 760 cell lines and their sensitivity to JQ1, and a separate BET family inhibitor, I-BET151 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5C</xref>). Altogether, this analysis identified BRD4 as a major factor deregulated by RPB3 overexpression, mostly responsible for driving increased transcription activity and increased genome instability in cells, sensitizing at the same time cells to a JQ1.</p><p id="P25">In the case of RPB4 overexpression, as cells presented reduced Ser5-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4F-G</xref>), this suggested a potential defect in the recruitment/regulation of the major Ser5-P kinase CDK7, part of the TFIIH complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.

To further support a link between the genes presenting higher DNA damage levels following RPB4 overexpression and CDK7 activity, we analyzed how these genes were affected following treatment with THZ1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. We found that genes more genome unstable following RPB4 overexpression were downregulated significantly faster compared to other transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5D</xref>), indicating that these genes were particularly reliant on CDK7 activity for their transcription. At the same time, cells overexpressing RPB1 that were not presenting only milder defects in Ser2-P or Ser5-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>) were not sensitive to either JQ1 or THZ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>).

Therefore, we determined whether there was overlap between the genes with more DNA damage found in our HeLa T-Rex cells after subunits overexpression, and those more frequently genomically altered in the cancers. To do this, we compared how frequently genes with &gt;1.5FC γH2AX levels following subunits overexpression were either copy number altered or mutated in TCGA datasets, compared to control patients without upregulation of the three assessed subunits. First, we analyzed all TCGA datasets together as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A-B</xref>, comparing patients with an amplified subunit to patients without any subunit affected. The genes with more γH2AX found when we overexpressed subunits presented generally low levels of copy number alterations (CNA) and mutations in control cancer patients without subunits amplifications, indicating that these were not the most genome unstable genes in cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>). However, in patients with amplification of either RPB1, RPB3 or RPB4, these genes were much more frequently genomic altered, either amplified or deleted, and to a lesser extent accumulated mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>). Importantly, this was not an indication of increased CNA levels across transcribed genes, as we found for example that in the case of RPB3 and RPB4 genes that presented &lt;0.5FC γH2AX levels following subunits overexpression, were also significantly less CNA compared to genes &gt;1.5FC γH2AX levels in cancers with subunit amplification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6A</xref>). Next, we expanded this analysis to the specific cancer datasets that showed reduced survival following subunits upregulation. In the case of BIC and UCEC, we found strong increases in CNA levels for the genes presenting higher levels of genome instability in cells following overexpression, for each of the subunit analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6B</xref>). In the case of BLGG and KIRP we found increased CNA levels only in cases with RPB4 upregulations, while in LIHC, AML and KICH we found lower levels of genome instability across the selected genes independently of the subunit upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6B</xref>). These data therefore indicate that at the global pan-cancer level there is a correlation between the genes we found more genome unstable in the cell line model and those more genomically altered in the cancers with subunit’s deregulation, valid also for some of the cancer types initially identified based on the impact on survival. It would also indicate that subunits upregulations, through their deregulated transcription, could directly contribute to the increased genome instability observed across these genes in cancers, linking in this way their upregulations to the reduced survival.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">Independently of the specific oncogenic driver, oncogenes will ultimately lead to changes to the transcription program to support their transformative action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Over the years many sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors have been found to be highly relevant oncogenes, and more recently this list has been extended also to the general transcription machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. The RNAPII complex in this sense had been previously found deregulated in many cancers, with deregulations associated with higher cancer proliferation, tumor progression and drug resistance across a broad range of cancer types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Our study has indeed validated that deregulations of RNAPII subunits are frequently found in cancers, with 21% of all cancer samples in the TCGA PanCancer studies presenting at least one genomic alteration in any of the 12 subunits of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A</xref>). Importantly, by performing a pan-cancer analysis, we found how in particular amplifications of the subunits correlated with reduced cancer patients’ survival, and identified seven cancer types where this was correlating in particular with upregulations in any of the four largest subunits of the complex, RPB1-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). While this indicated that upregulations in RPB1-4 correlated more with patients’ reduced outcome than the rest of the complex, it was in no way indicating that it was exclusively RPB1-4 deregulations that were always associated with poor outcome. Another feature shared by cancers with RPB1-4 upregulations was the increased genome instability, in particular CNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>), a typical hallmark of cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Therefore, to determine whether genome instability could be directly induced by RPB1-4 upregulation, we generated doxycycline inducible cell lines able to overexpress one subunit at the time and determined how these overexpressions affected transcription and genome stability. Our data indicated that small overexpression of either RPB1, RPB3 or RPB4, were sufficient to increase DNA damage levels in cells, with subunit-specific differences on how the overexpression impacted on genome stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>). A multi-genomic characterization of transcription activity and regulation found that all overexpressions were able to increase transcription activity globally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>). However, how each subunit overexpression deregulated transcription was subunit specific, and genes with increased genome instability showed changes in transcription activity like those of other transcribed genes. We were able to identify how each subunit overexpression deregulated the CTD phosphorylation pattern of the RNAPII in a unique way, and how genes with increased γH2AX levels presented also the more marked changes to RNAPII and CTD phosphorylation levels by ChIP-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). This was particularly noteworthy in the case of RPB3 and RPB4 overexpressions, where we identified distinguished sets of genes with separate changes to total RNAPII, Ser2-P and Ser5-P levels, only one of which linked to the increased DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>).

Regarding RPB1, as the largest subunit of the complex that contains also the highly post-translationally modified CTD domain, it could be somehow hypothesised that non-stochiometric expression of RPB1 could affect transcription regulation. Intriguingly, we found that RPB1 overexpression or RPB1 degron degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> presented a transcription termination defect across the same set of genes, emphasising how RPB1 stoichiometry is essential for transcription termination control. However, our data show that also non-stochiometric expression RPB3 and RPB4 have profound consequences for transcription regulation and genome instability, perhaps even more than the overexpression of RPB1. Cross-referencing our data, we have found instances like the overexpression of RPB1 showing increased RNAPII occupancy and increased TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq signal, indicating overall increased transcription, and others like overexpression of RPB3 and RPB4, where the RNAPII ChIP-Seq occupancy and the TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq signal were going in opposite direction, indicative of a change in elongation rates. Increased transcription elongation rates were previously found following the knock-down of RECQL5, although genome instability was linked to increased RNAPII stalling/pausing (transcription stress) consequence of the uncontrolled elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In our case, we found that overexpression of RPB3 and RPB4 gave rise to different deregulations of the CTD, both linked to increased elongation rates in particular across shorter genes. Therefore, we would hypothesise that the increased genome instability is consequence of the CTD deregulation, with its impact on the timely recruitment of transcription factors. The increase in TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq and the reduced RNAPII total ChIP-Seq levels in this sense suggest that stalling/pausing of the RNAPII might not be affected.</p><p id="P29">Previously, it was shown that RPB3 exists both associated to the RNAPII complex and in a dissociated form, important for the preferential control of 3’-end processing of ribosomal protein genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. When we overexpressed RPB3, we found that ribosomal genes tend on average to present increased total RNAPII levels across the gene, while TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq levels were not particularly affected either on the gene or 2kb downstream of the TTS, indicating that overexpression of RPB3 is not overall affecting ribosomal gene transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6C</xref>). Our data showed also how RPB3 was important for the recruitment of BRD4 to the RNAPII on chromatin, regulating CDK9 activity and Ser2-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The significance of RPB3 regulation for this process was represented by how much BRD4 deregulation impacted on genome stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). CDK9 is a general transcription factor required globally to regulate RNAPII transcription, however our data indicate that some genes are particularly reliant on its correct regulation, as deregulation of Ser2-P on these genes can lead to increased genome instability. At the same time, we found that 16.3% transcribed genes presented an opposite phenotype following RPB3 overexpression, with increased total RNAPII and very little changes to Ser2-P levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4D</xref>). These genes were almost completely excluded from the list of genes with more DNA damage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4E</xref>), indicating that transcription deregulations are not equally capable of inducing DNA damage. This if further supported by the lack of correlation between TT<sub>chem</sub>-seq signal and γH2AX changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>). Similarly, in the case of the overexpression of RPB4 we found a global reduction in Ser5-P, with genes with increased DNA damage levels presenting a more pronounced Ser5-P defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>), enriched for genes particularly reliant on CDK7 activity for their transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5D</xref>). Altogether, this indicates that while transcription deregulation is a major driver or genome instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, not all transcription deregulations will lead to genome instability.</p><p id="P30">Ser2-P and Ser5-P are two major regulators of RNAPII interactors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, and indeed it was not surprising that many of the transcription-associated factors we tested showed increased/decreased chromatin recruitment following subunits overexpression. It is conceivable that among the factors that recognise the CTD phosphorylation status of RNAPII there could be also some important to preserve genome stability in case of transcription-replication conflicts, and that the increased genome instability could also be consequence of deregulated recruitment of such factors to collision sites. Equally, although we have not assessed directly, it is highly likely that also other CTD post-translational modifications might be affected following subunits overexpression, because of crosstalk between CTD modifications and because CDKs can phosphorylate multiple CTD sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. At the same time, although our analysis focused on the impact of RPB1, RPB3 and RPB4 because of their more prominent impact on cancer patients’ survival, it is highly likely that overexpression of other subunits may also affect RNAPII transcription inducing DNA damage, with future work needed to determine the impact of the remaining subunits.</p><sec id="S20"><title>Conclusions and study limitations</title><p id="P31">Altogether, our study has identified how small overexpression of single subunits of the RNAPII complex can have profound effects on transcription activity, transcription regulation and ultimately genome stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref>). Several genomic assays have calculated elongation rates in multiple cell lines and conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. However, these assays are effective in measuring elongation rates over long genes, and these appear less affected by RPB3 and RPB4 overexpression, making it challenging to apply these assays in these conditions.</p><p id="P32">Intriguingly, we found also a correlation between the genes more affected in our overexpressing cell line (HeLa T-Rex) and those presenting increased genomic alterations in cancer patients baring subunits deregulations. We recognize that this phenotype was only partially recapitulated in the seven cancers we initially identified with reduced patients’ survival correlating with subunits upregulations. Although a well-established cell line, our model cannot recapitulate the phenotypes of all possible cell types, especially as our defects were specifically related to which genes were transcribed in our system. Future work in more appropriate cell lines will be required to determine to what extend subunits upregulations could be a major driver of the genome instability found in these cancers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary
