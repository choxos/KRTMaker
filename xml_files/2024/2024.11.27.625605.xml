A widespread strategy for inter-bacterial competition is the delivery of antibacterial toxins, or effector proteins, directly into rival cells using the Type VI secretion system (T6SS). Whilst a large number of broad-spectrum enzymatic T6SS effectors have been described, relatively few which form pores in target cell membranes have been reported. Here, we describe a widely-occurring new family of T6SS-dependent pore-forming effectors, exemplified by Ssp4 of <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> Db10. We show <italic>in vitro</italic> that Ssp4 forms regulated pores that have higher selectivity for cations and use molecular dynamics simulations to support a high resolution structural model of a tetrameric membrane pore formed by Ssp4. Notably, Ssp4 displays a distinct ion selectivity, phylogenetic distribution and impact on intoxicated cells compared with Ssp6, the other cation-selective pore-forming toxin delivered by the same T6SS. Ssp4 is also active against a wider range of target species than Ssp6, highlighting that T6SS effectors are not always broad-spectrum. Finally, use of Tn-seq to identify Ssp4-resistant mutants reveals that a <italic>mucA</italic> mutant of <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>, which overproduces extracellular polysaccharide, provides resistance to T6SS attacks. We conclude that possession of two distinct T6SS-dependent pore-forming toxins may be a common strategy to ensure effective de-energisation of closely- and distantly-related competitors.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Bacteria typically exist in mixed microbial communities, where competition for resources between and within species represents a constant challenge and a key driver for the evolution of antimicrobial toxins and the molecular machineries that deliver them to competitor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) occurs widely in Gram-negative bacteria and is used to deliver antibacterial toxins, or effector proteins, directly into neighbouring competitors, effectively killing or disabling recipient cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Growing evidence supports a role for the T6SS in determining the success of individual isolates and the composition of the polymicrobial population in a wide variety of host-associated and environmental communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The T6SS is a dynamic protein nanomachine in which contraction of an intracellular sheath structure anchored on a membrane-bound basal complex propels a cell puncturing device out of the secreting cell and into a neighbouring recipient, or target, cell. This expelled puncturing structure, comprising a tube of Hcp tipped with a spike of VgrG and PAAR proteins, is decorated with multiple effector proteins, which either interact with or are covalently fused to the tube or spike proteins, thereby delivering the effectors into the target cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Since the discovery of inter-bacterial competition mediated by the T6SS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, an ever-increasing number of T6SS-delivered antibacterial effectors have been reported, with molecular targets that are conserved and essential in bacterial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The vast majority of these are enzymatic toxins, including families of effectors which cleave the peptidoglycan cell wall, hydrolyse nucleic acids, degrade membrane phospholipids, deplete NAD or ATP, and modify RNA or proteins by ADP-ribosylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Self-intoxication and intoxication by incoming effectors delivered by genetically-identical neighbouring cells is prevented through the co-expression of effector-specific immunity proteins. Immunity proteins are localised at the site of action of their cognate effector, bind tightly and specifically to the effector, and, for enzymatic toxins, typically inhibit effector activity by blocking the active site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. The mode of action of enzymatic effectors can often be predicted by sequence homology or structural prediction, including, more recently, with the use of AlphaFold2 which can typically generate reliable predictions for soluble enzymatic domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. A small number of T6SS effectors have been reported which, by contrast, act as pore forming toxins in recipient cell membranes, including two shown to form cation-selective pores <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, identification of such effectors has been hampered by the fact that their function is much harder to predict <italic>in silico</italic>, given they typically present as small proteins with no homologues of known structure or function, and we believe that they represent a larger contribution to the pool of antibacterial effectors than is currently appreciated.</p><p id="P4"><italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen which is widespread in diverse environmental niches and represents a significant cause of antibiotic-resistant hospital-acquired infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The T6SS of the model strain <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 is well characterised and displays potent anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity. Ten effectors delivered by this T6SS have been identified by secretomic and genetic studies, including anti-bacterial effectors with peptidoglycan amidase (Ssp1 and Ssp2), DNase (Rhs2), and NAD(P)<sup>+</sup>-glycohydrolase (Rhs1) activity, and two anti-fungal effectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. This T6SS also delivers the ion-selective pore forming effector Ssp6, which forms cation-selective pores <italic>in vitro</italic> and, as a consequence, disrupts the inner membrane potential <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Another effector, Ssp4, was identified in the T6SS-dependent secretome of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 and subsequently shown to possess antibacterial activity which was observable upon expression in the periplasm of <italic>E. coli</italic> and neutralised by a cognate immunity protein, Sip4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, no function could be readily ascribed to Ssp4, given a lack of sequence or structural similarity with any T6SS-associated or other proteins described previously.</p><p id="P5">Here, we report that Ssp4 forms cation-selective pores in the membrane of susceptible bacterial cells and represents the founding member of a widely-occurring new family of T6SS-dependent pore-forming toxins. Importantly, we show that Ssp4 is active against a wider range of target species than the other cation-selective pore-forming toxin delivered by this T6SS, Ssp6, revealing that not all T6SS antibacterial effectors have broad spectrum activity. We further demonstrate that the ion selectivities of the pores formed by Ssp4 and Ssp6 are distinct and provide the first high resolution model of a membrane pore formed by a T6SS-delivered effector. Our data support a model whereby possession of two distinct T6SS-dependent pore-forming toxins ensures effective de-energisation of both closely- and distantly-related competitors.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>The properties of Ssp4 and Sip4 are consistent with Ssp4 being a membrane-targeting effector</title><p id="P6">Ssp4 is encoded with its cognate immunity protein, Sip4, within a three gene insertion in the isoleucine, leucine and valine (<italic>ilv</italic>) gene cluster of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). AlphaFold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> was used to generate a high confidence structural prediction for Ssp4, comprising 13 α-helices and one β-sheet (pLDDT value 85.9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>). Regions within three of these α-helices were predicted to represent transmembrane helices by MEMSAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b,c</xref>), indicating that Ssp4 may have the ability to integrate into membranes. However, no Ssp4 homologues of known or predicted function were identified in sequence databases and no convincing structural homologues were retrieved when the predicted structure of Ssp4 was used to search the Protein Data Bank.</p><p id="P7">In order to investigate the mode of toxicity of Ssp4, <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 was transformed with plasmids directing the expression of Ssp4, either retained in the cytoplasm or fused to an N-terminal signal peptide for export to the periplasm (sp-Ssp4). Inducing expression of sp-Ssp4 inhibited further growth but did not cause a drop in optical density, suggesting that Ssp4 does not cause lysis of intoxicated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). No inhibition was observed when Ssp4 was retained in the cytoplasm or when Sip4 was co-expressed. Next, we determined whether the action of Ssp4 results in growth inhibition at a single cell level when it is delivered into neighbouring cells by the T6SS. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy was used to observe co-cultures between cells of wild type, T6SS-inactive (Δ<italic>tssE</italic>), or Δ<italic>ssp4</italic> strains of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 expressing mCherry (‘attacker’) and an Ssp4-susceptible ‘target’ strain, Db10 Δ<italic>ssp4</italic>Δ<italic>sip4</italic> expressing GFP (this mutant lacks the protection normally conferred by Sip4). Target cells in contact with wild type attacker cells generally failed to proliferate and divide, whilst isolated target cells or target cells in contact with T6SS-deficient or Ssp4-lacking attackers proliferated indistinguishably from attacker cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Given also that no target cell lysis events were observed, our combined data are consistent with Ssp4 intoxication causing growth inhibition but not cell lysis.</p><p id="P8">The subcellular localisation of T6SS immunity proteins typically indicates the site of action of the cognate effector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Using MEMSAT, Sip4 was predicted to contain four transmembrane helices, with an N- and C-terminal ‘in’ topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). This prediction was consistent with a low confidence AlphaFold model in which Sip4 folds into a bundle of seven α-helices (pLDDT 64.9; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>) and suggested that Sip4 is an integral membrane protein. To confirm the membrane insertion and topology of Sip4, fully functional variants of Sip4 with no cysteine residues or selected single cysteine substitutions were expressed in the Db10 Δ<italic>ssp4</italic>Δ<italic>sip4</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 2</xref>) and cells were incubated with the membrane impermeant, Cys-reactive reagent mPEG-malemide (mPEG-Mal). Sip4 variants with cysteine substitutions in residues predicted to be located in the cytoplasm (S18C, G43C) or a transmembrane helix (G145C) were only labelled with mPEG-Mal in the presence of SDS, confirming that these amino acid positions are not exposed extra-cytoplasmically and only become available for labelling upon inner membrane disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). In contrast, the G81C variant could be labelled in the absence of SDS, confirming that Gly 81 is exposed in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). These data confirm that Sip4 is an integral inner membrane protein and are consistent with the predicted topology. Taken together, the predicted α-helical structure of Ssp4, its non-lytic and periplasmic toxicity, and the integral membrane location of its immunity protein, suggested that Ssp4, like Ssp6, was likely to be a membrane-targeting toxin.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Ssp4 and Ssp6 display distinct target specificities during T6SS-mediated competition</title><p id="P9">Next we compared the ability of Ssp4 and the previously-characterised membrane-targeting effector Ssp6 to intoxicate different bacterial species upon delivery by the T6SS. Initially, we compared the T6SS-dependent anti-bacterial activity of Δ<italic>ssp4</italic> and Δ<italic>ssp6</italic> mutants with that of wild type <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 against <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, by determining the recovery of viable target cells following co-culture with the attacker strain of <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. While the Δ<italic>ssp4</italic> mutant showed a small reduction in activity against <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, in the other cases no significant difference with wild type Db10 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). This is not unexpected, given that there are at least seven other anti-bacterial effectors delivered by the Δ<italic>ssp4</italic> and Δ<italic>ssp6</italic> mutants. Therefore, to observe the impact of Ssp4 and Ssp6 in isolation, we separately re-introduced the gene for each effector into <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 lacking all known anti-bacterial effectors (strain Δ9). Against <italic>E. coli</italic>, both Δ9 + <italic>ssp4</italic> and Δ9 + <italic>ssp6</italic> displayed considerable anti-bacterial activity compared with Δ9, showing that both effectors can act against this species and that Ssp4 is the more potent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Ssp4 also showed substantial activity in <italic>S. marcescens</italic> when Db10 or Δ9 + <italic>ssp4</italic> were co-cultured with the Δ<italic>ssp4</italic>Δ<italic>sip4</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Unexpectedly, whilst Ssp4 also effectively intoxicated <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, Ssp6 showed no detectable activity against this target species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), revealing that the two effectors have an overlapping but distinct range of target species.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ssp4 causes loss of membrane potential in susceptible cells</title><p id="P10">Given the phenotypic similarity of Ssp4 with other membrane-targeting effectors, we investigated whether Ssp4 affects the membrane potential or permeability of intoxicated cells. We co-cultured attacker strains delivering Ssp4 (wild type Db10 or Δ9 + <italic>ssp4</italic>) with the Ssp4-susceptible target Δ<italic>ssp4</italic>Δ<italic>sip4</italic>, and stained the total mixed population with the voltage-sensitive dye DiBAC4(3) and propidium iodide (PI). Around 15-20% of the total population were positive for DiBAC4(3) fluorescence, indicating that the cells had become depolarised. However these cells did not simultaneously stain with PI, indicating that there was no permeabilisation or loss of membrane integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The population of DiBAC4(3)-positive, depolarised cells was not observed when the attacking cells were unable to deliver Ssp4 (Δ<italic>tssE</italic>, Δ<italic>ssp4</italic> and Δ9 mutants), confirming that it represents Ssp4-intoxicated cells. Similarly, heterologous expression of sp-Ssp4 in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> induced membrane depolarisation but not permeabilisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Therefore Ssp4, like Ssp6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, disrupts the inner membrane potential in intoxicated cells, without the formation of large unspecific pores or loss of bilayer integrity. However, no DiBAC4(3) or PI staining above control was observed on expression of sp-Ssp6 in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), consistent with the lack of Ssp6 activity observed against <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> in co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). When cells of <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> expressing sp-Ssp4 or sp-Ssp6 were fractionated, Ssp4 could be observed within the total membrane fraction, confirming that Ssp4 interacts directly with target cell membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). At least small amounts of Ssp6 could also be observed associated with the total membrane fraction in this system.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ssp4 forms ion-selective membrane pores <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p id="P11">The observation that Ssp4 intoxication causes inner membrane depolarisation suggested that this protein, like Ssp6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, may form ion-selective pores, leading to disruption of the membrane potential through ion leakage. To test the ability of Ssp4 to form membrane pores, purified monomeric Ssp4 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 4</xref>) was incorporated into artificial lipid bilayers under voltage-clamp conditions. In symmetrical KCl (510 mM KCl in <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> chambers), Ssp4 generated a measurable current when the membrane was clamped at voltages of &gt; 40 mV or &lt; -40 mV, confirming that Ssp4 is capable of ion permeation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). Between 20 mV and -20 mV, the signal-to-noise ratio was too high to accurately determine current measurements, although pore openings remained visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In symmetrical 510 mM KCl solutions, Ssp4 displayed a single channel conductance of 18.4 ± 0.64 pS (mean ± SD; n = 4), consistent with the conduction of ions through the Ssp4 pore. In order to investigate whether Ssp4 is permeable to cations, anions or both, a current/voltage (<italic>I</italic>/<italic>V</italic>) relationship in non-symmetrical conditions was determined and used to calculate the reversal potential (<italic>E<sub>rev</sub></italic>) of the Ssp4 pore. Under these conditions, the reversal potential was -14.8 ± 1.6 mV (mean ± SD; n = 4), a value that is closer to the predicted equilibrium potential (calculated using the Nernst equation) of K<sup>+</sup> (−22.8 mV) than Cl<sup>-</sup> (+22.8 mV), indicating a preference for cations over anions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P12">In order to establish whether the Ssp4 pore has higher selectivity for monovalent or divalent cations, the relative permeability of K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> was examined. When Ca<sup>2+</sup> was the permeant ion in the <italic>cis</italic> chamber and K<sup>+</sup> the permeant ion in the <italic>trans</italic> chamber, the reversal potential was close to zero (-1.44 ± 1.7 mV; mean ± SD; n = 3), implying that Ssp4 transports monovalent and divalent cations equally well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). When CaCl<sub>2</sub> was in the <italic>trans</italic> chamber and KCl in the <italic>cis</italic> chamber, rectification was apparent at voltages &gt; 50 mV, but not at negative potentials, indicative of a change in the behaviour of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). Additionally, rectification of the channel by high Ca<sup>2+</sup> only in the <italic>trans</italic> chamber suggests that Ssp4 incorporates into the membrane in a fixed orientation. The reversal potential of the pore was calculated through point-to-point analysis of the linear current-voltage relationship at -50 mV and + 50 mV, giving a value of -3.1 ± 4.6 (mean ± SD; n = 3). The single channel conductance of the pore also changed when Ca<sup>2+</sup> was present in the <italic>trans</italic> chamber, increasing from 15.0 ± 0.40 pS (mean ± SD; Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in <italic>cis</italic>) to 19.4 ± 3.2 pS (mean ± SD; Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in <italic>trans</italic>) suggesting that the channel may undergo a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent conformational change.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Structural modelling and molecular dynamics simulation suggest that Ssp4 forms tetrameric pores in membranes</title><p id="P13">In order to investigate the potential structure of the pore formed by Ssp4 in target cell membranes, structural predictions for Ssp4 homo-multimers containing two, three, four, six or eight Ssp4 monomers were generated using AlphaFold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, based on full length Ssp4 (Ssp4<sub>1-331</sub>) or a truncated version lacking regions disordered in the predicted structure of the monomer (Ssp4<sub>114-331</sub>). The ability of the resulting structural models to insert into a POPE/POPG lipid bilayer was predicted using MemProtMD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Following manual examination of the subset of models predicted to form a transmembrane complex, a tetrameric assembly was selected as the most likely structure for an ion-selective pore and a final model based on the predicted tetrameric structure of Ssp4<sub>114-331</sub> with manual removal of the final 29 amino acids (Ssp4<sub>114-302</sub>) was taken forward for analysis by molecular dynamics simulation. In this model, the four Ssp4<sub>114-302</sub> proteins retain a similar structure to that predicted for the corresponding regions of the Ssp4 monomer in isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and form a ring-like assembly with a central channel and four transmembrane helices contributed by each Ssp4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-c</xref>). Based on MEMSAT predictions and the fact that Ssp4 is active from the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), which suggests that Ssp4 enters the membrane from the periplasmic side, we predict that the pore is oriented with its N- and C-termini (including the ~113 amino acid N-terminal domain truncated from the model) in the periplasm.</p><p id="P14">To investigate the structural stability of the Ssp4 tetrameric model and its permeability for ions, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of membrane-embedded, tetrameric Ssp4<sub>114-302</sub>. Our initial set of molecular dynamics simulations of the Ssp4<sub>114-302</sub> tetramer embedded in a model lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>) showed structural stability with a root-mean-square deviation between 2.5-4 Å over a simulated time of 300 ns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Suppl. Fig. 5</xref>). To investigate the model’s permeability for ions, we next performed simulations of Ssp4 at a membrane voltage of 100 mV. Each simulation had a length of 1 μs and was three-fold replicated. Across all simulations taken together, we observed the permeation of 29 K<sup>+</sup> ions and 4 Cl<sup>-</sup> ions, confirming both the ability of the membrane-inserted Ssp4 tetramer to conduct ions and its cation selectivity. The conductance calculated from these simulations was 18 ± 6 pS, in good agreement with the experimental conductance of 18.4 pS observed above. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref> shows the typical hydration pattern of the Ssp4<sub>114-302</sub> tetramer inserted in the membrane, revealing multiple narrow water channels.

Given the differences between Ssp4 and Ssp6, including target species specificity, we investigated the distribution of Ssp4-like proteins. Interrogation of the previously-reported pan-genome of the genus <italic>Serratia</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> revealed that Ssp4 is more widely distributed across the genus and occurs much more frequently than Ssp6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref>), which may be a consequence of its greater efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Given this level of conservation in <italic>Serratia</italic>, and the polyphyletic pattern of occurrence across the genus, we were interested to see how widely Ssp4 is found in other bacterial species. Using HMMER homology searching, we identified Ssp4 homologues across the <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8b</xref>). Ssp4 homologues in a number of genera within the order <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> formed a group closely related to Ssp4 in <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, whilst two other groups of more distantly-related Ssp4-like proteins were observed, one containing a large number of Ssp4 homologues across the genus <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, and the other containing Ssp4 homologues in several orders of marine bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>). Examining the genomic context of these Ssp4 homologues showed that Ssp4 genes are encoded next to a small downstream gene that is likely to encode a cognate immunity protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>). Additionally, for all three groups of Ssp4-like proteins, whilst the corresponding genes are often found in loci distant from any T6SS genes, in some cases they are found next to genes encoding T6SS components which recruit effectors (Hcp and VgrG) or within large T6SS gene clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8d</xref>), strongly indicating that these groups of Ssp4-like proteins are also T6SS-dependent effectors. Overall, this analysis indicates that Ssp4 is the founding member of a new family of ion-selective pore-forming effectors, which contains at least three groups spanning a number of bacterial orders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P21">In this study, we have shown that Ssp4, an effector delivered by the T6SS of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10, is a potent antibacterial toxin that forms cation-selective pores in the inner membrane of intoxicated cells, leading to a catastrophic disruption of their membrane potential. Homologues of Ssp4 are found widely in Gram-negative bacteria and represent a new family of T6SS effector proteins with at least three sub-groups.</p><p id="P22">The discovery that Ssp4 is a cation-selective pore forming effector was somewhat unexpected, given that Db10 possesses another T6SS effector, Ssp6, which, although unrelated to Ssp4, is also a cation-selective pore forming toxin and causes similar membrane depolarisation and cessation of growth in intoxicated cells. However, the two effectors are not redundant, and differ in their potency, ion selectivity, target species specificity, and the distribution of their homologues across bacterial genera. T6SS effectors are often considered to be ‘broad spectrum’ based on the fact that they target conserved, essential cellular structures and molecules in bacterial cells. However, here we observed that whilst Ssp4 was able to effectively intoxicate <italic>S. marcescens, E. coli</italic> and <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, Ssp6 was not able to intoxicate <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, implying it may only work against species relatively closely related to <italic>Serratia</italic>. Interestingly, whilst homologues of Ssp6 are restricted to the Enterobacterales, Ssp4-like proteins are found much more widely, including in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Vibrio</italic> species. Ssp4 is also much more commonly found across <italic>Serratia</italic> than Ssp6. Taken together, we suggest that Ssp4-type effectors are commonly used for competition between more distantly related species, whilst Ssp6 is used only for intra-order competition within the Enterobacterales. This broader specificity, coupled with the higher potency of Ssp4, may explain why Ssp4 is found so frequently in <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. However, this frequency also means it is less useful for competition within species, hence certain isolates gain a competitive intra-species advantage by horizontal acquisition of the rarer Ssp6.</p><p id="P23">Structural prediction reveals that Ssp4 is an α-pore forming toxin (α-PFT), a class which includes several colicins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and likely other T6SS pore-forming effectors, including Ssp6, Tse5 and Tse4 from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and VasX from <italic>V. cholerae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Upon delivery to their target cellular compartment, α-PFT monomers typically undergo a conformational change resulting in exposure of hydrophobic or amphipathic helices, followed by oligomerisation and concomitant membrane insertion to form the mature pore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Such toxins are thus well suited to delivery by the T6SS, where two forms of the protein are likely to exist: a pre-secretion form which is soluble and compact to allow loading into the Hcp tube, and an active form with exposed hydrophobic helices primed for membrane insertion. The basis for the resistance to Ssp6 intoxication observed in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> remains to be elucidated. While it cannot cause detectable depolarisation, some Ssp6 can be found associated with the membrane fraction. Differences in lipid composition or membrane structure might mean that pore formation cannot proceed beyond an initial interaction with the membrane and no mature pore is formed.</p><p id="P24">To date, no structures have been reported for membrane pores formed by T6SS-delivered effectors. Here, we present the first high confidence structural prediction for such a pore, supported by molecular dynamics simulations and comparison with experimental electrophysiology data. Our modelling suggests that Ssp4 forms tetrameric pores, with water-filled, ion-conducting channels formed by a total of 16 transmembrane alpha-helices. The formation of a tetrameric pore requires multiple Ssp4 proteins to be delivered into a recipient cell, most likely simultaneously. Ssp4 is an Hcp-dependent cargo effector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, meaning that it interacts with one or two hexameric rings of Hcp inside the T6SS-delivered puncturing structure. Given that the Hcp tube may comprise over 200 rings of Hcp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, it is likely that many individual Ssp4 proteins are delivered per firing event, allowing several tetrameric pores to form in the recipient cell, even from just one shot. In contrast, if Ssp4 were delivered by association with VgrG or PAAR, one shot would not deliver enough Ssp4 to form even a single pore. This example illustrates the potential importance of delivery mode to effector function.</p><p id="P25">We have demonstrated experimentally that, in common with Ssp6, Tse5, and most likely Tse4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, Ssp4 forms ion-conducting pores in target cell membranes. This leads to unregulated movement of ions across the inner membrane and disrupted membrane potential, in turn interfering with the proton motive force, ATP synthesis, membrane transport and a variety of other cellular processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. These effectors cause membrane depolarisation without affecting the overall integrity of the inner membrane. In contrast, several T6SS effectors cause permeabilisation and loss of membrane integrity, suggesting they may form larger, non-specific pores, namely VasX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and Tme1/2 from <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Whilst Ssp4 does not cause lysis or loss of membrane integrity, it can cause terminal inhibition of growth and loss of viability, as shown by the number of surviving viable target cells being much lower than the initial inoculum in co-culture assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Of the pore-forming T6SS effectors described to date, ion selectivity has only been determined <italic>in vitro</italic> for Ssp4, Ssp6 and Tse5, whilst cell-based assays suggested that Tse4 forms pores specific for monovalent cations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. It is interesting to note that all these effectors form pores with a strong preference for cations, although Ssp6 appears to be exclusive for cations whilst Ssp4, like Tse5, is also able to transport anions. The ability of Ssp4 to conduct anions as well as cations may contribute to its greater toxicity <italic>in vivo</italic>, although the ionic gradient(s) dissipated by all these toxins will vary with the extracellular environment of the intoxicated cell. Intriguingly, our data also revealed that the activity of the Ssp4 pore may be affected by the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane, since the properties of the pore changed when Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions were present in the <italic>trans</italic> chamber. We predict that the <italic>trans</italic> chamber is equivalent to the cytoplasm in our system, since Ssp4 acts, and therefore must enter the inner membrane, from the periplasm <italic>in vivo</italic>, which corresponds to its addition to the lipid bilayer on the <italic>cis</italic> side <italic>in vitro</italic>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been shown to modulate the transport properties of Tse5 and the SARS-CoV-2 E protein, suggesting that regulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> may be a common property of microbial pore-forming toxins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">Another interesting difference between the two pore-forming effectors deployed by <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 is that intoxication by Ssp4 but not Ssp6 leads to the accumulation of intracellular ROS in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Accumulation of ROS causes damage to DNA, protein and lipids and can contribute to the lethality of antibiotics under certain conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. It is possible that ROS production also contributes to the higher level of toxicity observed for Ssp4 compared with Ssp6. The reason for the difference between the effectors is not clear but might perhaps reflect the ability of Ssp4 to interfere with a greater number of ion gradients. Bacteria possess multiple protective pathways that counter ROS damage. Disruption of one of these, SoxRS, resulted in increased susceptibility of <italic>E. coli</italic> to T6SS attacks, suggesting that ROS generation can contribute to T6SS-mediated antibacterial activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Our observation that intoxication with Ssp4, but not Ssp5 or Ssp6, causes increased intracellular ROS suggests that ROS production may be a specific consequence of certain effectors rather than a general response to the stress induced by T6SS attack. Activation of CpxA in response to cell envelope stress has been implicated in aminoglycoside-induced ROS production and its loss can increase resistance towards such compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Deletion of <italic>cpxA</italic> caused only a modest reduction in ROS accumulation following expression of sp-Ssp4 suggesting that ROS production in response to Ssp4 is largely independent of the Cpx pathway. Loss of CpxA had no impact on <italic>E. coli</italic> susceptibility to Ssp4 in co-culture, indicating that the Cpx stress response pathway does not significantly potentiate or protect against T6SS-delivered Ssp4, consistent with observations for TseH of <italic>V. cholerae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">The strong Ssp4-dependent antibacterial activity observed in co-culture experiments provided an opportunity to investigate whether an unbiased approach, Tn-seq, could identify mutants resistant to a pore-forming effector. One gene whose inactivation caused a modest level of resistance to Ssp4, <italic>moaC</italic>, was identified, although there is a trade-off with the fact that loss of MoaC, a protein required for molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis, has a deleterious impact on overall fitness. It is currently unclear why interruption of Moco synthesis or loss of the ability to assemble Moco-containing enzymes, which are redox-active enzymes involved in electron-transfer reactions during nitrogen, carbon, and sulphur metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, would provide an advantage under conditions of Ssp4 intoxication. One hypothesis is that eliminating activity of these enzymes in the context of elevated oxidative stress could be beneficial. MoaC acts before the step in Moco synthesis that requires activity of two proteins outside the Moco-specific pathway (IscS and TusA), hence loss of competition from MoaC could free these enzymes to aid in repairing oxidative damage to Fe-S clusters in other proteins. However, any advantage of <italic>moaC</italic> inactivation will only be seen in conditions when Moco-dependent electron transfer reactions are not essential, such as during growth on LB.</p><p id="P29">More strikingly, the Tn-seq approach revealed that loss of the C-terminal domain of the anti-sigma factor MucA provides <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> with substantially increased protection against overall T6SS attack.

It is possible that interaction of Ssp6 with the membrane in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> leads to rare or immature pores conferring a small fitness defect detectable by this assay. Alternatively, reintroduction of Ssp6 into the Δ9 mutant might increase T6SS firing rate via a checkpoint for effector loading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, leading to increased T6SS damage to the target cells, either from penetration or delivery of an as-yet-unidentified effector.</p><p id="P30">MucA has been extensively characterised in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> due to its role in regulating production of the extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) alginate and the fact that mutations causing C-terminal truncations of MucA lead to a mucoid (alginate overproducing) phenotype in isolates from cystic fibrosis patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Production of alginate in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> is also controlled by MucA and truncations of MucA lead to EPS production, in concert with other changes in gene expression consistent with its role as an anti-sigma factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that production or overproduction of EPS, either as a membrane-bound capsule or free EPS, by <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella</italic> can provide protection against T6SS attack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. This protection operates by providing a physical barrier and, in the case of free EPS, by facilitating spatial segregation of producers and bystanders away from T6SS-wielding attacker cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Thus we propose that the increased survival of the <italic>P. fluorescens mucA</italic><sub>Δ76-195</sub> mutant is due to increased alginate EPS production, providing both a physical barrier between attacker and target cells and promoting formation of <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> microcolonies which spatially segregate the cells within them from <italic>S. marcescens</italic> attackers. In support of this model, a <italic>P. aeruginosa mucA</italic> mutant was shown to exhibit enhanced microcolony formation and form more highly structured biofilms, dependent on overproduction of alginate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P31">In conclusion, Ssp4 represents the founder member of a widely-distributed family of T6SS-dependent effectors which form ion-selective transmembrane pores. Ssp4 is one of two unrelated cation-selective pore-forming effectors delivered by the T6SS of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db10 which differ in their ion selectivity, target specificity and impact on intoxicated cells. Moreover, these two effectors are likely to be used differently, one for ‘intra-order’ competition within closely related species, the other primarily between more distantly related competitors. Co-occurrence of two such pore-forming effectors may be common (e.g Tse5 and Tse4 in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) and these effectors likely play an important synergistic role in overall T6SS-mediated antibacterial activity, as loss of membrane potential will impair the ability of intoxicated cells to repair damage or reverse nucleotide depletion caused by other types of effectors. Conversely, production of EPS is emerging as a common means of protection against T6SS assault, with alginate production by <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> providing another example of this phenomenon.

Trees of Ssp4-like protein sequences were drawn using IQTREE (v1.6.5)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup> with 1000 ultrafast bootstraps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup> using models chosen by modelfinder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. Trees were drawn from alignments created by hmmsearch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>.
