Here, we present a scalable method for preparing translation-competent lysates from a range of frequently used human cell lines using dual centrifugation. We optimized lysis conditions for adherent and suspension cells, producing high-quality lysates from HEK-293 (adherent and in suspension), HeLa, SH-SY5Y, and U2OS cells. Our results demonstrate that cell-specific factors influence translation efficiency, with adherent HeLa cells showing the highest activity. We also observed that sensitivity to lysis conditions varies between cell lines, underscoring the importance of fine-tuning parameters for efficient protein production.

In the past, cell-free or <italic>in vitro</italic> translation has contributed to key discoveries, such as the elucidation of the genetic code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Recent improvements in cell-free translation systems have expanded their capabilities and potential applications in synthetic biology, biotechnology, and biomedicine. Some recent examples include findings in the features of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), alternative ways to produce proteinosomes, particles that support cell-free transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), and the study of riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Cell-free expression systems have also been more systematically utilized to study the folding of membrane proteins, which are often challenging to express in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Furthermore, constructing artificial cells based on cell-free systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), integrating cell-free expression reactions in artificial biomolecular condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), and inhibiting translation in synthetic cells using membrane-less organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) fuel the potential for future advances in synthetic biology.</p><p id="P3"><italic>In vitro</italic> translation systems based on cell lysates allow for the rapid and efficient synthesis of proteins in a cell-free environment, enabling researchers to study protein translation without needing intact cells. The Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate (RRL) is a cell-free, lysate-based system derived from the immature red blood cells (reticulocytes) of rabbits that is widely used in molecular biology and biochemistry for <italic>in vitro</italic> protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). This system provides a rich source of the components necessary for translation, including ribosomes, tRNAs, amino acids, and various translation factors. However, RRL is of limited use for studying the mechanism of mammalian translation. The ability to translate mRNAs without a 7-methyl-G cap structure and cap-binding proteins and its non-canonical translation initiation activity at internal mRNA sites limit the physiological relevance of this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). High levels of globin mRNA and tissue-specific RNases can interfere with translation and degrade mRNA, reducing both efficiency and yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Therefore, the specialized nature of reticulocytes may not accurately represent translation processes in other cell types. Additionally, RRL cannot be easily genetically manipulated to deplete or enrich specific protein factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). These factors can affect the specificity, control, and broader applicability of the RRL system in certain experimental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Given the limitations of RRL and the ethical issues associated with its production, there has been a growing interest in developing cell-free translation systems based on lysates from immortalized human cells. Such systems offer a more physiologically relevant environment, capturing tissue- and cell-type-specific factors critical for proper translation in mammalian systems. By preserving human regulatory elements, post-translational modifications, and translation control mechanisms, human cell-derived lysates provide a powerful tool for studying translation in a context resembling <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. This has significant implications for fields like synthetic biology, structural biology, and drug screening, where accurate recapitulation of human cellular processes is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Efficient cell-free translation systems have been produced from various mammalian cell lines and used to study the mechanism of translation and translation-relevant processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). A common challenge of these protocols is the variability in translation efficiency depending on the lysis conditions, leading to significant batch-to-batch variation. To address these problems, we previously developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> translation system based on HeLa S3 suspension cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The key innovation of our approach was to lyse the cells by dual centrifugation, a technique traditionally used in the chemical industry that provides efficient sample homogenization by applying well-controlled shearing forces. We established dual centrifugation as a robust method for routine cell lysis under various buffer conditions, yielding lysates capable of cap- and IRES-dependent translation. The efficacy of this new method is documented in studies exploring the role of Nsp1, a virulent factor from SARS-CoV-2, in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), and translation re-initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Here, we report the production of translation-competent lysates from different commonly used human cell lines using our dual centrifugation approach. We used adherent HEK-293 cells to benchmark the production of translation-competent lysates from adherent cells, and we adapted the protocol to produce lysates for cell-free translation from adherent HeLa, U2OS, and SH-SY5Y cells, as well as from HEK FreeStyle 293 suspension cells, from here on referred to as HEK FreeStyle cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>Optimized conditions to yield translation-competent lysates from adherent HEK-293 cells</title><p id="P7">Previously, we streamlined the production of translation-competent lysates using HeLa S3 suspension cells by dual centrifugation (DC) and have successfully used it to study translation-related processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Acknowledging the importance of examining molecular mechanisms across different cell types, we set out to test this method’s ability to produce translation-competent lysate from HEK293 Flp-In T-Rex cells, from here on referred to as HEK FITR cells. For this purpose, we grew the cells to 80-90% confluency, harvested them by trypsinization, and resuspended them in a translation buffer supplemented with essential salts and an energy regeneration system consisting of creatine phosphate and creatine kinase, previously optimized for HeLa S3 <italic>in vitro</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). We then subjected the cell suspensions to a range of DC conditions, with speeds varying from 500 to 1’200 rpm for 1 to 4 minutes. The processed lysates, namely the supernatant after spinning down the DC-lysed material, were used to translate a 3xFLAG tagged Renilla luciferase (3xFLAG-RLuc) reporter mRNA for 1 hour at 37°C, followed by luminescence measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Even though we obtained translation-competent lysates from almost all conditions, translation efficiency depended on both the duration and intensity of DC treatment, with highest RLuc signals observed at 800 and 900 rpm for 1 minute. These conditions differ from the DC conditions for HeLa S3 lysate, which yield best translation activity at 500 rpm for 4 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), suggesting that different cell types require different lysis conditions to achieve optimal translation efficiency of the derived lysates. To monitor the cell lysis efficiency under the different DC conditions, we performed Trypan Blue staining, where living cells are visible as white spheres, whereas dead cells and nuclei as dark blue foci. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>, the lysis efficiency depends on the applied centrifugal forces. Similar to our experience with HeLa S3 cells, at the optimal condition (800-900 rpm for 1 minute), approximately 50% of the cells were lysed with the cell nuclei remaining intact. DC at higher rpm or for longer periods leads to a higher proportion of lysed cells but concomitantly lower translation efficiency of the resulting lysates. This may result from damaging sensitive components essential for translation or disruption of cellular organelles such as the nucleus, which could release nuclear components that negatively impact translation.</p><p id="P8">Attempting to further improve the translation efficiency of the HEK FITR lysate, we assessed the effect of glycerol on cell-free translation based on its molecular crowding effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). We observed an 80% increase in translation efficiency upon adding 15% glycerol to the translation buffer in which the cells are suspended and lysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Notably, addition of glycerol did not increase the translation efficiency of HeLa S3 lysates, suggesting that these lysates may already translate with their maximal translation capacity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). In contrast, HEK FITR lysates might be less concentrated and, therefore, benefit from increasing the local concentration of translation factors by adding a crowding agent.</p><p id="P9">To speed up the lysate preparation procedure, we further tested whether we could harvest the cells by scraping of the plates instead of the more time-consuming trypsinization procedure. However, we observed that only lysates originating from trypsinized cells were translationally competent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Harvesting the cells by scraping is a harsh treatment that damages and lyses a large proportion of the HEK FITR cells, which was clearly visible when the cells were microscopically examined directly after harvesting, before DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). Since scraping can influence the integrity of cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), we speculate that the resulting release of inhibitory factors from membrane-bound compartments might be responsible for the reduced translational activity. Alternatively, the mechanical stress of scraping may inactivate critical elements of the translation machinery that are preserved when cells are trypsinized.</p><p id="P10">In summary, our optimal lysate preparation protocol for HEK FITR cells includes harvesting the cells by trypsinization and resuspension after washing in a translation buffer containing 15% glycerol and DC at 800 rpm for 1 minute.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Characterization of HEK FITR translation-competent lysate</title><p id="P11">To characterize the HEK FITR lysate, we first tested the duration of its translation activity using the 3xFLAG-RLuc reporter mRNA. We found that protein production increases linearly for at least one hour of incubation at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Furthermore, we titrated the reporter mRNA concentration in the translation reaction and observed an increase in translation at a concentration range of 2.5-20 fmol of reporter mRNA per μl of cell-free translation reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To assess the versatility of the HEK FITR lysate, we explored the translation of reporter mRNAs encoding proteins of different sizes, including human beta-globin (HBB) and SMG6, an endonuclease involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed that consistent with our findings for 3xFLAG-RLuc (37 kDa), we detected distinct single bands for 3xFLAG-HBB (21 kDa) and SMG6-3xFLAG (163 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, D, E</xref>), demonstrating the HEK FITR lysate’s ability to translate efficiently diverse proteins up to a size of at least 160 kDa and probably beyond, comparable to our previous results with HeLa S3 lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To evaluate the stability of the HEK FITR lysate, we tested its resistance to freeze-thaw cycles. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>, the translation output of HEK FITR lysate remains unchanged through at least four freeze-thaw cycles, providing significant storage and handling advantages over other lysates such as RRL, which is recommended to only be used for up to two freeze-thaw cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Production of translation-competent lysates from various cell types</title><p id="P14">Using translation-competent lysates from different cell types facilitates studying cell-specific differences in translation, revealing tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms and responses. To this end, we addressed to what extent our protocol can be adapted to produce translation-competent lysates from different cell lines. Having succeeded in producing translation-competent lysates from HeLa S3 suspension cells and adherent HEK FITR cells, we next attempted to produce lysates from HEK FreeStyle, a HEK 293-based suspension cell line, and from adherent HeLa cells. To expand the range of cell-type-specific translation-competent lysates, we complemented our panel with two additional commonly used cell lines, SH-SY5Y and U2OS cells, which are of neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma origin, respectively.</p><p id="P15">Our previous work on HeLa S3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and HEK-FITR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref>) highlighted the importance of optimizing the cell lysis parameters to yield lysates with high translational activity.</p><p id="P16">Therefore, we tested different DC parameters for each cell line, beginning with the optimal conditions for HeLa S3 and HEK-FITR cells (500 rpm for 4 min and 800 rpm for 1 min). We then increased or decreased the DC rpms and duration, based on the translation efficiency of the initial lysates, until we identified conditions that maximized translation of the 3xFLAG-RLuc reporter protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Furthermore, we monitored cell lysis efficiency by Trypan Blue staining of the cell suspension samples after DC treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Both, the translation efficiency readout and the Trypan Blue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) showed that certain cell lines, such as HEK FreeStyle, are more sensitive to DC and minor alterations of the lysis parameters, while others, like adherent HeLa cells, resulted in similar degrees of lysis and translation efficiency over a wide range of DC conditions. Interestingly, U2OS cells displayed a notably high lysis efficiency at the optimal condition. The observed differences in cell sensitivity to lysis parameters may be attributed to the distinct structural characteristics of these cell types.</p><p id="P18">Next, we assessed how the duration of <italic>in vitro</italic> translation is associated with producing the 3xFLAG-RLuc reporter protein. For this purpose, we conducted time-course translation experiments in the lysates produced from the different cell lines under their above-determined optimal DC conditions. Translation efficiency was assessed based on 3xFLAG-RLuc using luminescence and Western Blot measurements. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E-L</xref>, we observed an increase in Renilla luciferase activity during the first hour of translation, which reached a plateau at two hours in all cases, apart from the U2OS-derived lysate, which translated for a longer time. Thus, the reporter protein output increased over a shorter time window for all the newly tested cell lines, except for U2OS, compared to HeLa S3 lysates. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), HeLa S3 lysates increased the reporter protein output for at least 2 hours of translation reaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Successful production of translation-competent lysates from diverse cell lines demonstrates the adaptability of the protocol, broadening its application for studying cell-type-specific translation mechanisms. The different sensitivity of different cell types to lysis conditions underscores the need to optimize cell lysis protocols based on the unique structural characteristics of each cell type. This variation may impact lysate quality and downstream applications, highlighting the importance of fine-tuning dual centrifugation parameters. The plateau in translation efficiency over time indicates possible limitations in translation machinery or substrate availability over time, which may vary across cell types, necessitating further investigation into rate-limiting factors.</p><p id="P20">Having optimized the lysate preparation protocol for each cell line, we next compared the translation efficiency of the different cell type-specific lysates after <italic>in vitro</italic> translation for 1 hour. The translation efficiency, measured through 3xFLAG-RLuc reporter activity and Western Blot analysis, shows a marked difference between cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). Notably, the adherent HeLa cell lysate exhibited the highest translation efficiency, while SH-SY5Y and U2OS lysates demonstrated considerably lower levels of translation. Both HEK 293 lysates, from adherent FITR and suspension FreeStyle cells, showed similar translation efficiencies. It is important to note that these results reflect only a snapshot of translation efficiency for the different lysates under this specific translation condition. Adjusting the translation parameters could yield different outcomes. For example, extending the translation duration from 1 hour to 2 hours would result in considerably higher translation efficiencies in both U2OS and HeLa S3 lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3H and L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P21">The variation in translation efficiency across cell lines could reflect the importance of cell-type-specific factors in regulating translation but might also indicate different degrees of cell lysis or reduced activity of translation factors in these cell types.</p><p id="P22">Overall, we adapted DC parameters, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>, to achieve efficient lysis and produce translation-competent lysates. This method demonstrates versatility across various cell types, allowing us to adapt the conditions for both adherent and suspension cells. Notably, the scalability of this approach makes it suitable for diverse cell-type-specific translation studies ranging from small-scale functional studies to large-scale biochemical purification experiments.</p><p id="P23">The possibility of producing translation-competent lysates from specific cell lines is instrumental for several reasons. Many translation-relevant processes require tissue-specific factors, and some proteins only acquire post-translational modifications in specific cell-type derived lysates and not in others. For instance, extracts from HeLa cells proved inefficient in producing an N-glycosylated form of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 envelope protein 120 (gp120), while the hybridoma extract was able to fully N-glycosylate gp120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>).</p><p id="P24">The ability to generate lysates from various cell cultures creates new opportunities to produce lysates from genetically modified cells, allowing for controlled variations in factors of interest through knockdown, knockout, and overexpression experiments. The protein production output can be further increased by the addition of auxiliary proteins and other modifications of parameters that can increase the translation rate, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p><p id="P25">The success of the DC-based cell lysis protocol across different cell lines highlights the versatility and adaptability of the method. We anticipate our lysate preparation can be applied to virtually any cell line, facilitating studies of cell-type-specific translation mechanisms across a wide range of biological and disease contexts. This opens exciting possibilities for both basic research and industrial applications, enabling the production of cell-free translation systems tailored to specific cellular environments. The ability to scale this process and produce ample amounts of translation-competent lysates renders it a valuable tool for high-throughput applications and facilitates cross-cell-type comparisons of translational activities. Furthermore, it is well suited for isolating cell-type-specific translation complexes in sufficient amounts and purity for cryogenic electron microscopy studies.</p><p id="P26">Cell-free translation systems are instrumental in studying translational mechanisms and producing proteins of interest in various biological contexts. Our method expands the possibility of producing translation-competent lysates from specific cell types, providing systems that are promising for the investigation of co- and post-translational phenomena, such as cell-type specific translation phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>), post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), and viral manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), which can differ between cell types.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="P27">While the DC method for preparing translation-competent lysates has proven versatile across various cell lines, each new cell type-requires careful optimization of the lysis conditions, which is determined mainly by the DC speed and time. Achieving the right balance between disruption of the cell membrane and preserving translation activity, particularly for more delicate or hard-to-lyse cells, is crucial for maximizing the yield of recombinant protein. Additionally, while the method works well for cultured cell lines, its scalability remains untested for more complex tissues, like primary cells or multi-cellular tissues. These tissues present additional structural complexity, which may impede lysate quality and translation efficiency. Another consideration is the preservation of post-translational modifications, which may not be fully maintained during lysate preparation, potentially affecting studies of cellular regulation. Furthermore, the method may have limitations when applied to studying organelle-specific translation processes, such as those occurring in mitochondria or at the endoplasmic reticulum, where localized translation events play key roles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>General cell culture growth conditions</title><p id="P28">HEK293 Flip-In T-Rex (HEK FITR), SH-SY5Y and U2OS cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Gibco, Cat No. 32500-043) medium supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 10% FCS (BioConcept, Cat No. 2-01F30-I) (termed DMEM+/+), at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humid atmosphere on 150 cm<sup>2</sup> dishes to 80-90% confluency.

mechanisms that depend on different biological contexts. Developing systems tailored to diverse cell types would be instrumental in investigating cell-type-specific translational control, co- and post-translational modifications, and viral manipulation strategies. Our method addresses this gap by providing a scalable and adaptable solution for producing high-quality lysates that reflect the specific needs of different cell types.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Preparation of translation-competent lysate from HEK FITR cells using DC</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Comparison of luminescence output HEK FITR lysates produced under different dual centrifugation (DC) conditions by Renilla luciferase assay. <bold>(B)</bold> Examination of HEK FITR cell integrity after DC by Trypan Blue staining. <bold>(C)</bold> Luciferase assay comparing <italic>in vitro</italic> translation efficiency of HEK FITR lysates prepared with or without 15% glycerol in the translation buffer. <bold>(D)</bold> Comparison of translation efficiency between lysates from HEK FITR cells harvested by trypsinization or scraping.
