Understanding how this architecture impacts gene expression has been hindered by a lack of tools for elucidating the molecular interactions at individual genomic loci. Here, we adapt oligonucleotide-mediated proximity-interactome mapping (O-MAP) to biochemically characterize discrete, micron-scale nuclear neighborhoods. By targeting O-MAP to introns within the <italic>TTN</italic> pre-mRNA<italic>,</italic> we systematically map the chromatin loci, RNAs, and proteins within a muscle-specific RNA factory organized around the <italic>TTN</italic> locus. This reveals an unanticipated compartmental architecture that organizes <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-interacting chromosomal domains, including a hub of transcriptionally silenced chromatin. The factory also recruits dozens of unique RNA-binding and chromatinscaffolding factors, including QKI and SAFB, along with their target transcripts. Loss of the cardiac-specific splicing factor RBM20—a master regulator of <italic>TTN</italic> splicing that is mutated in dilated cardiomyopathy—remodels nearly every facet of this architecture. This establishes O-MAP as a pioneering method for probing single-locus, microcompartment-level interactions that are opaque to conventional tools. Our findings suggest new mechanisms by which coding genes can “moonlight” in nuclear-architectural roles.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>MAIN</title><p id="P2">In eukaryotes, the tasks of reading, modulating, copying, and repairing genomic information must be executed within the dense confines of the nucleus, where meters of chromatin are compacted into a space that is only microns wide. To achieve this, cells partition their nuclei into a highly compartmentalized architecture that enables spatial control over these core genomic functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. For example, processes like DNA repair, ribosome biogenesis, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assembly, RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription, and pre-mRNA splicing each appear to be coordinated in dedicated, micrometer-scale compartments that concentrate regulatory proteins and RNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. These compartments also spatially cluster co-regulated loci, including both long-range <italic>cis</italic>-contacts along the same chromosome, and <italic>trans</italic>-contacts between chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Notably, a single nucleus may contain dozens to thousands of a given compartment type, each of which has a characteristic, core molecular architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. It is presumed that individual compartments can modify or functionalize this core architecture to support the unique needs of the loci they regulate. However, exploring this hypothesis has proven challenging without robust technologies for biochemically characterizing the distinct microenvironments surrounding individual target loci. As a result, the functional diversity of individual nuclear compartments, and the mechanisms by which this diversity is programmed, remain largely unexplored.</p><p id="P3">We recently reported the discovery of one such specialized compartment—an “RNA factory” that plays a key regulatory role during cardiomyogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In cardiomyocytes (CMs), this factory assembles around nascent pre-mRNAs encoding the giant protein Titin (<italic>TTN</italic>), and nucleate prominent foci of the muscle-specific splicing factor RBM20, a key regulator of <italic>TTN</italic> mRNA biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Genomic loci encoding other RBM20 targets (located on several chromosomes) also visit these RBM20 foci, which appears to enhance their alternate splicing. These observations suggest that <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factories might serve as “crucibles” that coordinate the biogenesis of cardiomyogenic genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Previous studies indicated that RBM20 foci are a class of nuclear speckles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>—RNA-rich nuclear bodies that coordinate pre-mRNA splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. But, while cardiomyocytes contain dozens of nuclear speckles, only those located near the <italic>TTN</italic> locus compartmentalize RBM20 and its target genes, suggesting their functional specialization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. A similar model of RNA-mediated compartmentalization is thought to underlie the assembly of many other prominent subnuclear structures—including nucleoli, Barr bodies, paraspeckles, and nuclear stress bodies (nSBs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Yet, while these compartments are all assembled on long noncoding RNAs, this kind of architectural function has rarely been ascribed to a pre-mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Hence, the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory may represent an under-explored mechanism of nuclear compartmentalization in which coding loci “moonlight” as sources of chromatin-regulatory RNAs.</p><p id="P4">Proper assembly of the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory may also be critical for human health. Mutations in RBM20, including those that sequester it outside of the nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, induce a malignant form of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) characterized by conduction system disorders, ventricular arrhythmia, and rapid progression to heart failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Current therapies can only manage these symptoms; the sole effective treatment is heart transplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Much of the cardiac dysfunction observed in RBM20–DCM can be ascribed to defects in <italic>TTN</italic> splicing, which induces an elastic, fetal-like protein isoform that severely weakens left ventricular function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. However, other facets of disease etiology, including calcium current aberrations, cannot be directly ascribed to the missplicing of RBM20 target transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. We thus hypothesized that nuclear depletion of RBM20 may also disrupt the architecture of the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory, with potentially deleterious effects on chromatin organization and gene expression.</p><p id="P5">To explore this hypothesis, we sought to develop a new experimental strategy that would enable targeted biochemical characterization of discrete subnuclear compartments like the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory—an approach for which few robust tools are currently available. To date, most efforts at characterizing nuclear architecture have focused on the looping and folding of chromatin at the nanometer-scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Although powerful, these methods have difficulty probing the higher-order, micron-scale compartmental interactions that are pervasive in nuclear organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, including <italic>trans-</italic>chromosomal contacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Newer genomics approaches that explicitly probe such higher-order structures (<italic>e.g</italic>., GAM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>; SPRITE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>) are technically demanding and have lower dynamic range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Moreover, because these methods probe all nuclear compartments <italic>en masse,</italic> they might lack the sampling depth to discover unique interactions within any individual compartment. In principle, such compartment-specific interactions might be probed using pulldown-based biochemical strategies—for example, immunoprecipitation of RBM20, or antisense oligonucleotide-based capture of the <italic>TTN</italic> pre-mRNA or genomic locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. However, these methods would be challenging to apply to compartments like the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory, which are lowly abundant and presumably too fragile to survive biochemical purification.</p><p id="P6">We reasoned that we could overcome this barrier using <italic>in situ</italic> proximity biotinylation. This approach uses promiscuous biotinylating enzymes (<italic>e.g</italic>. Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP); APEX), to affinity-tag biomolecules within a target compartment, <italic>in situ,</italic> enabling unbiased discovery of compartment-level interactions without complex fractionation or pulldown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Although proximity-labeling has been previously adapted to characterize nuclear structure—for example, by using CRISPR/Cas9 to localize APEX to target genomic loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, or using antibody-HRP conjugates to label all compartments of a given type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>—these established approaches lack the targeting specificity needed to probe single-locus compartments with high accuracy.</p><p id="P7">To overcome this challenge, we here adapt <bold>O</bold>ligonucleotide-mediated proximity-interactome <bold>MAP</bold>ping (<bold>O–MAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup></bold>)—a novel RNA-targeted proximity-biotinylation tool—to achieve first-of-its-kind biochemical characterization of discrete subnuclear compartments, with unrivaled spatial precision. By targeting O-MAP to introns on the <italic>TTN</italic> pre-mRNA, we elucidate the chromatin loci, transcripts, and proteins that co-compartmentalize within the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory, and map how this molecular architecture is disrupted upon loss of RBM20. Our novel approach reveals unanticipated new facets of factory architecture that had eluded prior detection by conventional tools. This includes a “hub” of <italic>trans</italic>-chromosomal interactions built from transcriptionally silenced chromatin, which recruits hundreds of RNAs post-transcriptionally. Loss of RBM20 appears to remodel every facet of this architecture, disrupting factory chromatin interactions and rewiring the networks of co-compartmentalized proteins and RNAs, potentially dysregulating RNA biogenesis. To our knowledge, this work represents the first biochemical characterization ever attained for a single-locus subnuclear compartment, and demonstrates O-MAP’s ability to probe facets of nuclear architecture that are opaque to conventional tools. This work furthermore reveals new molecular players that enable <italic>TTN</italic> to coordinate gene expression during cardiac development, with potential implications for RBM20–DCM. We anticipate that these mechanisms may be broadly utilized by nascent transcripts to sculpt nuclear structure in other developmental and disease contexts.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>Nascent transcript O-MAP enables precise</italic> in situ <italic>proximity-biotinylation of the TTN RNA Factory</italic></title><p id="P8">O-MAP uses programmable DNA oligonucleotide probes (similar to those used in RNA-FISH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> to recruit proximity-labeling enzymes to an RNA of interest within its native context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In O-MAP, samples are chemically fixed and oligo probes are hybridized to the target RNA <italic>in situ</italic>. These probes are appended with a universal “landing pad” sequence that, in a subsequent hybridization step, recruits a secondary oligo that is chemically conjugated to Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP). Upon addition of biotin-tyramide and hydrogen peroxide, HRP generates biotinyl radicals that diffuse outward (~50–75 nm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> and covalently tag nearby molecules, enabling their capture and analysis.</p><p id="P9">We sought to apply O-MAP to the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory by targeting the RNA “scaffold” around which this factory nucleates: unspliced <italic>TTN</italic> pre-mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. To pinpoint these unspliced nuclear transcripts (and avoid mature cytoplasmic mRNA), we designed O-MAP probes against intronic sequences within the <italic>TTN</italic> gene, focusing on introns known to be bound and regulated by RBM20<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We applied these probes in an established cell culture model that generates highly pure (&gt;90% cardiac troponin T-positive) cardiomyocytes (CMs) by <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation from RUES2 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Parallel experiments in an isogenic, RBM20 knockout line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> (ΔRBM20 CMs) enabled us to also map disruptions in pre-<italic>TTN</italic> factory architecture upon RBM20 depletion. Although such homozygous RBM20 deletions are not observed in human DCM patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, this line provides a biochemically clean model to study the effect of RBM20 nuclear depletion (which is observed with most disease-associated variants), while avoiding potentially confounding effects from mutant RBM20 aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">We began by validating the targeting precision of our O-MAP probe set. In wild-type (WT) CMs, pre-<italic>TTN</italic> O-MAP induced two prominent (~1 μm diameter) biotinylation puncta within each diploid CM nucleus—corresponding to the two alleles of <italic>TTN—</italic>with undetectable background signal elsewhere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). O-MAP puncta were not observed in CMs in which both <italic>TTN</italic> alleles had been CRISPR-edited to remove the promoter of full-length Titin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, demonstrating the high specificity of our approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). In WT cells, biotinylation puncta exclusively overlapped with nascent <italic>TTN</italic> transcripts, as gauged by intron-targeting RNA-FISH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, indicating that O-MAP had targeted pre-<italic>TTN</italic> with high precision and accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These puncta also colocalized with foci of the RBM20 protein, as gauged by immunofluorescence, with an average O-MAP–RBM20 displacement near the resolution limit of conventional microscopy (overlap <italic>p-</italic>value &lt; 0.01; <italic>n</italic>=100; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, e</xref>). Importantly, in ΔRBM20 CMs, the number, size and intensity of O-MAP biotinylation puncta were nearly indistinguishable from those of WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). This suggests that any differences observed between WT and ΔRBM20 cells are likely not artifacts of differential O-MAP labeling of the <italic>TTN</italic> microenvironment, but rather reflect <italic>bona fide</italic> remodeling of this microenvironment upon RBM20 loss.</p><p id="P11">Collectively, these data demonstrate intron-targeted O-MAP’s ability to biotinylate single-locus subnuclear compartments at unprecedently high targeting precision. With these validated reagents in hand, we sought to elucidate the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory’s chromatin architecture, transcriptome, and proteome.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The TTN RNA factory forms of hub of cis and trans-chromosomal interactions</title><p id="P12">The <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory is thought to organize a network of higher-order chromatin interactions that recruits and compartmentalizes loci from multiple chromosomes, potentially facilitating their co-regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. We sought to elucidate this network using O-MAP-ChIP, which captures chromatin loci near a target RNA (here, the unspliced <italic>TTN</italic> pre-mRNA) by pulling down the biotinylated proteins to which these loci are bound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In WT CMs, O-MAP-ChIP revealed the striking enrichment of megabase-scale domains spanning the entirety of chromosome 2 (on which the <italic>TTN</italic> gene is itself located), which we term <italic>Cis</italic>-Interacting Domains (CIDs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). Notably, CID periodicity approximates the “A/B compartmentalization”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> of chromosome 2—previously mapped in this cell line by DNase Hi-C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>—with CIDs corresponding to the transcriptionally active “A compartment” (average Pearson’s correlations: O-MAP-vs-Hi-C <italic>r</italic> = 0.41; Mock-vs-Hi-C <italic>r</italic> = –0.24, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).

Consistent with our new hypothesis, in WT CMs, TID-enclosed genes are lowly expressed as a class (median TPM = 3.355), and a substantial proportion are altogether transcriptionally silent (52 genes; 19% <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>, <italic>left</italic>).

We thus hypothesized that loss of RBM20 (and the concomitant ablation of TID architecture) may aberrantly reactivate certain TID-resident TF genes along with their downstream targets. Indeed, in ΔRBM20 cells we observed significant upregulation of several key TFs, with members of the Forkhead class (<italic>e.g., FOXC2; FOXL1</italic>) increasing between three and 60-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>).

We thus sought to characterize how loss of RBM20 might influence alternative splicing in the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory transcriptome. As expected, global changes in pre-mRNA splicing between WT and ΔRBM20 CMs appear largely to be driven by RBM20 loss, as principal component analysis clustered samples tightly by genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). These global analyses identified 3,477 differential splicing events between WT and ΔRBM20 cells (FDR&lt;0.05; ΔPercent Spliced-in (ΔPSI) = 0.1), with skipped-exon (SE) events exhibiting the largest change between cell types (3.15% difference; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). While this result is consistent with RBM20’s established role in promoting exon exclusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, we noted that eCLIP-confirmed RBM20-target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> represented only a small fraction (5.43 %) of observed SE events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). This suggests that many such splicing changes might be attributed to pleiotropic or downstream effects induced by RBM20 loss, and we hypothesized that these effects might be more pronounced in the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory transcriptome. Indeed, we observed an enrichment of alternative splicing events in the WT- and ΔRBM20-specific O-MAP-enriched RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary table 4</xref>), relative to bulk RNA (~20% of <italic>TTN-</italic>proximal transcripts, compared to ~15% of all RNAs, <italic>p =</italic> 2.6 x 10<sup>-5</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>, <italic>middle</italic>).

Furthermore, the majority (~60%) of these alternative splicing events were specific to ΔRBM20-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref>, <italic>left</italic>), with nearly 85% of RI events being unique to the knockout line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>).

These domains assemble around a micron-wide compartment surrounding unspliced <italic>TTN</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f–i</xref>), which appears to hold many genes within these TIDs in a transcriptionally repressive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Based on our proteomic data, we hypothesize that this higher-order compartmentalization is driven by a cohort of chromatin-architectural proteins, including the cohesin complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> and scaffolding factors like SAFB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref></sup> and HMGB2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>—each of which is highly enriched within the factory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b,c</xref>). These are joined by an array of DNA-repair factors, potentially suggesting that synthesis of the ~278 kb <italic>TTN</italic> transcript may induce DNA damage, as has been observed with other long, repeat-laden transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>. In principle, these factors might also play a role in chromatin compartmentalization, by organizing foci near the site of <italic>TTN</italic> transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>, or by imposing topological constraints on cohesin-mediated chromatin-looping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup>. Concomitantly, the factory compartmentalizes dozens of RNA-binding proteins, including factors like QKI and ELAVL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>), which in turn appear to recruit hundreds of their target RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6f</xref>), presumably post-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). This suggests that, in addition to its roles in mediating <italic>TTN</italic> biogenesis and TID-silencing, the factory may also provide a post-transcriptional hub that sequesters a defined ensemble of target transcripts. This compartmentalization phenomenon has been observed in other nuclear bodies—including nuclear speckles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, paraspeckles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>, nuclear stress bodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>, and nucleoli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>—though the functional significance of RNA sequestration in the <italic>TTN</italic> Factory remains unclear.</p><p id="P28">In the absence of RBM20, nearly every facet of <italic>TTN’s</italic> microenvironment is remodeled or altogether lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). We hypothesize that this gross remodeling may underlie some of the cryptic facets of RBM20-DCM etiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>, and hope that the extensive molecular characterization presented here will facilitate future mechanistic studies. Of note, in ΔRBM20 cells, nascent <italic>TTN</italic> appears incapable of affiliating with higher-order chromatin architecture, including other active loci on its own chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e–i</xref>). It is unclear what influence RBM20 has on CID structure, which we hypothesize is largely determined by chromosomal A/B compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). That said, RBM20 loss appears to disrupt TID organization, disassociating these domains from <italic>TTN’s</italic> compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2g–i</xref>), and partially reactivating TID-enclosed genes, with potential downstream effects on global gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Concomitantly, in the absence of RBM20, nascent <italic>TTN</italic> appears to compartmentalize into a vastly different subnuclear microenvironment, devoid of the unique proteomic markers observed in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>) and co-compartmentalized with a distinct ensemble of transcripts. Compared to their WT counterparts, these ΔRBM20-specific <italic>TTN</italic>-proximal transcripts appear disproportionately mis-spliced, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e–i</xref>) even though few of them are direct RBM20 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). We speculate that the denuded <italic>TTN</italic> transcript may contribute to this aberrant splicing, potentially by sequestering essential splicing factors and poisoning the biogenesis of these other RNAs. A similar mechanism is thought to underlie the toxic RNA aggregates formed in repeat-expansion disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>. However, our data are also consistent with a model in which aberrantly spliced <italic>TTN</italic> is passively sequestered into a speckle-like compartment, along with other transcripts that are independently mis-spliced.</p><p id="P29">The model emerging from this study significantly enhances our understanding of the molecular architecture and functional scope of the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory. Prior work has demonstrated that the factory organizes a clique of RBM20-target genes, thereby influencing these genes’ biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Our results expand on these findings, revealing that the <italic>TTN</italic> factory also organizes a hub of repressed chromatin and post-transcriptional RNA compartmentalization. These novel findings highlight O-MAP’s ability to probe facets of nuclear organization that are undersampled by conventional, proximity-ligation-based tools (<italic>e.g</italic>., Hi-C). We hypothesize that this is due to the two principal factors. First, O-MAP employs biotinyl radicals that can diffuse 50–100 nm during a labeling reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>—markedly larger distances than the nanometer-scale interactions predominantly captured by proximity-ligation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Second, O-MAP and Hi-C are anchored on distinct molecular targets that may themselves occupy different volumes, since Hi-C captures direct interactions at the genomic locus itself, whereas O-MAP probes pools of target RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Collectively, these enable O-MAP to capture higher-order, compartmentlevel features of nuclear organization that have long been observed cytologically, but which have been difficult to characterize at the molecular level.</p><p id="P30">These technical differences may also explain some of the complexities in our O-MAP-Seq results, which revealed a surprisingly imperfect overlap with our earlier RBM20 eCLIP data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We do not believe that this discrepancy is an artifact of the O-MAP pipeline—both because this pipeline has been extensively validated on other target RNAs (<italic>e.g</italic>., the 47S pre-rRNA; <italic>Xist</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, and because the present data support the accuracy of our new results. Notably, the confirmed co-compartmentalization of our O-MAP-Seq hits with nascent <italic>TTN</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g–h</xref>), and the fact that many of these hits represent putative targets for factory RBPs (implying a mechanism for their compartmentalization, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f–g</xref>) suggest their validity as <italic>bona fide</italic> factory transcripts. Given the relatively small population of RBM20 targets enriched in our data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">5b</xref>) we currently favor a model in which the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory comprises only part of the RBM20-associated transcriptome, and that many target transcripts may be regulated by the diffuse nucleoplasmic pool of RBM20, outside the factory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we note that our intron-targeting experimental strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) might also probe other species of <italic>TTN</italic> transcripts that contain these targeted introns—including alternatively spliced isoforms and circular RNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>—in addition to the intended nascent transcripts. It is hence possible that our data have sampled an ensemble of compartments that are populated by these diverse RNA isoforms. Future modifications to the O-MAP workflow, including strategies that directly target genomic loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>, may help to distinguish these distinct compartmental interactomes.</p><p id="P31">We note that our revised model of the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory architecture is not entirely unprecedented, and indeed, that it resembles a class of subnuclear compartments termed nuclear stress bodies (nSBs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Like the <italic>TTN</italic> factory, nSBs are assembled on long, repetitive transcripts and accrete prominent nuclear foci of SAFB. These foci serve as recruitment sites for defined sets of RBPs—many of which are shared by the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory (<italic>e.g</italic>. SRSF1, SRSF9)— which appears to drive the post-transcriptional sequestration of these proteins’ target transcripts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. It is thus possible that the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory and nSBs represent two foundational examples of a broader mechanism by which cells assemble functionally distinct chromatin compartments around nascent transcripts. Moreover, the fact that this mechanism can utilize nascent pre-mRNAs like <italic>TTN</italic>, and thereby coopt a coding gene as a chromatin-regulatory RNA, raises the question of whether additional mRNAs may play similar roles in other developmental and disease contexts.</p><p id="P32">This characterization study highlights O-MAP’s unique ability to elucidate novel facets of nuclear architecture, establishing a new method that complements the DNA proximity-ligation-based tools that are mainstays of the field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Although powerful, these methods struggle to probe the μm-scale, compartment-level interactions that define the <italic>TTN</italic> RNA factory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and many other subnuclear compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and they cannot capture compartmental RNAs or proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. By comparison, nascent transcript O-MAP has enabled us to readily capture higher-order TID interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), as well as the ensembles of co-compartmentalized RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) and proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), revealing a host of novel interactions and potential regulatory phenomena. Our approach also spatially refines compartment-level analysis in a way that would be unattainable with established biochemical methods, such as fractionation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>, affinity purification of tagged compartmental proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, or targeted <italic>in situ</italic> proximity-biotinylation of these proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. By targeting the common biophysical or biochemical features of a given compartment type, these methods survey all such compartments simultaneously, and therefore cannot identify the unique molecular features that define individual subnuclear neighborhoods. In contrast, the novel O-MAP strategy we have implemented here overcomes this longstanding technical roadblock, enabling us to characterize, for the first time, the distinct molecular microenvironment surrounding a single genomic locus of interest. We anticipate that this powerful approach can be applied to dissect nuclear architecture at the single-neighborhood level in a wide range of settings.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials And Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell culture and tissue sections</title><p id="P33">RUES2 hESCs (RUESe002-A; WiCell) and WTC-11 hiPSCs (a gift of Bruce R.

A total of 4 intervals were performed per sample; in between samples the thermal block was re-equilibrated on ice.</p><p id="P60">Samples were supplemented with 47.47 μL of 20% (w/v) SDS, to a final concentration of 1%, and boiled at 95°C for one hour to reverse formaldehyde crosslinks. Samples were passively cooled to 50 °C before placing on ice, and then sonicated for one more cycle, using the same setting described above. Samples were then clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 10-minutes at 4°C, and supernatants were moved to fresh tubes. To each tube was added 75 μL of Pierce Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads that had been equilibrated by two NLB washes. Samples were rotated end-over-end for 2 hours at room-temperature, and beads were collected by magnetization and aspirated. Beads were then washed with 250 μl of NLB, supplemented with 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM sodium azide, 1x Halt EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, and 150 mM NaCl. Beads were then moved to fresh PCR-strip tubes (Simport Scientific; T320-2N) to minimize sample loss. The following series of washes were then performed (200 μl each, 1 minute per wash, at room-temperature, with end-over-end rotation): (1–4) four washes of NLB, supplemented with 5 mM EDTA, 10mM sodium azide and protease inhibitors; (5–8) four washes of 1X PBS in nuclease-free water; (9–16) four washes of 1 M KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA; (17–24) eight washes of 2 M Urea, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA; (25–28) four washes of 200 mM EPPS pH 8.5 in nuclease-free water. After the final wash the beads were moved to fresh PCR strip tubes, aspirated, and resuspended in 50 μl 200 mM EPPS pH 8.5.</p><p id="P61">Samples were transferred to a Mixer HC unit (USA Scientific) outfitted with custom “thermal couples" fashioned by wrapping a small square of aluminum foil around the end of a 1 mL pipette tip. Samples were supplemented with TCEP (Thermo Fisher; 77720) to a final concentration of 10 mM, and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, with shaking at 700 rpm. Samples were alkylated with iodoacetamide (Sigma; I1149-5G) supplemented to a final concentration of 20 mM, and incubated in the dark for one-hour at room temperature with shaking at 700 rpm. Alkylation was quenched by the addition of dithiothreitol (Sigma; 43816) to 5 mM and incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes, with shaking at 700 rpm. To each sample was added 300 ng of mass spectrometry grade LysC (FujiFilm; 121-05063), and samples were incubated at 37°C for three hours, with shaking at 700 rpm. Samples were then supplemented with 300 ng sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega; V5113) and incubated for exactly 16 hours at 37°C, with shaking at 700 rpm.</p><p id="P62">Beads were removed by magnetic separation, and the clarified samples were moved to fresh PCR strip tubes and frozen at –80 °C to inactivate LysC and trypsin. Samples were stored at –80°C for no longer than three days. Samples were thawed to room temperature, and to each were added 0.5 μL of 1% HPLC-grade formic acid to achieve pH &lt; 3, as measured using pH strip paper. Samples were then desalted using C18 StageTips, largely as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Briefly, each StageTip was activated with 50 μL of HPLC-grade methanol, followed by addition of 50 μL of Stage Tip B (80% aq. acetonitrile; 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and then 50 μL of Stage Tip A (0.1% TFA). Samples were then loaded, washed with 50 μL of Stage Tip A, and stored at 4°C until use.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>O-MAP-MS data acquisition and analysis</title><p id="P63">Peptides were eluted from StageTips by addition of 50 μL 45% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA, into a 96-well plate. Samples were dried and resuspended in 10 μL Stage Tip A. Peptides were separated on an EASY-nLC 1200 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 20 cm long fused silica capillary columns (100 μm ID, laser pulled in-house with Sutter P-2000, Novato CA) packed with 3 μm 120 Å reversed phase C18 beads (Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch, DE). The liquid chromatography (LC) gradient was 90 min long with 5–35% B at 300 nL/min. LC solvent A was 0.5% (v/v) aq. acetic acid and LC solvent B was 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid, 80% acetonitrile. MS data were collected on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Lumos using a data-independent acquisition (DIA) method with a 120K resolution Orbitrap MS1 scan and 12 m/z isolation window, 15K resolution Orbitrap MS2 scans for precursors from 400-1000 m/z.</p><p id="P64">Data .raw files were converted to. mzML using MSConvert 3.0.21251-d2724a5 and spectral libraries built using MSFragger-DIA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">107</xref></sup> (FragPipe version 19.1) with quantification through DIA-NN version 1.8.232. The database search was against the UniProt human database (updated September 17th, 2021) containing 20420 sequences and 20420 reverse-sequence decoys. For the MSFragger analysis, both precursor and initial fragment mass tolerances were set to 20 ppm. Spectrum deisotoping, mass calibration, and parameter optimization were enabled. Enzyme specificity was set to “stricttrypsin” and up to two missed trypsin cleavages were allowed. Oxidation of methionine, acetylation of protein N-termini, -18.0106 Da on N-terminal Glutamic acid, and -17.0265 Da on N-terminal Glutamine and Cysteine were set as variable modifications. Carbamidomethylation of Cysteine was set as a fixed modification. Maximum number of variable modifications per peptide was set to 3.</p><p id="P65">FragPipe/DIA-NN output files were processed and analyzed using the Perseus software package v1.5.6.0. Expression columns (protein MS intensities) were log2 transformed and normalized by subtracting the median log2 expression value from each expression value within each MS run. For statistical testing of significant differences in expression, a two-sample Student’s t test was applied.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Image acquisition</title><p id="P66">Fluorescence widefield microscopy was performed on a Leica DM IL, equipped with a HC Fluotar 100x oil immersion objective with a 1.32 numerical aperture and planar correction (Leica; 11506527), a white LED light source (Leica; EL6000) and a DFC365 FX digital camera (Leica; 11547004). The following filter cubes were used: Texas Red (Leica TX2 ET; 11504180; used with Dylight-550 conjugates), Cy5 (Leica Y5 ET; 11504181, used for Alexafluor-647), GFP (Leica GFP ET; 11504174, used for Atto-488 and AF488), and DAPI (Leica DAPI ET; 11504204). Illumination intensity was adjusted using the light source manual control; acquisition times ranged from 40–1000 ms, as controlled by the Leica LASX software. Fluorescence confocal microscopy was performed on a Leica SP8X microscope (UW Keck Imaging Center), outfitted with a HC CS2 63x oil immersion objective, with 1.40 numerical aperture with both planar and apochromatic correction. The pixel size was 0.18 μm for fixed cell distance quantification, 0.06 μm for fixed cell representative images, and 0.045 for FFPE distance quantification and representative images. Samples were illuminated using a 470–670 nm tunable White Light Laser system, with a typical laser power of 0.1% for DAPI, 3% for 550 nm, and 10% for 647 nm. Gain and offset settings were adjusted to avoid pixel saturation. Images were line-averaged twice, with an average pixel dwell time of 1.58 μs. A bit-depth of 16 was used and zoom factor of 1–3 was used for all images.</p></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Image processing</title><p id="P67">Images were processed using Fiji<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">108</xref></sup> and ImageJ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R109">109</xref></sup> and multicolor overlays were made using the screen setting in Adobe Photoshop. All confocal images are maximum projections of z-stacks. Brightness and contrast were adjusted for display purposes using Fiji and ImageJ or Adobe Photoshop. In all cases, contrast adjustment was applied to improve signal visibility, by changing the minimum (black) and maximum (white) values only. Automated despeckling was applied when necessary (e.g. in DNA-FISH images with weak, diffuse speckling between cells) to reduce residual background signal. To measure the 3D distances between DNA-FISH puncta for the TTN locus and DNA-FISH puncta for an experimental TID, nuclei were first segmented in Fiji. Each nucleus was then duplicated in 3D retaining all Z-slices for DAPI and for FISH signal. Then, for each 3D composite image, the minimum edge-edge distances between <italic>TTN</italic> FISH loci and TID FISH loci were measured using the object-based ImageJ Distance Analysis (DiAna) plug-in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R110">110</xref></sup>, using the Gaussian-filtering setting to remove noise. At least 50 cells per condition were analyzed; the exact number is listed in each figure. The same pipeline was used to measure the distance between nascent <italic>TTN</italic> O-MAP signal and interacting RNA-FISH signal. DiAna was also used for object-based colocalization, and the shuffle function was used to calculate the statistical significance of object-based colocalization and to generate the cumulative distribution plots.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS199971-supplement-Supplementary_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d34aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS199971-supplement-Supplementary_Tables.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d34aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S33"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank A.
