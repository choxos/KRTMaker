Following cellular uptake, Q is incorporated at the wobble base (position 34) of tRNAs with a GUN anticodon, which is important for efficient translation. Early studies suggested that cytosolic uptake of queuine is mediated by a selective transporter that is regulated by mitogenic signals, but the identity of this transporter has remained elusive. Here, through a cross-species bioinformatic search and genetic validation, we have identified the solute carrier family member SLC35F2 as a unique transporter for both queuine and queuosine in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>. Furthermore, gene disruption in HeLa cells revealed that SLC35F2 is the sole transporter for queuosine in HeLa cells (K<sub>m</sub> 174 nM) and a high-affinity transporter for the queuine nucleobase (K<sub>m</sub> 67 nM), with the presence of another low-affinity transporter (K<sub>m</sub> 259 nM) in these cells. Competition uptake studies show that SLC35F2 is not a general transporter for other canonical ribonucleobases or ribonucleosides, but selectively imports q and Q. The identification of SLC35F2, an oncogene, as the transporter of both q and Q advances our understanding of how intracellular levels of queuine and queuosine are regulated and how their deficiency contributes to a variety of pathophysiological conditions, including neurological disorders and cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Classification</title><kwd>Major Classification: Biological Sciences</kwd><kwd>Minor Classification: Biochemistry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><kwd>tRNA modification</kwd><kwd><italic>SPCC320.08</italic></kwd><kwd>Qtp1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Human health is deeply intertwined with the acquisition of sufficient daily nutrients. This encompasses not only adequate caloric intake, but also a diverse array of essential vitamins, minerals, and other micronutrients necessary for optimal cellular function, disease prevention, and overall well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Queuine (q) and its nucleoside derivative queuosine (Q) are one such group of micronutrients that are synthesized exclusively by bacteria and salvaged by eukaryotic organisms including plants, fungi, yeast, and metazoan species, with q undergoing subsequent incorporation into tRNAs decoding His, Tyr, Asp, and Asn codons and serving as a substrate for further glycosylation, turnover, and salvage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Currently, no transporters for intracellular uptake of Q nor q have been identified in any eukaryote and, in metazoans, the mechanism of uptake from the gut and redistribution throughout the body is poorly understood.</p><p id="P5">In humans, the circulating levels of q are estimated to be in the range of 1-10 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>) recent studies indicating a mean serum concentration of 8 nM in females and 6.8 nM in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Early studies in fibroblasts and mammalian cell lines showed that a specific cellular uptake mechanism exists to transport q from the extracellular space to the cytosol. Using a tritiated q derivative (rQT<sub>3</sub>), it was shown that uptake in human foreskin fibroblasts can occur <italic>via</italic> two different transporters, a low K<sub>m</sub> transporter (30 nM) that reached saturation after 2 minutes (13.5 pmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells/h) and a slower, high K<sub>m</sub> mechanism (350 nM) that displayed a linear uptake after 3-4 hrs (2.3 pmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells/h). Moreover, competitive uptake experiments with a variety of purine and purine-derivatives did not affect q transport, suggesting that the transporter is specific to q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Earlier studies indicated that mitogenic signalling pathways could modulate q transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). In fibroblasts, low doses and short-term exposure to the Protein Kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol-12, 13-didecanoate (PDD) led to increased rQT<sub>3</sub> uptake, whereas extended exposure durations inhibited uptake. In addition, the protein phosphatase inhibitors calyculin A and okadaic acid were found to increase rQT<sub>3</sub> uptake but avoidance of excess exposure time and concentrations were necessary [6]. Later, other PKC activators, including phosphatidylserine, calcium ionophore and diolein were also found to increase rQT<sub>3</sub> uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Furthermore, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor were also shown to increase q uptake, both alone and in combination with PKC activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Notably, although a major portion of q transport appears to be regulated by PKC and mitogenic signalling, a substantial basal rate of q uptake exists, which operates independently of exogenous signalling. This implies the presence of two or more transporters for q uptake, one of which may be PKC- and mitogen-regulated.</p><p id="P7">Here we show that SLC35F2 functions as the exclusive transporter for q and Q in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and the human parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>. In the human HeLa cell line, it serves as the primary high-affinity transporter for q and as the unique transporter for Q. Competitive uptake studies reveal that SLC35F2 does not recognize canonical nucleobases nor nucleosides, since they were unable to disrupt q/Q import into HeLa cells. Defining the role of the SLC35F2 transporter, an identified oncogene, as the q/Q transporter has significance for understanding the uptake, distribution and function of this micronutrient in eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Prediction of a candidate Q/q transporter family by comparative genomics</title><p id="P8">The Q modification of tRNA has been independently lost in several eukaryotic clades including the model organism <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, while being present in most sequenced fungal genomes including <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The presence/absence of Q can be inferred by the presence/absence of the signature gene <italic>Qtrt1</italic>, which encodes tRNA guanine transglycosylase that exchanges G for Q at position 34 in tRNA. Previous phyletic profile searches to identify the missing q/Q transporter gene(s) by searching for protein families that co-distribute with <italic>Qtrt1</italic> were performed across three eukaryotic kingdoms (fungi, viridiplantae and metazoa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). However, these searches only returned candidate genes for the already characterized <italic>Qtrt1</italic> and <italic>Qng1</italic> genes, the latter being responsible for the release of q from the Q precursor queuosine 5′-monophosphate (Q-5′MP). As an alternate strategy, we analyzed protein families containing transmembrane domains separately in four different taxonomic clades (Sar, Viridiplantae, Metazoa and Fungi), each including around 200 organisms encoding QTRT1 (QTRT<sup>+</sup>) and at least 10 organisms that are QTRT1 deficient (QTRT<sup>-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref> Step I). The proteins in each of these taxonomic groups containing at least four transmembrane (TM) domains covering 25% or more of their length were clustered based on sequence similarity as described in the methods section (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref> Step II). The choice of four TM domains was because 96.4% of all known electrochemical potential-driven transporters have at least four TM domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Each cluster within a given group was given a probability score that would be 1 if all the proteins of the cluster were encoded by QTRT<sup>+</sup> organisms and absent in QTRT<sup>-</sup> organisms as described in the methods section and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref> (Step III).</p><p id="P9">The top candidate in the fungi clade, which also scored highly in the other three analyzed taxonomic groups, was the IPR052221 annotated in InterPro database as the “SLC35F solute transporter family” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref><bold>)</bold>, but corresponds to the “solute carrier family 35 member F1/2” or the “SLC35F1/F2” KEGG orthology group (K15287)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). This family of transporters contains 10 transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>) and is a subgroup of the SLC35 superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Most members of this family transport nucleoside di-phosphate (NDP) sugars, but a few transport vitamins such as thiamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). To date, the substrate specificity of the SLC35F1/F2 subgroup is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p><p id="P10">SLC35F1/F2 proteins were present in 184 out of 189 QTRT<sup>+</sup> fungi and absent in all of 189 QTRT<sup>-</sup> Fungi.

Another published co-expression analysis along the <italic>S. pombe</italic> cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) found that <italic>SPCC320.08</italic> was the only transporter gene in a cluster of co-expressed genes highly enriched (21 out of 24, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>) in rRNA processing and translation related proteins.</p><p id="P11">We constructed a sequence similarity network (SSN) of the IPR052221 family proteins to dissect their functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The Chordata F1 and F2 paralogous subgroups could not be separated with an alignment score threshold (AST) of 110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>), but the divergence becomes evident with an AST of 125 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>), indicating similar functions. Members of this family separate mostly following taxonomic lineages except for the Viridiplantae SLC35F proteins, which are split in two groups: one that contains members from QTRT<sup>-</sup> organisms, such as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S3</xref>), and one that lacks <italic>A. thaliana</italic> homologs but contains members only from QTRT<sup>+</sup> organisms, such as <italic>Zea mays</italic>. Indeed, the <italic>Z. mays</italic> genome encodes the full Q salvage pathway (Uniprot accession: QTRT1, A0A3L6E559; QTRT2, A0A8J8Y6E7 and Qng1, A0A3L6FZJ1) while <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is known to lack Q in tRNA, as this wobble base modification has been lost in cruciferous plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The identification of distinct Viridiplantae paralogous groups, one with no <italic>A. thaliana</italic> member, suggested that the SLC35F family is not isofunctional and could also explain why this transporter family was not identified in previous phylogenetic distribution searches that were filtering for transporter families present in <italic>Zea mays</italic> and absent in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Analyses of the co-expression data available for the two human SLC35F genes link SLC35F2 to ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing, but associate SLC35F1 to neural and synaptic function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). In addition, overexpression of SLC35F1 in HeLa cells recently showed that the transporter resides exclusively on recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). This would suggest that SLC35F1 is likely not the plasma membrane transporter for q/Q. The combination of <italic>in silico-derived</italic> evidence (presence/absence correlated with QTRT1, co-expression with RNA processing proteins and membrane protein topology) led us to test the hypothesis that SLC35F2 is one of the missing human Q/q transporters.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The human <italic>SLC35F2</italic> gene encodes the Q/q transporter</title><p id="P12">To investigate whether the SLC35F2 protein is required for q or Q transport in humans, a knockout approach was adopted. The SLC35F2 gene is located on the reverse strand of chromosome 11, comprising eight exons that encode a 374-amino acid protein. CRISPR-Cas9 was used to insert a promoter trap into exon two of the gene by homologous recombination — providing puromycin resistance under the control of the SLC35F2 promoter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3A</xref>). From the clones surviving puromycin treatment, four were selected and genotyped. All four clones were homozygous knockouts for SLC35F2, with either no PCR amplicon observed for the wild-type allele or a band of the incorrect size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>). Strikingly, 3-AcrylamidoPhenylBoronic acid (APB) Northern blot analysis, which can separate Q modified from unmodified tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), revealed that in the absence of SLC35F2, all four HeLa cell lines were devoid of detectable Q modification in tRNA<sup>His</sup> after incubation with Q (25 nM), contrasting with wildtype cells, where approximately fifty percent of the tRNA was Q-modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, upper panel). In the case of q nucleobase (25 nM), in wild-type cells, all the tRNA was found to be fully Q-modified with the addition of the micronutrient at a concentration of 25 nM, but a dramatic reduction in modification was observed in the SLC35F2 knockout clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, lower panel). To validate and extend this finding, Clone 1 was selected for further analysis by treating cells with increasing concentrations (25 to 250 nM) of either the q-base or Q-nucleoside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Notably, at all concentrations tested Q failed to modify the tRNA in the SLC35F2 knockout cells (upper panel), whereas in the case of q, almost a ten-fold higher concentration was required, relative to wild-type cells, to completely modify the tRNA (lower panel). These data show that SLC35F2 is a unique transporter for Q-nucleoside in human cells and the primary high-affinity transporter for the uptake of q base.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The SLC35F2 homologs of <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> are the sole q/Q transporters in these organisms</title><p id="P13">Having shown that SLC35F2 was required for both q and Q transport in human cells, we investigated if this was also the case in eukaryotes that encode only one SLC35F protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C-D</xref>). We focused on two single-cell eukaryotes where Q synthesis and function have been extensively studied: the fission yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) and the parasite <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The fission yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic> encodes an SLC35F1/F2 homolog SPCC320.08, (here renamed Qtp1 [<bold>Q</bold>ueuosine and queuine <bold>t</bold>rans<bold>p</bold>orter 1]), which has no apparent homolog in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (PomBase,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>)).

In contrast, in the <italic>qtp1</italic>Δ strain, tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> showed no Q modification of the tRNA even at the higher q concentration. Similarly, the <italic>qtp1</italic>Δ strain showed no Q modification of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> when provided with the Q nucleoside, whereas the wildtype strain showed full modification.</p><p id="P15">To study the function of the SLC35F2 homolog in <italic>T. brucei</italic> (ORF Tb927.4.320), here renamed Qtp1 as above for <italic>S. pombe</italic>, both alleles of the corresponding gene were deleted using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). This gene was not essential in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and growth was not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>) in agreement with the fact that Q in tRNA is not essential for growth in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). We then extracted total RNA from wild type and knockout cells lines and analyzed Q-content in tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> via APB Northern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref><bold>)</bold>. For this analysis, Q-content from cells grown in complete media (non-dialyzed serum) were compared to cells grown in media containing dialyzed serum. No Q-tRNA was detected in cells grown with dialyzed serum, regardless of the presence or absence of Qtp1. This is expected given that serum is the only source of q/Q for <italic>T. brucei</italic> when grown in culture. Similar experiments were then performed by supplementing the dialyzed serum with q or Q (at 25 nM concentration, respectively).

It therefore was of interest to determine the substrate affinity and specificity of SLC35F2, to provide an indication of its physiological activity. Of note, the SLC35F2 solute carrier has previously been identified as a unique, high-specificity transporter for the small molecule anti-cancer agent YM155 (sepantronium bromide), with retroviral disruption in KBM7 cells conferring drug resistance to this molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To negate the interference of multiple downstream steps, the uptake kinetics of SLC35F2 for Q was determined in HeLa cells that were knocked out for QNG1 and therefore are incapable of converting Q to q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, upper panel). Intracellular Q and Q-5′MP were quantified by LC-MS/MS and their additive concentration was used to measure uptake kinetics, providing a K<sub>m</sub> of 174 nM and a Vmax of 0.87 pmol/min (lower panel). To examine q uptake, HeLa cells deficient in Qtrt1 were exploited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, upper panel), providing a K<sub>m</sub> of 67 nM for q uptake through both the SLC35F2 transporter and the unidentified secondary mechanism (lower panel). To obtain further data on the uptake kinetics of the unidentified transporter, we took advantage of the fact that YM155 is a high-specificity substrate for SLC35F2 uptake and thus capable of competitively inhibiting the transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>, upper panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Saturating concentrations of YM155 were added to the Qtrt1 deficient HeLa cells to inhibit q uptake, revealing that the second transporter for q has a higher K<sub>m</sub> of 260 nM (lower panel), which agrees with previous literature wherein both a low-K<sub>m</sub> and high-K<sub>m</sub> transporter for the q nucleobase had been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Together, the data indicate that the SLC35F2 transporter is uniquely tasked for Q uptake in humans with a K<sub>m</sub> that is comparatively high relative to that of q and which could indicate differential roles for the transporter in the uptake of each form of the micronutrient.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The SLC35F2 transporter is highly specific for q/Q micronutrient uptake</title><p id="P19">Earlier studies showed that transporters for q are specific, and that uptake cannot be outcompeted by a variety of nucleobases or nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Using the level of Q-modified tRNA as an indirect indicator of the ability of cells to import Q or q, competitive uptake studies were performed using a range of nucleosides and nucleobases. In all cases in wild-type cells, none of the canonical nucleosides were capable of competing against Q-nucleoside uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Similarly, none of the tested nucleobases competed against q uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>) at saturating concentrations (25 µM versus 25 nM) except for the anti-cancer drug YM155, which effectively outcompeted Q/q import. This further validates SLC35F2 as the high-specificity transporter for both q and Q, both of which possess a cyclopentene-diol moiety not shared with canonical nucleobase or nucleoside molecules.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Structural insights into SLC35F2/Qtp1 proteins</title><p id="P20">Human SLC35F2, <italic>T. brucei</italic> Qtp1 (ORF Tb927.4.320), and <italic>S. pombe</italic> Qtp1 (<italic>SPCC320.08)</italic> are all members of the SLC35F subfamily of the large solute carrier family 35 (SLC35). SLC35 proteins are highly conserved TM proteins typically composed of 10 α-helices (10-TM) arranged in two bundles of five helices each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). These bundles are related by a pseudo-twofold symmetry axis running parallel to the membrane. Architecturally, they are part of the Drug/Metabolite Exporter (DME) structural superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) and operate using an alternating-access mechanism to facilitate solute exchange across the membrane. This process involves two gates, formed by specific helical pairs, that alternately open and close on the opposite sides of the DME fold, enabling the central solute-binding site to access solutes from either side of the membrane. To date, the SLC35 family comprises 32 members classified into seven subfamilies (SLC35A-G) based on sequence similarity and phylogenetic analyses, with members within a subfamily differentiated by the solutes they transport. For the majority of SLC35 proteins (21 of the 32 members), the substrates are unknown (orphan transporters) [27], while most of the functionally characterized members (mostly in subfamilies A-D) are Nucleotide Sugar Transporters (NSTs) located in the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum membranes, where they transport specific nucleotide sugars into the lumens of these organelles to serve as substrates for glycosylation reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). NSTs use an antiport mechanism and typically utilize the corresponding luminal nucleoside monophosphates as their antiport molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Additionally, members of the SLC35B subfamily include an ATP/ADP exchanger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) and 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). In the SLC35F subfamily, which comprises six members, none have been reported to function as an NST, and only one has been functionally characterized and found to transport thiamine across the plasma membrane (SLC35F3, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>)).</p><p id="P21">We built a structure-based multisequence alignment of human, <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> SLC35F2/Qtp1 proteins based on the superposition of tertiary structures predicted by the AI-based tool AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7</xref>). Overall, the three proteins exhibit 14% sequence identity and 31% similarity. Their predicted structures share the common 10-TM transporter core and possess different, putatively extra-membranous, N- and C-terminal regions that could not be modeled with confidence. The 10-TM core is most similar to the crystal structure of the CMP-sialic acid transporter SLC35A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>) (e.g., mouse CMP-sialic acid transporter, PDB ID 6OH3, r.m.s.d. 3.3 Å over 247 Cα atoms, 13% sequence identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>)).

Notably, the predicted structures of human, <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> SLC35F2/Qtp1 proteins exhibit a biased distribution of positively charged amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7B</xref>), consistent with the “positive-inside rule” for integral membrane proteins, whereby basic amino acids cluster at the cytoplasmic interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Analysis of the topology of the core membrane-spanning domain using the online tool Deep TMHMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) suggests that the N- and C-termini are located on the cytoplasmic side (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A</xref>).

Herein, we demonstrate by homozygous disruption in human HeLa cells that SLC35F2 functions as a key transporter for queuine and queuosine. We show that it is the sole high-affinity plasma membrane transporter for the Q nucleoside and the primary high-affinity transporter for the nucleobase q in human cells. Furthermore, it is the exclusive transporter of both q and Q in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> and thus has been renamed Qtp1 in those two species.</p><p id="P23">Previous literature has shown that q uptake can occur by two different transporters in human cells, a low K<sub>m</sub> (30 nM) component demonstrating rapid saturation and a high K<sub>m</sub> component (350 nM) showing a slower linear uptake, but their identity was not determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). Here we demonstrate that SLC35F2 accounts for high affinity K<sub>m</sub> q transporter activity (67 nM), and that there exists an independent lower affinity transporter for q (259 nM) that is evident from competitive inhibition of SLC35F2 with saturating concentrations of the anti-cancer compound YM155. Notably, the K<sub>m</sub> for q is higher than the maximum levels determined in human serum under normal conditions of ∼25 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) and could therefore indicate that the levels of q in serum are capable of reaching higher levels, such as after a meal replete with q/Q. In the case of Q, its levels have not been detectable in human plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Therefore, the observed K<sub>m</sub> of 174 nM could suggest SLC35F2’s role in Q uptake is limited to environments that are rich in this micronutrient, such as the human gut, where Q is liberated from tRNA turnover either from the microbiome or from food. In this regard, an analysis of tissue-specific expression data ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref>) finds that there is a heavy propensity for SLC35F2 to be expressed in the human alimentary canal, suggesting that SLC35F2 is responsible for the active transport of Q/q during the digestive process. In our previous work, we observed that the liver has distinctly higher levels of the Q salvage enzyme QNG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). It could therefore be envisaged that Q is transported from the gut by SLC35F2 and delivered to the liver for cleavage by QNG1, which then serves to liberate the q base for subsequent release into the serum and wider distribution throughout the body. Whether the SLC35F2 transporter also functions in a reversible manner to release q to the extracellular space is an outstanding question.</p><p id="P24">Similar to other eukaryotes, the blood borne parasite <italic>T. brucei</italic> is auxotrophic for q/Q, and it is interesting that it exploits a homologous transporter for uptake (termed Qtp1 in this work). In this regard, tRNA from blood-stream trypanosomes shows a greater level of Q-modification relative to the procyclic form that resides in the midgut of the tsetse fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), a difference that could potentially be explained by differential expression of the Qtp1 transporter.</p><p id="P25">The SLC35F2 gene was first identified during the construction of a transcription map of the ATM gene locus located on chromosome region 11q23, which is associated with the genetic disorder ataxia telangiectasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Subsequently, an analysis of SLC35F2 mRNA expression by RT-PCR revealed that it is highest in human adult salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Previous studies on SLC35F2 have linked its expression to the progression of several forms of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). For example, high levels of SLC35F2 expression have been identified in non-small cell lung carcinoma tissue (under the name LSCC-3), suggesting its use as a prognostic biomarker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). Moreover, elevated levels of SLC35F2 have been associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and inhibiting SLC35F2 expression was shown to suppress the malignant phenotype of PTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). Also, SLC35F2 shows oncogenic behavior, promoting cell proliferation and metastasis in H1299 lung cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Furthermore, SLC35F2 is highly expressed in human pluripotent stem cells, which underlies the high cytotoxicity of YM155 in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). Given our identification of SLC35F2 as an import molecule for q and Q, one interpretation of its oncogenic activity is that its overexpression increases cellular levels of q/Q and thus promotes higher Q34 modification of tRNAs. This in turn may give malignant cells a selective advantage over normal cells. Elucidating the role of SLC35F2 in q/Q import will deepen our understanding of its involvement in cancer progression and open new avenues for the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P26">The <italic>in silico</italic> methods are given below.

distributed to different body tissues. Queuosine modification of tRNAs enhances the accuracy and efficiency of codon-anticodon pairing and regulates a range of biological and pathophysiological states, including oxidative stress responses, cancer, learning, memory, and gut homeostasis.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Transport of q and Q into eukaryotes and subsequent intracellular utilization.</title><p>The q/Q micronutrients are imported into the cell via (an) unidentified transporter(s). Q is phosphorylated by an unknown kinase to Q-5′-monophosphate (Q-5′MP) and subsequently hydrolyzed by QNG1 to release the q nucleobase. Queuine serves as a substrate of the eukaryotic tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) heterodimer (QTRT1 and QTRT2) for incorporation into tRNA of the GUN anticodon, generating tRNAs modified with Q (Q<sub>34</sub>-tRNA) at position 34. The Q in tyrosyl- and aspartyl-tRNA can be modified further by galactosylation and mannosylation by the enzymes QTMAN and QTGAL, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>).
