Our recent studies revealed its circadian timekeeping properties, with molecular and electrophysiological 24h rhythms persisting independently of the primary hypothalamic clock. However, the factors entraining these brainstem oscillators, and the downstream transcriptional targets of the DVC molecular clock remain unclear. Here, using fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation, we demonstrate core clock gene expression in inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations of the DVC, as well as in its output cholinergic vagal neurons. We further reveal that the molecular clock is associated with rhythmic expression of numerous neurotransmitter receptor genes in the DVC <italic>in vivo,</italic> with the phase of both clock and clock-controlled gene expression tightly regulated by meal timing. These findings uncover food-entrained circadian rhythms in the DVC and have important implications for clinical studies targeting brainstem satiety mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>circadian clock</kwd><kwd>dorsal vagal complex</kwd><kwd>food-entrainable oscillator</kwd><kwd>time-restricted feeding</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Feeding is a vital behaviour for survival, and organisms have evolved complex mechanisms to ensure adequate food intake. In mammals, neural circuits that regulate feeding are finely tuned to nutrient composition and the daily patterns of food availability in the environment. This allows organisms to not only respond to food presence but also anticipate its availability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The suprachiasmati’c nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the central circadian clock in mammals, generating approximately 24-hour rhythms in physiology and behaviour. The SCN’s timekeeping ability is driven by the rhythmic expression of molecular clock components. These core clock genes operate within transcription-translati’on feedback loops (TTFL) to maintain a cycle close to 24 hours. Their protein products are transcription factors that in turn regulate the expression of numerous clock-controlled genes to ensure timely transcription and availability of proteins including signalling molecules, neurotransmitter receptors, and ion channels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">SCN neurons can adjust the phase of the molecular clock in response to environmental light, via their innervation by the retina, and thus constitute a light-entrainable oscillator <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. However, under time-restricted feeding (TRF), where food is provided at specific times, feeding becomes an additional, competing time cue (Zeitgeber). Evidence indicates that food anticipatory activity (FAA), the behavioural arousal preceding repetitive timed food presentation, operates largely independent of the SCN and is driven by a network of extra-SCN oscillators in the brain and peripheral organs, collectively termed the food-entrainable oscillator (FEO) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Despite extensive research, the FEO has not been localised to a single brain region or peripheral tissue, with several brain centres involved in feeding behaviour identified as contributors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">While many feeding centres are in the hypothalamus, we have identified that the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) in the hindbrain exhibits robust circadian timekeeping properties <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The DVC is a crucial hub for ingestive, metabolic, cardiovascular, and other homeostatic functions, serving as both a primary source and recipient of vagal innervation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Known in the metabolic control field as the brainstem satiety centre, the DVC has recently gained attention for its fundamental role in the action of obesity medications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The DVC comprises three anatomically and functionally distinct structures, all expressing circadian rhythmicity: the area postrema (AP; the sensor of the complex), the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS; the processor), and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV; the peripheral output). Additionally, we have recently found that non-neuronal ependymal cells lining the central canal and the fourth ventricle within the DVC rhythmically express molecular clock genes <italic>ex vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Despite clear evidence implicating the DVC in meal termination and more broadly in feeding behaviour, it is still unclear if and how food intake acts as a Zeitgeber for the DVC circadian oscillators.</p><p id="P8">Previous studies, including our own, have demonstrated that circadian timekeeping in the DVC of mice and rats is highly sensitive to diet composition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the DVC’s circadian properties are similarly sensitive to the timing of food intake and to examine the consequences of altered feeding schedules on gene expression within this brainstem complex. By investigating competing Zeitgeber conditions, our experiments show that the DVC’s circadian rhythms are responsive to the timing of food intake, rather than light-dark cycles. These food-entrained rhythms in components of the molecular clock further shape the rhythmic transcription of clock-controlled genes, thus aligning DVC gene expression to feeding behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Neurochemical Profile of Clock Gene-Expressing Cells in the Dorsal Vagal Complex (DVC)</title><p id="P9">In the SCN, the primary circadian clock, there is functional delineation between cell populations expressing clock genes. These functional groups have distinct neurochemical identities and spatiotemporal organisation within the SCN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, the neurochemical identity of clock gene-expressing cells within the DVC remains unexplored and it is unclear whether there is spatiotemporal organisation to its circadian timekeeping <italic>in vivo.</italic> Hence, we initiated our investigation by delineating the neurochemical profile of DVC cells utilising RNAscope <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation on tissue collected from mice at dawn (or lights-on; ZT0) and dusk (or lights-off, ZT12). Five to six DVC slices (from n=3 mice) were analysed in each time point. Previously we demonstrated using a bioluminescent reporter of the circadian clock gene protein PER2, that it is rhythmically expressed in neuron-rich and neuron-sparse areas of DVC tissue explants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, the identity of these PER2-expressing cells remained unknown. Here, employing <italic>Per2</italic> as a marker for clock gene-expressing cells, we observed its high co-localisation within the DVC with both GABAergic and glutamatergic neuronal markers (identified by <italic>Gad1</italic> and <italic>Slc17a6,</italic> respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). Within the AP, 85% and 83% of <italic>Gad1+</italic> cells were found to co-express <italic>Per2</italic> (at ZT0 and ZT12, respectively). Similarly, 89% and 82% of the <italic>Slc17a6+</italic> population of AP cells co-localised with <italic>Per2.</italic> Corresponding findings were made in the NTS; 84% and 74% of putatively GABAergic, and 93% and 78% of putatively glutamatergic NTS cells co-expressed <italic>Per2</italic> at the two studied time points, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Using single cell measurements of cell coverage by <italic>Per2</italic> puncta, we further showed that the level of <italic>Per2</italic> expression was significantly higher at ZT12 compared to ZT0 in the <italic>Gad1+</italic> cells in the NTS (<italic>p</italic>=0.029, unpaired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Similarly, we detected a high co-localisation of <italic>Per2</italic> with a cholinergic marker (<italic>Chat)</italic> within the DMV. These <italic>Chat+</italic> cells showed a robust nighttime increase of the number of <italic>Per2</italic> puncta detected, compared to the day (<italic>p</italic>=0.0099, unpaired t-test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This suggests that circadian timekeeping in the DVC is carried out by GABAergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic neurons, with NTS GABAergic and DMV cholinergic cells showing a robust increase of <italic>Per2 in vivo</italic> from ZT0 to ZT12.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Daily Rhythms in the Transcriptìonal Programme of the Dorsal Vagal Complex (DVC)</title><p id="P10">Clock gene proteins serve as transcriptional factors to orchestrate the timely expression of downstream genes over approximately 24h. Notably, in the SCN and other extra-SCN oscillators, the transcription of genes for receptors of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators display robust daily and circadian rhythmicity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, we directed our investigation towards delineating the expression of neurotransmitter receptors in tissue punches obtained from the AP and NTS at 4h intervals over a 24h period (n=5/timepoint). Utilising RT<sup>2</sup> Profiler PCR Arrays, we assessed the expression levels of 84 transcripts in each sample, of which 72 and 75 were found to be reliably expressed (Ct&lt;35) in the AP and NTS, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Subsequently, by fitting sine waves to expression profiles normalised to <italic>Gapdh</italic> (housekeeping gene without clear circadian variation) across six daily ti’mepoints, we identified 23 transcripts as rhythmically expressed over 24h in the AP and 32 in the NTS. A total of 15 transcripts exhibited daily rhythmicity common to both regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Intriguingly, extrapolated peak times for these rhythmic transcripts in the AP were predominantly clustered during the middle of the night, with a secondary cluster observed in the early part of the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). A similar clustering was observed for rhythmic transcripts in the NTS, albeit the peaks in the clustering were less defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Rhythmic transcripts in the AP and NTS were further explored for the presence of putative E-boxes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, and thus their potential to be directly responsive to the transcriptional activity of the molecular clock. Motif analysis assessing BMAL1 binding profile (taken from JASPAR database) revealed that 30 out of 34 rhythmic transcripts analysed contained putative E-boxes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). The remaining 4 genes with rhythmic transcripts (<italic>Grik5, Hrt2b, Prok2,</italic> and <italic>Ssrt1</italic>) detected with our RT<sup>2</sup> Profiler PCR Arrays must be either controlled by transcription factors other than BMAL1/CLOCK or their daily oscillations are a result of rhythmic input to the DVC. Four rhythmic genes (<italic>Adra1d, Adrb3, Grin2a,</italic> and <italic>Hrh4</italic>) were excluded from the analysis, as their promoter sequences were not known or listed in the eukaryotic promoter database <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">Previously we developed a model (based on recordings of rhythmic PER2::LUC expression in DVC tissue explants) which predicted that the circadian oscillators in the DVC would be malleable and readily reset by exogenous cues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We therefore investigated whether increased expression of neurotransmitter receptor genes in the AP and NTS is a direct consequence of feeding during the active phase of mice, commencing at the onset of the night. For this aim, we compared two cohorts of 5 animals. One group was culled immediately after undergoing a single 6h-long restriction of food availability from the late day (ZT10) to early night (ZT16). The second group experienced the same 6h food restriction followed by 2h of unlimited access to chow and thus was culled in the middle of the night (ZT18). Interestingly, this transient fasti’ng/refeeding regimen had minimal impact on overall neurotransmitter gene expression levels in the DVC. In the AP, only 9 out of 72 transcripts tested were affected by food restriction and/or refeeding, of which just 3 exhibited daily rhythmicity in the previous experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Similarly, in the NTS, acute changes in food availability affected 11 out of 75 transcripts, with only 5 displaying rhythmic patterns under <italic>ad libitum</italic> conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). These findings collectively suggest that the expression of clock genes in the AP and NTS, rather than acute change in feeding behaviour, orchestrate the majority of the phasic regulation of downstream gene expression, including those encoding neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptors.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Core Clock Gene Expression in the Dorsal Vagal Complex (DVC) during Time-Restricted Feeding</title><p id="P13">In contrast to acute fasti’ng-refeeding protocols, consistent presentation of food within a predictable time window over several days induces food anticipatory activity (FAA), indicative of activation of the SCN-independent food-entrainable circadian oscillator (FEO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Although the precise anatomical location of the FEO remains elusive, it is hypothesised to be a product of a network of oscillators in central and peripheral tissues rather than a singular brain structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. To assess how induction of the FEO influences DVC timekeeping, we monitored the feeding, drinking, and wheel-running behaviours of mice subjected to time-restricted feeding (TRF). Initially, all mice underwent monitoring with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food under a 12:12-hour light-dark (LD) cycle as well as constant darkness (DD) to establish their daily and circadian behavioural profiles. Subsequently, following re-entrainment to LD, mice were subjected to TRF for 6-7 days, either during the initial 6 hours of the dark phase (ZT12-18, n=16) or the late portion of the light phase (ZT6-12, n=16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). In both TRF groups, significant enhancement in the rhythmicity of feeding and drinking patterns were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B,C</xref>), while wheel-running rhythms exhibited reduced robustness due to fragmentation of daily locomotor activity between FAA and nocturnal wheel running (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B,C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To elucidate the pattern of core clock gene expression in the DVC under these competing food and light Zeitgeber conditions, we culled mice following the same regimes of TRF at four daily ti’mepoints (ZT0, 6, 12, and 18; n=4 each) and conducted RNAscope <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation on DVC brain slices to delineate the spatiotemporal expression patterns of three core clock genes: <italic>Bmal1, Per2,</italic> and <italic>Reverbα</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Irrespective of the timing of food presentation, all core clock genes exhibited rhythmic expression across all four regions of the DVC: the AP, NTS, DMV, and ependymal lining of the fourth ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, their phases of expression aligned with meal timing rather than light-dark cycles. Notably across all oscillators, <italic>Reverbα</italic> peaked approximately 6 hours prior to food presentation, while <italic>Bmal1</italic> peaked approximately 6 hours after food withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Per2</italic> exhibited a consistent phase across the AP, NTS, and DMV, peaking at the end of the feeding period, whereas in ependymal cells, <italic>Per2</italic> peaked prior to food intake in both TRF conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B,C</xref>).</p><p id="P15">A phase divergence between predominantly neuronal parts of the DVC and ependymal cells has been previously noted under <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Moreover, when clock gene transcription was examined under <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding conditions (n=16), the phase of <italic>Per2</italic> across DVC regions was synchronised, peaking around the transition from light to dark (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that meal timing differentially entrains the molecular clock in ependymal cells and the remaining parts of the DVC.</p><p id="P16">Next, a separate group of animals underwent early-day TRF (ZT0-6, n=16) for one week, followed by the same clock gene expression assessment with RNAscope. Surprisingly, this feeding regimen resulted in misalignment of DVC oscillators, leading to cessation of <italic>Bmal1</italic> rhythms in the NTS, and <italic>Per2</italic> rhythms in the AP and DMV (sine wave fit <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05; CircWave). With the majority of clock gene expression out of phase with food presentation compared to other TRF timings, only the remaining rhythms in the NTS reliably followed the new mealtime; <italic>Per2</italic> consistently peaked at the end of feeding, and <italic>Reverbα</italic> approximately 5 hours before food presentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). With the above observation on the phase entrainment of clock gene expression by TRF, we determined a ‘food entrainment error’ (FEE, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S8">Methods</xref> for description) for each gene and each DVC oscillator in order to measure the degree of entrainment to different TRF schedules. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). The values of FEE under late day TRF (ZT6-12) were in the range of ± 2h in all DVC substructures for all three core clock genes tested. This means that their phase can follow a 6h advance in feeding with relatively high precision. However, under an early day TRF (ZT0-6), only the acrophase of clock gene expression in the NTS showed a food entrainment error in this range, with all other structures exhibiting error in the -4h to -6h range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Taken together, these data indicate that the phase of clock gene expression in the DVC follows meal presentation time, rather than light-dark cycles. While the phase of all DVC substructures can be reliably delayed by late-day TRF, only the NTS shows enough flexibility to be advanced in phase after a one-week long early-day TRF.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Time-Restricted Feeding Shifts Rhythms in the Transcriptional Programme in the Dorsal Vagal Complex (DVC)</title><p id="P18">Clock genes act as transcription factors, regulating the expression of numerous downstream genes to maintain proper 24-hour cycles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>.

Notably, the phase of rhythmic neurotransmitter receptor gene expression shifted according to TRF timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A,D,E</xref>). Under early-day TRF, acrophases aligned more closely with feeding times, with greater precision and clustering in the NTS compared to the AP.

However, the environmental cues that entrain the DVC remained unclear until now. In the SCN, synchronised rhythms in molecular clock expression, which maintain daily outputs such as neurophysiological activity and neurohormone release, are entrained predominantly by light <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In contrast, the DVC lacks direct retinal innervation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and it has a well-established role in controlling ingestive behaviour <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup></p><p id="P25">Accumulating research has shown that long-term high-fat diet (HFD) disrupts circadian oscillators <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, including molecular clock rhythms in the DVC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Moreover, it is well-documented that feeding patterns are altered by consumption of HFD via dysfunction of the molecular clock as well as an increased hedonic drive to eat highly palatable food throughout the 24h cycle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Our own studies corroborate these findings, showing that even short-term HFD alters rhythmic properties in the DVC <italic>ex vivo</italic> while disrupting feeding patterns, leading to food intake during the behaviourally quiescent light phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Here we show that meal timing is crucial for the phase of clock gene expression in the DVC, which suggests that changes in daily patterns of feeding evoked by HFD, rather than diet composition, may contribute to the detrimental effects of HFD on the DVC circadian timekeeping. Therefore, the potential protective effects of TRF during the behaviourally active phase on the rhythmicity of the DVC under HFD conditions warrant further investigation.</p><p id="P26">Our findings further support the inclusion of the DVC within the food-entrainable oscillator (FEO) network. The alignment of DVC clock gene expression to TRF is consistent with patterns observed in hypothalamic feeding centres including the arcuate nucleus and dorsomedial hypothalamus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. While the SCN-independent nature of FAA has been well-established <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, the specific role of the DVC within this network remains to be fully elucidated. It is unlikely that the AP is critical for the expression of FAA, as a previous study demonstrated that AP lesions do not abolish this behaviour <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, reinforcing the idea that no single brain structure constitutes the entire FEO <sup>n</sup>. However, further studies using genetic models are needed to investigate possible involvement of other DVC nuclei (particularly the NTS) in the generation of FAA. To date, our findings position the DVC as a flexible node in the FEO network, capable of adapting its transcriptional program to predict meal availability.</p><p id="P27">Interestingly, the timing of TRF within the 24-hour cycle affects the degree of DVC entrainment. A late-day TRF schedule (phase advance relative to the active phase) produced more reliable shifts in DVC rhythms compared to early-day TRF (phase delay). This aligns with behavioural evidence suggesting that circadian rhythms are more readily advanced by non-photi’c cues and delayed by photic stimuli <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Although a week of TRF is enough to synchronise peripheral clocks to a reversed feeding time <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, longer TRF protocols may enhance entrainment to early-day feeding schedules. Among DVC components, the NTS demonstrated the most precise alignment of clock gene expression under both TRF conditions, suggesting a role for vagal afferent signalling in entraining the DVC circadian timekeeping. Given that gut-derived vagal innervation preferentially targets the NTS I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, it is plausible that the vagus nerve functions as a key pathway for feeding-driven entrainment, analogous to the role of retinal input in the SCN. Future studies are needed to investigate this hypothesis.</p><p id="P28">Crucially, these food-entrained molecular clock rhythms were shown to orchestrate the rhythmic transcriptional repertoire of the DVC. Under <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding, we observed daily oscillations in the expression of multiple neurotransmitter receptor genes. Similar temporal clustering or synchronisation of gene expression has been reported in other clock gene-expressing peripheral tissues, such as the heart and liver, where the circadian clock governs tissue-specific functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Our findings also mirror those in the SCN, where the molecular clock’s role in regulating downstream gene expression is well established <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Importantly, the phase of these gene expression rhythms in the DVC shifted in accordance with clock gene entrainment to altered meal timing. This includes transcripts encoding neurotransmitter receptors with documented roles in the control of feeding (such as <italic>Sstr1, Hrt2c,</italic> and Cnr1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup> and gastric mobility (<italic>Gabra1</italic> or <italic>Gabra4</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. This highlights the functional output of the DVC’s circadian machinery, shaping the daily transcriptional landscape of its constituent cells to align with environmental feeding cues.</p><p id="P29">Our findings have important implications for understanding the circadian plasticity of the DVC and its role in metabolic health. Feeding schedules that entrain DVC molecular clocks could optimise the timing of neurotransmitter receptor expression, potentially enhancing the efficacy of pharmacological interventions targeting DVC circuits. Pharmacological agents that target neurotransmitter receptors in the DVC including CNR1, HTR2c, and GLP1R are already in clinical use or under investigation for obesity and diabetes treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. Incorporating meal timing into chronopharmacological strategies could synergise with these treatments, utilising the DVC’s circadian rhythmicity to improve therapeutic outcomes.</p><p id="P30">In conclusion, our study establishes the DVC as an integral node in the FEO network, capable of integrating feeding cues to modulate circadian gene expression. By demonstrating the entrainment of DVC molecular clocks by meal timing, we provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying food entrainment and lay the groundwork for circadian-based interventions in metabolic disorders.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Animals</title><p id="P31">All experiments described in this article were conducted using adult (&gt;8 weeks old) mice of both sexes, on a C57BL/6J genetic background locally bred at the Animal Services Unit at the University of Bristol.

Food was presented <italic>ad libitum</italic> until day 29, where 6h-long time-restricted feeding (TRF) protocol started; food presentation time is then depicted by an orange box. (B) Representative periodograms showing the robustness of ~24h rhythms in all three behaviours under light-dark (LD), constant darkness (DD), and TRF conditions. (C) Repeated-measures comparisons showing that TRF significantly decreases robustness (periodogram amplitude) of the wheel running rhythms, while boosting feeding and drinking rhythms. *<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, ***<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, ****<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, Šídák’s multiple comparisons test.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS202386-f003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>The phase of core clock genes expression in the DVC <italic>in vivo</italic> follows the time of food presentation.</title><p>(A) Representative confocal microphotograph showing RNAscope images used for these analyses.
