However, a vast chemical space of other DNA modifications remains to be explored for genome editing. Here, we harness the bacterial anti-phage toxin DarT2 to append ADP-ribosyl moieties to DNA, unlocking distinct editing outcomes in bacteria versus eukaryotes. Fusing an attenuated DarT2 to a Cas9 nickase, we program site-specific ADP-ribosylation of thymines within a target DNA sequence. In tested bacteria, targeting drives efficient homologous recombination in tested bacteria, offering flexible and scar-free genome editing without base replacement nor counterselection. In tested eukaryotes including yeast, plants and human cells, targeting drives substitution of the modified thymine to adenine or a mixture of adenine and cytosine with limited insertions or deletions, offering edits inaccessible to current base editors. Altogether, our approach, called append editing, leverages the addition of a chemical moiety to DNA to expand current modalities for precision gene editing.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In the expanding field of genome editing, targeting chemical modifications to a specific DNA sequence offers an effective way to create precise genomic edits without relying on double-stranded DNA breaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. These modifications are installed at selected sites by base editors (BEs) comprising an enzymatic DNA domain and a programmable DNA binding protein. After the BE acts on recognized bases within a selected target site, the modified bases then change identity, resulting in a permanent genetic substitution. As this process does not actively generate double-stranded DNA breaks at the target site, unintended and possibly harmful genetic alterations such as random insertions or deletions (indels), chromosomal abnormalities, chromothripsis are avoided<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. To date, BEs have been applied in all three domains of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> including DNA-containing organelles like mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, can convert each of the four bases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, and have recently entered clinical use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Within these advances, BEs have consistently relied on DNA deaminases to remove an amino group, changing the base’s perceived identity, or DNA glycosylases to remove the entire base, driving the base’s replacement via base excision repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. While such “subtractive” DNA modifications represent powerful means to elicit precise gene edits, what remains unexplored is the impact of “additive” DNA modifications. Extensive work in DNA repair has shown that appended chemical moieties can elicit diverse DNA repair pathways, such as homologous recombination, translesion synthesis, nucleotide-excision repair or Fanconi anemia repair, extending well beyond base-excision repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. However, the programmable addition of chemical moieties to DNA for gene editing remains to be explored.</p><p id="P4">One promising starting point derives from the DNA ADP-ribosyltransferase protein DarT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. DarT2 is part of the DarT2/DarG toxin-antitoxin system recently associated with a growing collection of anti-phage defenses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. As the system’s toxin, DarT2 appends a single ADP-ribosyl moiety to the N3 position of thymine in single-stranded DNA using the metabolic cofactor NAD<sup>+</sup> as a substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The antitoxin DarG protein catalytically removes the appended ADP-ribosyl moiety and serves as a DNA mimic that binds DarT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. During a phage infection, DarG is inactivated through an unknown mechanism, and DarT2 begins ADP-ribosylating DNA within the bacteriophage and host genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. An appended ADP-ribosyl moiety interferes with DNA replication, which can block bacteriophage replication and induce cellular growth arrest. In Escherichia coli, growth arrest could be partially relieved through bypass via RecF-mediated homologous recombination with the sister chromatid followed by removal through nucleotide-excision repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Critically, this mode of repair contrasts with traditional base editing in this bacterium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, suggesting that the installation of an ADP-ribosyl moiety could unlock distinct types of genome edits. Here, we explore such an approach, which we call append editing. As we append an ADP-ribosyl (ADPr) moiety to thymine, the approach can be abbreviated as ADPr-T append editing (ADPr-TAE).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CRISPR-guided ADP-ribosylation drives homologous recombination in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p id="P5">To explore the outcome of targeted DNA ADP-ribosylation, we selected the previously characterized DarT2 from enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC) O127:H6 str.

The EPEC DarT2 was shown to ADP-ribosylate single-stranded DNA at the third position in a 5′-TYTN-3′ motif (Y = C/T), with the fourth position biased against a G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Paralleling its growth-inhibitory effects <italic>in vivo</italic>, this DarT2 blocked extension by the large fragment of <italic>E. coli</italic>’s DNA Polymerase I <italic>in vitro</italic> from a single-stranded (ss)DNA template with the recognition motif (5′-TCTC-3′), whereas extension was unhindered with a mutated motif (5′-ACTC-3′) or with DarT2 containing the inactivating E170A mutation (dDarT2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1c-d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">To direct DNA ADP-ribosylation, we fused DarT2 to the N-terminus of the PAM-flexible (5′-NNG-3′) <italic>Streptococcus canis</italic> Cas9 (ScCas9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Directing the DarT2-Cas9 fusion to a target sequence through a designed single-guide (sg) RNA would localize DarT2 to the non-target strand displaced during R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). If the non-target strand contains a 5′-TYTN-3′ motif accessible to DarT2, then the target thymine within the motif would be ADP-ribosylated and serve as a block to DNA replication. As wild-type DarT2 would arrest cell growth through genome-wide ADP-ribosylation, we included a previously reported spontaneous G49D mutation in the NAD<sup>+</sup>-binding loop helix (DarT2<sup>D</sup>) exhibiting reduced cytotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. To promote repair through a provided DNA template rather than the sister chromatid, we used a nickase version of Cas9 (D10A) that only cleaves the target strand and provided a plasmid-encoded repair template with ~500-bp homology arms flanking the intended edits.</p><p id="P7">As a simple readout of homologous recombination, we introduced a premature stop codon into a chromosomally integrated kanamycin resistance gene in <italic>E. coli</italic> strain MG1655 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). The premature stop codon overlaps with an ScCas9 target containing the 5′-TTTC-3′ DarT2 motif and a PAM sequence, while a provided repair template with ~500-bp homology arms introduces mutations that revert the premature stop codon and remove the DarT2 motif. As part of an editing assay, plasmids encoding the editor, sgRNA, and repair template are transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic>, and colony counts are compared following editor induction and plating with or without kanamycin.</p><p id="P8">To set a baseline, we applied dsDNA cleavage with Cas9, which is commonly used for genome editing in bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. As dsDNA cleavage principally removes cells that did not undergo recombination, using Cas9 resulted in 66% kanamycin-resistant colonies and a 159-fold colony reduction compared to the non-targeting control (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0002, n = 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). The nickase version of Cas9 did not deplete colony counts (3.6-fold increase relative to the non-targeting control, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02, n = 3) but at the expense of fewer kanamycin-resistant colonies (4%), in line with nicking being less cytotoxic but a poor driver of homologous recombination. Binding DNA alone with a catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) exhibited similar colony counts to nCas9 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.07, n = 3) and did not drive any measurable editing.</p><p id="P9">Turning to append editing with DarT2, the nCas9-DarT2<sup>D</sup> fusion yielded 96% kanamycin-resistant colonies, and negligible depletion in colony counts compared to its non-targeting control (2.0-fold increase, <italic>p</italic> = 0.25, n = 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Both DNA ADP-ribosylation and opposite-strand nicking were important, as conferring kanamycin resistance was less effective with nicking alone (nCas9-dDarT, 0.16%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003, n = 3) or ADP-ribosylation alone (dCas9-DarT2<sup>D</sup>, 38%, p = 0.029, n = 3) when compared to nCas9-DarT2<sup>D</sup>. All screened kanamycin-resistant colonies contained the intended edit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). Dart2<sup>D</sup> still conferred cytotoxicity, as cell counts were low even for the non-targeting controls and increased upon deactivation of DarT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>), creating an opportunity to further attenuate the toxin. Collectively, append editing with DarT2 drives homologous recombination with a provided template in <italic>E. coli</italic>, yielded editing that outperformed traditional Cas9-based approaches.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Targeted ADP-ribosylation does not induce detectable base edits in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p id="P10">Our employed reporter assay requires homologous recombination to confer kanamycin resistance. However, chemically modifying DNA bases can lead to single nucleotide edits as demonstrated by BEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. We therefore asked whether append editing could drive editing without antibiotic selection but also induce base mutagenesis. First, we repeated the <italic>kanR</italic> reporter assay in the absence of kanamycin selection and performed amplicon sequencing on the target site from liquid culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>). Under targeting conditions, append editing yielded 82% of total reads with the desired edit that drastically dropped with nicking alone (0.9%), paralleling the fraction of kanamycin-resistant colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Of the remaining reads, the few detected substitutions of the ADP-ribosylated thymine were not significantly elevated in any sample (<italic>F</italic> = 1.03, p = 0.39, <italic>df</italic> = 3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). As homologous recombination could overshadow base editing, we performed the assay in the absence of the repair template. However, the 16 screened colonies only yielded the original sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Therefore, append editing with DarT2 did not result in detectable base edits in <italic>E. coli</italic>, further supporting sole triggering of homologous recombination.</p><p id="P11">Base editing can also occur at genomic sites unrelated to the target sequence presumably through the DNA modification domain acting on DNA that is temporarily single-stranded <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Given the lack of obvious substitutions at the target site with append editing, we hypothesized that DarT2 expression would not lead to such edits associated with BEs. Culturing editor-expressing cells and performing whole-genome sequencing of three individual clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), a cytosine base editor (CBE) yielded the expected C-to-T edits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, with either three or eight edits in each clone. In contrast, the ADPr-TA editor yielded no T-to-G edits and similarly few T-to-C edits as the CBE or no editor. One of the three clones with the ADPr-TA editor yielded a single T-to-A edit, while none were observed with the CBE or no editor. This one edit was associated with the 5′-TYTN-3′ motif, suggesting that base mutagenesis is possible but rare (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Thus, even a highly active DarT2 that reduces cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>) does not inherently drive base edits across the <italic>E. coli genome.</italic></p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Attenuating DarT2 alleviates cytotoxicity without compromising homologous recombination</title><p id="P12">ADPr-TAE yielded high editing efficiencies, although the expressed DarT2<sup>D</sup> exhibited strong cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). As the cytotoxicity was likely due to ADP-ribosylation of ssDNA across the genome, we aimed to attenuate DarT2 without compromising localized ADP-ribosylation and subsequent initiation of homologous recombination using structural insights and sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). While the structure of EPEC DarT2 remains to be experimentally determined, a crystal structure is available for the <italic>Thermus</italic> sp. 2.9 DarT2 sharing 34% amino-acid identity with EPEC DarT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Aligning this structure with the AlphaFold-predicted structure of EPEC DarT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, we selected a subset of residues potentially involved in binding the DNA recognition motif (M84, M86, R57, R92, R166) or potentially flanking regions of the DNA strand not captured in the crystal structure (R193). The positively charged arginines were mutated to uncharged alanine, while the methionines were mutated to leucine to disrupt the coordinating sulfur while preserving the residue’s hydrophobicity and chain length. Testing these substitutions in combination with G49D as part of the kanamycin-resistance reversion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1f</xref>), we found that all improved cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). At the same time, three of the mutations (M86L, R92A, R193A) maintained the fraction of kanamycin resistant colonies comparable to the original G49D (<italic>p</italic> = 0.77, 0.51 and 0.27 respectively, n = 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), representing candidates for further use with append editing.</p><p id="P13">Viability was greatly enhanced across the single-substitution variants, yet DarT2 may still exert target-independent ADP-ribosylation that could have more subtle effects on cell growth and behavior. We therefore generated cells hypersensitive to ADP-ribosylation by deleting the core repair gene recA to disable homologous recombination, and we assessed cell growth when expressing each ADPr-TAE variant under non-targeting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>). While growth rates in exponential phase were similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>), we observed marked differences in entry into stationary phase. In particular, amino acid substitutions that previously compromised editing (M84L, R57A, R166A) yielded final turbidities paralleling the inactivating E170A (<italic>p</italic> = 0.35, 0.65, and 0.22 respectively, n = 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>). In contrast, substitutions that previously showed high editing efficiencies (M86L, R92A, R193A) exhibited a final turbidity similar to G49D alone (<italic>p</italic> = 0.99, 0.05, and 0.17 respectively, n = 3) and lower than the E170A. We therefore combined the high editing mutations (M86L, R92A, R193A) into a four-substitution version of DarT2, DarT2<sup>DLAA</sup>. This version maintained cell viability and a high frequency of kanamycin-resistant colonies (49%) in <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Moreover, in the <italic>recA</italic>-deletion strain, the append editor with DarT2<sup>DLAA</sup> restored final turbidity to approach that of the editor lacking ADP-ribosylation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.09, n = 3) (E170A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P14">By improving cell viability and growth in a strain in which homologous recombination was fully disabled, the append editor with DarT2<sup>DLAA</sup> afforded the opportunity to probe the genetic basis of templated-mediated editing. Prior work on the cytotoxicity of DarT2<sup>D</sup> in <italic>E. coli</italic> revealed a key role by RecF and possibly nucleotide-excision repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, the involved DNA repair pathways as part of targeted ADP-ribosylation with opposite-strand nicking could differ. Within the kanamycin-reversion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>), <italic>recA</italic> was essential for editing and even showed some reduction in colony counts under non-targeting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Disrupting the RecBCD branch of recombination (Δ<italic>recB</italic>) reduced viability but also increased the frequency of kanamycin-resistant colonies, suggesting a role in survival in the absence of recombination with the provided repair template. In contrast, disrupting the alternative RecFOR recombination pathway (Δ<italic>recF</italic>, Δ<italic>recO</italic>) reduced editing relative to the wild type (one-sided Welch’s t-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.048, 0.001 respectively, n = 3) but not viability for <italic>recF</italic> (one-sided Welch’s t-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.40, n = 3), suggesting involvement in templated recombination. Disrupting RecA-independent RecT recombination (Δ<italic>recT</italic>) significantly reduced both viability and editing (one-sided Welch’s t-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, 0.003 respectively, n = 3), suggesting involvement in both survival and templated recombination. Finally, the DNA repair exonuclease RecJ (Δ<italic>recJ</italic>), mismatch repair (Δ<italic>mutS</italic>), base excision repair (Δ<italic>xthA</italic>) and nucleotide-excision repair (Δ<italic>uvrA</italic>) did not impact editing (one-sided Welch’s t-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.89, 0.68, 0.81 respectively, n = 3) or viability (one-sided Welch’s t-test, p = 0.87, 0.24, 0.93, n = 3) relative to the wild type. These findings implicate multiple recombination pathways as part of ADPr-TAE <italic>in E. coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Attenuated ADP-ribosylation enables flexible and non-cytotoxic genome editing in bacteria</title><p id="P15">Append editing with DarT2<sup>DLAA</sup> efficiently reverted the premature stop codon in the kanamycin-reversion assay. However, the reliance on homologous recombination lends to a much broader range of edits in different genes and bacteria. We therefore explored the bounds of ADPr-TA editing.

These base substitutions principally occurred at the thymine expected to undergo ADP-ribosylation by DarT2, with the modified base becoming an A (67%) or a C (33%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Homologous recombination and base mutagenesis represented mutually exclusive repair outcomes, as removing the repair template enhanced the mutagenesis frequency without altering the location and distribution of mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs. 3c-d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S11</xref>).

Nicking similarly generated a high level of templated edits whether or not TARG1 was intact (18%), but with minimal indels (0.4%) due to the lack of dsDNA breaks. The append editor with DarT2<sup>D</sup> also yielded templated edits, with the editing frequency increasing from 7% to 10% by disrupting TARG1. However, no significant differences were observed for append editors with the attenuated DarT2<sup>DLAA</sup> or with dDarT2 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.32 and 0.33 respectively, n = 3), suggesting that the templated edits were driven primarily through DNA nicking rather than DNA ADP-ribosylation.</p><p id="P23">At the same time, the ADPr-TA editor with DarT2<sup>D</sup> yielded 9% base substitutions specifically at the modified thymine within two overlapping DarT2 recognition motifs, but only with TARG1 disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Base substitutions were negligible with DarT2<sup>DLAA</sup> (0.2%) or dDarT2 (0.3%), suggesting that higher levels of ADP-ribosylation were necessary to drive editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Indel frequencies for ADPr-TAE were slightly elevated over nCas9 with TARG1 disrupted (1.5% vs. 0.9%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03, n = 3) but still 22-fold lower than that observed with Cas9 (33%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), indicating that the principal repair outcome of ADP-ribosylation and opposite strand nicking is base mutagenesis.

Thus, ADPr-TAE in HEK293T cells drives base mutagenesis similar to that in plants and yeast, but only in the absence of TARG1.</p><p id="P24">As different oligonucleotide templates revealed reduced templated repair with increased base mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S17</xref>), we repeated the editing assay without the oligonucleotide template. Base mutagenesis at both modified thymines increased to 16% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>), with conversion to either A or C at similar frequencies. Additionally, base mutagenesis was reduced by 20-fold to 0.8% in the absence of DNA nicking, indicating the importance of the nick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). ADP-ribosylation in the absence of opposite-strand nicking would also capture Cas9-independent off-targeting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, suggesting that such off-targeting would lead to limited editing despite use of a highly-active DarT2. Probing base mutagenesis beyond this target site, we performed transient transfections without the oligonucleotide template at 16 additional target sites in five genes containing one or more DarT2 recognition motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S18</xref>).

Similar trends were observed in U2OS<sup>Δ<italic>TARG1</italic></sup> cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, with generally lower editing frequencies due to lower transfection efficiencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figs.

First, indel frequencies measured by next-generation sequencing or predicted using the Rule Set 2 scoring method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> at each target site with Cas9 correlated with base-mutagenesis frequencies (Spearman correlation = 0.80 and 0.58 respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S22</xref>). The correlation indicates that efficient targeting and DNA cleavage offer a starting point to identify efficient ADPr-TAE sites. Second, across these sites, editing principally occurred at the modified thymine falling between positions 3 and 9 of sgRNA guide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>). For targets with multiple DarT2 recognition motifs, co-occurring mutations were observed 1.1-5.1-fold more frequently than expected if the motifs could be edited independently (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S23</xref>). Finally, we noticed distinct mutagenesis distributions that strongly depended on the DarT2 recognition motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Specifically, 5′-TCTN-3′ motifs were associated with similar conversion frequencies to A and C. In contrast, 5′-TTTN-3′ were associated with a strong bias toward A, with secondary edits biased toward C (5′-TTTA-3′) or equally split between C and G (5′-TTTC-3′). In total, ADPr-TAE can drive base mutagenesis of thymines in human cells paralleling that observed in yeast and plants, with TARG1 countering the effect of DarT2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">In this work, we explored the impact of appending chemical moieties to target DNA as a distinct yet broad approach for precision editing, what we call append editing. As a first example, we used the bacterial toxin DarT2 to mediate ADP-ribosylation of thymine (abbreviated as ADPr-TAE). When paired with opposite-strand nicking, ADPr-TAE introduced precise edits through homologous recombination in tested bacteria, allowing the creation of templated edits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). While this strategy also drove templated recombination in yeast, the predominant outcome was mutagenesis of the ADP-ribosylated thymine. Base mutagenesis was similarly observed in plants and mammalian cells, with a general bias toward substitution to adenine or cytosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Although the exact underlying repair pathways in eukaryotes remain to be identified (e.g., nucleotide-excision repair, translesion synthesis), homologous recombination can at least be excluded. This divergence in repair pathways contrasts with other genome-editing approaches that engage equivalent repair pathways across organisms and result in similar types of edits, supporting append editing as a distinct entry in the genome editing toolbox.</p><p id="P27">ADPr-TAE furthermore offers unique opportunities for genome editing in bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) exemplified by the broad range of generated sequence replacements, deletions and insertions. This form of editing did not sacrifice colony counts compared to traditional dsDNA cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, offered broader edits without perturbing DNA repair compared to prime editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, and omitted fixed scars compared to CRISPR-associated transposons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Given these distinctions, ADPr-TAE is well suited for generating large chromosomal libraries and multiplexed editing or multi-base editing in non-model bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">In yeast, plants, and human cells, ADPr-TAE operates closest to BEs yet offers distinct editing avenues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). BEs to date rely on base deaminases or glycosylases that convert T (or A on the opposite strand) into C (adenosine deaminase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, G (adenine glycosylase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> or C/G (thymine glycosylase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. In contrast, ADPr-TAE converts T to A or A/C depending on the organism and sequence context. T-to-A editing is particularly unique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), where ADPr-TAE could potentially revert 789 of the verified pathogenic SNVs across 355 genes in the ClinVar database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> otherwise off-limits through existing thymine base editors. While the current DarT2 recognition motif would capture a fraction of these SNVs (i.e., 30 T-to-A; 447 T-to-C) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S5</xref>), relaxing the motif through ortholog mining or protein engineering could access a greater set. A stringent motif can also be beneficial, such as when reversing pathogenic mutations susceptible to bystander edits. In particular, ADPr-TAE could create a single desired T-to-C edit in a stretch of three thymines (e.g., pathogenic mutation in the third T of 5′-TTTG-3′ (c.103C&gt;T, c.4396C&gt;T, c.4852C&gt;T, c.5188C&gt;T, c.5623C&gt;T, c.742C&gt;T, c.748C&gt;T) or 5′-TTTA-3′ (c.1537C&gt;T, c.3346C&gt;T, c.3673C&gt;T, c.3826C&gt;T, c.4603C&gt;T, c.5473C&gt;T, c.5599C&gt;T)-3′ in the <italic>ATM</italic> gene underlying Ataxia-telangiectasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>), while current adenine base editors would generate unwanted edits across the thymines. TARG1 poses an immediate barrier to ADPr-TAE in human cells; however, this barrier could be circumvented with peptide or chemical inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, transient gene silencing such as with RNA interference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, or use of dominant-negative inhibitors such as used against mismatch repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P29">Beyond ADP-ribosylation of thymine with DarT2, a large number of base-modifying enzymatic domains against any of the four nucleotides could expand append editing. For instance, DarT1 toxins (related to DarT2) and eukaryotic toxins called pierisins (found in cabbage moths) ADP-ribosylate the N2 position of guanine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>, with evidence of base mutagenesis by pierisins in CHO cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Additionally, bacteria and bacteriophages append unique chemical moieties such as methylcarbamoyl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, dPreQ<sub>0</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>, dADG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, glucosyl-5-hydroxymethyl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, and 5-hydroxymethyl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> to their DNA to block access by anti-phage defenses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>.
