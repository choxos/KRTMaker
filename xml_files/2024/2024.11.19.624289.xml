However, these cells are heterogeneous, and there has been extensive debate about the roles of ALS populations in the different pain dimensions. We recently performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on a developmentally-defined subset of ALS neurons, and identified 5 transcriptomic populations. One of these, ALS4, consists of cells that express <italic>Sst</italic>, the gene coding for somatostatin, and we reported that these were located in the lateral part of lamina V. Here we use a Sst<sup>Cre</sup> mouse line to characterise these cells and define their axonal projections. We find that their axons ascend mainly on the ipsilateral side, giving off collaterals throughout their course in the spinal cord. They target various brainstem nuclei, including the parabrachial internal lateral nucleus, and the posterior triangular and medial dorsal thalamic nuclei. We also show that in the L4 segment <italic>Sst</italic> is expressed by ~75% of ALS neurons in lateral lamina V and that there are around 120 <italic>Sst</italic>-positive lateral lamina V cells on each side. Our findings indicate that this is a relatively large population, and based on projection targets we conclude that they are likely to contribute to the affective-motivational dimension of pain.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The spinal dorsal horn receives somatosensory information from primary afferents that innervate the skin and deep tissues, and encode various stimulus modalities. This information is processed through complex neural circuits before being transmitted to the brain through spinal projection neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Many of these belong to the anterolateral system (ALS), which consists of cells whose axons innervate a distinctive set of brain regions, including thalamus, periaqueductal grey matter (PAG), superior colliculus, lateral parabrachial area (LPB), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and brainstem reticular formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Cell bodies of ALS neurons are found in lamina I, the deeper laminae (III-VIII), the area around the central canal (lamina X), and the lateral white matter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The majority of ALS neurons project to the brain on the contralateral side, although there are also neurons that project bilaterally or only to the ipsilateral side. In humans, ascending ALS axons are located in the anterolateral funiculus, and disruption of these by anterolateral cordotomy results in loss of pain, itch and skin temperature sensation on the opposite side of the body caudal to the lesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, demonstrating the importance of the ALS for these sensory perceptions. In rodents, ALS axons are located more dorsally, within the lateral funiculus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, presumably because the corticospinal tract (which occupies the dorsal part of the lateral funiculus in humans) is located in the dorsal columns.</p><p id="P3">ALS neurons are functionally heterogeneous, and there has been extensive debate about the relative importance of different populations, for example those that are located in deep or superficial laminae, in transmitting pain information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. However, the lack of molecular markers for different subpopulations of ALS cells has made it difficult to target specific types of ALS neuron selectively, and this has limited our ability to define the roles of the different cell types. We recently performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) on a developmentally-defined subset of ALS cells (those that transiently express the transcription factor Phox2a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>), and identified 5 populations, which we named ALS1-5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. One of these populations, ALS4, consisted of cells that were mainly located in the lateral reticulated part of lamina V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Many of the ALS4 cells contain <italic>Sst</italic> mRNA, which codes for the peptide somatostatin, and this was relatively specific for this population. Here we have used a mouse line in which Cre recombinase is expressed from the <italic>Sst</italic> locus to selectively target and characterise the ALS4 cells. We tested the hypothesis that these transcriptomically-defined cells have characteristic patterns of axonal projections that may dictate their distinct roles in the generation of pain.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Anterograde tracing in the Sst<sup>Cre</sup> mouse</title><p id="P4">To reveal axonal projections of Sst-expressing ALS neurons we injected AAVs coding for Cre-dependent tdTomato into either the L3 or L3, L4 and L5 spinal segments of Sst<sup>Cre</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Due to the very high density of <italic>Sst</italic>-expressing dorsal horn neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> there was extensive tdTomato labelling close to the injection site; however, at more rostral levels of the spinal cord labelling was much more restricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). At upper lumbar levels, there was a prominent bundle of fibres within the ipsilateral ventral funiculus, and axons could be seen entering this region near the injection site. In thoracic segments, this bundle lay within the lateral funiculus and it ascended through the entire length of the spinal cord, moving more dorsally as it did so, as indicated by the arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>. A much smaller bundle (double arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>) was present in the same position on the contralateral side. Labelled fibres and varicosities were also present in the lateral spinal nucleus (LSN) on the ipsilateral side in lumbar and thoracic segments (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>), but the density of LSN labelling decreased progressively, and it was virtually absent in cervical segments. These LSN axons are likely to originate from <italic>Sst</italic>-expressing excitatory interneurons in the superficial dorsal horn (SDH), as we have seen a similar projection to the LSN when AAV.Cre<sup>ON</sup>.GFP was injected into the lumbar spinal cord of Tac1<sup>Cre</sup> mice, and many of the varicosities in the LSN seen in that study contained somatostatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, consistent with extensive coexpression of these peptides in SDH excitatory interneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. At all spinal levels examined, collateral branches with boutons occupied a region extending from the lateral reticulated part of lamina V towards the central canal, and these appeared to originate from the main fibre bundle that ascended in the lateral funiculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). These collaterals were particularly well seen in animals that had received injections of AAV.Cre<sup>ON</sup>.tdTomato into the L3, L4 and L5 segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>). Only very sparse collaterals were seen in lamina I in segments rostral to T10.</p><p id="P5">Within the brainstem the main ascending fibre bundle was located near the ventrolateral surface on the ipsilateral side, with a much smaller bundle in the same location on the contralateral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). These bundles continued in the same ventrolateral location up to the rostral part of the pons (at a level corresponding to ~interaural -1 mm in the Franklin and Paxinos atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>). Here, the fibres passed dorsally and then caudally to reach the lateral parabrachial area, where they arborised mainly in the internal lateral nucleus (PBil), with much smaller contributions to other regions in LPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>). Many fibres crossed the midline by looping caudally in the superior medullary velum (SMV) to reach the PBil of the opposite side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). The density of labelling in PBil was nearly symmetrical between the two sides, presumably because some fibres that ascended on the ipsilateral side of the caudal brainstem reached the contralateral PBil through the SMV. In their course within the caudal brainstem, collateral branches were given off to the caudal part of the NTS, the parvicellular reticular nucleus and the gigantocellular reticular nucleus. A relatively dense bundle was given off from the main ascending tract at the level of the facial nerve and this arborised in the intermediate reticular nucleus and adjacent structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Axonal labelling in the rostral brainstem and thalamus was best seen in mice that had survived 8 weeks after spinal injection of AAV.Cre<sup>ON</sup>.tdTom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4</xref>). In these animals, labelled axons were seen at a moderate density throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the PAG on both sides. Only a few sparsely distributed fibres were present in the superior colliculus (not shown). Within the thalamus, labelled axons were seen in the posterior triangular (PoT) nucleus and these were more numerous on the side contralateral to the injection site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B,D</xref>). Apart from this, thalamic labelling was restricted to the medial part, in particular the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A,C</xref>). There was essentially no labelling in two other thalamic nuclei that are known to receive input from the ALS: posterior (Po) and ventral posterolateral (VPL) nuclei. A few labelled axons were seen in the hypothalamus.</p><p id="P7">Only very occasional labelled axons were observed in the cerebellum, and none were present in the gracile nuclei, indicating minimal expression of <italic>Sst</italic> by spinocerebellar or postsynaptic dorsal column pathways. Since axonal labelling in the brain was restricted to known targets of the ALS (NTS, various reticular nuclei, LPB, PAG, thalamus), this demonstrates that at least the vast majority of <italic>Sst</italic>-expressing lumbar projection cells belong to this system.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Expression of <italic>Sst</italic> in retrogradely labelled lamina V neurons</title><p id="P8">We previously showed that the ALS4 cluster (which includes Sst-expressing cells) was mainly located in the lateral reticular part of lamina V, and that most of the retrogradely labelled cells seen when AAV.Cre<sup>ON</sup>.tdTomato was injected into the LPB were present in this region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We therefore determined the proportion of projection neurons in the lateral part of lamina V that expressed <italic>Sst</italic>. We injected cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) bilaterally into the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM) of two Phox2a::Cre;Ai9 mice and combined immunohistochemical detection of CTb and tdTomato with fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (FISH) for <italic>Sst</italic> mRNA on 16 μm thick transverse cryostat sections. The CVLM was selected for CTb injections because this region contains the main ascending axon bundle belonging to <italic>Sst</italic>-expressing ALS neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Numerous CTb-labelled cells were seen in the L4 segments of these animals, and these were located in several regions of the spinal cord, including lamina I, the deep dorsal horn (laminae IIIVI), the lateral white matter, the LSN and the region around the central canal. Some of these cells were also labelled with tdTomato, indicating that they were derived from the Phox2a lineage. The distribution of cells that were labelled with CTb and/or tdTomato in the lateral part of lamina V (including its lateral reticulated portion) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>. Many of these cells contained <italic>Sst</italic> mRNA, and consistent with our previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, these were concentrated in the reticulated part of lamina V, which can be readily identified when sections are viewed with dark-field illumination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. We therefore restricted our analysis to this region, and found that the great majority (71%, 78%, mean 75%) of retrogradely labelled cells were <italic>Sst</italic>-positive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Most of the retrogradely labelled cells in this region (89%, 83%) lacked tdTomato, whereas all tdTomato-positive cells were labelled with CTb. Expression of <italic>Sst</italic> did not appear to differ between the cells with or without tdTomato (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To provide an estimate of the total number of projection neurons in the lateral part of lamina V in the L4 segment, we re-analysed the scans using a variant of the disector method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, by including only those cells for which the bottom surface of the nucleus (stained with DAPI) was contained within the 16 μm cryostat section. We found 42 projection neurons in 20 sides (2.1 cells per section per side) in one animal and 22 from 14 sides (1.57 cells per section per side) in the other. This gives a mean value of 1.8 cells per 16 μm section on one side, and since we have previously reported that the L4 segment is 1.45 mm long<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, we estimate that the total number of projection neurons in the lateral white matter (excluding the LSN) is ~165 on each side, with around 75% of these (corresponding to ~124 cells) expressing Sst and presumably belonging to the ALS4 population.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Relation to other molecularly defined populations among the ALS</title><p id="P11">Our findings that <italic>Sst</italic>-expressing ALS cells are mainly located in the lateral reticulated part of lamina V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, and that their main target within the parabrachial area is the internal lateral (PBil) nucleus, are consistent with the findings of previous anterograde tracing studies in the rat, which showed that PBil is innervated by spinal projection neurons located in the deep grey matter, including cells in the lateral part of lamina V, but not by neurons in superficial laminae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, Choi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> reported that PBil also receives input from two ALS populations, defined by expression of Tacr1 and Gpr83. Although they had focused on ALS cells in the SDH that expressed these genes, the innervation of PBil suggests that some of the cells were located in deeper regions. In addition, we had found significant expression of <italic>Tacr1</italic> and some expression of <italic>Gpr83</italic> in cells belonging to ALS4 in our snRNAseq analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3A</xref>). We therefore looked for evidence of expression of Tacr1 and Gpr83 in lateral lamina V cells by injecting CTb into the left CVLM of two Tacr1<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Ai9 and two Gpr83<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Ai9 mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. In these mice, cells that express Tacr1 or Gpr83 at the time of administration of tamoxifen are labelled with tdTomato. Since most axons belonging to <italic>Sst</italic>-expressing ALS neurons ascend on the ipsilateral side of the medulla, we restricted our analysis to lateral lamina V cells that were ipsilateral to the CTb injection, and quantified tdTomato labelling in cells that contained CTb. To provide further evidence for Tacr1 expression in the Tacr1<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Ai9 mice, we also immunostained these sections for the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1r), the product of the Tacr1 gene. Examples of immunostaining, together with plots of the cells and injection sites, are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3B</xref> and quantitative results from the Tacr1<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Ai9 experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>. In the 2 Tacr1<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Ai9 mice, we found that 71% and 39% of CTb-labelled cells in this region contained tdTomato, while 61% and 60% were NK1r-immunoreactive. As expected, there was considerable overlap between tdTomato and NK1r expression, with 80% of tdTomato-positive cells staining for NK1r, and 71% of NK1r-immunoreactive cells expressing tdTomato. In tissue from the 2 Gpr83<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Ai9 we found that 20% and 59% of CTb-labelled cells in the lateral part of lamina V on the ipsilateral side were tdTomato-positive. This variability probably reflected inter-animal differences in the level of expression of tdTomato in these crosses. However, overall our results show that some projection neurons in the lateral reticulated part of lamina V are captured in each case, and therefore presumably express Tacr1 or Gpr83.</p><p id="P12">Another population that had been identified among ALS cells is characterised by expression of Tac1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, the gene that encodes preprotachykinin A, the precursor for substance P. Tac1 is widely expressed among Phox2a-derived projection neurons, including many of those in ALS4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4A</xref>). Consistent with this, Huang et al reported that Tac1 projection neurons were located in various locations, apparently including the lateral reticulated area of lamina V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. They identify the main parabrachial target as the superior lateral nucleus, but this has a similar location to PBil. To test this, we reviewed sections from a previous study in which we had anterogradely labelled Tac1-expressing projection neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, and confirmed that axons of these cells terminate bilaterally in PBil (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4B</xref>). This difference likely results from variations in the nomenclature of LPB subnuclei.</p><p id="P13">Together, these findings support the suggestion that some cells in each of these molecular classes (defined by expression of <italic>Tacr1, Gpr83</italic> or <italic>Tac1</italic>) belong to the ALS4 population, and that these contribute to the innervation of PBil.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Retrograde transport of AAVs to target <italic>Sst</italic>-expressing ALS neurons</title><p id="P14">We had previously shown that a unilateral injection of AAV coding for Cre-dependent tdTomato into the LPB in Sst<sup>Cre</sup> mice resulted in retrograde labelling of cells in lateral lamina V on both sides. This symmetrical arrangement presumably occurs because many of the ascending axons of these cells, having passed through the ipsilateral LPB, cross the midline in the SMV to reach the contralateral LPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). We predicted that if this was the case, injection of retrogradely transported virus into the CVLM on one side should result in mainly ipsilateral labelling of ALS neurons. To test this, we injected AAV2r.Cre<sup>ON</sup>.GFP into the left CVLM of 2 Sst<sup>Cre</sup> mice. The choice of this serotype was based on a recent report by Browne et al that AAV2r selectively targets ALS neurons in lateral lamina V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. As expected, we found that retrogradely labelled neurons were largely restricted to the lateral part of lamina V, and these were far more numerous on the side ipsilateral to the CVLM injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figs 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Across the two mice, the mean number of cells in lateral lamina V on the ipsilateral side was 1.9 per 60 μm section (corresponding to 46 cells in the L4 segment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>), with 0.36 cells per section on the contralateral side. Cells in the ipsilateral lamina V therefore outnumbered those in the contralateral lamina V by a ratio of 5.5:1.</p><p id="P15">Finally, to provide further information on spinal cord collaterals of the <italic>Sst</italic>-expressing ALS cells, we targeted these neurons by injecting AAV.Flp into the CVLM on one side, and AAV.Cre<sup>ON</sup>/Flp<sup>ON</sup>.GFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> into the lumbar spinal cord on the same side, in two Sst<sup>Cre</sup> mice. Cell body labelling with GFP was seen in the injected segments, and this was largely restricted to neurons in the lateral part of lamina V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8A</xref>). In addition, a few labelled axons were seen in lamina I close to the site of the spinal injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref> inset). In segments rostral to the spinal injection sites, a bundle of ascending axons was present in the ipsilateral lateral funiculus, and collateral branches were seen entering the lateral part of lamina V and extending towards the central canal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8B</xref>). In one of the mice, which survived for 29 days after the operation, these collaterals were seen as far rostrally as the C7 segment, while in the other (which survived for 17 days) they could be identified as far as the T11 segment. This confirms that the collateral branches seen in these locations following intraspinal injection of AAV.Cre<sup>ON</sup>.tdTomato in the Sst<sup>Cre</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>) originated from ascending axons of the <italic>Sst</italic>-expressing ALS cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">The main findings of this study are that somatostatin-expressing neurons account for ~75% of ALS cells in lateral lamina V, and project mainly through the ipsilateral lateral funiculus to the PBil on both sides, while giving off collateral branches at multiple spinal levels, as well as to several brainstem areas. Thalamic projections from somatostatin-expressing ALS cells are present in PoT, but are otherwise restricted to the medial nuclei, especially MD.</p><sec id="S8"><title>Somatatostatin as a marker for ALS4 neurons</title><p id="P17">We previously reported that <italic>Sst</italic> was among the top differentially expressed genes within the ALS4 cluster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Sst was not detected in all ALS4 neurons, and it is occasionally expressed in cells belonging to other clusters. Nonetheless, our finding that Cre-expressing neurons in Sst<sup>Cre</sup> mice retrogradely labelled from the LPB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> or CVLM (present study) are largely restricted to the lateral part of lamina V suggest that the Sst<sup>Cre</sup> mouse provides a reliable way of targeting ALS4 cells and that these have a very distinctive distribution within the spinal cord.</p><p id="P18">Browne et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> have recently demonstrated that viruses of the AAV2retro serotype injected into LPB selectively label ALS neurons in lateral lamina V, suggesting that they show a tropism for ALS4. However, the density of cells that they captured was relatively low: 0.5 cells per 50 μm, which is equivalent to 15 cells per side in the L4 segment. We confirmed that this serotype is able to retrogradely label ALS4 cells in lateral lamina V, by injecting AAV2r.Cre<sup>ON</sup>.GFP into Sst<sup>Cre</sup> mice. However, we achieved ~3-fold higher number of retrogradely labelled neurons, possibly because of more efficient labelling from the CVLM. By comparing results from these injections with the total number of <italic>Sst</italic>-containing projection neurons in lateral lamina V, we estimate that ~37% of these cells were GFP-labelled, and this proportion would be slightly higher if any cells project exclusively via the contralateral CVLM. Although Browne et al describe the lateral lamina V cells that they captured as being a small population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, we estimate that there are ~120 <italic>Sst</italic>-positive ALS cells in lateral lamina V in L4. We previously reported that there are around 240 lamina I ALS neurons in this segment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, and lamina I contains at least 3 different transcriptomic classes of projection neuron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. It is therefore likely that the ALS4 population is of a comparable size to (or even larger than) other ALS populations.</p><p id="P19">Although our transcriptomic classification was based on those ALS cells that are derived from the Phox2a lineage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, we found that only around 15% of the <italic>Sst</italic>+ ALS cells in two Phox2a::Cre;Ai9 mice were labelled with tdTomato. While it is possible that <italic>Sst</italic> is expressed in ALS neurons that are not derived from this lineage, a more likely explanation is that lack of tdTomato in many of these cells reflects incomplete capture of Phox2a-derived cells in this BAC transgenic line. Consistent with this, Roome et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> reported that only a minority of lamina V cells with <italic>Phox2a</italic> mRNA were tdTomato-positive in Phox2a::Cre;Ai14 mice at E16.5, and we have found considerable inter-animal variation in the extent to which deep dorsal horn ALS neurons were labelled in Phox2a::Cre;Ai9 mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">Other molecular markers used to define ALS populations in recent studies include the genes coding for Tacr1 and Gpr83<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, and for Tac1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. However, it appears that all three of these are expressed by at least some of the ALS cells in the lateral reticulated part of lamina V, as well as by ALS cells in other locations, suggesting that they are not restricted to single populations. In contrast, the highly specific laminar location of the <italic>Sst</italic>-expressing cells supports the relatively selective association of <italic>Sst</italic> with a single population of ALS cells.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Response properties of ALS4 neurons</title><p id="P21">Numerous studies of the receptive field properties of ALS projection neurons located in lateral lamina V have been carried out in a variety of species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. These cells are generally described as having wide dynamic range (WDR) receptive fields, responding weakly to innocuous cutaneous stimuli and strongly to noxious mechanical or thermal stimulation of the skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, with some cells also being activated by visceral stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, or application of pruritogens to the skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. In addition, Menetrey et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> reported that projection neurons in lateral lamina V upregulated the activity-dependent marker Fos following subcutaneous injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant or periarticular injection of urate crystals, suggesting that these cells have a role in inflammatory pain states.</p><p id="P22">The ALS4 cells are likely to receive only a sparse direct synaptic input from nociceptors, as these terminate mainly in the SDH, and their nociceptive input is likely to be mainly transmitted indirectly through excitatory interneurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. One potential population of excitatory interneurons that could provide this input consists of GRPR-expressing cells in laminae I-II. These largely correspond to vertical cells, and have axons that arborise in lateral lamina V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. We have shown that chemogenetic activation of the GRPR cells evokes behaviours that appear to reflect both pain and itch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, and results in Fos expression in many cells in lateral lamina V, including projection neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. The GRPR cells may therefore provide both nociceptive and pruritoceptive input to ALS4 cells.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>The course of ALS4 axons within the spinal cord</title><p id="P23">One highly unusual feature of the projection from the somatostatin-expressing ALS cells was that the main bundle of ascending axons was located on the ipsilateral side in the spinal cord. We initially observed this when examining anterograde transport of AAV.Cre<sup>ON</sup>.tdTomato injected into the lumbar spinal cord of Sst<sup>Cre</sup> mice, and subsequently confirmed it by showing that most retrogradely labelled ALS cells were located ipsilateral to an injection of AAV2r.Cre<sup>ON</sup>.GFP into the CVLM in these mice. In contrast, retrograde labelling of these cells with AAV.Cre<sup>ON</sup>.tdTomato injected into the LPB of Sst<sup>Cre</sup> mice resulted in similar numbers on each side<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, and Browne et al reported a symmetrical arrangement of cells in the lateral reticulated part of lamina V when AAV2r.GFP was injected into the LPB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. This suggests that having ascended on the ipsilateral side and entered the LPB on that side, axons of many of these cells cross the midline in the SMV, to enter the contralateral LPB.</p><p id="P24">This pattern is very different from that of most ALS neurons, which have axons that cross the midline close to the level of the cell body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> and ascend in the contralateral white matter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Despite this difference, the course of the ascending fibres seems to mirror that seen by Chen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, who performed anterograde viral tracing from lumbar spinal cord (as shown in their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E,F</xref>). The functional significance of a mainly ipsilateral projection is not known, but if the same arrangement is present in the human spinal cord this would have implications for the interpretation of pain relief following anterolateral cordotomy. This procedure is performed on the side contralateral to the main site of pain, typically in patients with terminal malignancies, and results in effective pain relief on the side contralateral to the cordotomy, at least in the short term<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. If ALS cells in lateral lamina V in humans also project through the ipsilateral side of the cord, then those located on the “painful” side would be spared by this procedure, suggesting that on their own, they are not essential for pain perception. However, in many cases the initial pain relief following cordotomy diminishes over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, and an intact pathway from these ipsilateral ALS neurons may contribute to this phenomenon. In addition, some cordotomy patients report “mirror pain”, in which pain is felt on the same location as the original pain, but on the opposite side of the body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, and ipsilaterally projecting ALS cells may also be involved in this<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">Another unexpected feature was the presence of collateral axons that were apparently given off at all spinal levels rostral to the cell body. There has been considerable recent interest in collateral axons arising from spinal projection neurons, but this has mainly focused on those originating from cells in lamina I, and those given off close to the cell body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Browne et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> had combined optogenetic activation of ALS cells in lateral lamina V with detection of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases to identify areas that received input from collateral axons, and found that these included the superficial and deep laminae of the dorsal horn, and the area around the central canal. Taken together with our anatomical findings, this suggests that there are two distinct patterns: collaterals that enter the SDH are given off within a few segments of the cell body, whereas those that innervate the deep dorsal horn and lamina X arise at multiple segmental levels. Browne et al proposed that the major targets of the local collaterals were inhibitory interneurons, and suggested that this could serve as a mechanism for suppressing activity in other cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Interestingly, these 3 target regions (SDH, lamina V and lamina X) all contain cell bodies of other ALS cells, and the collaterals may therefore influence other components of the ALS. However, it is not yet known whether the collaterals exert and inhibitory or facilitatory effect at each of these locations.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Brain projections of ALS4 cells</title><p id="P26">Within the brainstem, the projection pattern of <italic>Sst</italic>-expressing ALS cells was generally similar to that described for other components of the ALS, with axons targeting the NTS, various reticular nuclei, the LPB and PAG. Consistent with previous studies that have traced projections from lateral lamina V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, we found that within the LPB complex, these cells projected mainly to PBil, and this highly restricted distribution supports the view that the Sst-expressing ALS cells represent a distinct functional population. Since projections traced in Tacr1<sup>CreERT2</sup>, Gpr83<sup>CreERT2</sup> and Tac1<sup>Cre</sup> mice also include this region, and ALS cells expressing these genes are present in the lateral part of lamina V, it is likely that these cells at least partly account for the PBil projections seen in these genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">Thalamic projections were restricted to the PoT and medial thalamic nuclei (in particular MD and nucleus reuniens). Gauriau and Bernard found that following injections of anterograde tracer into the lateral part of lamina V in rat cervical cord the main thalamic target was the centrolateral (CL) nucleus, which surrounds MD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. This difference may reflect a species or segmental difference, but more likely results from differences in approach, as theirs depended on spatial rather molecular specificity. Neurons in PBil project to the paracentral (PC) nucleus, and both PC and MD thalamus in turn project to the prefrontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, while the PoT thalamic nucleus targets the insular and second somatosensory cortices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Taken together with the lack of input to VPL (which projects to primary somatosensory cortex), our findings suggest that activity in the ALS4 population will influence prefrontal, insular and S2 regions. It is therefore likely that these cells contribute to the motivation-affective, rather than sensory-discriminative, dimensions of pain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Animals</title><p id="P28">All experiments were approved by the Ethical Review Process Applications Panel of the University of Glasgow, and were performed in accordance with the European Community directive 86/609/EC and the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

Neuronal labelling with NeuN antibody is shown in blue. Images on the left are confocal scans through transverse sections at different segmental levels (C4, T1, T10, L1 and L3). Higher magnification views of the regions marked by boxes are shown on the right. At the level of the injection site (L3) there is dense labelling in the dorsal horn, including the lateral reticulated part of lamina V (double arrowheads). In the high magnification image from this section, some labelled axons can be seen passing towards the ventral funiculus on the same side (arrows). At more rostral levels, a prominent bundle of labelled axons can be seen in the ventral funiculus (L1) or lateral funiculus (T10, T1, C4), and this moves progressively more dorsally as it ascends. A much smaller bundle is visible in the same location on the opposite (contralateral) side in the C4 and T1 segments (double arrows). Many labelled structures are visible in the ipsilateral LSN in the L1 segment (arrowheads), and this labelling extends rostrally to at least the T1 segment, although it becomes less intense in rostral thoracic segments.

The main ascending bundle of axons is located on the ventrolateral aspect of the brainstem on the side ipsilateral to the spinal injection (Right, R), and is marked with arrowheads. Collateral branches are given off at several levels in the caudal brainstem, in particular to the NTS, Gi, IRt and PCRt. There is a dense projection to the lateral parabrachial area (LPB), which is largely restricted to the PBil. Fibres enter the LPB by passing along the dorsolateral aspect of the pons (as seen at the -1.5 interaural level), and these connect with the main ascending bundle on the ventrolateral aspect at a slightly more rostral level (as shown in the inset). A few fibres can be seen in the PAG. Note that although labelling is predominantly ipsilateral to the injection site in the caudal brainstem, there is a substantial projection to the PBil on both sides, and some of this is likely to be through fibres that cross the midline in the superior medullary velum (SMV). Asterisks indicate a cut made on the left side that was used to orientate the sections.
