In this study, we address how people make sequential embodied decisions, requiring balancing between immediate affordances and long-term utilities of alternative action plans. We designed a novel virtually embodied, game-like task in which participants controlled an avatar tasked with “crossing rivers”, by jumping across rocks. The task permitted us to assess how participants balanced between immediate jumping affordances (“safe” versus “risky” jumps) and the utility (length) of the ensuing paths to the goal. Behavioral and computational analyses revealed that participants planned ahead their path to the goal rather than simply focusing on the most immediate jumping affordances. Furthermore, embodied components of the task influenced participants’ decision strategies, as evident by the fact that participants’ current direction of movement influenced their choice between safe and risky jumps. We also found that participants showed (pre)planning before making the first jump, but they continued deliberating during it, with movement speed decreasing at decision points and when approaching them. Finally, computational modeling indicates that farsighted participants who assigned greater weight to the utility of future jumps showed a better performance, highlighting the usefulness of planning in embodied settings. Our findings underscore the importance of studying decision-making and planning in ecologically valid, embodied settings, providing new insights into the interplay between action and cognition in real-world planning-while-acting scenarios.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>embodied decisions</kwd><kwd>planning-while-acting</kwd><kwd>affordances</kwd><kwd>affordance competition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Most everyday tasks, such as selecting a path in a crowded street, preparing a table or a backpack for a trekking, require sequences of embodied decisions, in which planning and action processes unfold simultaneously. Traditional studies of decision-making and planning in psychology and (neuro)economics focused instead on static, non-embodied scenarios, such as abstract problem-solving or choices between predefined offers, in which action requirements are minimal. Therefore, it is unclear how individuals plan ahead and how they balance the immediate affordances and the longer-term utility of different courses of actions in embodied settings.</p><p id="P3">Recent work addressed some of these limitations by focusing on simple embodied decisions and asked how people select between different courses of action, by weighting immediate affordances – or opportunities for action – and utilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cisek and Pastor-Bernier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gibson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Pezzulo and Cisek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Yoo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Priorelli et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Wispinski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gallivan et al., 2018</xref>). However, most of the above studies focused on immediate actions and affordances, such as selecting between reaching, stepping, or pressing actions, or choosing between following a current target or switching to a new one, without addressing sequential decisions and planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Cos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Michalski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Connors et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kobayashi and Kimura, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Lepora and Pezzulo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Grießbach et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ulbrich and Gail, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Warren, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Gallivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Nashed et al., 2014</xref>). Other studies investigated decision-making and affordance competition in sports, highlighting the importance of embodied strategies for successful performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Raab, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Gordon et al., 2021</xref>). While these studies advanced our understanding of simple forms of embodied decisions that exploit immediate affordances, the ways people solve sequential embodied tasks requiring the continuous construction and evaluation of novel affordances remains incompletely known. We still do not know how, in sequential embodied settings, people prefer plans whose immediate affordance for movement or long-term utility is greater; whether they preplan action sequences before initiating movements; whether the planning phase ends up at the beginning of movement or continues during it; whether embodied constraints of the task, such as the current movement or the cost of changing trajectory influence decision-making. Addressing these open questions requires designing novel experiments and computational models that address sequential decision-making in embodied settings, in which decisions and actions are intertwined, i.e., planning-while-acting studies.</p><p id="P4">Here, we address the above questions, by designing a novel experiment in which participants control an avatar tasked with “crossing rivers”, by jumping across rocks. Crucially, the task requires making a series of jumping choices, in a “virtually embodied” setting, in which the movements of the avatar follow coherent spatial and physical rules. Sequential decisions are often studied in psychology and (neuro)economics in non-embodied settings, in which the movements required to make the first choice are irrelevant for the subsequent choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Daw et al., 2011</xref>). Rather, in our virtually embodied setting, choices and movements are interdependent: each jump changes the direction and velocity of the avatar and the geometry of the problem. This allows us to probe whether and how some of the factors inherent in decisions made during real physical behavior, such as affordances, spatial relationships, and momentum, impact choice dynamics.</p><p id="P5">We created multiple sequential choices between “safe” versus “risky” jumps, corresponding to closer-and-bigger versus farther-and-smaller rocks, and between paths having different utilities (here, related to the path length to the goal). By analyzing participants’ behavioral choices and formalizing their strategies using computational models, we aim to reveal how individuals balance affordance and utility in embodied settings, how they form sequential plans, and how their choice strategies are influenced by embodied aspects of the task.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p id="P6">We recruited participants via the Prolific platform, indicating native English and age between 18 an 40 years as eligibility criteria. We only included in the analysis participants who completed all levels of the game, resulting in a sample of 40 participants (19 males and 21 females), with a median age of 30 years, while 5 participants were excluded for not finishing the experiment. All participants gave informed consent online before starting the experiment. All our procedures were approved by the CNR Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>Experimental setup</title><p id="P7">In this study, we develop a novel 3D video game using Unity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://unity.com/">https://unity.com/</ext-link>). The game requires participants to control an avatar (an anthropomorphic frog) to cross rivers, by jumping from rock to rock until a goal platftorm indicated by a red flag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Participants use the mouse to adjust the camera view, the ’W’ key to move forward, and the spacebar to jump. If the avarar falls into the water, the trial restarts from the last rock on which it stood, after a brief animation showing the avatar being transported back. The avatar is 1.75 units tall. The game’s world units are arbitrary, meaning that the relative proportions between them are what matter, rather than their absolute values. The gravity is simulated realistically, with a constant gravitational acceleration of −15 units/s<sup>2</sup>. Collisions between the character and the platforms, as well as with the water, are handled via an invisible capsule-shaped collider attached to the avatar. A non-realistic simplification was introduced, allowing the character to move forward and rotate even while airborne. However, no additional platforming tricks, such as “coyote time”, were implemented to artificially facilitate movement. The forward movement speed is 5 units per second when the ’W’ key is pressed. Acceleration from rest to this speed, as well as deceleration when ’W’ is released, is nearly instantaneous. The vertical speed imparted when pressing ’SPACE’ to jump is calibrated so that the avatar reaches a maximum height of 1.2 units during a jump. This means the initial vertical speed at takeoff is 6 units per second, the time required to reach the peak is 0.4 seconds, and the total duration of a jump is 0.8 seconds. Keeping SPACE pressed for longer does not alter the height of the jump. If the player holds ’W’ for the entire duration of the jump, the maximum horizontal distance that can be covered is 4 units. Finally, the avatar’s orientation (i.e., rotation around the vertical axis) is fully controlled by mouse movements. This ensures that the direction the avatar is facing always matches the player’s camera view, meaning there is no discrepancy between where the character is looking and what the player sees.</p><p id="P8">Participants start each level from a starting platform, which provides them with a full view of the map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.a</xref>). Crossing the river requires jumping across stones of two types: large rocks, affording a <italic>safe</italic> jump to a larger landing area and small rocks, affording a <italic>risky</italic> jump to a smaller landing area. The large and small rocks colliders have an approximate radius of 0.72 and 0.48 units respectively. The game levels are generated procedurally. They include a <italic>safe</italic> path composed only of large stones arranged in a zig-zag pattern on a hexagonal grid from the starting platform to the goal platform. Furthermore, they include multiple <italic>risky</italic> paths composed of smaller rocks, which branch off the <italic>safe</italic> path at random points. The <italic>risky</italic> paths move toward the goal by selecting one of three directions on the hexagonal grid: forward left, forward, or forward right. This design creates multiple decision points, between safe or risky jumps and paths. Notably, for each problem, there is a single shortest path, which could be either the <italic>safe</italic> path or a <italic>risky</italic> path. Regardless of which one is shorter, the difference in distance between the shortest path and the other is always two jumps. We fixed the distance between points on the hexagonal grid to 3.9 units, preventing participants from jumping to non-adjacent rocks. Furthermore, we applied a positional jitter to the rocks after the initial map generation, to create a more naturalistic arrangement. Specifically, each platform was moved in a random directions by 0.4 units. We made sure that the randomization was the same for all players and that, after the random jitter, the border-to-border distance between adjacent platforms (w.r.t. the hexagonal grid) was always less than the maximum jump distance of the avatar (4 units).</p><p id="P9">Our experiment used 40 game levels and a 2 x 2 design. The two factors reflect the decision to be made at the first decision point between a <italic>safe</italic> and a <italic>risky</italic> jump (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.b</xref>). The first factor reflects whether the the shortest path to the goal (measured as the minimum number of jumps) started with the <italic>safe</italic> or the <italic>risky</italic> jump. The second factor is the angle between the vector connecting the decision point to the chosen rock and the vector connecting the decision point to the goal, indicating how aligned the jump and the direction of the goal are. As a single jump is insufficient to indicate the path’s overall direction, we considered the average direction over the first few rocks following the jump. Note that path length is typically a better proxy for performance than the angle to the goal, as fewer jumps generally require less time. However, the angle to the goal provides an immediate, visually perceivable cue, whereas estimating path length is more challenging – especially considering that paths often involve more than 20 jumps. By considering both factors, we aimed to assess how participants balance efficiency and perceptual availability. Based on these two factors, we created four groups of ten levels each, for a total of 40 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1.c-f</xref>). We procedurally generated multiple levels for each factor and selected manually the best 40, prioritizing those providing more useful decision points for the subsequent analyses.</p><p id="P10">Participants are informed that they have a maximum of 80 seconds to complete each level and that they are awarded from one to three stars depending on problem completion time (or zero stars if they fail to complete the problem within the time limit). The total score, i.e. the total number of collected stars, was always visible in the top-right corner of the screen. Before the experiment, participants completed three tutorial levels to familiarize with the controls and game mechanics.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.3</label><title>Data analysis methods</title><p id="P11">We used mixed-effects models to account for both fixed effects of experimental factors and random effects associated with individual variability. We employed the <italic>pymer4</italic> package in Python, using the <italic>Lmer</italic> function for both generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and linear mixed models (LMMs), depending on the dependent variable.</p><p id="P12">In the case of binary outcome variables (e.g., probabilities), we used GLMMs with a logit link function, whereas in the case of continuous variables we used LMMs without a logit link function. In both cases, we included in these models random intercepts for each participant, to capture participant-level variability.</p><p id="P13">For each analysis, we compared models with or without interaction terms between factors, using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and we retained the model having the lower BIC score, indicating a better fit. Following the model fitting procedure, we conducted post-hoc analyses when we found main effects or interactions to be significant. We carried out these post-hoc pairwise comparisons using the <italic>post_hoc</italic> function in <italic>pymer4</italic>, with Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD) correction applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. This procedure ensured that we identified specific differences between conditions while controlling for Type I errors.</p><p id="P14">We set the statistical significance at <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05 for all analyses and we indicated in the boxplots all the significant differences from the post-hoc tests.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="results"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p id="P15">We first considered whether participants were able to solve the game effectively, by looking at their general performance metrics (reported below as mean <italic>±</italic> standard deviation) across the experiment. A total of 26 out of 40 participants completed all trials within the time limit, while others failed to complete one or more levels before the timer expired. On average, participants successfully completed 36.05 <italic>±</italic> 8.46 trials, making 21.30 <italic>±</italic> 2.97 jumps per level. The total time they spent actively playing the levels (excluding tutorials and transitions) was 31.47 <italic>±</italic> 14.63 minutes.</p><p id="P16">Participants demonstrated a high level of accuracy in the task, with an overall jump success rate of 93% <italic>±</italic> 5%, falling into the water 1.61 <italic>±</italic> 2.02 times per level on average. This indicates that errors were relatively rare, and performance was generally robust across conditions. Performance varied across individuals, with participants earning an average of 76.90 <italic>±</italic> 30.90 stars across all levels, out of the 120 possible stars if they completed each level perfectly.</p><sec id="S7"><label>3.1</label><title>Participants rely on both path length and angle to goal to decide between <italic>safe</italic> or <italic>risky</italic> jumps</title><p id="P17">We analyzed the probability of making the first <italic>risky</italic> jump (i.e., jumping onto the small rock at the first decision point) in relation to our two experimental factors: namely, the length of the path to the goal starting with the <italic>risky</italic> jump and the angle between the jump direction and the goal. We computed the probabilities per participant across all levels corresponding to the four specific combinations of these factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.a</xref>). Participants select the <italic>risky</italic> jump more often when both the path starting with it is shorter and the angle to the goal is smaller; and less often when the path is longer and the angle is larger. When either the path is shorter with a larger angle or longer with a smaller angle, participants selected the <italic>risky</italic> jump with intermediate probabilities.</p><p id="P18">To assess the relative influence of the two experimental factors on the probability of taking a <italic>risky</italic> jump, we fitted a generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM). We considered a model that includes an interaction term between the factors, as this resulted in a lower BIC than a model without interaction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Both path length and angle significantly affect the probability of choosing the <italic>risky</italic> jump (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001). However, the coefficient for path length is larger, suggesting a stronger influence of path length compared to angle to the goal. We compared all pairs of conditions using Post-hoc tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). All the differences are significant (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001), except for the two intermediate conditions (shorter path length, larger angle vs longer path length, smaller angle), indicating a lack of clear dominance of either factor.</p><p id="P19">These results suggest that participants consider both path length and angle to the goal when deciding which rock to jump onto at the first decision point. Moreover, the impact of path length on the choice is greater than angle to the goal, despite the small difference (two jumps) between the lengths of <italic>risky</italic> and <italic>safe</italic> paths and the fact that the angle to the goal is more readily available perceptually.</p><p id="P20">We extended the analysis to include all decision points, not just the first one. A decision point was defined as a condition where participants faced a forced choice between a <italic>risky</italic> and a <italic>safe</italic> jump. We excluded decisions points with more than two options or where both options where either <italic>risky</italic> or <italic>safe</italic>.</p><p id="P21">For each decision point, we calculated the length of the path and the angle to the goal for both options and considered whether the <italic>risky</italic> jump was associated with the shorter path or smaller angle than the <italic>safe</italic> jump, forming the same four categories as in the analysis of the first decision point. We then computed the probability of choosing the <italic>risky</italic> jump for each participant across these categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2.b</xref>). As with the first decision point, we fitted a GLMM to the data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). This time, we considered the model without the interaction term, as it resulted in a smaller BIC. The results of the GLMM confirm that both path length and angle to the goal are significant predictors of <italic>risky</italic> jump probability (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001). This indicates that participants consistently rely on both factors when making decisions across all decision points, not just at the first decision point. Post-hoc comparisons reveal significant differences across all conditions (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), with path length again exerting a stronger influence than angle, as evidenced by both the coefficient sizes and the pairwise tests.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><label>3.2</label><title>Current travel direction influences subsequent jump choices</title><p id="P22">We tested the hypothesis that participants’ choice between <italic>risky</italic> and <italic>safe</italic> jumps were influenced by embodied aspects of the task – specifically, by participants’ current travel direction at the moment they made the choice.</p><p id="P23">To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether the direction of travel before reaching a decision point affects jump choice probability. To analyze this, we introduced the concept of a “trajectory angle”, defined as the angle between the participant’s direction of movement and the direction of the jump to be selected; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3.a</xref> for a schematic illustration of how this angle is computed.</p><p id="P24">Given that each decision point presents two possible choices – either a <italic>risky</italic> or a <italic>safe</italic> jump – we analyzed these two possibilities separately. First, we considered how often participants selected the <italic>risky</italic> jump, based on the trajectory angle. For ease of analysis, we categorized the trajectory angles (which are continuous variables) into a categorical variable with three levels: i) 0° to 45°; ii) 45° to 90°; iii) greater than 90°. This classification reflects the arrangement of rocks in a hexagonal grid, where typical angles between directions (ignoring jitter) are around 0°, 60°, and occasionally 120° or 180° when participants backtrack (note that the latter condition occurs rarely in our dataset). We fit a GLMM to model the probability of choosing a <italic>risky</italic> jump as a function of the trajectory angle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Using the [0°, 45°] class as the baseline, both other angle classes exhibit significant differences (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001). This indicates that the trajectory angle significantly influences participants’ <italic>risky</italic> jump decisions. The results are further illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3.b</xref>, showing that all conditions are significantly different from each other (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref> for the post-hoc comparisons results).</p><p id="P25">We next made the same analysis for <italic>safe</italic> jumps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3.c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Similar to <italic>risky</italic> jumps, the results reveal a significant effect of the trajectory angle (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001) and that the probability of performing the <italic>safe</italic> jump decreases significantly as the trajectory angle increases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S5</xref> for post-hoc comparison results). These results show that participants are more likely to select either jump option, when their current travel direction is aligned with it. This suggests that participants do not consider only the static costs and benefits of the choice alternatives but also the continuity of movement and the ease with which they can execute an action within the context of their current dynamic state, demonstrating the relevance of embodied factors like inertia and momentum for the choice. This embodied effect emerges in our task since the sequential choices are not independent from one another and the task does not break down the natural contingency between movement and subsequent perception. This feature is often absent from non-embodied, sequential decisions often addressed in (neuro)economics, which comprise series of discrete and independent choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dewey, 1896</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Pezzulo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Maselli et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>3.3</label><title>Preplanning time indexes initial decision dynamics</title><p id="P26">We next examined the relations between the time participants spent preplanning before movement and their subsequent performance and strategy during the levels. We defined <italic>preplanning time</italic> as the time participants spent stationary on the first rock, before the beginning of movement. To assess how preplanning time influenced participants’ performance during the trial, we considered the length of the path they selected. We preferred this measure compared to possible alternatives such as total level score or completion time, since they are confounded by factors such as participants’ skill with the game and are therefore insufficient to isolate planning processes.</p><p id="P27">We used a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) to analyze the relationship between preplanning time and length of the selected path (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>) We found a significant negative effect of preplanning time on path length (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001), showing that participants who spent more time preplanning required fewer jumps to complete the level. A companion, correlation analysis between preplanning time and path length shows a strong negative correlation between the two variables (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.82, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Quantitatively, each additional second of preplanning reduces path length by approximately 0.274 jumps.</p><p id="P28">Next, we analyzed how preplanning time was influenced by the path length of the <italic>risky</italic> jump and the angle to the goal at the first decision point, using a generalized linear mixed-effects model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>). We found no significant difference in preplanning time was observed between levels where the <italic>risky</italic> jump resulted in a longer or shorter path. However, we found that participants spent significantly less time preplanning when the <italic>risky</italic> jump had a smaller angle to the goal (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Post-hoc comparisons show participants preplanned faster when the <italic>risky</italic> jump had a smaller compared to a larger angle to the goal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). These findings suggest that participants considered trials in which <italic>risky</italic> jumps had smaller angles to the goal more intuitive and less uncertain.</p><p id="P29">The two analyses of this section highlight distinctive roles of preplanning for selecting the first jump versus the overall path. Despite the fact that preplanning time is not affected by the length of the <italic>risky</italic> path evaluated at the first decision point, it strongly correlates with participants’ ability to select an efficient (shorter) solution to the overall problem, suggesting that during preplanning participants might focus on a global evaluation of the problem rather than only on the first decision.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><label>3.4</label><title>Planning time during navigation increases at decision points and at platforms preceding them</title><p id="P30">We next tested the hypothesis that in a continuous task such as crossing the river, planning processes might not only occur at the beginning of a level (i.e., preplanning), but rather continue during the level. To investigate this, we defined <italic>planning time</italic> as the time participants remain stationary on a platform during the solution of a level, without movement or rotation. We then tested whether planning time increases at decision points and/or at platforms immediately preceding decision points, compared to the other platforms. We categorized platforms into three types: i) <italic>Decision points</italic>, where participants must choose between different risky or safe jumps (as previously described); ii) <italic>Pre-decision points</italic>, platforms immediately preceding a decision point, which are not themselves decision points; iii) <italic>Non-decision points</italic>, all other platforms that are neither decision points nor pre-decision points; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5.a</xref> for a schematic illustration of these platform types in an example level.</p><p id="P31">We fit a Linear Mixed Model (LMM) to predict planning time based on platform type, considered as a categorical variable with three classes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5.b</xref>). The results show greater planning time for both pre-decision points and decision points (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001) compared to non-decision points, which was taken as the baseline. The coefficient estimates indicate that the increase in planning time is smaller for pre-decision points (<italic>β</italic> = 0.049) than for decision points (<italic>β</italic> = 0.114). See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref> for post-hoc comparisons. These results suggests that planning is a continuous process during crossing the river: it occurs not only before the movement but continues during the task.

The model assigns an EV to each jump, calculated as the product of two components: utility (U), corresponding to the inverse of the length of the path after the jump, and affordance (A), corresponding to the jumpability“ or ”landability“ (risky or safe) of the destination platform.

While previous sections explored various types of affordances, here for simplicity we only consider platform distance.

The relatively narrow range of <italic>γ</italic> values can be explained by considering that small variations in this parameter result in large differences in planning behavior, due to its exponential effect on future choices as the number of steps increases.</p><p id="P42">The fitted affordance coefficient <italic>α</italic> reveals two groups of participants. For 15 participants, the values of <italic>α</italic> are equal to zero, suggesting that this group does not prioritize affordance (jump distance) when evaluating the EV of their choices. In other words, these participants adopt a rather uniform strategy, treating all jumps similarly, regardless of distance. By contrast, the <italic>α</italic> of the other participants range between 0 and 0.5, implying that they consider the affordance (distance between platforms) when making jumping choices.</p><p id="P43">We explored whether the two parameters, farsightedness <italic>γ</italic> and affordance coefficient <italic>α</italic>, correlate with participant performance in the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Our results reveal a significant positive correlation between <italic>γ</italic> and participant performance, with more farsighted participants (those having higher <italic>γ</italic> values) achieving better scores in the task (Pearson <italic>r</italic> = 0.53, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7.a</xref>). Furthermore, our results reveal a negative correlation between <italic>α</italic> and the score, with participants giving more weight to affordances (those having higher <italic>α</italic> values) achieving lower scores (Pearson <italic>r</italic> = −0.44, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7.b</xref>). These results suggest that high-performing participants might pay little attention to the distance between platforms.</p><p id="P44">Furthermore, we examined the number of errors made by each participant throughout the experiment, where an error was defined as falling into the water during a jump. Our results reveal a negative correlation between the farsightedness parameter <italic>γ</italic> and the number of errors, suggesting that more farsighted participants tended to make fewer errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7.c</xref>). Furthermore, the results reveal a positive correlation between affordance coefficients <italic>α</italic> and number of errors, potentially reflecting the fact that participants who made more (fewer) errors tended to assign more (less) importance to the relative difficulty of making safe or risky jumps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7.c</xref>).</p><p id="P45">To further investigate the role of affordances in jump performance, we examined the relationship between <italic>α</italic> and jump success probability. For consistency with the selection criteria used in other analyses and our definition of decision points, we only focused on jumps starting from large platforms. Furthermore, we only included in the analyses those failed jumps where it was clear which rock the participant was aiming to reach; instead, we discarded ambiguous jumps in which participants landed in the water near their starting rock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p id="P46">Our analysis reveals that success rates were significantly smaller with risky compared to safe jumps, highlighting the increased difficulty of the former (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8.a</xref>). Furthermore, our analysis reveals a negative correlation between <italic>α</italic> and the change in success probability from safe to risky jumps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8.b</xref>). Specifically, participants with lower <italic>α</italic> values show minimal changes in success probability, suggesting that affordance-related factors may not be relevant to them, as all jumps, whether safe or risky, are equally easy for them. In contrast, higher <italic>α</italic> participants are more sensitive to the relative difficulty posed by risky jumps.</p><p id="P47">Finally, we compared the log-likelihoods between our EV model, a random agent, and an agent that always follows the shortest path (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">Table 8</xref>). We found the log-likelihood of our EV model to be lower than both the random agent and the shortest path agent. The shortest path agent performs better than the random agent, but exhibits a much higher log-likelihood than our EV model, along with a much larger standard deviation. This comparison suggests that participants make decisions that take into account both future planning and affordances, as captured by the fitted parameters of our model, rather than exclusively following the shortest path.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="discussion"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P48">Every day, we face a myriad of embodied decisions, such as when deciding what path to take in a busy road or which objects to use and in which order to set up a table for breakfast or prepare a backpack for a trekking. These and other tasks present sequences of choices between immediate and more distal affordances and often require simultaneously making sequential decisions and actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cisek and Pastor-Bernier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gibson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Pezzulo and Cisek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Yoo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Priorelli et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Wispinski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Gallivan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Nashed et al., 2014</xref>). Despite their importance, embodied decisions remain poorly investigated. Most studies of decision-making and planning in human psychology and (neuro)economics focus on non-embodied settings and the few studies of embodied decisions tend to focus on single embodied decisions, not sequential decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cisek and Pastor-Bernier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gibson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Pezzulo and Cisek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Yoo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Priorelli et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Gallivan et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, we still do not know whether, when making sequences of embodied decisions, people plan ahead by considering how different choices will lead to new affordances, whether they preplan an entire task before starting or continue planning even while acting, and whether embodied aspects of action execution influence the decisions that are made.</p><p id="P49">We addressed the above questions by designing a game-like experiment in which participants controlled an avatar required to ”cross rivers“, by jumping on a series of rocks of different sizes forming different paths to the goal destination. Crucially, the task presented participants with a series of choices between ”safe“ and ”risky“ jumps (corresponding to bigger-and-closer versus smaller-and-farther rocks) and between longer and shorter paths to the goal. This setup permitted us to study how people balance affordance and utility in sequential embodied settings. To get more insights about participants’ strategies, we also developed a computational model implementing jumping decisions as a function of current affordances (”safe“ and ”risky“ jumps) and the utility (length) of the paths that they open up. By fitting the models’ parameters (the weight of the affordance term and the degree of forward planning) to participants’ behavior, we aimed to formalize their decision strategies.</p><p id="P50">Our behavioral and computational analyses highlight five main findings. First, participants plan ahead their path to the goal rather than simply focusing on the most immediate jumping affordances. At decision points between safe and risky jumps, they balance jumping affordances and their long-term utility, indexed by the length of the paths that they open up and the angle that they form with the goal. Interestingly, despite the angle to goal being a more perceptually available proxy for path utility (albeit potentially misleading), participants take into more consideration the path length, which is a veridical index of utility. The fact that participants show effective planning strategies during ”crossing the river“ illustrates the effectiveness of embodied tasks to study higher cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Maselli et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P51">Second, embodied components of the task influence participants’ decision strategies. This is demonstrated by the fact that participants’ current direction of movement influences their choices between risky and safe jumps. This is possible since, despite being merely virtually embodied, our game requires detailed sensorimotor control of the avatar and the consideration of environmental affordances. Furthermore, the movements of the avatar follow coherent physical and spatial rules and the ease of executing a jump while continuing along the same trajectory (with some inertia and without the motor cost required to change direction) may impact the participant’s decisions. This finding illustrates that in (virtually) embodied settings, action dynamics can influence decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Lepora and Pezzulo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Priorelli et al., 2024</xref>). From a methodological point of view, studying sequential choices in embodied settings reveals subtle aspects of decision processes that might be relevant to understand everyday cognition, but might be missed when only focusing on non-embodied settings, as usually done in psychology and (neuro)economics.</p><p id="P52">Third, participants preplan part of the path at the beginning of the task, before making the first jump. This is evidenced by the fact that preplanning time is influenced by the perceived angle between the first risky jump and the goal and that longer preplanning time can lead to improved solutions (shorter paths). This finding parallels studies of preplanning during more abstract problem solving, such as the fact that humans think for different durations in different contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Jensen et al., 2024</xref>), highlighting that participants are sensitive to the sequential planning nature of ”crossing the river“.</p><p id="P53">Fourth, planning is not completed before movement but continues during the task. This is shown by the fact that participants’ deliberation time (indexed by slowing down during the task, not related to motor requirements) increases at decision points and even before them. This finding illustrates that in embodied settings, participants can simultaneously plan and act – and that a strict separation between the two processes does not allow accounting for subtle aspects of naturalistic behavior, such as the fact that movement kinematics index decision variables such as decision uncertainty and confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Song and Nakayama, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Barca and Pezzulo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dotan et al., 2018</xref>) and that participants can change their mind along the way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Spivey, 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P54">Finally, computational modeling shows that farsighted participants (which assigned greater weight to the utility of future jumps) show better task performance, above and beyond their jumping skill (which varies across participants independent of decision strategy). This finding highlights the possibility to adopt computational models that formalize the usual trade-offs that characterize value-based decisions, such as between the probabilities of the different outcomes (here, of successful jumps) and their utilities (here, path length) but in embodied settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Maselli et al., 2023</xref>). Besides providing a way to quantify participants’ strategies, the variables inferred by the model – namely, affordance and utility landscapes at decision points – could be potentially used a predictors of neural representations in future studies that address the neuronal underpinnings of embodied decision and planning processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Thura et al. (2022)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Cisek and Kalaska (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Klaes et al. (2011)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Siegel et al. (2015)</xref>.</p><p id="P55">Taken together, our results show that when solving an embodied task (even a ”virtually embodied“ one) – crossing the river by continuously selecting and executing ”risky“ or ”safe“ jumps – participants adopt effective planning strategies that balance immediate jump affordances and long-term path utility. Notably, participants’ decision strategies are influenced by embodied characteristics of the task such as their current travel direction and reciprocally, their movement speed is influenced by the necessity to continue planning along the way. These findings emphasize the interplay between decision and action in embodied tasks, shedding light on the cognitive mechanisms underlying real-world planning-while-acting scenarios. Furthermore, they underscore the importance of studying higher level processes such as planning in settings that reflect the ecological conditions of our everyday decisions and actions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS201447-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d2aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S13"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research received funding from the European Research Council under the Grant Agreement No. 820213 (ThinkAhead), the Italian National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), M4C2, funded by the European Union – NextGenerationEU (Project IR0000011, CUP B51E22000150006, “EBRAINS-Italy”; Project PE0000013, “FAIR”; Project PE0000006, “MNESYS”), and the Ministry of University and Research, PRIN PNRR P20224FESY and PRIN 20229Z7M8N.

In the top row (<italic>α</italic> = 0), where affordances do not vary with distance, all jumps have the same affordance.
