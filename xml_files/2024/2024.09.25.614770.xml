The functionality of these anchors is influenced by the residence time of CTCF on chromatin, which is determined by its binding affinity and its interactions with nucleosomes and other chromatin-associated factors. In this study, we demonstrate that CTCF occupancy is driven by CTCF motifs, strategically positioned at the entry sides of a well-positioned nucleosome, such that, upon binding, the N-terminus of CTCF is oriented towards the nucleosome. We refer to this nucleosome as the CTCF priming nucleosome (CPN). CTCF recognizes its binding sites if they are not methylated. It can then displace the CPN, provided the nucleosome is not marked by CpG methylation or repressive histone modifications. Under these permissive conditions, the N-terminus of CTCF recruits SMARCA5 to reposition the CPN downstream, thereby creating nucleosome-free regions that enhance CTCF occupancy and cohesin stalling. In contrast, when CPNs carry repressive epigenetic marks, CTCF binding is transient, without nucleosome displacement or chromatin opening. In such cases, cohesin is not effectively retained at CTCF binding sites. We propose that the epigenetic status of CPNs shapes cell-specific CTCF binding patterns, ensuring the maintenance of chromatin architecture throughout the cell cycle.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><p id="P3"><fig id="F8" position="anchor"><caption><title>Graphical Abstract</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199033-f008"/></fig></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">3D genome organization in vertebrates is largely shaped by CTCF, which stops cohesin-guided extrusion of chromatin at its binding sites in the convergent orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). CTCF is a ubiquitously expressed, highly conserved 11 Zinc Finger (ZF)-DNA binding factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). As part of the ENCODE project, CTCF binding sites were among the first to be mapped by ChIP-seq across multiple tissues and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). It is estimated that there are approximately 326,000 CTCF binding sites in the human genome, with an average of 66,000 sites occupied by CTCF in a single cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). CTCF binding sites serve as anchors for 3D genome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), activators or repressors of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), insulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), imprinting control regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), DNA repair sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), and more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Dysfunction of CTCF binding sites has been associated with various pathological conditions, including myotonic dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), aberrant X-chromosome inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Although the overall CTCF binding pattern remains largely consistent across different cell types, a small but significant proportion (~10-30%) of CTCF binding sites are cell type-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). These cell-specific sites play a critical role in defining cell identity by contributing to cell-specific 3D genome organization and gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). For instance, during ES cell differentiation into distinct lineages, changes in CTCF occupancy—marked by the loss and gain of cell-specific sites—are closely linked to cell specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Similarly, unique cancer-specific CTCF binding patterns have been identified across various human malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), and anti-cancer drug treatments have been shown to alter CTCF occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Therefore, CTCF binding patterns appear to be fundamental to cell fate and specialization. The dynamic reorganization of CTCF occupancy may represent a crucial cellular mechanism for adapting to new conditions or environmental challenges. Nevertheless, key questions remain underexplored: What determines the specificity of CTCF binding in different cell types, and how are changes in CTCF occupancy achieved during processes such as development, differentiation, or stress responses?</p><p id="P6">It has been established that CTCF occupancy is regulated by CpG methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), cell-specific transcription factors (TFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), kinases that phosphorylate ZFs to displace CTCF during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) or in hormone response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>), chromatin remodeling factors that open chromatin for CTCF occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), histone marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) and more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). CTCF binds a great assortment of DNA sequences using combinatorial clustering of its 11 ZFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). CTCF ZFs 3-7 are responsible for recognition and binding the 15-bp CTCF core consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>), while ZFs 1-2 and ZFs 9-11 bind downstream and upstream from the core consensus sequences, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). CTCF bound sites are located in nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) flanked by several well-positioned nucleosomes around CTCF binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). As cohesin translocates along chromatin, it encounters nucleosomes before reaching CTCF bound at convergent motifs, suggesting that nucleosomes may act as “regulatory barriers,” potentially modulating cohesin’s translocation speed and adding an additional layer of regulation to cohesin dynamics and loop extrusion.</p><p id="P7">Single-molecule level analysis of chromatin structure has demonstrated that only a small fraction of individual fibers is bound by CTCF at any given time in a cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>). Similar conclusions about the transience of CTCF binding were drawn from single-cell nucleosome positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) and single-cell DNA-footprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). CTCF binding is dynamic, with CTCF protein binding on and off chromatin with an average residence time of 1-2 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), while the residence time of CTCF-anchored loops is approximately 10 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Such dynamic binding is essential for 3D genome organization and necessary for chromatin extrusion by cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). When CTCF is off chromatin, its place is occupied by a nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). To re-bind to chromatin, CTCF must first reposition this nucleosome. This process involves chromatin-remodeling factors such as SNF2H (SMARCA5), CDH4, and BRG1, which can slide, evict, or remove nucleosomes around CTCF binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Consequently, nucleosomes play a crucial role in regulating CTCF occupancy. Evidence supporting this includes the significant loss of CTCF occupancy observed after the loss of SMARCA5, which disrupts CTCF’s ability to reposition nucleosomes and re-bind to its target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>).</p><p id="P8">The CTCF-nucleosome regulation model suggests that CTCF can recognize and bind to its sites even when they are occupied by nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Moreover, CTCF restores the exact same binding pattern in daughter cells after mitosis, during which most CTCF is released from chromatin due to phosphorylation of CTCF zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). Additionally, when CTCF is degraded using auxin-degron systems, its occupancy is erased, but upon auxin removal, CTCF occupancy is restored exactly as it was before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). These observations suggest that the CTCF binding pattern for each cell type is encoded in the DNA and chromatin status, thereby maintaining cell identity.</p><p id="P9">In this study, we sought to identify how chromatin status is involved in a cell-specific CTCF occupancy. By comparing ChIP-seq and Affinity-seq data from the same cell type, we analyzed CTCF binding sites both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Based on our findings, we propose a model for the regulation of CTCF occupancy that is driven by the epigenetic status of the nucleosome that is well-positioned relative to CTCF binding sites. To confirm this proposed model, we used wild type (wt) and mutant (mut) CH12 cells. Compared to wtCH12 cells, a homozygous deletion of CTCF ZF 9-11 in mutCH12 cells resulted in a loss of CTCF occupancy at five thousand (5K) binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Ectopic expression of wild type CTCF in the mutCH12 cells not only recapitulated CTCF occupancy like in wild type cells but, most importantly, restored CTCF occupancy at the same 5K lost CTCF sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), suggesting that these sites are somehow pre-marked to be bound by CTCF in the CH12 cells. In this study, we demonstrate that cell-specific CTCF occupancy is preprogrammed not only by the status of CpG methylation in the CTCF site itself, but also by the status of CpG methylation and histone modifications of the nucleosome asymmetrically positioned relative to CTCF binding site.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell culture, plasmids</title><p id="P10">CH12 wild type (wt) and mutant (mut) cells were described previously in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) and obtained as a gift from Dr. Casellas’s lab.

This extraction method preserves the DNA CpG methylation status, allowing mapping of CTCF binding only to unmethylated DNA sequences. The genomic DNA was incubated overnight with purified 6HisHALO-tagged CTCF 11-Zinc fingers protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>). In the current study, we downloaded the FASTQ files for CTCF Affinity-seq data from mouse spleen (GSM3039567) and mouse control DNA (GSM3039568) from the series GSE111772.

For heatmap visualization of ATAC-seq data, we sorted BAM files of paired-end mapped reads into two categories based on fragment size, using the bamCoverage option from deepTools. For CTCF footprints, we applied the arguments “--Mnase --minFragmentLength 40 --maxFragmentLength 130”, and for nucleosome positioning, we used “--Mnase --minFragmentLength 160 --maxFragmentLength 200”. For heatmap visualization of MNase-assisted H3 ChIP-seq data, we similarly used the bamCoverage option with the --Mnase argument. For ChIP-seq and meDIP-seq, we used just bamCoverage option without an additional argument. All BAM files in this study were normalized using the deepTools option “--normalizeUsing RPKM”. Heatmaps were generated using the computeMatrix option to simultaneously analyze and visualize multiple NGS datasets at the same genomic coordinates. Since certain datasets, such as ChIP-seq, exhibited significantly higher enrichment values compared to MNase-H3 ChIP-seq or MeDIP-seq, we adjusted the heatmap intensities using different --zMax values in plotHeatmap. The heatmaps, each with different zMax values as reflected by the numbers on the average plots and scale bars, were then combined into a single figure. The heatmaps and average plots were centered on either a strand-oriented CTCF consensus or the summits of CTCF ChIP-seq peaks, depending on the analysis. For analyses involving MNase-seq H3 data, we specifically used a strand-oriented CTCF consensus because nucleosome positioning is sensitive to the orientation of the consensus motif. Conversely, for ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C,D</xref>), ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S10</xref>, we centered the data on the summits of CTCF ChIP-seq peaks. This approach ensured that all CTCF binding events, regardless of motif orientation, were included. It is worth noting that only approximately 70–80% of CTCF ChIP-seq peaks contain a canonical CTCF consensus motif with a p-value &lt;1e-5. By centering analyses on the summits of CTCF ChIP-seq peaks, we were able to account for all CTCF binding events comprehensively.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Identification of CTCF binding motifs/consensuses</title><p id="P19">For CTCF motif analysis, we used the summit CTCF ChIP-seq or CTCF Affinity-Seq BED files generated by MACS2. The sequences around the summits of ChIP-seq or Affinity-Seq peaks were extended by 100 bp upstream and downstream for CTCF motif discovery. FASTA files were generated using BEDTools (getfasta option) based on either the human (hg19) or mouse (mm9) genome. These FASTA files were then used to recover position weight matrices using Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME) software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>). We ran MEME with the parameters (-nmotifs 1 -mod oops -revcomp -w 15, or -w20, or -w40) to identify the motif for CTCF ChIP-seq or CTCF Affinity-seq peaks. To determine the orientation of CTCF motifs for each CTCF ChIP-seq peak, we used the FIMO tool from the MEME suite with default settings (p-value &lt; 0.0001). FIMO allowed us to identify the genomic coordinates and strand-specific CTCF motif orientation under each ChIP-seq peak called by MACS2. Based on the strand-specific orientation, CTCF motifs were classified as either plus or minus motifs for further analysis. To generate heatmaps in deepTools that account for strand-specific information, we included strand data directly in the BED file with genomic coordinates (6<sup>th</sup> column). This enables deepTools’ computeMatrix program to handle strand orientation correctly, aligning data in the direction of CTCF binding site orientation. In cases where the 100 bp window around the summit of a CTCF peak contained more than one CTCF motif, we selected the motif with the most significant p-value. If several motifs within a single CTCF ChIP-seq peak had identical p-values, those sites were excluded from the analysis. The list of plus and minus CTCF motifs used in this study is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>. Notably, not all CTCF ChIP-seq peaks were associated with a MEME PWM (Position Weight Matrix) p-value &lt; 0.0001, as some contained variations of the CTCF motif or motifs with lower statistical significance. These CTCF ChIP-seq peaks were excluded from the deepTools heatmap analysis, along with peaks containing multiple CTCF consensus sequences. Consequently, the total number of mapped CTCF ChIP-seq peaks exceeds the number of CTCF motifs presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>, which were used for heatmap generation. To calculate the total number of CTCF motifs in the mouse genome, we used the position weight matrices from CTCF ChIP-seq data in CH12 cells to scan the mouse genome (mm9) using the FIMO tool with default settings (p-value &lt; 0.0001). To identify motif enrichment around CTCF ChIP-seq peaks, we used the MEME AME (Analysis of Motif Enrichment) tool, analyzing 400-bp sequences centered on the CTCF summits against the JASPAR CORE and UniPROBE Mouse motif databases.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>AlphaFold-Multimer prediction</title><p id="P20">We used the AlphaFold Server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alphafoldserver.com/">https://alphafoldserver.com/</ext-link>) to predict potential interactions between CTCF, BORIS, and SMARCA5.

Using these two genome-wide approaches, we mapped 26,208 CTCF binding sites in chromatin and 191,231 potential CTCF binding sites in naked genomic DNA of mouse spleen, respectively. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). The majority of CTCF sites (96%) bound <italic>in vivo</italic> (chromatin) were also identified by the 11 ZFs binding to naked genomic DNA (<italic>in vitro</italic>), confirming that the CTCF binding domain is a main factor of CTCF occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P23">However, 167,132 potential CTCF binding sites were not occupied by CTCF in vivo, despite being accessible to the 11-zinc-finger (ZF) domain binding as identified by Affinity-seq. Since Affinity-seq preserves genomic CpG methylation, which is known to negatively affect CTCF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), DNA methylation alone cannot fully explain the absence of CTCF occupancy at these sites. Given that these sites were free of CpG methylation and available for 11 ZF binding, we hypothesized that other regulatory factors may influence CTCF occupancy <italic>in vivo</italic>. Notably, a comparison of ChIP-seq and Affinity-seq data revealed that CTCF binding affinity is more uniform when the 11-ZF domains bind directly to genomic DNA, as observed in Affinity-seq. This contrasts with the variable binding strength observed in ChIP-seq, which is modulated by the chromatin environment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Motif analysis of CTCF binding sites detected by ChIP-seq and Affinity-seq identified the classic 14-bp CTCF core consensus motif at the summit of the recovered peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, this motif alone is not sufficient to predict CTCF occupancy. When the mouse genome (mm9) was scanned for the CTCF consensus, over 900,000 potential CTCF binding sites were detected, most of which were never bound by CTCF in the spleen or any other mouse cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). Interestingly, there were 1,772 CTCF ChIP-seq peaks in the mouse spleen that were not recovered by Affinity-seq. These CTCF peaks exhibited a degenerate variant of CTCF consensus motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), leading to significantly reduced CTCF binding affinity compared to peaks with a canonical CTCF motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). Given that CTCF occupancy can be modulated by other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), a motif analysis conducted within a 400 bp window around the summit of the 1,772 CTCF ChIP-seq peaks revealed significant enrichment of binding sites for various B-cell specific transcription factors, including members of the IKAROS family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>).

This suggests that these sites are valid CTCF binding sites, likely free from CpG methylation (due to their accessibility to the 11 ZFs of CTCF), but exhibit tissue-specific chromatin properties that restrict CTCF binding in the spleen. We aim to investigate which DNA and chromatin features that render these potential CTCF sites unavailable for binding in the spleen while allowing CTCF binding in other cell types.</p><p id="P26">In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, a genome browser visualization demonstrates that the potential CTCF binding sites recovered by Affinity-seq, but not by ChIP-seq in mouse spleen, are bound by CTCF in mouse B-cell lymphoma (CH12) and mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells (shown by arrows). There are also Affinity-seq recovered CTCF sites that are not bound by CTCF in CH12 and mES cells but bound by CTCF in other cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1B, D</xref>). Based on these observations, for future analysis, we categorized CTCF binding sites into three groups: (Group #1) sites bound by CTCF in the chromatin of the analyzed cells (CTCF-bound, ChIP-seq), (Group #2) Affinity-seq recovered sites not bound by CTCF in the chromatin of the analyzed cells (11 ZFs-only, naked DNA), and (Group #3) CTCF consensus sequences that are not bound by CTCF <italic>in vivo</italic> and not recovered by Affinity-seq (CTCF motif, not bound by CTCF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). For each group, we randomly selected approximately 32,000 CTCF binding motifs and analyzed them in the plus (sense) orientations, reversing the signal from the minus orientation to match the plus strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Previous studies have shown that CTCF competes with nucleosomes for DNA binding <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Once bound to chromatin, CTCF can reposition nucleosomes on either side of its binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). To investigate nucleosome positioning at the three selected groups of CTCF binding sites, we analyzed MNase-assisted H3 ChIP-seq data for both CH12 and mES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Our analysis first focused on plus-oriented CTCF motifs bound by CTCF in CH12 cells (Group #1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). The combined analysis of CTCF occupancy via ChIP-seq and Affinity-seq, along with nucleosome positioning, revealed distinct patterns. High-occupancy CTCF ChIP-seq peaks were primarily found in nucleosome-free regions flanked by well-positioned nucleosomes, while low-occupancy CTCF sites exhibited less stable binding and showed a nucleosome approaching from the right side of plus-oriented CTCF sites (shown by blue arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Clustering of CTCF-bound sites (Group #1) into three clusters based on occupancy levels revealed that low-occupancy CTCF sites, unlike high-occupancy sites, exhibit a narrower DNA footprint influenced by the nucleosome positioned on the right of the plus CTCF motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>, blue arrow). Interestingly, the same nucleosome on the right is well-positioned at Affinity-seq derived CTCF binding sites that are not bound by CTCF in CH12 cells (Group #2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>, blue arrow). This nucleosome is positioned such that, once CTCF binds, its N-terminus is oriented towards the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), with the CTCF consensus sequence located at the entry side of the nucleosome. We refer to this nucleosome as the CTCF Priming Nucleosome (CPN). The same analysis of CTCF sites bound or not bound by CTCF in mES cells showed consistent results with those observed in CH12 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Additionally, re-analysis of CTCF depletion in mES cells using the auxin-degron system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>) revealed that upon CTCF loss, nucleosomes, including the CPN, shifted inward toward the CTCF site but did not fully occupy it (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3C,D</xref>), suggesting that the positioning of the CPN and CTCF occupancy are interrelated across cell types.</p><p id="P28">Based on these observations, we propose that CTCF binding sites are strategically positioned at the entry side of the CPN. At sites where CTCF strongly binds, it displaces the CPN for stable DNA binding, with its N-terminus oriented toward the nucleosome, shifting the nucleosome downstream from the binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, schematic, black arrow). In contrast, at sites identified only by Affinity-seq, CTCF is unable to displace the CPN for a strong DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A</xref>).

To achieve this, we compared CTCF ChIP-seq data from CH12 cells with Affinity-seq data, classifying CTCF binding sites into two categories: sites bound by CTCF in CH12 cells (58,010 sites) and sites recovered by Affinity-seq but not bound by CTCF in CH12 cells (133,108 sites) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>). Next, we overlapped these two groups of CTCF sites with histone modification and variant data mapped by ENCODE in CH12 cells. This analysis revealed that the histone variant H2A.Z is significantly enriched at CTCF-bound sites, whereas the repressive histone modification H3K9me3 is predominantly enriched at sites not bound by CTCF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>).</p><p id="P30">To further investigate, we analyzed ChIP-seq data for H2A.Z and H3K9me3 at three groups of CTCF sites classified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>. High-occupancy CTCF-bound sites (Group #1) were flanked by nucleosomes carrying the active histone variant H2A.Z and were completely depleted of the repressive histone mark H3K9me3. In contrast, not bound by CTCF sites (11ZFs-only, Group #2) and low-occupancy CTCF sites within the CTCF-bound group (Group #1) were enriched with H3K9me3 at the CPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). These findings suggest that the CPN, marked by H3K9me3, may inhibit CTCF’s ability to displace nucleosomes for strong DNA binding. Conversely, H2A.Z may facilitate nucleosome displacement, consistent with previous studies implicating SMARCA5 in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>). Clustering of CTCF-bound sites (Group #1) and analysis of mES cell data further confirmed that H3K9me3 enrichment at the CPN restricts CTCF binding within the chromatin environment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A</xref>).</p><p id="P31">Since H3K9me3 histone modification is often associated with CpG methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>), we extended our analysis to include the analysis of CpG methylation in CH12 and mES cells at the three groups of selected CTCF sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A</xref>). This analysis showed that CTCF-bound sites (Group #1) were associated not only with the absence of CpG methylation at the CTCF consensus itself but also at the DNA sequence wrapped around the CPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A</xref>).

For example, CTCF sites that are bound only in mES cells are enriched with both H3K9me3 and CpG methylation in CH12 cells, suggesting a repressive environment that blocks CTCF binding. Conversely, CTCF sites bound only in CH12 cells are depleted of these repressive marks, allowing for strong CTCF binding in these regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4C</xref>). Similar patterns were observed in the human cell lines K562 and MCF7, further supporting the idea that the cell-specific occupancy of CTCF is influenced by the epigenetic landscape surrounding the CPN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5A-C</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Based on these observations, we propose that cell-specific CTCF occupancy is determined by CTCF’s ability to reposition the CpN for effective DNA binding.

Conversely, when the CPN incorporates an active histone variant such as H2A.Z, CTCF can effectively displace the nucleosome, facilitating stronger binding. Thus, the methylation status and histone modification state of the CpN are critical factors in determining CTCF occupancy.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>The loss of H3K9me3 at the CTCF priming nucleosome opens CTCF sites for a stable CTCF occupancy</title><p id="P34">As we describe the interrelation between high CTCF occupancy and the absence of the H3K9me3 mark on the CPN, we tested this hypothesis by examining whether CTCF sites identified by Affinity-seq in spleen cells but not bound by CTCF in vivo could be attributed to the enrichment of H3K9me3 at the CPN.

Comparing CTCF ChIP-seq data from wild-type and Setdb1 knockout (KO) cells, we identified at least 3,608 CTCF binding sites where CTCF occupancy increased at least twofold (p-value &lt; 0.01) upon Setdb1 KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The combination of CTCF ChIP-seq, MNase-seq, and H3K9me3 ChIP-seq at these 3,608 sites showed that increased CTCF occupancy was accompanied by a downstream shift of the CPN, moving away from the N-terminus of CTCF as H3K9me3 was lost specifically at the priming nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). In parental mES cells, the plus-oriented consensus for the 3,608 CTCF sites was located at the entry side of the CPN marked by H3K9me3, and this repressive modification inhibited CTCF binding. Upon loss of H3K9me3, CTCF occupancy dramatically increased. Although the H3K9me3 heatmap data at these sites appeared to position the repressive histone modification directly at the CTCF consensus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), more precise analysis revealed that the average summit of H3K9me3 ChIP-seq peaks, which were lost upon Setdb1 KO, is located at least 70 bp downstream from the start of the 14-bp CTCF core consensus, downstream from the N-terminus of CTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). These results confirm our hypothesis that the repressive epigenetic status of the CPN hinders strong CTCF binding.

We hypothesized that the status of the CPN may serve as a memory marker for CTCF binding, preserving the specific occupancy pattern seen in each cell type across cell divisions. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a model system involving wild-type (wt) CH12 cells and mutant (mut) CH12 cells. The mutCH12 cells were previously generated through the homozygous deletion of CTCF zinc fingers (ZFs) 9-11, resulting in a truncated CTCF protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>, schematic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>).

This approach allowed us to dissect the roles of the C- and N-terminal domains of CTCF in the re-establishment of occupancy at the 5K sites.

This indicates that CTCF is crucial for maintaining an open chromatin state at its binding sites. Ectopic expression of FL-CTCF (tagged with V5-tag) in mutCH12 cells restored not only CTCF occupancy at the vast majority of the 5K lost sites (as mapped using V5-tag antibodies) but also reestablished open chromatin and nucleosome positioning around CTCF sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).

To validate the ATAC-seq findings, we performed micrococcal nuclease digestion followed by H3 histone ChIP sequencing (MNase-H3-ChIP-seq) to assess nucleosome status in wtCH12 versus mutCH12 cells. The MNase-H3-ChIP-seq analysis revealed that several well-positioned nucleosomes flank the 56K remaining CTCF sites in both wtCH12 and mutCH12 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S7E</xref>). However, at the 5K lost CTCF sites in mutCH12 cells, the nucleosome positioning observed in wtCH12 cells was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-B</xref>).

Thus, similar to the Affinity-seq only CTCF sites shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D-E</xref> (group #2), in the absence of strong CTCF binding, the N-terminal nucleosome shifts toward the CTCF motif, positioning it at the entrance of what we term the CTCF priming nucleosome (CPN).</p><p id="P48">Ectopic expression of full-length CTCF (FL-CTCF) in mutCH12 cells restored the open chromatin state and the positioning of several nucleosomes on each side of the 5K lost CTCF sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), further corroborating that both chromatin states depend on CTCF occupancy. When examining nucleosome positioning in mutCH12 cells expressing either a C-terminal truncation (deltaC) or an N-terminal truncation (deltaN) of CTCF, we found that the truncation of the N-terminus prevented the restoration of open chromatin and proper nucleosome positioning around CTCF binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures, 3F-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E-F</xref>).

This failure likely results in the observed reduction in CTCF binding. Regarding the CPN nucleosome, CTCF-bound motifs were nucleosome-free prior to SMARCA5 degradation but shifted to the nucleosome entry side post-degradation, weakening CTCF binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). These findings align with our data from the 5K lost CTCF sites in mutCH12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). A critical distinction between the stable loss of CTCF occupancy in mutCH12 cells and the transient loss resulting from siRNA- or PROTAC-mediated SMARCA5 degradation lies in the behavior of the C-terminal nucleosome. Upon SMARCA5 depletion, this nucleosome also shifts inward toward the CTCF motif. Similar inward repositioning of flanking nucleosomes was observed with auxin-mediated CTCF degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3C-D</xref>) and nanoNOMe-seq single-molecule analysis of dynamic CTCF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>). This difference likely reflects chromatin’s ability to adapt to stable versus transient changes in CTCF binding. Notably, even with SMARCA5 depletion, CTCF retains the ability to recognize and bind its target sites. This conclusion is supported by our data showing that a CTCF variant with a truncated N-terminus can bind the 5K lost sites in mutCH12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>), albeit with lower occupancy than full-length CTCF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S7C</xref>) but fails to reposition the CPN nucleosome for strong binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>).</p><p id="P52">SMARCA5 has been shown to directly interact with CTCF by co-IP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>); however, the interacting domains between the two proteins have not been mapped.

Next, we examined the CpG methylation status across three distinct groups of CTCF binding sites in CH12 cells: (#1) Remaining CTCF sites: 56,276 sites that are bound by CTCF in both wtCH12 and mutCH12 cells; (#2) 5K lost CTCF sites: 4,958 sites that lost CTCF binding in mutCH12 cells but could be restored with ectopic expression of FL-CTCF; (#3) Irreversibly lost CTCF sites: 199 sites that were irreversibly lost in mutCH12 cells and could not be restored with FL-CTCF expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). The MeDIP-seq analysis demonstrated that while the remaining CTCF sites (#1) were completely devoid of CpG methylation, the 5K lost CTCF sites (#2) began to acquire some CpG methylation in the absence of CTCF, as indicated by the enrichment of MeDIP-seq reads at the CTCF motifs in mutCH12 cells compared to wtCH12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S12A</xref>, shown by the black arrow). In contrast, the irreversibly lost CTCF sites (#3) exhibited a more pronounced gain of CpG methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>, red arrow). Since CTCF binding is methylation-sensitive, the observed methylation patterns across the three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>) may explain the restoration of CTCF binding in mutCH12 cells. The persistence of low methylation levels at the 5K lost sites (Group #2) in mutCH12 cells permits potential CTCF re-binding when full-length 11ZFs CTCF is ectopically expressed. Conversely, the gain of CpG methylation at the 199 sites prevents CTCF re-binding, highlighting the critical role of methylation in regulating CTCF binding.</p><p id="P60">Previous studies have shown that CTCF binding is essential for maintaining the unmethylated state of its target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>). However, at the 5K lost CTCF sites, these regions largely remain unmethylated even in the absence of CTCF. Analysis of ATAC-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>) showed that the chromatin surrounding the 5K sites transitions to a closed state following CTCF loss, thereby preventing other chromatin-binding factors from sustaining the unmethylated state of these sites. This raises the question of why only a small subset (199 CTCF sites) of the lost 5K CTCF sites gained CpG methylation, while the remaining 4,958 sites remained largely methylation-free. To investigate this, we analyzed the sequences of the two groups (#2 and #3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>) of CTCF sites to determine whether the irreversibly lost CTCF sites might have a higher presence of CpG sites within the consensus sequence, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). No significant differences were observed between these two groups that could explain their differential methylation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Furthermore, the irreversibly lost CTCF sites were not associated with CpG islands, with only 3.2% of them being part of such regions. A manual analysis of the most representative examples of irreversibly lost CTCF sites revealed that these 199 sites already exhibited some level of CpG methylation in wtCH12 cells, particularly in the sequences surrounding the CTCF-bound sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S12B</xref>, shown by black arrows). This contrasts sharply with the 5K lost sites, which could be restored with FL-CTCF expression and were generally devoid of CpG methylation in both wtCH12 and mutCH12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B, D</xref>).</p><p id="P61">Thus, certain CTCF sites are more susceptible to acquiring CpG methylation upon the loss of CTCF binding. Based on the observed CpG methylation enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S12B</xref>), these sites may initially be hemi-methylated (with only one strand of the DNA being methylated, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S12B</xref>). Over time, with the loss of CTCF binding, these sites are more likely to become fully CpG methylated, which renders them inaccessible to CTCF binding.</p><p id="P62">As we have shown that the epigenetic status of CPN influences CTCF occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S2, S3A, S4C, S5D</xref>), we analyzed the enrichment patterns of H3K9me3 and H2A.Z around CTCF sites in wtCH12 and mutCH12 cells. A comparison of H3K9me3 levels at the remaining and lost CTCF sites in these cells showed that the epigenetic chromatin status did not change with the deletion of ZFs9-11, nor with the loss of CTCF occupancy at the 5K sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S12C</xref>). This may explain why these 5K lost CTCF sites remain available for future CTCF occupancy in mutCH12 cells. However, the 199 irreversibly lost CTCF sites did acquire the repressive histone mark, rendering these sites inaccessible for CTCF occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). As high CTCF occupancy was associated with the gain of the H2A.Z histone variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3 A</xref>), we investigated whether H2A.Z pre-marks the 5K lost CTCF sites in mutCH12 cells for future CTCF occupancy, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). However, analysis of H2A.Z in wtCH12 versus mutCH12 cells revealed that this histone variant was lost following the loss of CTCF occupancy at the 5K sites in mutCH12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S12D</xref>). This finding supports the conclusion that the absence of repressive histone modifications may maintain the 5K sites in a state permissive for future CTCF binding in mutCH12 cells, even though active histone variants like H2A.Z are completely lost.</p><p id="P63">Thus, in this study, we confirmed our initial hypothesis regarding the regulation of CTCF occupancy by CPN. We demonstrated that CTCF binding to the 5K lost CTCF sites in mutCH12 cells is preprogrammed not only by the CpG methylation status of the CTCF site itself but also by the CpG methylation status and histone modifications of the CPN. The preservation of the unchanged CpG methylation status and H3K9me3 histone modifications at the 5K lost CTCF sites in mutCH12 cells, as observed in wtCH12 cells, makes these sites available for CTCF occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). This finding highlights the importance of the epigenetic landscape in regulating CTCF binding and further emphasizes the role of chromatin accessibility in CTCF function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S26" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P64">CTCF binding patterns are closely linked to cell fate during differentiation, playing a critical role in 3D genome organization and cell-specific gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>). In this study, we sought to investigate how these cell-specific CTCF binding patterns are established and maintained to preserve cell identity. First, we compared CTCF binding to naked DNA versus chromatin and proposed a model for CTCF occupancy. According to this model, CTCF binding sites are strategically positioned at the entry side of a well-positioned nucleosome, such that upon CTCF binding, its N-terminus is oriented towards the nucleosome. We refer to this nucleosome as the CTCF-priming nucleosome (CPN). CTCF can either shift this nucleosome downstream from its binding site or not, depending on the epigenetic state of the nucleosome.</p><p id="P65">CTCF displaces nucleosomes when the DNA is unmethylated at CpG sites and the nucleosomes lack repressive histone marks, such as H3K9me3. Under these conditions, CTCF recruits SMARCA5 via its N-terminus, pushing the nucleosome downstream and enabling stable binding to the nucleosome-free sequence. Conversely, when nucleosomal DNA is CpG-methylated and enriched with repressive histone marks such as H3K9me3, CTCF cannot effectively displace the nucleosome. In such cases, the nucleosome remains in place, leading to weak and transient CTCF binding. Based on our analysis of the experimental data presented here and multiple published datasets, we propose that the contributions of the C-terminal and N-terminal nucleosomes flanking CTCF are unequal. Specifically, the epigenetic status of the N-terminal nucleosome (CPN) plays a more critical role in determining CTCF binding. This distinction is further supported by differences in their positioning relative to the CTCF binding site: 1). upon CTCF binding, the N-terminal nucleosome is shifted further downstream compared to the C-terminal nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>); 2). mapping CTCF occupancy using the CUT&amp;RUN approach often results in the asymmetric release of the C-terminal nucleosome along with the CTCF footprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>), suggesting that the C-terminal nucleosome is positioned closer to the CTCF binding site.</p><p id="P66">To confirm our model, we used wtCH12 and mutCH12 cells and demonstrated that as long as the CPN’s epigenetic status remains favorable for CTCF binding, these sites remain pre-marked for CTCF occupancy, even in the absence of CTCF itself. Our data suggest that both the CTCF consensus sequence and the CPN must be free of repressive epigenetic marks to permit stable CTCF binding. Active epigenetic marks, such as H2A.Z histone variant, appear to be linked to CTCF binding itself rather than serving as pre-markers for future CTCF occupancy. We also speculate that the mechanism by which priming nucleosomes regulate CTCF occupancy may extend to other pioneer factors, as REST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>), PU.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R86">86</xref>), and ESRRB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>), which are capable of displacing nucleosomes and associating with well-positioned nucleosomes. However, the exact mechanism of nucleosome displacement likely varies, depending on the specific protein partners of each factor.</p><sec id="S27"><title>Do small CTCF peaks matter?</title><p id="P67">Cross-referencing ChIP-seq (<italic>in vivo</italic>) with Affinity-seq (<italic>in vitro</italic>) from the same cell type revealed that CTCF sites detected strongly <italic>in vitro</italic> but not <italic>in vivo</italic> are still transiently bound by CTCF <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, this transient CTCF occupancy is often insufficient for these sites to be classified as significantly bound by standard peak-calling algorithms, such as MACS. Similarly, when comparing CTCF occupancy across different cell lines, a closer examination of cell-specific CTCF binding sites shows that these sites are also transiently bound by CTCF in other cell types but are not identified as significant peaks in ChIP-seq data.</p><p id="P68">In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S1</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6</xref>, we have highlighted these low-occupancy CTCF sites with yellow arrows. According to our model, CTCF can transiently recognize and bind to these sites without inducing chromatin opening. The repressive nature of the CPN, which incorporates the H3K9me3 repressive histone mark, prevents strong and sustained CTCF occupancy. Thus, we propose that there are many more CTCF binding sites than are currently detected by ChIP-seq using peak-calling algorithms like MACS.</p><p id="P69">Do these low-occupancy CTCF sites matter? Our data suggest they do. We observed that low CTCF occupancy is associated with low cohesin enrichment, indicating that these sites might contribute to loop formation, albeit transiently and for short durations. A growing body of research supports the idea that low-occupancy CTCF sites play a role in cell-specific transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>), serve as targets for JPX RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>). Additionally, recent findings indicate that weak CTCF sites help define H3K9me2/3 nanodomain structures within the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>). In summary, these low-occupancy CTCF sites should not be disregarded, as they may contribute to 3D genome organization and gene transcription.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Why does the enrichment of H3K9me3 and H2A.Z at the CPN affect CTCF occupancy?</title><p id="P70">In this study, we demonstrated that the presence of the H3K9me3 histone modification on the CTCF priming nucleosome (CPN) either reduces or completely inhibits CTCF binding to chromatin. This finding is consistent with several previous studies that have identified a mutually exclusive relationship between H3K9me3 enrichment and CTCF occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>). For example, during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into pancreatic islet organoids, CTCF recruitment to new binding sites is facilitated by the demethylation of H3K9me3 to H3K9me2 on nucleosomes flanking these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>). The H3K9me3 modification can be established by at least six enzymes, including SUV39H1, SUV39H2, SETDB1, SETDB2, G9A, and GLP, which exhibit redundant functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>). The single knockout of several of these enzymes has been shown to increase CTCF occupancy. For instance, SETDB1 depletion in mouse cells led to the increased recruitment of CTCF at more than 1,600 CTCF motifs within SINE B2 repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>). Similar results confirmed that SETDB1 knockout caused a global increase in CTCF occupancy, accompanied by changes in nucleosome positioning around newly occupied CTCF sites, independent of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Furthermore, G9A knockout also resulted in enhanced CTCF occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>).</p><p id="P71">Thus, the removal of H3K9me3 consistently increases CTCF occupancy at thousands of CTCF binding sites, though not universally. This pattern mirrors that observed with CpG methylation, which influences CTCF occupancy but is not sufficient to explain its genome-wide distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>). We speculate that the CPN may harbor additional repressive histone marks not mapped in this study.</p><p id="P72">The reduced CTCF occupancy at sites flanked by H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes suggests that CTCF may bind these sites transiently but is unable to reposition the CPN. As previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), and confirmed by our study, SMARCA5 (SNF2H) is required for CTCF to displace nucleosomes at its binding sites. Interestingly, histone deacetylation has been shown to block SWI/SNF remodelers from accessing chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R97">97</xref>), suggesting that repressive histone modifications may hinder SMARCA5-mediated nucleosome displacement, thereby preventing the strong and stable occupancy of CTCF. Conversely, active histone variants such as H2A.Z may facilitate nucleosome displacement by SMARCA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>), promoting chromatin opening around CTCF sites and enhancing CTCF binding stability.</p><p id="P73">A key question remains: what initiates strong CTCF occupancy? In this study, we demonstrated that the grammar of the CTCF core motif plays a critical role. The affinity of CTCF binding varies depending on the strength of the CTCF motif. CTCF likely demonstrates higher affinity for stronger motifs and, upon binding, influences the epigenetic status of flanking nucleosomes by incorporating H2A.Z through the recruitment of chromatin remodeling factors, such as SRCAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). This incorporation, in turn, further facilitates chromatin opening via SMARCA5 activity. In contrast, weaker CTCF motifs are more susceptible to cell-specific regulation of CTCF occupancy through repressive epigenetic modifications, as H3K9me3 and CpG methylation.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Why is the CTCF priming nucleosome well-positioned relative to the CTCF consensus?</title><p id="P74">Our proposed model supports the CTCF-nucleosome competition model, which has been explored in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). An analysis of MNase-seq data from experiments where CTCF was depleted using either the auxin-degron system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>) or a conditional mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">98</xref>), or where CTCF binding was lost during cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), revealed increased nucleosome occupancy directly at CTCF binding sites in the absence of CTCF. In this study, by focusing on CTCF sites in the plus orientation, we found that the CTCF consensus typically resides on the entry side of the well-positioned nucleosome, with the N-terminus of CTCF facing the nucleosome upon binding.</p><p id="P75">The next question is: Why is the CTCF priming nucleosome well-positioned? The fact that nucleosomes remain well-positioned even in the absence of CTCF suggests that intrinsic DNA properties, such as DNA conformation and bendability, play a key role in nucleosome positioning. Indeed, CTCF binding sequences have been shown to possess properties that enable them to stall RNA polymerase II independently of CTCF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">99</xref>) and help retain cohesin at CTCF-bound sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>). Notably, even when CTCF’s N-terminus, which interacts with cohesin, is directed to alternative target sites, cohesin is not retained at non-CTCF sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>), indicating that the specific conformation of the CTCF-DNA complex is crucial. Moreover, the CTCF motif sequence itself has been found to exhibit significantly higher DNA bendability compared to the surrounding 200 bp of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R100">100</xref>). DNA bendability is a key factor in nucleosome positioning, and sequences with greater flexibility often favor specific rotational settings within nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R101">101</xref>). Thus, the high flexibility of the DNA at CTCF consensus sites may naturally favor its positioning near the entry side of the nucleosome.</p><p id="P76">Another potential explanation for the well-positioned nucleosome could be related to non-B DNA motifs, which are found to be highly enriched at CTCF sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R103">103</xref>). Non-B DNA structures are known to disrupt nucleosome positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R104">104</xref>). If CTCF binding sites adopt a non-B DNA structure, this could act as a repellent for nucleosome assembly, further contributing to the shift in nucleosome positioning relative to the CTCF site.</p><p id="P77">In summary, our study underscores the critical role of the well-positioned nucleosome in establishing and maintaining CTCF binding patterns, which are crucial for cell identity. We propose that CTCF binding is tightly regulated by the epigenetic state of the priming nucleosome. The next question is: What factors guide and establish these epigenetic marks during cell differentiation?</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p id="P78">All analyses in this study were performed on total cell populations. While informative, single-molecule approaches could provide more detailed insights into the nucleosome repositioning dynamics associated with CTCF binding to chromatin. In investigating CTCF sites bound in vitro but not in vivo, we relied on multiple ENCODE datasets and other published ChIP-seq data for various epigenetic marks to explore the differences between chromatin-bound and DNA-only sites. However, we cannot rule out the potential influence of additional, yet-undiscovered epigenetic modifications that may contribute to these differences. Additionally, the analysis of wild-type versus mutant CH12 cells focused exclusively on the 5K CTCF sites with upstream CTCF consensus motifs bound by ZFs9-11. This scope may not fully capture the broader diversity of CTCF binding sites across the genome.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS199033-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d41aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Table</label><media xlink:href="EMS199033-supplement-Supplemental_Table.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d41aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S31"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study used the Office of Cyber Infrastructure and Computational Biology High Performance Computing cluster at NIAID, and high-performance computational capabilities of the Biowulf Linux cluster at NIH.
