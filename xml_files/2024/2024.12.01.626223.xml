Many of these compounds play direct roles in the interactions of plants with the abiotic and biotic environment, and have been exploited for this purpose by humanity, including the agricultural (e.g. geraniol, a terpenoid volatile, which repels eggplant-infesting pest moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Ghosh et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Byers, 2023</xref>)) and flavour and fragrance industries (e.g. vanillin, a volatile product of the phenylpropanoid pathway, which is the dominant compound in natural vanilla extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Gallage et al., 2014</xref>)). Although these compounds can be exploited in such ways, and although chemical structures of numerous plant metabolites have been described, their biological functions remain unknown in many cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dixon and Dickinson, 2024</xref>). Many of these compounds are volatiles, which are especially well known for influencing plants’ interactions with insects by attracting both beneficial and antagonistic species (e.g. pollinators and herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Raguso, 2008</xref>)), with significant implications for plant ecology and evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Byers, 2021</xref>) as well as agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Pickett and Khan, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Identifying which volatile cues emitted by plants are perceived by plant-interacting insects is key to our understanding of these cross-kingdom interactions. In particular, identifying insect-relevant volatiles can facilitate work in plant secondary metabolism, ecology, and evolution. For example, identifying pest-resistant crop varieties by screening for known resistance volatiles is cheaper and easier than performing field trials (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Ghosh et al., 2023</xref>), while determining which volatiles are key to the ecology and evolution of plant-pollinator interactions can facilitate genetic mapping of only those volatiles rather than the entire plant headspace (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Byers et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">2014b</xref>). In short, identifying insect-relevant volatiles – often only a fraction of a plant’s emitted volatiles and individually not always the most abundant volatiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Clavijo McCormick et al., 2014</xref>) – can dramatically reduce the experimental scope and increase the tractability of plant secondary metabolite study.</p><p id="P6">Electroantennography – the detection and measurement of electrical signals from whole insect antennae – is often used to screen plant volatiles for insect perceptibility. The compounds to which the insect antenna “responds” with some voltage change are taken to be physiologically active and may be further tested via behavioural assays with single pure or mixed compounds or with plant lines known to be high or low in the relevant compounds. Although these techniques have been in use for nearly seventy years, being first described in 1957 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Schneider, 1957</xref>), the resulting data are always presented qualitatively – “response/no response” (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Peakall et al., 2010</xref>) – with no quantitative, repeatable measure used to define antennal “response” versus background activity. Indeed, a comprehensive and well-cited overview of GC-EAD includes no mention of how data analysis is performed or what criteria are used to define an “active” peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Schiestl and Marion-Poll, 2002</xref>). This has hampered the field by limiting reproducibility and cross-study or cross-observer comparisons, introducing error, and reducing ease of application to broader plant volatile studies. This may be a particular issue with many plant volatiles, which – unlike insect pheromones – may not have the same degree of “dedicated hardware” on the insect antenna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Akers and Getz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Schiestl and Marion-Poll, 2002</xref>) and thus may produce weaker signals, with the exception of sexually deceptive insect pollination systems which use insect pheromone compounds to attract pollinators.</p><p id="P7">In this Protocol Note, I present “best practice” statistical approaches incorporating techniques from signal processing to analyse gas chromatography-coupled electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) data in a quantitative fashion. Methods for correcting for baseline drift (specifically, the use of the antennal signal first forward difference), background antennal noise (specifically, comparison with response to the solvent control), and antennal sensitivity loss (via use of windowing) are presented. A sample data set from six <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> hawkmoths (three males and three females), four <italic>Bombus terrestris audax</italic> bumble bees (all workers), and 28 common volatile stimuli of different volatile chemical skeleton types (all present in a variety of plant species) are used to demonstrate the methods and their application in detail and show that they work for a variety of volatile plant secondary metabolites and two major model pollinating insect species. I show that quantitative analyses of electroantennogram data are indeed possible and quite feasible, pointing the way forward for robust, statistically-based analyses of antennal detection ability in volatile-driven plant-insect interactions.</p></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="methods | results"><title>Methods and Results</title><sec id="S6"><title>Methods: Gas chromatography-coupled electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) setup and recording</title><sec id="S7"><title>Insect sourcing</title><p id="P8">Adult <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> (L.)

Standards were obtained from a variety of established sources (see Table S1 for vendor addresses and Table S2 for vendor and product numbers) and diluted to 10μg/μl in hexane (HPLC-grade, ca. 95% purity). The final compound list was selected to include a variety of chemical skeletons (terpenoids, aromatics, fatty acid derived compounds, and one nitrogenous compound) that would separate well on a 10°C per minute GC oven ramp program. Due to differences in FID responsiveness to the individual compounds (i.e. some compounds may produce different peak areas on the FID despite being at equal injected amounts), different volumes of the 10μg/μl dilutions were added to the mixture (see Table S2 for final concentrations, which ranged from 93ng/μl for (R)-(+)-limonene to 2004ng/μl (2.004μg/μl) for indole).</p><p id="P10">To determine retention times and mixture peak identities, 3ul of the test mixture was manually injected into an Agilent 7890BGC (Agilent, Stockport, UK) fitted with an Agilent 5977A/B MS detector (GC-MS) and a Phenomenex Zebron ZB-5HT column (30m x 0.25mm x 0.10μm; Phenomenex UK Ltd, Macclesfield, United Kingdom). The GC run parameters were as follows: the column flow was 1.0603 ml/min of helium carrier gas with an oven program of 50°C for 4 minutes followed by a temperature ramp of 10°C/minute to 230°C, which was then held for 4 minutes.

The column (a Phenomenex Zebron ZB-5HT column (35m x 0.25mm x 0.10μm), identical to the one used for GC-MS analysis) was fitted to a splitless inlet kept at 250°C. The detector end of the column was fitted to the bottom end of an inert glass Y-splitter (Agilent UltraInert Universal PressFit Y-Splitter, part 5190-6980). The two other arms of the splitter were fitted with deactivated column segments of equal 30cm length (Agilent CP803210, 0.32mm inner diameter), with one end running to the FID (which was kept at 300°C) and the other end leaving the GC oven through a port on the side which was fitted with a Syntech EC-03 heated transfer tube kept at 250°C. The GC used hydrogen as a carrier gas, which was generated with a Parker Hydrogen Generator (H2PEM-100, Thames Restek UK Ltd, Saunderton, United Kingdom). Nitrogen gas at a flow of 25ml/min was used as a make-up gas, and the FID was also fed with compressed air at 400ml/min to ensure adequate flame gas supply. The GC run parameters were as follows: the column flow was 4.7 ml/min with an oven program of 50°C for 4 minutes followed by a temperature ramp of 10°C/minute to 230°C, which was then held for 4 minutes. Each manual sample injection consisted of 3ul of the EAD test mixture, for a total of 0.279-6.012μg of compound injected. GC-FID chromatogram waveforms were exported from Agilent OpenLab CDS v2.5 software as CSV files consisting of an FID amplitude value (in pA) for each given sampled timepoint.</p><p id="P14">The EAD recording setup consisted of a Syntech IDAC-2 (Ockenfels Syntech, Buchenbach, Germany) connected to the desktop computer controlling the GC-FIDsystem. A constant air flow (setting 8 on the CS-55) was delivered using a Syntech CS-55 Stimulus Controller throughout the experiment. Prior to and shortly after each GC-FID run, a puff of the EAD test mixture (via a Pasteur pipette fitted with filter paper, with 10μl of the EAD test mixture added onto the paper, also setting 8 on the CS-55) was delivered using the CS-55 to ensure antennal viability had been maintained throughout the GC-FID run. EAD signals were captured using Syntech GcEAD 2014 v1.2.5 software with default settings and exported as CSV waveforms in GcEAD 2014 (measured as millivolts) prior to analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Methods: Data processing and analysis</title><sec id="S12"><title>GC-FID peak identification</title><p id="P15">A custom Perl script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Perl, 2023</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Appendix</xref> for script) was developed to determine the “onset” and “offset” timings (i.e. when a peak began and when it ended) of GC-FID peaks above a certain user-defined threshold from the FID CSV data. In the presented experimental data, the threshold was set at 50pA to capture all significant peaks while avoiding inclusion of small peaks likely representing contamination from the hexane solvent. Note that this resulted in the merger of the closely eluting caryophyllene oxide and ethyl laurate peaks, which were removed from the analyses of compound type and compound modification impact on GC-EAD responses as a result.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Data loading and initial processing</title><p id="P16">EAD and FID waveforms were loaded as CSV files into R (R Core Team, 2024; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Appendix</xref> for example script). GC-FID onsets and offsets determined in the previous section were also loaded. As the EAD setup samples at a rate of 6000 datapoints per second and does not export a timestamp to its CSV file, a new time variable was defined corresponding to the sampling rate. The GC-FID injection time and a 20 minute endpoint (after all tested peaks had eluted) relative to the EAD time were also defined, as were EAD timestamps corresponding to each GC-FID peak onset and offset. As injections were done manually for the GC-FID, there was occasionally a slight disparity between GC-FID peak onsets and the onset of a significant-seeming EAD pattern, and so a user-defined offset was determined by comparing the most significant EAD pattern onset with the previously determined corresponding GC-FID peak onset.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>First Forward Difference (FFD) processing and significant FFD value identification</title><p id="P17">Using the diff() function in base R (specifically as ‘diff(EADamplitude,lag=1,differences=1)’), the First Forward Difference of the antennal amplitude was calculated from the input antennal amplitude data. The FFD vector was subsetted into five windows of four minutes each for a total GC-FID run of 20 minutes. For each window, the average and standard deviation of the FFD within that window was calculated. A significance threshold of 3σ above or below the average was calculated, and data points that exceeded the significance threshold for their respective windows were marked as significant.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Calculating the number of significant FFD hits per second for each identified GC-FID peak</title><p id="P18">For each GC-FID peak identified, the number of significant hits as defined above within its onset-offset window was determined using the ‘between’ function in the R package dplyr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Wickham et al., 2023</xref>). This value was divided by the length of the GC-FID peak in seconds (offset time minus onset time) to get the significant hit frequency of hits/second. As EAD data can have significant background noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Schiestl and Marion-Poll, 2002</xref>), we defined the frequency of the initial hexane peak 1 as the threshold for whether a peak attracted significant EAD activity: if the frequency for a given GC-FID peak exceeded the frequency of the hexane peak, it was counted as significant, and otherwise considered insignificant.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P19">A “significant response” across each species-sex/caste category (female <italic>M. sexta</italic>, male <italic>M. sexta</italic>, and worker <italic>B. terrestris</italic>) was identified for compounds where &gt;50% of individuals tested showed a significant hit frequency greater than that of the initial large solvent (hexane) peak.</p><p id="P20">To investigate whether the results were repeatable between moths, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the significant hit frequency for each pair of moths within a sex using cor.test() in R.

We separately conducted a somewhat haphazard literature review to identify whether our tested compounds had previously been identified as electroantennographically active in either <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> or <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic>, with the results shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>. In general, many of our tested compounds had not previously been tested with GC-EAD or puff-based electroantennography, and those that had been often produced results that differed between studies, further suggesting the need for a quantitative analysis technique such as the one presented here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S22" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P27">In this Protocol Note, we have presented a novel signal processing-based methodology for use with gas chromatography-coupled electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) measurements of insect antennae in response to plant volatiles. Female <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> hawkmoths were responsive to approximately half of tested compounds in a highly repeatable fashion, while male hawkmoths of the same species responded to only about one eighth of tested compounds and were far less repeatable between individuals. In female moths, compound skeleton type (FAD, aromatic, terpenoid, or nitrogenous) and modification (none, alcohol, aldehyde, ester, ketone, or oxide) played a significant role in response patterns, while in male moths this was only true for modification type but not compound skeleton type. Worker <italic>Bombus terrestris audax</italic> bumble bees showed an intermediate level of response, with significant responses to one third of tested compounds, and with no difference in response rate relative to compound type or modification.</p><p id="P28">Our haphazard literature review to identify compounds that had previously been identified as electroantennographically active in either <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> or <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic> identified large gaps in our knowledge, as well as discrepancies between studies in whether compounds were designated as physiologically active or not in the antenna. Consistent with our findings, some compounds were significant in some studies but not others, emphasizing the importance of testing stimuli on multiple individuals of a given species rather than relying on one or two individuals, given that we found variability even between individuals of the same commercial bumble bee hive and hawkmoth colony. The weaker responses seen in bumble bees further necessitate the use of this new technique to ensure unbiased assessment of electroantennographic detection studies in potentially less strongly responsive insects.</p><p id="P29">By studying responses to common plant volatiles in two model pollinator species, we have shown that responses are species- and sex-specific, and that it will be difficult to generalize results from one pollinator group to another. Further study will be needed to determine whether results can be generalized within a genus of pollinators, or between those that are generalists and specialists. However, at least one species of pollinating insect was responsive to the majority of the plant compounds tested here. Interestingly, there was no significant GC-EAD response in any species tested to the monoterpene (R)-(+)-limonene. Limonene is the most widely distributed floral volatile in terms of angiosperm families in which it is found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Schiestl, 2010</xref>), and is known to provoke a responsive in the antennal lobe of <italic>Bombus vosnesenskii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Byers et al., 2014a</xref>). We also did not see any response to the common nitrogenous volatile indole. The latter is utilized in many dung-mimicking brood site-deceptive pollination systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Jürgens et al., 2013</xref>), which does not include the insects tested here.</p><p id="P30">The methods introduced make use of existing typical GC-EAD recording setups and methods, differing only in the downstream processing of collected GC-EAD data, and thus may be used with both existing as well as novel datasets. In addition, they are simple to execute, requiring only minimal implementation in R or another statistical processing language (example code is provided in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Appendix</xref>). This study provides the first truly quantitative analysis of insect responses to common plant volatiles using GC-EAD, and paves the way forward for future GC-EAD analyses to incorporate quantitative, unbiased data processing methodologies to determine whether plant volatiles are physiologically active to interacting insect species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures and Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS201683-supplement-Supplemental_Figures_and_Tables.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d194aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Appendix</label><media xlink:href="EMS201683-supplement-Appendix.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d194aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the John Innes Centre (JIC) Entomology platform for maintaining the <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> and <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic> colonies and the JIC Metabolomics platform for GC-MS maintenance.
