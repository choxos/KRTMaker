disadvantages, highlighting the need to identify new drug targets. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane proteins whose surface expression and extracellular activation make them desirable drug targets. Our previous studies have identified 144 GPCR genes to be expressed in primary human osteoclasts, which could provide novel drug targets. The development of high-throughput assays to assess osteoclast activity would improve the efficiency at which we could assess the effect of GPCR activation on human bone cells and could be utilised for future compound screening. Here we assessed the utility of a high-content imaging (HCI) assay that measured cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 (NFATc1), a transcription factor that is essential for osteoclast differentiation and resorptive activity. We first demonstrated that the HCI assay detected changes in NFATc1 nuclear translocation in human primary osteoclasts using GIPR as a positive control, then developed an automated analysis platform to assess NFATc1 in nuclei in an efficient and unbiased manner. We assessed six GPCRs simultaneously and identified four receptors (FFAR2, FFAR4, FPR1, GPR35) that reduced osteoclast activity. Bone resorption assays and measurements of TRAP activity verified that activation of these GPCRs reduced osteoclast activity, and that receptor-specific antagonists prevented these effects. These studies demonstrate that HCI of NFATc1 can accurately assess osteoclast activity in human cells, reducing observer bias and increasing efficiency of target detection for future osteoclast-targeted osteoporosis therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bone resorption</kwd><kwd>FFAR2</kwd><kwd>FFAR4</kwd><kwd>FPR1/2/3</kwd><kwd>orphan GPCRs</kwd><kwd>NFATc1 nuclear translocation</kwd><kwd>TRAP activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disorder characterised by reduced bone density and increased fracture risk. Over 10 million people in the United States and &gt;25 million in Europe are estimated to have osteoporosis with &gt;6 million fractures reported each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Park, et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Willers, et al. 2022</xref>). Pharmacological treatment focuses on prevention of bone loss or increases in bone mass using anti-resorptive, anabolic or combined anti-resorptive and anabolic drugs including bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone-related analogues, and sclerostin inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Park et al. 2023</xref>). However, although effective in lowering fracture risk and increasing bone mass these drugs do have disadvantages. Bisphosphonates are associated with adverse effects including acute reactions in ∼18% of patients, and osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Khosla, et al. 2012</xref>). Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), which inhibits osteoclast differentiation and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Kendler, et al. 2022</xref>). It has long-term improvements in bone mineral density; however, cessation of treatment induces rapid bone loss and increases fracture risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Ferrari and Langdahl 2023</xref>). Romosozumab is an antibody against sclerostin which transiently inhibits bone resorption and promotes bone formation. Although more effective than other osteoporosis treatments in clinical trials, romosozumab has been associated with serious cardiovascular events. Moreover, prior treatment with bisphosphonates and denosumab attenuate its ability to increase bone mineral density (BMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Ebina, et al. 2024</xref>). Teriparatide increases bone mineral density, however, the efficacy is limited when used after bisphosphonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Finkelstein, et al. 2010</xref>) and is associated with hypercalcaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Wen, et al. 2024</xref>). These adverse effects of current therapies indicate that additional osteoporosis therapies, which could be used alone or as part of a sequential therapy approach, would be welcomed.</p><p id="P3">G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane proteins that respond to a range of extracellular stimuli including neurotransmitters and hormones. Their cell surface expression and extracellular activation makes GPCRs inherently druggable, and GPCRs currently account for one-third of all FDA approved drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hauser, et al. 2017</xref>), including teriparatide and abaloparatide that target the parathyroid hormone receptor. Our previous studies of gene expression in primary human osteoclasts at four developmental stages using RNA-sequencing revealed that 144 GPCRs are expressed in osteoclasts, including many with unknown functions in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hansen, et al. 2024</xref>). Examination of the effects of three GPCRs in this study identified previously unrecognised regulators of osteoclast differentiation and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hansen et al. 2024</xref>). This suggests that GPCRs that are highly expressed in bone cells could be effective targets for osteoporosis therapies and that there is a need to clarify the role of these GPCRs in bone cells.</p><p id="P4">Ideally, the assessment of multiple GPCR agonists and antagonists on osteoclast activity would be measured simultaneously and analyses would be automated. There are several methods that are commonly used to assess osteoclast activity although they differ in the extent to which they could be automated. Measurements of resorption on bone slices following incubation with osteoclasts is a routine method to assess resorption. Osteoclasts produce round pits or long trenches that can be visualised by adding toluidine blue stain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Merrild, et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Rumpler, et al. 2013</xref>). However, bone resorption measurements are time consuming, bone slices have artefacts that are unrelated to osteoclast activity that make it difficult for untrained observers to count resorption areas accurately, as well as providing difficulties when developing automated analyses. Moreover, scanning data may be required to accurately assess the depth of resorption sites, which renders the technique unsuitable for high-throughput analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Rumpler et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Sieberath, et al. 2020</xref>). Other methods to assess osteoclast differentiation and activity include quantifying tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) expression. TRAP is expressed by osteoclasts and has traditionally been detected using histochemistry and light microscopy. Although commonly used, quantification of TRAP-positive cells is time consuming and subject to operator bias as it can be difficult to clearly observe nuclei, which is required to designate cells as mature multinucleated osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Cohen-Karlik, et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Filgueira 2004</xref>). While the use of TRAP fluorescent dyes or combined treatments with nuclei stains has improved this, image quality can still be variable, and some researchers now prefer to quantify TRAP activity in cell culture media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Dai, et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hansen, et al. 2023</xref>). This latter method has the advantage that it can readily be adapted to high throughput assays and generates quantitative data, but it may need to be combined with other methods to demonstrate osteoclast activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Sieberath et al. 2020</xref>). High-content imaging (HCI), which can measure the signalling effects of several treatments on the same cells on a single plate could be an alternative high-throughput method to assess osteoclast activity.</p><p id="P5">HCI allows microscopy to be performed in cell culture plates (e.g. 96-well) in a reproducible and unbiased manner. This enables the simultaneous monitoring of the effects of multiple treatments (e.g. agonists and antagonists) on cells in a high-throughput, standardised manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Garner 2020</xref>). Signalling pathways that can be measured by HCI include monitoring calcium dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Ritter, et al. 2020</xref>) and assessing nuclear translocation of signal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Njikan, et al. 2018</xref>). In osteoclasts, the RANKL-mediated nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 (NFATc1 or NFAT2) transcription factor is essential for osteoclast differentiation and resorptive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ikeda, et al. 2004</xref>). We hypothesised that the quantification of NFATc1 in nuclei of osteoclasts exposed to different GPCR agonists and antagonists by HCI would enable us to screen multiple GPCRs simultaneously to assess their effects on osteoclast activity. This method would have the advantage of being able to accurately determine which cells were multinucleated by DAPI staining and assessing the activity of these osteoclasts in parallel. Here, we sought to establish an NFATc1 nuclear translocation assay in primary human osteoclasts to determine the effect of six GPCRs identified in our previous RNA-seq analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Compounds</title><p id="P6">The working concentration and source of compounds are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cell Culture</title><p id="P7">All cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Cells were fixed with 4% PFA/PBS (Thermo Scientific/ Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), permeabilised with 0.1% Triton-X100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS and blocked with 10% donkey serum in PBS. Primary incubation with a rabbit polyclonal anti-NFATc1 antibody (1:120, ab25916, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was performed for 1 hour, then with a donkey anti-rabbit secondary AlexaFluor488 for 1 hour (1:500, A21206, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA). Nuclei were stained with NucBlu™ DAPI for 15 minutes (1:100, Invitrogen; R37606). Cells were imaged on a Cell Discoverer 7 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), using a Axiocam 702 camera, Plan-Apochromat objective (at 40x magnification), and LED light illuminators to measure DAPI (excitation 353nm, emission 465nm) and AlexaFluor488 (excitation 493nm, emission 517nm). Images were captured using Zen Black software (Zeiss) programmed to take five images of each well. Two technical repeats were performed for each treatment and the location of each treatment on the plate varied between biological repeats.</p><p id="P11">Manual analysis was performed of wells exposed to glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) or the GIP-receptor (GIPR) antagonist using ImageJ (NIH) to measure total corrected cellular fluorescence (TCCF), accounting for cell area and background signal, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">McCloy, et al. 2014</xref>). In brief, ImageJ was used to draw an outline around each cell and around an area of background, mean fluorescence was measured in both regions of interest (ROIs), then the total corrected cellular fluorescence (TCCF) was calculated as: fluorescent signal in the ROI – (area of selected cell x mean fluorescence of background readings). This was then repeated to measure the area around each nucleus. Nuclear values were subtracted from cytoplasmic values to derive a TCCF for the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Nuclear/ cytoplasmic ratios were then derived and plotted in GraphPad Prism.</p><p id="P12">Automated analysis to measure signal inside nuclei was performed using Zeiss arivis Pro Software. Fluorescent channels were separated and software was used to identify the nuclei as regions of interest using the DAPI channel. The signal intensity was then measured in the NFAT-488 channel.

Bone slices were visualised on an Olympus BX53 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 10x magnification and areas of bone resorption were quantified using a 10×10 counting grid (24.5 mm, Graticules Optics Ltd., Tonbridge, UK).

Six GPCRs were selected for analyses based on: a ready availability of agonists and antagonists, an incomplete understanding or unknown function in human osteoclasts, or because the receptors are current drug development targets and compounds could be rapidly repurposed for future osteoporosis studies. GIPR was used as a positive control in each experiment as it has previously been shown to reduce NFATc1 nuclear translocation, osteoclast resorption and TRAP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hansen et al. 2023</xref>). In the RNA-seq datasets one GPCR, free-fatty acid receptor-4 (FFAR4), had an increase in gene expression during differentiation; while five receptors, FFAR2, formyl peptide receptor 1 and 2 (FPR1, FPR2), GPR35 and GPR84 had a reduction in gene expression during differentiation. We have previously shown that FFAR4 can signal in primary human osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hansen et al. 2024</xref>) and FFAR2 knockout mice (<italic>Gpr43<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) have suppressed bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Montalvany-Antonucci, et al. 2019</xref>). All three members of the FPR family are expressed in primary human osteoclasts and are known to respond to the N-Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF) peptide in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Migeotte, et al. 2006</xref>). Previous studies have indicated that formyl peptide may affect bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Park, et al. 2017</xref>), but the receptors involved in human cells remain to be clarified. GPR35 and GPR84 are defined as orphan GPCRs as their native endogenous ligands are unknown. Several orphan receptors are expressed in human osteoclasts, and GPR35 and GPR84 may negatively regulate osteoclastogenesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Park, et al. 2018</xref>). For these reasons, we chose these six receptors to screen using HCI.</p><p id="P17">To ensure that any effects observed in cell studies were due to receptor specific activity rather than a toxic effect of compounds, cell viability was first assessed in HEK293 cells. Cells were exposed to compounds for 72 hours, and cell viability measured using CellTiterGlo assays. When used alone, no agonists or antagonists significantly affected cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). Treatment of cells with 10% DMSO for 72 hours, used as a positive control, did significantly reduce cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). A subset of cells was also exposed to antagonists for both FPR1 and FPR2 as an alternative to suppress FPR3 activity as no robust antagonists exist against this receptor. However, combined treatment reduced the viability of the primary osteoclasts. Therefore, combined treatments were not pursued in subsequent studies.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Optimisation of the HCI technique</title><p id="P18">Translocation of NFATc1 to the nucleus to induce osteoclast-mediated gene transcription is essential for RANKL-mediated effects on osteoclast activity and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Takayanagi, et al. 2002</xref>), and GPCR agonists, including GIP, have been shown to affect the NFATc1 signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hansen et al. 2023</xref>). We hypothesised that measuring agonist-induced effects on NFATc1 nuclear translocation by HCI would be an efficient way to test which receptors likely affect osteoclast activity and could be adapted in future studies to screen compound libraries to identify anti-resorptive targets. To validate the HCI protocol we first assessed whether HCI could replicate our previous findings that activation of GIPR induces NFATc1 nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hansen et al. 2023</xref>). Mature osteoclasts in 96-well plates were pre-exposed to the GIPR antagonist, GIP(3-30)NH<sub>2</sub>, then GIPR was stimulated with GIP to induce NFATc1 nuclear translocation. Fixed cells were then exposed to NFATc1 antibody and fluorescently labelled with AlexaFluor488, and counter-stained with DAPI to label nuclei prior to performing HCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>). Images were first analysed manually using a previously described technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">McCloy et al. 2014</xref>) in which fluorescence is measured in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus, and a nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio is derived. Consistent with previous studies, GIP was shown to reduce NFATc1 nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-D</xref>). Pre-exposure of osteoclasts to the GIPR antagonist prevented the GIP-induced reduction in NFATc1 nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-D</xref>). Therefore, the HCI replicates the data previously acquired on coverslips by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hansen et al. 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We then sought to automate the analysis of the high-content images to remove observer bias and increase analysis efficiency. An automated analysis pipeline was designed using Zeiss arivis Pro Software in which nuclei were identified using the DAPI images, then signal intensity was measured in the corresponding areas on the NFAT-488 image. To determine whether measuring nuclei only was a valid way to measure NFATc1 nuclear translocation, we returned to our original dataset measured by manual analysis and quantified nuclei fluorescence only. This similarly demonstrated a significant reduction in fluorescence intensity compared to cells exposed to vehicle or cells pre-treated with the GIPR antagonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). We then tested our automated nuclei analysis platform to determine whether it could accurately detect differences between fluorescence intensities in our HCI dataset. The automated analysis detected a similar number of cells to the manual analysis and there was less variability in the data obtained. In the automated analyses GIP still had a significant reduction in NFATc1 nuclear fluorescence compared to osteoclasts exposed to vehicle or antagonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-D</xref>). Thus, the automated analysis can accurately detect differences between treatments, and we proceeded to assess other GPCR agonists by HCI with automated analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>High content imaging detects four GPCRs that reduce NFATc1 signalling</title><p id="P20">NFATc1 nuclear translocation, with agonists and antagonists for the six GPCRs selected from the RNA-seq dataset, was then investigated by HCI. Exposure of mature osteoclasts to agonists for FFAR2 and FFAR4 (4-CMTB and TUG-891, respectively) significantly reduced NFATc1 nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A-D</xref>). Pre-incubation with receptor-specific antagonists (GLPG0974 and AH7614, respectively) prevented this reduction. Similarly, exposure of osteoclasts to fMLF, which activates all three FPRs, significantly reduced NFATc1 nuclear translocation. Pre-incubation with the FPR1 antagonist (Boc-MLF) prevented this reduction in translocation, whereas the FPR2 antagonist (WRW4) had no effect on fMLF-induced responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E-F</xref>). Activation of GPR35 with agonist (Zaprinast) reduced NFATc1 nuclear translocation, which was prevented by combined exposure of receptor-specific agonist and antagonist (ML 145) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G-H</xref>). In contrast, no significant differences were observed in osteoclasts exposed to agonist (DL-175) and antagonist (GLPG1205) of GPR84 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I-J</xref>). Therefore, HCI identified that four GPCRs reduce NFATc1 signalling in osteoclasts.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>The four GPCRs identified by HCI reduce osteoclast activity</title><p id="P21">The HCI studies showed that activation of four receptors (FFAR2, FFAR4, FPR1, GPR35) significantly reduced NFATc1 nuclear translocation, and may affect osteoclast resorption. To investigate whether results from HCI correlate with changes in osteoclast activity, two assays that are routinely used in osteoclast research, resorption assays on bone slices and detection of TRAP activity, were performed.</p><p id="P22">To determine whether the six selected GPCRs affected osteoclast activity, mature primary human osteoclasts were incubated with either vehicle, agonist, or agonist with antagonist for 72 hours, then toluidine blue staining and quantification of osteoclast resorption sites performed. Consistent with our previous studies, bone slices incubated with the GIPR agonist, GIP, had significantly fewer osteoclast resorption sites than bone slices exposed to vehicle or the GIPR antagonist, GIP(3-39)NH<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>). Incubation of cells with the FFAR2 and FFAR4 agonists also reduced resorption, and this was reversed by exposure of cells to receptor-specific antagonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-D</xref>). Incubation of osteoclasts with fMLF significantly reduced bone resorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-D</xref>). Incubation of cells with the FPR1-specific antagonist impaired the ability of fMLF to reduce bone resorption, but there was a significant difference compared to vehicle-treated cells, indicating another FPR may be involved. The FPR2-specific antagonist had no effect, suggesting that FPR3 may have a role in suppression of osteoclast resorption. Activation of GPR35 and GPR84 also reduced human osteoclast resorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-D</xref>). However, co-treatment of cells with receptor-specific antagonists only prevented the effect of GPR35 stimulation, but had no effect on GPR84 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Finally, measurements of TRAP in media from osteoclasts incubated with GPCR agonists and antagonists for 72-hours was assessed. Exposure of cells to GIP was shown to reduce TRAP activity, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hansen et al. 2023</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). TRAP activity was also reduced by activation with all five agonists. However, pre-exposure of cells to GPCR-specific antagonists prevented the effect of FFAR2, FFAR4, FPR1 and GPR35 on TRAP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B-F</xref>). Therefore, bone resorption assays and TRAP activity assays correlate well with results from the HCI studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">Our studies have demonstrated the utility of a HCI platform to identify regulators of osteoclast activity. Assessment of agonists and antagonists to seven GPCRs identified five receptors (GIPR, FFAR2, FFAR4, FPR1, GPR35) reduce NFATc1 activity, and these same receptors were identified to reduce bone resorption using traditional measures of osteoclast activity. Additionally, measurement of TRAP activity in cell media from osteoclasts exposed to agonists for 72 hours was as proficient as toluidine blue stained bone resorption assays at identifying GPCRs that affect osteoclast activity. Therefore, a combined assessment of the effect of compounds on NFATc1 nuclear translocation by HCI and TRAP activity in cell media would allow both the acute (one hour) and long-term (72 hour) effects of compounds on GPCRs to be assessed and should provide sufficient information to decide which receptors to assess in further detail. Moreover, this assay could be used in safety tests to identify compounds that do not affect osteoclast activity, and therefore may have fewer potential off-target effects in bone. HCI has the advantage that there is no requirement for the genetic manipulation of receptors that could have off-target effects on cell health or differentiation, these assays are not subject to observer bias and they can be performed in 96-or 384-well plates allowing multiple receptors to be assessed simultaneously. The HCI of additional proteins that undergo nuclear translocation in osteoclasts (e.g. NFκB) could be performed in parallel with NFATc1 to provide details on multiple signalling pathways within the same assay.</p><p id="P25">The assays we developed are currently semi-automated as an operator is still required to determine which cells are multinucleated (and therefore mature osteoclasts) after fluorescence in all nuclei has been obtained. While this may reduce the efficiency of data analysis, this method is still more efficient than bone resorption assays that require manual counting over many hours, whereas HCI can obtain data from 96-well plates within minutes using the latest technologies. Additionally, with the rapid development of machine learning it is possible that our automated analysis could be improved to determine not just arbitrary scoring of multinucleated vs. single-nuclei cells, but could perform sophisticated analyses determining osteoclast activity in cells with different numbers of nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Cohen-Karlik et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Two receptors known to bind free-fatty acids were examined in these studies. We have previously shown that activation of FFAR4 reduces human osteoclast activity, while others have shown effects in mouse cell-lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hansen et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Kasonga, et al. 2019</xref>). Here, we provided further insights by including an FFAR4-specific antagonist that we showed prevents TUG-891 affects on osteoclast resorption. Moreover, we demonstrated that acute activation of FFAR4 reduces NFATc1-mediated nuclear translocation, consistent with previous studies that showed FFAR4 activation attenuates NFATc1 mRNA induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kim, et al. 2016</xref>). FFAR2 binds short-chain free-fatty acids and has been shown in a single study to affect bone cell activity. A global <italic>Gpr43<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse had a reduced number of osteoblasts, increased osteoclasts and changes in bone turnover markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Montalvany-Antonucci et al. 2019</xref>). Short-chain fatty acids and FFAR2-specific agonists reduced osteoclast differentiation in cells isolated from wild-type mice indicating that there may be a direct effect of activation of FFAR2 on osteoclasts, but effects on human cells were not investigated, FFAR2-specific antagonists were not examined and studies were performed in only two cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Montalvany-Antonucci et al. 2019</xref>). Our studies verified these previous findings and demonstrated that human FFAR2 may regulate osteoclast activity.</p><p id="P27">We were unable to demonstrate a role for GPR84 in human osteoclasts. GPR84 is highly expressed on immune cells and may have a role in phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Luscombe, et al. 2020</xref>). Several studies suggest GPR84 may bind medium-chain fatty acids. However, the receptor binds these ligands with low potency and is not expressed at high concentrations in many physiologically relevant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Luscombe et al. 2020</xref>), therefore GPR84 is still regarded as an orphan receptor. Very few studies have investigated GPR84 in osteoclasts. One study examined osteoclasts differentiated from bone marrow-derived macrophages and showed that GPR84 overexpression suppressed osteoclast differentiation, while knockdown enhanced differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Park et al. 2018</xref>). Findings from this study may differ from ours as we only used receptor-specific agonists and antagonists rather than modifying gene expression. We chose this approach as gene manipulation could affect receptor functions in precursor cells (e.g. macrophages) rendering it difficult to determine cell-specific responses, and we hypothesised that any compounds developed as osteoporosis therapies would likely target receptor activity (e.g. antagonists or allosteric modulators) rather than suppressing gene expression.</p><p id="P28">Activation of GPR35, an orphan GPCR, significantly reduced NFATc1 nuclear translocation, resorption and TRAP activity in these studies. Previous studies have indicated that <italic>GPR35</italic> is downregulated in individuals with osteoporosis and in mouse models of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Zhang, et al. 2021</xref>) and that activation of GPR35 improves bone density in osteoporotic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Ma, et al. 2023</xref>). This has been attributed to the effect of GPR35 on osteoblasts as <italic>Gpr35<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice have reduced bone mass due to impaired osteoblast development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Zhang et al. 2021</xref>). However, osteoclast-specific effects were not examined in these studies, and our data support a role for GPR35 stimulation in also affecting osteoclast bone resorption. One disadvantage of our studies is that we used an agonist, Zaprinast, that may have off-target effects on phosphodiesterase-5 and −6 (PDE5/ 6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Taniguchi, et al. 2006</xref>). However, PDE5 is not expressed and PDE6 is expressed at very low concentrations in mature osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hansen et al. 2024</xref>), and our use of a GPR35-specific antagonist increases confidence that our findings are mediated by GPR35 activity.</p><p id="P29">Our studies showed fMLF, an agonist for FPR1-3 significantly reduces NFATc1 nuclear translocation, bone resorption and TRAP activity. The FPR family is essential for chemoattraction and immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Migeotte et al. 2006</xref>) and are highly expressed in human monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hansen et al. 2024</xref>). Other work has shown that FPRs may have a role in bone cells. <italic>Fpr1</italic> knockout mice have reduced osteogenesis and bone fracture healing, and FPR1 activation promotes human osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Shin, et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Yang, et al. 2024</xref>). Additionally, the FAM19A5 cytokine that activates FPR1 and FPR2 inhibits osteoclast formation and RANKL-induced gene expression in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Park et al. 2017</xref>). Our studies indicated that the fMLF effects on human osteoclasts were mediated by FPR1 and could involve FPR3, while FPR2 antagonism had no effect on fMLF-mediated responses. This contrasts with previous studies in mice that indicate that the WRW4 antagonist prevents FAM19A5 effects on osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Park et al. 2017</xref>). These differences could be due to differences in FPR gene expression, as mice express eight different FPRs compared to the three in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Gao, et al. 1998</xref>). Therefore, it may be difficult to extrapolate findings on specific FPRs between species. Alternatively, there may be ligand-specific differences as FPR1 has an ∼400-fold higher affinity for fMLF than FPR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Ye, et al. 1992</xref>). The role of FPR3 has not been investigated in bone cells and our studies with dual FPR1/2 antagonists proved too toxic to pursue in osteoclast activity assays. Further studies with other compounds or receptor-specific siRNA could elucidate whether other FPRs have a role in human osteoclasts.</p><p id="P30">In conclusion, these studies have demonstrated that HCI is a viable alternative to assess the effects of compounds on osteoclast activity. These assays could be utilised for high-throughput compound screening to rapidly assess novel mediators of osteoclast activity and identify compounds that may have utility in osteoporosis treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S16"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by: the Novo Nordisk Foundation (Grant number NNF18OC0055047 to MF) and a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society (Grant Number 224155/Z/21/Z to CMG).
