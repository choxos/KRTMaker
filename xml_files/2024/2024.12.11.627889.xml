Provided that these cytokines are highly toxic, a tight control of their production is imperative. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential for the fine-tuning of cytokine production. The role of the RBP ZFP36L1 and its sister protein ZFP36L2 herein has been established, however, their relative contribution to cytokine production is not well known. We here compared the effect of ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 single and double deficiency in murine effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Whereas single deficient T cells significantly increased cytokine production, double deficiency completely unleashed the cytokine production. Not only the TNF production was substantially prolonged in double-deficient T cells. Also, the production of IFNγ reached unprecedented levels with &gt;90% IFNγ–producing T cells compared to 3% in WT T cells, even after 3 days of continuous activation. This continuous cytokine production by double-deficient T cells was also observed in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in vivo, however, with no effect on tumor growth. Rather, ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 double deficiency resulted in decreased cell viability, impaired STAT5 signaling, and dysregulated cell cycle progression. In conclusion, while combined deletion in ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 can drive continuous cytokine production even under chronic activation, safeguards are in place to counteract such super-cytokine producers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells protect us from microbial infections and can fight cancer cells. Fundamental to mounting effective T cell responses is their production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). In addition, memory T cells contain ready-to deploy mRNAs, which enables them to rapidly produce cytokines upon reactivation, and thus protect us from recurring infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). However, aberrant production of these toxic cytokines can have detrimental effects, as is for instance observed upon CAR T cell therapy and in patients that severely suffer from COVID-19 infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Several regulatory mechanisms are therefore in place to tightly regulate cytokine production, such as transcriptional, epigenetic, and post-transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P3">RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are key mediators of post-transcriptional regulation. Amongst other processes, they define RNA splicing, nuclear export, translation, and stability of the target mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), with important functional consequences. For instance, the ZFP36 family proteins ZFP36, ZFP36L1, and ZFP36L2 have been shown to modulate T cell development, differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). They do so by interacting with AU-rich elements (AREs) present in the 3’UTR of their target mRNAs, including cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Interestingly, even though all ZFP36 proteins bind to the same sequence, they act in a context-dependent manner. For instance, whereas ZFP36L2 blocks translation of preformed <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Ifng</italic> mRNA in resting memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), it destabilizes <italic>Ifng</italic> mRNA <italic>in</italic> continuously activated effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Likewise, ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 can control translation of <italic>Tnf</italic> and <italic>Il2</italic> mRNA in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), yet in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, the <italic>IL2</italic> mRNA becomes destabilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Intriguingly, ZFP36L1-deficient tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) produced more IFNγ, which resulted in a modest yet significant delay of tumor outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). ZFP36L2-deficient TILs also showed increased IFNγ production, however, they could not restrict tumor outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Whether ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 are redundant or collaborate in regulating IFNγ, and whether dual deficiency generates superior T cell responses against tumors is, however, not known.</p><p id="P4">To decipher how ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 regulate cytokine production in effector T cells, we determined their expression and regulation kinetics. We found that the protein expression dynamics mirrored that of their activity. Specifically, ZFP36L1 dampens cytokine expression during early T cell activation and at its peak of production, i.e. at 6h, whereas ZFP36L2 is active at later time points. Intriguingly, ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 double deficiency further increased cytokine expression at earlier time points. When exposed to continuous antigen, the double deficiency of ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 completely unleashed the production of IFNγ. High IFNγ production was also found <italic>in vivo</italic> in TILs, however, ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 double deficient CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells could not control tumor growth. Rather, they showed limited cell fitness due to decreased viability and a perturbed cell cycle progression. We therefore conclude that RBPs regulate multiple modules in concert to define the fate of T cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Differential expression kinetics of ZFP36 family members upon T cell activation</title><p id="P5">To determine the expression of ZFP36 family members during T cell activation, we first mined the proteomics data of ImmPRes from naive OT-I T cells that were activated for up to 24h with the OVA<sub>257-264</sub> peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Whereas ZFP36 expression was below the detection limit, the expression of ZFP36L1 rapidly increased upon T cell activation, peaking at 3-4h of T cell activation and declining slowly thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). ZFP36L2 expression remained low during the first 12h of activation and increased from 18h of activation onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The expression kinetics of ZFP36 proteins of <italic>in vitro</italic> generated effector T cells were similar. ZFP36L2 expression slowly declined at 6h of activation with OVA peptide, but it restored and increased at 24-48h of activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig 1A</xref>). Conversely, ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 expression increased at 6h, and decreased at 24h and 48h of T cell activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig 1A</xref>). Of note, we detected no effects on ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 protein expression in ZFP36L2<sup>CKO</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig 1A</xref>), suggesting that compensatory effects on ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 in ZFP36L2<sup>CKO</sup> T cells are limited.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ZFP36L1 controls cytokine production at early time points</title><p id="P6">Provided their differential expression kinetics, we questioned what the relative contribution of ZFP36 proteins is on cytokine expression. To study this, we compared WT, ZFP36L1- and ZFP36L2-single deficient T cells with ZFP36L1/ZFP36L2-double deficient T cells. CD4-Cre induced ZFP36L1/ZFP36L2 double deficiency results in impaired T cell priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), which impedes the use of this model for studies in effector T cells. To overcome this, we gene-edited WT and ZFP26L2<sup>CKO</sup> OT-I T cells with ZFP36L1-targeting CRISPR Cas9 gRNAs, or with non-targeting controls to obtain WT T cells, ZFP36L1 (L1-KO) and ZFP36L2 (L2-KO) single and double deficient (L1/L2-DKO) T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, C</xref>).</p><p id="P7">We next measured the cytokine production of T cells with the differential RBP deletion upon exposure to B16-OVA target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). In concordance with their respective expression kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), the production of TNF, IFNγ and IL-2 was significantly increased at 6h of activation in L1-KO cells compared to WT T cells, but not in L2-KO T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Interestingly, double deficient L1/L2-DKO T cells displayed higher percentages of cytokine-producing T cells than L1-KO cells and cytokine production per cell, as defined by the Geometric Mean Fluorescence intensity (GeoMFI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Thus, ZFP36L1 primarily regulates the cytokine production of T cells at early time points. ZFP36L2 also contributes, but only in the absence of ZFP36L1.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Double deficiency of ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 unleashes cytokine production</title><p id="P8">We previously showed that ZFP36L2 dampens the production of IFNγ when T cells are continuously exposed to antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). To test how L1-KO and L1/L2 DKO T cells responded to continuous antigen exposure, we re-exposed effector T cells each day to freshly seeded B16-OVA cells for a total period of 96h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). To measure cytokine production, we added Brefeldin A for the last two hours of activation. As we previously showed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), the production of TNF and IL-2 was lost in WT T cells after 24h of T cell activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Whereas ZFP36L1/L2 single and double deficiency did not alter the kinetics of IL-2 production at 24h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2A</xref>), this was not the case for TNF. TNF production was still detectable in L2-KO T cells, and even more so in L1/L2-DKO T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2B</xref>). Even at 48h and 72h of continuous activation, TNF production was with ±23% at 48h, and with ±10% at 72h still measurable in L1/L2 DKO T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2B</xref>). Only at 96h, the TNF production was lost in all genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We then turned our attention to IFNγ. As expected, substantial IFNγ production was measured in WT T cells at 24h and 48h of activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2C</xref>). In concordance with its expression kinetics, L2-KO T cells produced more IFNγ at 24h and 48h of continuous T cell activation than WT or L1-KO T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2C</xref>). Strikingly, whereas WT and L1-KO T cells ceased to produce IFNγ at 72h, almost all L1/L2-DKO T cells maintained their production of IFNγ, both in terms of percentage and production per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B, C</xref>). Even at 96h of continuous T cell activation, the production of IFNγ was with 32.4 ± 3.5% still significant in L1/L2-DKO T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2C</xref>). L1/L2-DKO T cells contained 10-fold higher <italic>Ifng</italic> mRNA levels, which was at least in part due to an almost complete loss of mRNA decay, as determined by blocking <italic>de novo</italic> transcription with Actinomycin D (ActD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D, E</xref>). In conclusion, ZFP36L2 dominates the regulation of cytokine production at later time points. Yet, double depletion of ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 unleashes the IFNγ production during continuous T cell activation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Loss of tumor-infiltrating ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 DKO T cells <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p id="P10">IFNγ is critical for effective T cell responses against tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Based on their superior IFNγ production upon continuous T cell activation <italic>in vitro</italic>, we hypothesized that this feature could render L1/L2 DKO T cells better tumor suppressors than WT T cells. To test this, we adoptively transferred OT-I T cells with the four different genetic backgrounds into B16-OVA tumor-bearing mice. 9 days later, we measured tumor size and the production of IFNγ in tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) upon 4h of incubation with Brefeldin A and Monensin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed no significant changes in tumor size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). Even though the production of IFNγ appeared higher in L1/L2 DKO TILs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2H</xref>), the yield of transferred L1/L2 DKO TILs was substantially lower than that of any other genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). Thus, even though ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L1 double deficiency relieves the block on IFNγ production within tumors, this occurs at the cost of cell loss.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Protein expression of different gene sets is altered in L1/L2-DKO T cells</title><p id="P11">We next aimed to uncover why L1/L2-DKO T cells lost their cell fitness <italic>in vivo</italic>. Albeit less prominent, lower cell viability in L1/L2-DKO T cells was also observed in <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures, both in resting and reactivated T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). We therefore turned to the <italic>in vitro</italic> model to compare the protein expression of resting and activated T cells of all four genetic backgrounds by Mass Spectrometry. Of the 8040 identified proteins, 678 proteins in resting and 160 proteins activated T cells were found to be statistically significant differentially abundant (adjusted P-value &lt; 0.05 and log2 fold change &lt; or &gt; 0.5, indicated throughout with an asterisk, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Table 1</xref>) between WT and L1/L2-DKO T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>). As expected, the ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 protein levels were substantially lower in the respective knockout T cells, and effects on ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 in L2-KO and L1/L2-DKO cells were limited (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To determine which proteins were direct targets of ZFP36L1, we re-analyzed ZFP36L1 individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data from activated WT and L1-KO T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Of the 1965 regions we identified in 521 transcripts, 439 interactions were located in intronic regions, known to contain AREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3B-C</xref>). 60 interactions were located in the 3’UTR of target genes, including <italic>Tnf, Ifng</italic>, and <italic>Il2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3C-D</xref>). Indeed, the ZFP36L1 iCLIP targets genes <italic>Lta, Pim1, Ifng</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> also showed higher protein intensity values in the MS analysis of resting L1/L2-DKO T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3E, F</xref>). After 24h of activation, ZFP36L1 iCLIP target genes <italic>Tnf, Cdkn1a</italic>, showed significantly higher protein levels, and <italic>Ccl3, Ccl4</italic> and <italic>Il3</italic> a trend of higher protein intensity levels in L1/L2-DKO T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3E, F</xref>). Intriguingly, CCL3 protein expression was below detection limit in resting WT and most single KO T cells, yet measurable in L1/L2-DKO T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig 3F</xref>), indicating that double deficiency can unleash protein expression of certain target genes.</p><p id="P13">Clustering analysis of proteins with different intensity values between WT and L1/L2-DKO T cells revealed 6 gene clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using Hallmark gene sets of these clusters uncovered that in L1/L2-DKO T cells, proteins associated with cytokine signaling (TNF signaling via NFKB, IFNγ response, IL-2-STAT5 signaling), metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis and fatty acid metabolism), cell cycle progression (G2M checkpoint, E2F targets), unfolded protein response (UPR), and apoptosis are enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). While we only found three proteins associated with the UPR to be differentially abundant in resting L1/L2 DKO T cells, the key ER-stress sensor PERK (Eif2ak3) was significantly increased in resting and activated L1/L2-DKO T cells, indicating a potentially increased UPR response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3G, H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Cell cycle progression is altered in the absence of ZFP361 and ZFP36L2</title><p id="P14">Proteins involved in the cell cycle progression (E2F targets and G2M checkpoint) included the key cell cycle regulatory genes Cks2, Cdc6, Ccne1 and Cdkn1a, and were almost exclusively upregulated in resting L1/L2-DKO T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig, 3I, J</xref>). When measuring the cell cycle in resting WT, L1-KO and L2-KO T cells, we found similar frequencies of T cells in the G0, G1, and S-M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). However, L1/L2-DKO T cells had slightly decreased percentages of cells in the G1 phase, and notably, 2-fold more cells in the G0 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>). The expression level of Ki-67 in the G0 phase of L1/L2-DKO T cells was also substantially lower, which, according to the relationship between Ki-67 expression and duration of cells spent in quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), indicates that L1/L2-DKO T cells remained for a longer time in quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3F</xref>). Furthermore, L1/L2-DKO T cells were dying more when in the G0 and S-M phase than T cells from the other genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4A</xref>). The block in G0 was still observed when L1/L2-DKO T cells were activated with OVA peptide for 4h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4B</xref>). After 24h of activation, however, T cells started to divide, and the frequency of G0 cells was similar between WT and L1/L2-DKO T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp Fig. 4C</xref>). Indeed, L1/L2-DKO proliferation was similar or even slightly increased compared to the other genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4D</xref>). Thus, ZFP36L1/ZFP36L2 double deficiency attenuates the cell cycle progression, which is however relieved upon T cell activation. Together, these data show that the induction of cell cycle quiescence in resting cells is partially regulated by the RBPs ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>IL-7R signaling is perturbed in the absence of ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2</title><p id="P15">We also found and enrichment of proteins involved in the IFNγ response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4E</xref>), which were in line with the increased expression of IFNγ and IFNGR1 in L1/L2-DKO T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3F, 4F</xref>). IFNγ can both block cell cycle progression and was suggested to promote apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). However, adding a blocking antibody against IFNγ in T cell cultures did not rescue L1/L2-DKO T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), indicating that the IFNγR signaling pathway is not responsible for the reduced cell fitness of L1/L2-DKO T cells.</p><p id="P16">Signals received through the common gamma chain cytokine receptors IL-2R, IL-4R, IL-7R and IL-15R are crucial for T cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>).

Because genes involved in IL-2 STAT5 signaling were enriched in L1/L2-DKO T cells compared to WT and single KO T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4G</xref>), we questioned whether STAT5 signaling was altered in L1/L2-DKO T cells. In resting mature L1/L2-DKO T cells, the two IL-7R receptor subunits CD127 and IL-2RG were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B, C</xref>). When T cells were deprived of rIL-7 for 4 hours and then re-exposed to the cytokine for 20 min, the frequency and levels of pSTAT5 were increased across all genotypes, however to different degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). In L1-KO cells, only the geoMFI was slightly lower than that of WT T cells, but not the frequency of pSTAT5 positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). L2-KO T cells had a lower frequency and levels of pSTAT5 than WT T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). However, in L1/L2-DKO T cells, IL-7 signaling was most severely affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). In line with this finding, the phosphatase Dusp4 which dephosphorylates Stat5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) was slightly upregulated in L1/L2-DKO T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4H</xref>). Of note, total Stat5a and Stat5b protein expression remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4I</xref>). In conclusion, these data show that IL-7 signaling in effector T cells is regulated by ZFP36L2 and ZFP36L1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">In this study, we show that L1/L2 double deficiency almost completely overcomes the attenuated cytokine production upon continuous T cell stimulation. While extended production of TNF and IFNγ could be observed in L1/L2-DKO T cells, IL-2 production was undetectable after 24h of activation. Indeed, IL-2 depends more on transcriptional regulation than TNF, IFNγ, CCL3, and CCL4, which rely more on post-transcriptional regulation (PTR) for their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>) Interestingly, even though ZFP36L2 deficiency on its own had no effects for early cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 double deficiency showed highest cytokine expression already at this time point. This finding suggests that ZFP36L2 is outcompeted by ZFP36L1 at early time points, either due to its lower expression levels early during T cell activation, or due to lower affinity to its target mRNAs.</p><p id="P18">Irrespective of the high cytokine production, adoptive transfer of L1/L2-DKO T cells could not block tumor outgrowth. <italic>In vitro</italic>, cell viability could be improved by TCR triggering, but in vivo, this did not rescue the reduced cell numbers of L1/L2-DKO T cells within tumours. We hypothesize that the decreased cell viability is a partial consequence of a perturbed cell-cycle progression. In thymocytes, L1/L2-DKO T cells increase the cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). However, the opposite is true for mature L1/L2-DKO T cells where cell cycle progression is perturbed. Interestingly, L1 or L2 single-deficient T cells did not display a perturbed cell cycle, highlighting the co-regulation of target genes by ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2. Indeed, Cdkn1a (p21) was already upregulated in the individual absence of ZFP36L1 or ZFP36L2 and Ccne2 (cyclin E2) was only upregulated L1/L2-DKO T cells. How ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 co-regulate cell cycle progression in T cells, however, remains to be uncovered.</p><p id="P19">Mature T cells receive important survival signals through cytokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). In line with their reduced cell viability, L1/L2-DKO T cells displayed reduced IL-7R mediated STAT5 signaling. The expression levels of the IL-7R subunits IL7RA and IL2RG were increased in mature L1/L2-DKO T cells. Because IL-7 mediated signaling requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis of IL-7R upon IL-7 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), it is conceivable that internalization of the IL-7R is impaired in L1/L2-DKO T cells. However, while we cannot exclude this possibility, the proteomics analysis did not uncover changes in key components of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, i.e. AP-2 and clathrin in L1/L2-DKO T cells (data not shown). Conversely, the phosphatase DUSP4 known to dephosphorylate STAT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>) was induced in L1/L2-DKO T cells, suggesting that the reduced STAT5 phosphorylation is at least in part regulated through this feedback mechanism.</p><p id="P20">Interestingly, L1/L2-DKO T cells showed increased expression of proteins involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), including the key reporter of ER-stress EIF2AK3 (PERK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). PERK inhibits translation by phosphorylating EIF2A and induces the expression of CHOP through ATF4, which impairs T cell function and induces apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Of note, PERK does not contain AREs in its mRNA. Its induction may therefore be a consequence of increased mRNA stability and thus increased translational demand of L1/L2 target genes during continuous T cell activation, which could potentially lead to the induction of apoptosis via CHOP. If true, this feedback would impede the generation of super-cytokine producers by compromising T cell integrity. This mechanism may thus serve as safeguard to prevent unwanted activity of T cells, and thus to prevent immunopathology, as seen with chronic IFNγ production in hepatitis A infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In summary, we highlight the important role of ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 in coregulating cytokine production during T cell activation, with the most striking effects during continuous activation. In addition, we unveiled the involvement of ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 in regulating fundamental cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and cytokine receptor signaling.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-only"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Mice and cell culture</title><p id="P22">OTI;Zfp36l2;CD4cre and C57BL/6j/Ly5.1<sup>+</sup>Ly5.2<sup>+</sup> mice were bred and housed in the animal facility of the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI).
