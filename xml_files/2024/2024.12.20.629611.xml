Here, we describe PrimalScheme, an open-source toolkit and website that allows users to easily design primer schemes for amplicon sequencing of viruses, and has generated over 67,000 primer schemes for the global community since 2017. In January 2020, PrimalScheme was used to rapidly generate a primer scheme for SARS-CoV-2, with primer pools distributed to researchers from 44 countries to help scale-up genomic surveillance efforts. Overall, these primers were used to generate an estimated 18M genome sequences and the protocols were viewed online ~250K times. To complement PrimalScheme, we have built PrimalScheme Labs, a scheme repository which allows users to find and share primer schemes as well as establishing a set of data standards. Through improvements to the primer design process, including the use of discrete primer clouds, we have expanded the use of amplicon sequencing to include diverse virus species. We demonstrate the utility of this approach through a high diversity pan-genotype Measles virus (MeV) scheme. We also demonstrate its use on a high sensitivity, short amplicon Monkeypox virus (MPXV) scheme with over 1000 primers, showing high genome recovery on low-titre clinical samples. These developments have implications for sequencing from samples such as wastewater, for genomic surveillance of endemic pathogens and in preparing for future pandemics.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The rapid and accurate identification of viral pathogens is crucial for effective outbreak management and public health response. Amplicon sequencing generates whole-genome coverage using a tiling approach; it is highly sensitive, low-cost, and compatible with a wide range of clinical sample types. Real-time genomic surveillance using the MinION platform from Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing was first used during the 2015 West African Ebola epidemic, allowing unprecedented responsiveness and resolution into the dynamics of viral outbreaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. We developed PrimalScheme in 2017, where it played a crucial role in generating genome sequences from low-titre Zika virus clinical samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. PrimalScheme is a web-based primer design tool which enables users to design multiplex primer schemes to amplify viral genomes in overlapping amplicons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. At the same time, we published protocols for sequencing amplicon products both for ONT and Illumina. This approach, now commonly referred to as the ‘ARTIC protocol’, is an important method which has been used in response to major outbreaks including Mpox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, Ebola<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, and Covid-196.</p><p id="P3">In January 2020 the first SARS-CoV-2 (then ncov-2019) genome sequence was released<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and within two weeks we released a primer scheme and sequencing protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. We communicated the initial release and subsequent updates via websites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://artic.network/ncov-2019">https://artic.network/ncov-2019</ext-link>) and social media. We also distributed pre-made primer pools at no cost to early adopters who requested them. As demand increased, we collaborated with industry partners (IDT, Sigma-Aldrich) with the capability to mass produce and distribute primer pools to customers. The low cost and availability of ARTIC primers (6p per reaction between April 2020 and March 2021<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>) exhibited a downward pressure on the cost of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing for the duration of the pandemic. Our protocol development focussed on optimising the native barcoding workflow (ONT) while a mixture of academic and commercial groups produced protocols which use PrimalScheme or ARTIC primer designs including; Midnight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, COVIDSeq (Illumina), NEBNext ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 (NEB), and QIASeq SARS-CoV-2 (Qiagen). COVIDSeq was the first sequencing-based diagnostic test to be granted emergency use authorisation by the FDA in June 202013.</p><p id="P4">A recurring problem we faced during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was new mutations in primer sites, resulting in reduced amplification efficiency or failure. RNA viruses typically evolve at a rate of ~2 mutations per month, but in some cases, it is much higher, for example, the Omicon variant contained around 80 new mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Primer binding sites cover around 20% of the genome in the ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 schemes, which can be reduced by using longer amplicons e.g. 5% for 1 kb amplicons or 2% for 2 kb amplicons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Longer schemes are less susceptible to disruption by new mutations, however, as they rely on longer template molecules, they have lower sensitivity. We produced updates to the primer scheme in response to new mutations, which led to different versions being in use at the same time. Over time we developed a semantic versioning system that recognises that some changes have less impact than others, as well using the patch number to indicate balancing. We also produced a set of standards for amplicon sequencing to improve reproducibility. To encourage the uptake of community developed primer schemes, we created a searchable repository called PrimalScheme Labs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labs.primalscheme.com/">labs.primalscheme.com</ext-link>). This allows users to upload the schemes they have developed, making it easier for others to discover them while ensuring interoperability.</p><p id="P5">The ARTIC protocol has proved to be a robust approach for sequencing during outbreaks but improvements to the design process could allow it to be used more widely. Using a tiling scheme design relies on the representation of all amplicons to generate an intact consensus sequence. It has been observed that primer interactions reduce the amplification efficiency of certain amplicons resulting in dropouts. The cause was shown to be 3’ complementarity between primers leading to dimer formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Interactions are an important factor limiting the complexity of multiplex PCR reactions as the number of possible interactions increases exponentially as primers are added<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Primer schemes for the large 200 kb DNA genome of MPXV have used long amplicons e.g. 2 kb to reduce the number of amplicons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This limits the use of long amplicons for low titre or degraded samples such as wastewater. A significant challenge has been developing primer schemes tolerant of sequence diversity which are desirable for surveillance and pandemic preparedness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Previous attempts to develop a pan-genotypic scheme for MeV with 12% diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> by selecting primer pairs in conserved regions of the genome were unsuccessful. When sequence diversity exceeded ~5% there were too few conserved positions to generate a continuous tiling path across the genome while the use of degenerate primers results in primers with a melting temperature (Tm) outside the target range (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). The latest version of PrimalScheme has significant improvements which will enable the surveillance of endemic viruses and larger, higher complexity schemes greatly increasing the power of the method.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Determining usage</title><p id="P6">Log files from the PrimalScheme website up to 28 November 2024 were parsed to determine the number of jobs processed.

Assuming a similar usage pattern for the sequences submitted to GISAID, we estimate over 18M genomes have been generated using these schemes.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Data standards for ARTIC sequencing protocols</title><p id="P21">Performing downstream analysis appropriately is vitally important to consensus genome accuracy. To improve reproducibility we developed a schema including semantic versioning and specifications of essential file formats. Each scheme has a unique ID created by combining the key information about the scheme <monospace>{scheme name}/{amplicon size}/{scheme version}</monospace>. The <monospace>{scheme name}</monospace> is a text field describing the scheme, which often includes the project or target organism e.g. <monospace>artic-sars-cov-2</monospace>. The <monospace>{amplicon size}</monospace> is the amplicon length for the scheme. The <monospace>{scheme version}</monospace> is the iteration of the scheme in the form <monospace>v{x}.{y}.{z}-{clade},</monospace> with <monospace>{x}</monospace> denoting a major redesign or new scheme, <monospace>{y}</monospace> denoting a change to the primers and <monospace>{z}</monospace> denoting a change to the primer balancing. While a single primer scheme can amplify genomes from different clades or genotypes, we have found it is still preferable to use a closely related reference genome for consensus generation. To allow this, the optional <monospace>{clade}</monospace> denotes if the scheme has been remapped to a different primary reference. Each scheme requires two essential files; the <monospace>reference.fasta</monospace> containing the sequence of the primary reference, and the <monospace>primer.bed</monospace> containing the sequence and location of the primers. We have created a specification for both input files which are compatible with the fieldbioinformatics pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics">https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Pan-genotypic amplicon sequencing of MeV</title><p id="P22">The pan-genotypic MeV scheme (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labs.primalscheme.com/detail/artic-measles/400/v1.0.0/">https://labs.primalscheme.com/detail/artic-measles/400/v1.0.0/</ext-link>) consisted of 46 amplicons and an average of 4 primers per cloud. The majority of primers had an exact match to an input genome with an average of 0.05 mismatches per primer. The scheme covers the entire coding region of the genome missing only the first 26 and last 37 bp relative to the primary reference NC_001498.1. Sequencing of 8 MeV strains from a viral culture collection showed all amplicons had at least 20x depth of coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Of the strains sequenced, 5 were genotype A while the others were B3, D4 and D5 according to the strain information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Three of the strains; Schwartz (0809212v), Schwartz (0007233v) and Moraten, were found to have identical or near-identical reference genomes which had been included in the input dataset for the scheme design (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). These are vaccine strains derived from the Edmonston strain isolated in 1954. There were no reference sequences for the B3, D4 or D5 strains identified but in each case, there were examples of the genotype in the input dataset. For the M/F intergenic region, there was amplicon coverage but a subset of the amplicons contained variable length deletions resulting in low coverage for some positions. We confirmed these deletions using metagenomic sequencing (data not shown) and believe it to be a genuine variation linked to the passage of the virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> and not related to the sequencing approach.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>High sensitivity amplicon sequencing of MPXV</title><p id="P23">The high sensitivity MPXV scheme consisted of 553 ~400 bp amplicons covering 97.1% of the 3’ UTR masked reference genome. The scheme had an average of 1.07 primers per cloud, which was consistent with the maximum pairwise distance of 0.4% between sequences, calculated using MEGA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. When comparing primers to the reference genomes for each clade the average mismatches per primer was 0.003. The scheme was tested on two clinical samples of Ct 26.1 and Ct 31.0, representing medium and low viral loads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). There was at least 10x depth of coverage for 98.0% of the genome for the medium viral load sample and 92.5% of the genome for the low viral load sample. Of the 553 amplicons, only four were below the coverage threshold of 10x in the medium viral load sample; 55, 362, 453 and 454. Three of these can be explained due to differences between the Clade I and II reference genomes. One of the primers for amplicon 55 is not present in the Clade IIb reference genome due to a relative deletion. An insertion in Clade IIb relative to Clade Ia within the amplicon 453 and 454 overlap region results in two amplicons ~2,800 bp in length which prevents them from amplifying efficiently.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="S16"><title>Open-source resources for viral genome sequencing</title><p id="P24">Open-source resources democratise access to genomic surveillance, particularly benefiting low and middle-income countries (LMICs) that disproportionately bear the human cost of infectious diseases. They provide opportunities for local scientists to develop expertise, build local capacity, and reduce dependency on proprietary reagents and technologies. ARTIC open-source primer schemes, protocols and tools are important community resources for pathogen surveillance as demonstrated by the usage metrics. Analysis of data deposited in public databases, showed that an estimated 18M SARS-CoV-2 genomes used these primer schemes. Surveillance networks are more effective when data is generated over the widest possible area, with low-cost, accessible sequencing approaches enabling the largest network of laboratories to contribute. The collaborative nature of open-source resources allows for quick dissemination of new methods during outbreaks. Leveraging online platforms like GitHub.com and protocols.io, we were able to publish the SARS-CoV-2 sequencing protocols less than a week after the first genome sequence was available. The rapid sharing of the first genome sequence was a critically important step in the development of diagnostic and sequencing assays. Open-source protocols allow improvements to be suggested by the community. For example, analysis of dimers generated by ARTIC V3 primers by researchers in Japan led to improvements in PrimalScheme software and the quality of future scheme designs. Other groups took the materials provided under the permissive CC-BY-4.0 license and customised them for their own needs. This led to the development of important products such as NEBNext ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 (NEB) and CovidSeq (Illumina). Transparent processes are essential to establish trust in the quality of surveillance data. Every stage of the sequencing pipeline from primer design software to sequencing analysis pipelines is available online. This provides users with the ability to replicate work and find problems, examples of this include the discovery of artefacts in consensus genome sequences caused by data quality issues or improper analysis approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. We have established a set of data standards for amplicon sequencing to try to promote reproducibility and interoperability with analysis pipelines going forward.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Primer schemes for diverse virus species</title><p id="P25">Our approach to primer design addresses an important question in amplicon sequencing; how do you capture more diversity without sacrificing specificity? A primer scheme using discrete primer clouds was able to completely sequence different genotypes of MeV without modifying the PCR conditions to reduce the stringency. Single primer pairs targeting conserved regions of the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> works well for small numbers of closely related input genomes, but is not scalable. We were able to use ~900 publicly available MeV genomes in this scheme design, incorporating phylogenetic downsampling to capture as many different clades as possible. The minimum base frequency argument in primalscheme3 provides additional control over the size of the primer clouds by removing the least common primers. The MeV scheme used 4 primers per cloud but we have successfully tested schemes with up to 40 primers per cloud (data not shown). Further work is needed to predict the effect of mismatches within primers, which will allow us to optimise the size of the primer clouds. A scheme we designed for another study was able to generate full genomes from 12 different genotypes of Hepatitis B virus (HBV), with an average cloud size of 8.7 primers. HBV is known to be challenging to sequence given the high diversity and low viral loads encountered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, demonstrating the potential of this approach.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Increasing the complexity of multiplex PCR reactions</title><p id="P26">We also demonstrated a high sensitivity MPXV scheme using 400 bp amplicons as an alternative to previous schemes which have ~2kb. This increase in sensitivity offers opportunities to perform wastewater and environmental surveillance where titres are expected to be low. Primer interactions have limited the scale of multiplex PCR reactions and a variety of different approaches to avoid them have been used including; digestible primers (AmpliSeq), microfluidic devices (Fluidigm) or droplets (Raindance). Our thermodynamic approach can predict interactions with high sensitivity and specificity which allows more complex reactions to be designed. Simulations have shown that schemes containing thousands of primers are feasible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>), paving the way for bacterial whole-genome schemes and multi-pathogen panels in future.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Effect on cost and time</title><p id="P27">One key advantage of amplicon sequencing as a surveillance approach is the low cost of around £10 per sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The use of primer clouds or larger schemes increases the cost however the effect is modest as oligos account for a small amount of the overall sequencing cost. Resuspending and pooling more oligos manually, takes longer but this is a one-time upfront task. We have found it easier to order these schemes in 96-well plates and resuspend them using an OpenTrons liquid handling robot. This way it is possible to resuspend and pool oligos in a few hours of mostly hands-off time.</p><p id="P28">Having multiple forward and reverse primers complicates the rebalancing of amplicons based on coverage. We have observed that using equimolar pooling gives behaviour similar to that of a conventional scheme but further work is needed to determine the best rebalancing strategy.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Future perspectives</title><p id="P29">The high sensitivity MPXV scheme highlighted some difficulties in working with pan-clade schemes. When using a single primer scheme to amplify genomes of different clades, we found a closely related reference is still preferable for reference based consensus generation. MPXV has large clade specific insertions and deletions which makes it impossible to remap all primers from one reference to another exactly. Remapping the Clade Ia reference to Clade IIb resulted in the loss of one of the primer sites whilst another two moved, resulting in the amplification failing. Further work is needed to investigate designing primers using a genome graph which would enable multiple paths to be created. It may also be possible to create an end-to-end process where consensus genomes are also generated using this approach.</p><p id="P30">This analysis shows how valuable ARTIC open-source resources are for viral genome sequencing especially in LMICs where they have proven cost-effective. These advances in primer design for viral genome sequencing will allow the surveillance of endemic diseases, as well as improving our ability to react to outbreaks and threats.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS202336-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d77aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr. Barry Atkinson and the National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses (NCPV) for providing the MeV RNA.
