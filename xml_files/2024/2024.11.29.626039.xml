We present a comprehensive single-cell spatial atlas of 280 metastatic HGSCs, integrating high-dimensional imaging, genomics, and transcriptomics. Using 929 single-cell maps, we identify distinct spatial domains associated with phenotypically heterogeneous cellular compositions, and demonstrate that immune cell co-infiltration at the tumor-stroma interface significantly influences clinical outcomes. To uncover the key drivers of the tumor ecosystem, we developed CEFIIRA (Cell Feature Importance Identification by RAndom forest), which identified tumor cell-intrinsic MHC-II expression as a critical predictor of prolonged survival, independent of clinicomolecular profiles. Validation with external datasets confirmed that MHC-II-expressing cancer cells drive immune infiltration and orchestrate spatial tumor-immune interactions. Our atlas offers novel insights into immune surveillance mechanisms across HGSC clinicomolecular groups, paving the way for improved therapeutic strategies and patient stratification.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem comprising cancer cells, immune cells, stromal cells, and non-cellular components and their interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The continuous crosstalk between tumor cells and the surrounding microenvironment is fundamental to tumor initiation, phenotypic changes, cancer progression, and therapeutic resistance. Ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most prevalent and aggressive subtype of ovarian cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, characterized by high genomic instability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and significant tumor heterogeneity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. This heterogeneity is evident in various aspects, such as histopathological architecture, genetic alterations, and TME cellular composition, leading to varying responses to chemotherapy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The genetic diversity of HGSC tumor cells significantly influences TME. For instance, tumors with a homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair deficiency, such as those with <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> mutations, have been suggested to be more immunogenic and exhibit higher lymphocyte infiltration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Emerging evidence also suggests that HR-deficient (HRD) tumors possess distinct immune escape mechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> and unique responses to combinations with immunotherapies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, we and others have shown that exposure to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly shapes the tumor ecosystem by enhancing the intricate interactions within the immune compartment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> resulting in spatially confined T-cell exhaustion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is crucial to decode the complex relationships between clinicomolecular features and the tumor ecosystem to improve patient stratification and immunotherapeutic treatment strategies for patients with HGSC.</p><p id="P4">We developed a high-resolution multi-omics single-cell spatial atlas, analyzing 15.1 million cells from advanced HGSC patient samples with comprehensive clinical and follow-up data. Leveraging detailed DNA methylation, gene copy number, and mutational profiling, we established clinicomolecular profiles that reveal critical tumor ecosystem dynamics. Using our image analysis paradigm, we resolved the TME at the single-cell level, identifying orchestrated multicellular domains that shape patient outcomes. We employed a custom machine learning tool, CEFIIRA, to integrate single-cell spatial, molecular, and survival data to uncover survival-linked features. We highlight the pivotal role of cancer cell-intrinsic MHC class II (MHCII) expression specifically at the tumor-stroma interface in driving immune landscapes. We show that MHCII-positive cancer cells generate immune hotspots marked by increased activation, impacting prognosis independently of clinicomolecular profiles. This atlas decodes the interplay between tumor and immune cells, shedding light on mechanisms influencing prognosis and paving the way for targeted interventions in HGSC.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Multi-omics single-cell spatial mapping of the tumor ecosystem of HGSC</title><p id="P5">To uncover the relationship between the TME ecosystem topography, clinical prognosis, and molecular profiles in HGSC we applied multi-omics analysis combined with high-plex imaging at a subcellular resolution on 265 advanced HGSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The tumor tissues were obtained from debulking surgeries, either from treatment-naive patients (Primary debulking surgery, PDS n=100) or after platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Interval debulking surgery, IDS n=158). The therapy sequence (PDS/IDS) was unknown for seven patients. Detailed clinical data, including long-term clinical outcomes, were collected, with a median follow-up of 38.2 months (IQR: 22-67 months) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Most patients (87.5%) received carboplatin and paclitaxel as adjuvant chemotherapy, and the median progression-free survival was 16 months (IQR: 12-27 months).</p><p id="P6">We conducted a hierarchical multi-omics analysis to assign the tumors’ molecular profiles. Firstly, <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> germline or somatic mutation status was assessed using targeted high throughput sequencing, and <italic>BRCA1</italic> promoter hypermethylation was evaluated using a targeted DNA methylation assay. Tumors without BRCAloss (<italic>BRCA1/2</italic> somatic or germline mutation, or <italic>BRCA1</italic> promoter hypermethylation) were tested for Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) and CCNE1-amplification using shallow whole genome sequencing and dedicated algorithms (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Methods</xref>). We categorized 174 tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) into four clinically and molecularly relevant groups (<italic>BRCAloss, HRD, HRP, and CCNE1 amplification</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. The rest (n=91) of the tumors were left “unassigned” as they could not be reliably categorized into the predefined molecular profiles (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Methods</xref>). For gene expression profiling, we performed Nanostring analysis using a panel of 335 genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. To characterize the TME from this large cohort, a tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed by targeting two representative cores from the tumor and two from stromal-rich areas. The tumor tissues were also stained for H&amp;E and CD8, CD20, CD103, CD68 using immunohistochemistry (IHC).</p><p id="P7">To precisely map the spatial TME at a single-cell resolution, we used hyperplexed imaging with tissue cyclic immunofluorescence (tCycIF) targeting 30 different proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), generating 929 single-cell maps of HGSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Image processing and analysis yielded 4,644,485 high-quality single cells, with an average of 20,000 cells for each tumor. The cell phenotyping was based on the multidimensional protein expression using two sequential approaches: 1) Per-sample detection of cancer cells using epithelial markers and clustering, 2) Annotation of stromal and immune populations using TRIBUS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> - a prior knowledge-based tool that combines unsupervised clustering with highly granular hierarchical automated cluster annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b to e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). We comprehensively validated the cell phenotyping by visual assessment of the cell annotation masks overlayed with the highly multiplexed images via customized Napari plugin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). The deep cell phenotypes comprised two non-immune stromal populations (annotated stromal) constituting 40% of the cells (CD31+ endothelial cells and Vimentin+, α-SMA+ fibroblasts) and 15 immune populations corresponding to 17% of the cells, including B cells, memory and regulatory T cells, and Myeloid lineages such as macrophages, neutrophils and antigen-presenting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f,g</xref>). The per-sample abundance of CD8+ T cells and CD20+ B cells concord with the expert pathologists’ annotations based on IHC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1c,d</xref>). The annotated cell phenotypes also showed agreement when projected on UMAPs. For example, lymphocytes (B cells and T cells) formed distinct clusters in the UMAP projection, while Myeloid cells depicted a phenotypically more heterogeneous group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1g</xref>). After cell phenotyping, we quantified the functional cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1h</xref>) and cell-to-cell spatial neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1i</xref>). To decode the phenotypic and spatial heterogeneity of cancer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, we clustered the cancer cells based on the expression of cancer-cell phenotypic markers, mesenchymal and functional markers, and cell morphology features. Using unsupervised consensus clustering (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Methods</xref>), we uncovered four distinct cancer cell phenotypic populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>) with distinct molecular and morphological characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1k, l</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Ext. Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Spatial TME is shaped by molecular profiles and chemotherapy exposure</title><p id="P8">We set out to evaluate clinically relevant patterns of immune infiltration across the defined clinicomolecular groups. We observed increased immune cell infiltration in BRCAloss and HRD tumors across both PDS and IDS samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>), with a notable enrichment of CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, lymphocyte populations demonstrated significant co-infiltration patterns within the TME (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1g</xref>). Furthermore, the abundance of several lymphocyte populations was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1h</xref>) and overall survival (OS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1i</xref>). Notably, in IDS samples, most immune cell infiltrations lacked prognostic significance, suggesting that tumor-intrinsic factors contribute to prognosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Additionally, the highly intercorrelated infiltration patterns limit the interpretability of individual hazard ratios, and imply that lymphocyte infiltration represents a coordinated process potentially orchestrated through shared biological mechanisms.</p><p id="P9">To map the spatial TME domains we clustered the 4,644,485 single cells based on their spatial neighborhood characteristics (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Methods</xref>). We uncovered 14 phenotypically distinct spatial clusters, hereafter referred to as recurrent cellular neighborhoods (RCN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1m,n</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1j</xref>). Four types of spatial domains were identified containing stromal (RCN01 to RNC03), cancer (RCN04 to RNC08), immune and stromal cells adjacent to cancer cells (annotated tumor-stroma interface, TSI; RCN09 and RCN10) and immune neighborhoods (RCN11 to RCN14). The RCN abundances were highly intercorrelated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 1k</xref>) indicating that the TME domains are spatially co-orchestrated. The cancer spatial domains included a heterogenous phenotypic neighborhood (RCN04), and four neighbourhoods predominated by distinct tumor cell functional phenotypes. Interestingly, the majority of cancer cells were localized in the RCN4 neighborhood containing the most heterogeneous cancer cell phenotypic composition measured using Shannon diversity index, indicating the preferred topographical concurrence of heterogeneous tumor cell clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1m</xref>). Further, the RCN4 was less abundant in the IDS samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1o,p</xref>) suggesting phenotypic convergence of cancer cell populations following chemotherapy, consistent with our previous observation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, we observed significant variations in the abundance of the immune-cold stroma (RNC01), enriched in the CCNE1 and HRP tumors, and immune-cold TSI (RCN09) enriched in HRD-IDS tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1o</xref>). Comparison of the spatial domains across therapy sequences further showed enrichment of stromal-non endothelial neighborhoods (RCN01 and RCN02), and immune-cold TSI (RCN09) in the chemotherapy exposed IDS samples, and proliferative tumor cell neighborhood (RCN7) in the PDS samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1p</xref>).

The primary objective of CEFIIRA is to identify the most distinguishing features within high-dimensional single-cell data that differentiate between two sample groups. CEFIIRA robustly minimizes bias in both ML model creation and the identification of critical features by: 1) Using ML model parameter tuning and feature importance evaluation in cross-validation, training and testing the model on multiple data partitions to prevent overfitting, 2) Ensuring that both the training and test sets have a proportional and balanced representation of samples from each class, 3) Validation of ML models on a prior defined validation set with unseen data, 4) Partitioning single-cell data in a sample-wise manner to minimize data leakage, 5) A robust identification of critical features using feature elimination and feature permutations, 6) Performing the previous steps over 30 iterations (nested cross validations) to achieve a consensus estimation.

We generated CEFIIRA models for either cancer cells or the immune-stromal compartment separately in HRD-like (BRCAloss, HRD) or HRP-like (HRP, CCNE1amp), and in PDS or IDS tumors respectively, also including age and tumor stage as potential confounders.

Our spatial analysis paradigm identified distinct spatial domains with varying phenotypic compositions. These intercorrelated domains were linked to specific tumor cell phenotypic profiles and clinicomolecular groups, underscoring the role of molecular drivers and chemotherapy in shaping TME topographies. Notably, of the two distinct TSI phenotypes, the immune-infiltrated TSI was associated with cancer cell phenotypic heterogeneity and improved outcomes, while the immune-cold TSI displayed stromal predominance and was linked to poorer outcomes. Using our machine learning framework CEFIIRA we integrate high-dimensional single-cell data and uncovered MHCII as a key prognostic marker in HGSC. Through spatial profiling of ∼15.1 million cells across two independent cohorts, we show that MHCII+ cancer cells within the immunogenic tumor and TSI neighborhoods generate immune hotspots. The hotspots showed evidence of coordinated immune activity with enhanced cellular interactions of MHCII+ cancer cells particularly with T cells and antigen-presenting myeloid cells. Interestingly, CD4+ T cells have been found to recognize MHCII+ cancer cell antigens in melanoma and breast cancer-promoting immune surveillance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, and the spatial contact between MHCII+ cancer cells and CD8+ T cells was reported recently in triple-negative breast cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.

While tumor-intrinsic MHCII expression indicates a functional tumor-immunity cycle via active antigen presentation, other therapeutic approaches should be developed for patients with tumors lacking MHCII expression.

of our study. We analyzed 265 HGSC patients using multi-omics tumor profiling. Each tumor was categorized in one of four common HGSC profiles: BRCAloss, homologous recombination deficient (HRD-BRCAwt), homologous recombination proficient (HRP) and Cyclin-E amplification (CCNE1 amp.), using methylation assay, targeted gene sequencing and shallow whole genome sequencing. The tumor microenvironment (TME) was assessed using tissue microarrays, comprising 1026 cores (spatial maps). High-dimensional imaging was employed to study the TME and extract single-cell spatial features. We developed a machine learning pipeline (CEFIIRA) to integrate the single-cell features and adjust for clinical covariates, aiming to predict features associated with survival and molecular profiles. Our results were validated using statistical methods, followed by further biological analysis for interpretation, both incorporating external cohorts. <bold>b</bold> A barplot displaying the composition of cancer cells, stromal cells, myeloid cells, lymphocytes, and unassigned cells per tumor.

Firstly, we defined targets for binary predictions, for example, prediction if cancer cells belong to either BRCAloss or HRP tumors. Data preprocessing is performed for the tumors related to the target (in the example, BRCAloss and HRP). Next, 30 nested cross-validation iterations are performed. In each iteration, 80% of the tumors (their corresponding cells) are randomly assigned to the training set, with the remaining 20% allocated to the test set. Subsequently, a random forest model is built using the training set, with several parameters optimized through Bayesian tuning and K-fold cross-validation. The trained model is validated on the test set to predict the target classes (in the example, whether cancer cells belong to either BRCAloss or HRP tumors) and its most predictive features are calculated. After completing 30 iterations of nested cross-validations, the model’s median accuracy and consensus critical features are identified. <bold>b-c</bold> Heatmap displaying the median accuracy (F1 score) of CEFIIRA models in predicting whether cells belong to tumors from short- or long-survival patients, across the indicated molecular profiles (rows) and cellular populations (columns).
