Conjugative pili, such as the F-pilus, are dynamic tubular structures, composed of a polymerized pilin, that mediate the initial donor–recipient interactions, a process known as mating pair formation (MPF). IncH are low-copy-number plasmids, traditionally considered broad host range, which are found in bacteria infecting both humans and animals. The reference IncHI1 plasmid R27, isolated from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhi, encodes the conjugative H-pilus subunit TrhA containing 74 residues after cleavage of the signal sequence. Here, we show that the H-pilus forms long filamentous structures that mediate MPF, and describe its cryo electron-microscopic (cryo-EM) structure at 2.2 Å resolution. Like the F pilus, the H-pilin subunits form helical assemblies with phospholipid molecules at a stochiometric ratio of 1:1. While there were previous reports that the T-pilus from <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> was composed of cyclic subunits, three recent cryo-EM structures of the T-pilus found no such cyclization. Here, we report that the H-pilin is cyclic, with a covalent bond connecting the peptide backbone between the N- and C-termini. Both the cryo-EM map and mass spectrometry revealed cleavage of the last five residues of the pilin, followed by cyclization via condensation of the amine and carboxylate residues. The cyclic nature of the pilin could stabilize the pilus and may explain the high incidence of IncH plasmid dissemination.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>conjugation</kwd><kwd>conjugation pilus</kwd><kwd>mating pair formation</kwd><kwd>cyclization</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Conjugation is a major mechanism of horizontal gene transfer, enabling the exchange of genetic material between bacterial cells. This process is central to bacterial evolution, particularly in exchange of virulence and metabolic genes as well as in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes. During conjugation plasmid DNA is transferred unidirectionally from one bacterium (donor) to another (recipient) in a contact-dependent manner (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>)). DNA transfer is facilitated by a type IV secretion system (T4SS) nanomachine, embedded in the bacterial cell wall, which is extended by a long hollow filament, known as the conjugation, mating, or sex pilus. Functionally, the pilus is involved in mating pair formation (MPF), linking donors and recipients at a distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). In IncF plasmids, MPF has been shown to enable low efficiency DNA transfer via the hollow conjugation pilus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). This is followed by pilus retraction, which enable donor and recipient bacteria to form mating aggregates via intimate interactions between the plasmid encoded outer membrane protein TraN in the donor and an outer membrane protein (OMP) receptor in the recipient, a process known as mating pair stabilization (MPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). We have recently shown the existence of at least four distinct TraN isoforms, each binding a distinct OMP receptor and influencing conjugation species specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). By stabilizing donor-recipient interactions, MPS enables efficient DNA transfer.</p><p id="P3">While pili were originally defined as all cell surface filaments that are not flagella, it has become clear that there are many different classes of pili that have evolved independently. Beyond conjugation, pili perform important other roles. For instance, type 1 pili in uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (UPEC) mediate adhesion to host cells, enabling colonization and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Type III pili (e.g. the <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> Mrk) are involved in biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Type IV pili contribute to both adhesion and motility via a process called twitching motility, allowing cells to glide across surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), as well as functioning as competence pili that mediate DNA uptake in natural transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Pili also assist in immune evasion by enabling adherence to immune-inaccessible niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). In addition, pili can undergo antigenic variation, which helps pathogens avoid detection by the host immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Pili also mediate DNA transfer across kingdoms, for example the transfer of the Ti plasmid via the T-pilus from <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> to plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Pilins that polymerize to form extracellular pili are synthesized in the cytoplasm as precursors with a leader peptide that directs their export to the periplasm via the Sec pathway, where the leader peptide is cleaved to produce the mature pilins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Structures of mating or conjugation pili from the IncF and IncW incompatibility plasmids have revealed that the pilins polymerize into a helical arrangement with tightly bound phospholipid molecules, forming thin, tubular filaments ~8 nanometers in diameter that can extend several micrometers in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Conjugation pilins are composed of three α helices, α1-3. Binding of the phospholipid is coordinated by α3 through hydrophobic interactions with the acyl chain of the phospholipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Recently, it has been shown based upon structural analysis that conjugation pili in archaea are homologs of the bacterial ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>).</p><p id="P5">IncH plasmids are divided into IncHI and IncHII, and the former is further divided into IncHI1, IncHI2 and IncHI3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). IncH plasmids, particularly IncHI1 and IncHI2 subtypes, are frequently associated with resistance to a wide range of antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and macrolides. IncH plasmids have been identified in several clinically significant Gram-negative bacterial pathogens (e.g. <italic>K, pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>), where they play a central role in mediating multidrug resistance (MDR). In recent years IncH plasmids have been shown to play a major role in the spread of New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). IncH plasmids harbor a conjugation system resembling the <italic>tra</italic> operon found in IncF plasmids, which fall under the MPFF classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). The key feature of the IncH plasmids is that conjugation rate is optimal at temperatures between 22 and 30°C and severely drops at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). This feature suggests that the dissemination of resistances by IncHI plasmids is promoted in water and soil environments. Accordingly it has been shown that expression of conjugative machinery genes is expressed al low temperatures (25°C) and repressed at high temperatures (37°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Using a derivative of the reference IncHI1 plasmid, R27, a tetracycline resistance plasmid isolated from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>), we determined the cryo-EM structure of the H-pilus at 2.2 Å resolution. Like the F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) and W (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) pili, the H-pilin subunits, TrhA, form helical assemblies with phospholipid molecules at a stochiometric ratio of 1:1. Uniquely, we found that unlike the F and W pilin structures, TrhA is cyclic, formed by a covalent bond connecting the peptide backbone between the N- and C-termini. Mass spectrometry data further validated the structure and confirmed that the last five residues of the mature pilin are cleaved, followed by cyclization via condensation of the amine and carboxylate residues. The cyclic nature of TrhA may provide the H-pilus with greater stability, which could potentially enable more efficient plasmid transfer during MPF.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Purification of the H-pilus</title><p id="P7">In order to optimize expression conditions of the derepressed <italic>htdA</italic> R27 mutant (drR27 in which resistance was swapped from tetracycline to chloramphenicol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), which constitutively expresses the conjugation operons at 25°C, we first conducted conjugation assays using a tryptophan auxotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> donor and wild type (WT) <italic>E. coli, Citrobacter rodentium</italic> and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> recipients. Briefly, overnight donor and recipient cultures were mixed in a ratio of 10:1, diluted 1 in 25 in PBS and 40 μl spotted onto LB agar plates. Following incubation at 37°C for 3 h, conjugation was allowed to proceed overnight at 25 °C. Transconjugates were selected by plating the conjugation mixture on M9 minimal media plates containing chloramphenicol. This revealed that almost 100% of the <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. rodentium</italic> recipients were transconjugates, while conjugation into <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was less efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To visualize the H-pilus, we transformed drR27 into <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 Δ<italic>fimA</italic>, lacking expression of type I pili. Following culturing at 25°C, we used negative stain EM to visualize surface appendages. We detected both thin pilus structures of ~ 90 Å diameter, presumably the H pili, and filamentous structures with a diameter of around 200 Å that are flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Finally, we used similar growth conduction to purify the H-pilus. In brief, we passed the cells through 25 G needles to shave the filaments which were precipitated by PEG 6,000 and dialyzed in imaging buffer (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref>). The purified filaments were deposited onto carbon coasted grids and stained by uranyl acetate. The negative stain EM of the purified samples show filaments corresponding to flagella and H-pili (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Cryo-EM imaging of the purified sample further confirmed the presence of flagella and H-pili (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). In raw images flagella showed structural features whereas the H-pili appeared as hollow tubes.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Cryo-EM structure of the H-pilus</title><p id="P9">We processed data using standard helical reconstruction in cryoSPARC and reconstructed a map of the H-pilus at 2.2 Å resolution (map:map FSC, 0.143 threshold), by imposing helical (rise 12.14 Å, twist 28.98°) and C5 symmetries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig.1</xref>). The 5-fold rotational symmetry is consistent with other characterized pili, including F and F-like pili (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), while the pKpQIL pilus does not have any rotational symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). The assembled pilus structure displays an outer diameter of ~ 90 Å and a lumen diameter of ~ 22 Å, which is similar to previously reported conjugation pilus structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). The high-resolution density map has allowed us to build the atomic model of the H-pilus for both the main chain and side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). Our analysis revealed clear phospholipid density in the map, indicating a precise 1:1 stoichiometry between pilus subunits and phospholipids. Although we have not identified the exact lipid, the density map clearly delineated the branched hydrocarbon chains, which were fit as PG32:1. The phosphate groups in the head region showed some flexibility, resulting in weaker density, but the overall lipid architecture was well-defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Additionally, we identified and modelled several bound water molecules per subunit, which are located on both the inner and outer surfaces of the pilus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The TrhA pilin is cyclized</title><p id="P10">Analysis of the H-pilus structure revealed cyclization between the N- and C-termini of the TrhA pilin. The density map unambiguously demonstrated the formation of a peptide bond between Gly1 and Asn69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref><bold>;</bold> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>). Although the mature TrhA pilin consists of 74 amino acids, only density for the first 69 residues was visible in the maps, indicating that the five C-terminal residues were cleaved during the cyclization process. As the H-pilus was resistant to tryptic digest studies, we validated the structural observation by performing electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). While the expected molecular weight for the mature TrhA is 7593.8 Da, the experimental mass was determined to be 7124.5 Da, which precisely corresponds to the loss of A<sub>70</sub>GIPD<sub>74</sub> (451.3Da) and the theoretical mass of residues 1-69 (7142.5 Da) minus 18 Da, representing the loss of one water molecule during the condensation of the Gly1 amine and Asn69 carboxylate residues as a result of the peptide bond formation during cyclization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The unambiguous density for the cyclization site, coupled with the mass spectrometry results, definitively establishes the cleavage of five C-terminal residues in the mature H-pilus structure.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>H-pilus assembly</title><p id="P11">Like other pilins, the TrhA pilin is comprised of three α-helices: α1 (Gly8-Thr19), α2 (Ala21-Phe37), and α3 (Gly45-Phe66), connected by short loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Structural comparison shows distinct structural features with six previously characterized pili: pED208 (PDB 5LEG)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), F (PDB 9MOQ), pKpQIL (PDB 7JSV)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), T (PDB 8EXH)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), pKM101 (PDB 8CW4)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), and R388 (PDB 8S6H)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).The pED208, F, and pKpQIL-pilus structures have straight α3 helices with loops between α1-α2, whereas pKM101, T, and R388-pilus structures have kinked α3 helices with straight α1-α2 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The H-pilus structure uniquely combines elements from both structural groups, featuring a moderately kinked α3 helix with less a pronounced kink than in other structures, while maintaining an α1-α2 connecting loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). The loop that connects α1 and α2 in H-pilus is less kinked and more structured with an additional turn, similar to the α1/2 (fused α1 and α2 helices) of the T pilus, pKM101 and R388. The distinctive kink angle in the H-pilus, which is smaller than in other pili, appears to be directly related to its cyclization. The formation of a cyclic structure between N- and C-termini brings the α1-2 and α3 helical regions closer, likely contributing to the reduced kink angle. The structure of the pilus lumen reveals a helix-loop-helix arrangement between α2 and α3, with the loop region showing a positive charge oriented toward the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>). The surface electrostatic potential for the lumen will depend upon the head group of the bound lipid. For pED208, it was shown that the lumen would have a positive potential without the lipid, but the PG headgroups changed the overall potential to negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). For the T-pilus, the potential of the lumen was positive with and without the inclusion of the PE headgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Given that we have not unambiguously identified the bound lipid, we do not know the overall surface potential of the lumen. The exterior surface of the pilus exhibits hydrophilic characteristics, featuring extensive water molecule associations and a pronounced positive charge distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Figs. 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The Lys24 side chain within the cyclized region, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>), likely enhances subunit interactions, thereby contributing to the structural stability of the assembled pilus.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Interaction between pilin subunits</title><p id="P12">The structural analysis reveals that each TrhA pilin establishes interactions with six neighboring subunits through an intricate network of both non-specific hydrophobic and specific polar contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The resolved water molecules appear to play an important role in mediating these subunit interactions through specific hydrogen bonding networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). A notable example is the hydrogen bond formation between Tyr13 and a water molecule, which subsequently forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone of Ala6 in the adjacent subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Additionally, charged residues contribute significantly to subunit stabilization, with Lys24 and Lys62 in one subunit forming salt bridges with Asp3 and Asp9, respectively, in an adjacent subunit while also making hydrogen bonds with water molecules and main chain atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). In the cyclization region, the main chain atoms of Gly1 and Asp69 participate in a hydrogen bonding network involving Lys24 and ordered water molecules, further stabilizing their structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Our structural analysis revealed the presence of one tightly bound phospholipid per TrhA subunit. Each subunit interacts with four lipid molecules, primarily through interactions involving hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4</xref>). The phosphate head groups of these lipids are oriented towards the pilus lumen and positioned within hydrophilic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Fig. 4</xref>). This specific arrangement of lipid-protein interactions appears to contribute significantly to both the structural stability of individual subunits and the overall integrity of the assembled pilus structure. These extensive networks of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions provide a strong molecular framework that maintains the overall H-pilus structure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P14">The R27 plasmid is a prototype conjugative plasmid, which has been extensively used to model dissemination of IncH plasmids carrying resistance genes among Gram-negative bacterial pathogen. In this study we characterized the R27-encoded H-pilus. Negative staining EM revealed that the H-pilus forms long polymerized filaments, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), similar to the pilus encoded by plasmids belonging to diverse incompatibility groups (e.g. IncF, IncP, IncW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). However, unlike previously reported conjugation pilus structures our high resolution cryo-EM structure revealed that the TrhA pilin is cyclic, with the N- and C-termini covalently bound to each other. Our mass spectrometry data confirm that cyclization is accompanied by cleavage of the last five C-terminal residues. Cyclization is driven by condensation of the Gly1 amine and Asn69 carboxylate residues. Pilin cyclization has been reported in earlier studies of the P-pilus from the IncP-1α plasmid RP4, where cyclization of the pilin TrbC proceeds via a similar condensation step as we found for the H-pilus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>); the cyclization of TrbC was proposed based on mass spectrometry and mutagenesis data. Similar to the TrhA pilin, where the last 5 terminal residues are proteolytically cleaved, 27 terminal residues of TrbC are also cleaved, although the terminal residues of the two pilins do not share any sequence similarity. It was suggested that the RP4-encoded signal peptidase homologue TraF attacks the C-terminus of TrbC via an activated serine residue. Similarly, the R27 plasmid contains TrhF, an RP4-TraF homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>); therefore, the mechanism of cyclisation of the H-pilus may be similar to that proposed for the P pilus.</p><p id="P15">While the IncH and IncF plasmid encode an MPFF conjugation machinery type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), only the H-pilin is cyclic. It is widely believed that following pilus retraction both IncH and IncF plasmids use MPS, mediated by the plasmid-encoded TraN. We have previously shown the presence of at least four distinct TraN isotypes amongst IncF plasmids, each of which binds a distinct OMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Interestingly, TraN encoded by IncH plasmids is about 50% longer than its IncF homologues. At present, it is not known if there is a functional relationship between expression of a long TraN and the cyclic nature of the H-pilus pilin.</p><p id="P16">Cyclization has also been reported for the <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> T pilus pilin VirB2 based largely upon mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). However, three recent cryo-EM structures of the T-pilus disagree with the MS, showing that VirB2 pilin is acyclic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). It should be considered that the different conclusions might be due to different growth conditions and sample preparation used in these studies. N-terminal to C-terminal cyclization is common in peptides but rare in proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>) and is usually associated with extreme stability under harsh conditions. Most notable cyclized structures are those of antibiotics (eg. bacitracin)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), bacteriocins (eg. enterocin AS-48)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), and cyclotides (e.g., Kalata B1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Kalata B1 is a cyclic peptide from the cyclotide family, from the plant <italic>Oldenlandia affinis</italic>, known for its exceptional stability due to its cyclic cystine-knot structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). The cyclization of Kalata B1 occurs between Gly1 and Asn29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), similar to the TrhA cyclization between Gly1 and Asn69. Although cyclization of the TrhA pilin does not affect the overall H-pilus filament structure, it is very likely to provide it with additional stability under harsh conjugation conditions. This assumption is further supported by the orientation of the side chain of Lys24 that points towards the ring-like structure and provides additional hydrogen-bonds.</p><p id="P17">In summary, we have shown both structurally and biochemically that TrhA is a cyclic pilin. While mass spectrometry suggested that the P-pilus is also composed of a cyclic pilin, this has not yet been shown structurally. Mass spectrometry did suggest that the T-pilus is cyclic, but structural data did not support the cyclic nature of the T-pilin. In contrast, we show the structure of a conjugation pilus composed of a cyclic pilin. These data raise intriguing questions about the biological consequences of a cyclic pilin and the cyclization mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Generating MG1655 Δ<italic>trp</italic> and Δ<italic>fimA</italic> mutants</title><p id="P18">All genome editing was conducted by two-step seamless markerless homologous recombination as previous described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Significance</title></caption><p>A major medical challenge is the spread of bacteria which are resistant to antibiotics. The resistance genes are spread via mobilized DNA, mainly via a process named conjugation. During conjugation, a resistant bacterium (donor), transfers the resistance DNA to another bacterium (recipient) in a contact-dependent manner. The initial donor-recipient interaction is mediated by a hollow filament expressed by the donor, named the conjugation pilus, that binds the recipient. This pilus is built via polymerization of a small protein subunit, pilin. Here, we report the atomic structure of the H-pilus, whose pilin subunit has an unusual cyclic structure where the N- and C-termini of the protein are covalently linked by a peptide bond.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Purification of the R27 H-pilus.</title><p>(A) Conjugation of R27 from <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 Δ<italic>trp</italic> donor into <italic>K. pneumoniae, E. coli</italic> or <italic>C. rodentium</italic> recipients.
