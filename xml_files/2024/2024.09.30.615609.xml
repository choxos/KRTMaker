Regardless of this existing paradox, our understanding of the molecular responses to aneuploidy remains limited. Here, we explore these cellular stresses and unique vulnerabilities in aneuploid human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) enriched for breast cancer-associated copy number alterations (CNAs). To uncover the genetic dependencies specific to aneuploid cells, we conducted a comprehensive, genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen targeting isogenic diploid and aneuploid HMEC lines. Our study reveals that aneuploid HMECs exhibit an increased reliance on pyrimidine biosynthesis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes, and demonstrate heightened fitness advantages upon loss of tumor suppressor genes. Using an integrative multi-omic analysis, we confirm nucleotide pool insufficiency as a key contributor to widespread cellular dysfunction in aneuploid HMECs with net copy number gain. While diploid cells can switch seamlessly between pyrimidine synthesis and salvage, cells with increased chromosomal content exhibit p53 activation and S-phase arrest when relying on salvage alone, and exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics. This work advances our understanding of the consequences of aneuploidy and uncovers potential avenues for patient stratification and therapeutic intervention based on tumor ploidy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Aneuploidy - the state of having abnormal numbers of chromosomes - is a hallmark of cancer, affecting &gt;90% of tumors, with most tumor genomes falling in the &gt;2N to &lt;4N ploidy range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup> and displaying tissue-specific karyotype selection patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>.

Just how widespread these stresses permeate across cellular systems is still being uncovered, with documentation of significant disruption to replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, RNA metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and proteostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. In yeast, drosophila, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, chromosomal imbalance results in metabolic disruptions in the form of increased ROS production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. It is no surprise then that aneuploidy generally slows growth rates in experimental models ranging from yeast to human cell lines, with the exception of some recurrent copy number alterations found prevalently in cancer, which have been shown to increase growth rate in cognate tissue-of-origin models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Aneuploidy is associated with p53 activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, which has been proposed to derive from aneuploidy-associated replication stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. This can lead to growth arrest, senescence, or apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Thus, one function of p53 is to sense and restrict aneuploidy in the body, and loss of p53 by somatic mutation in tumors is strongly associated with increased levels of aneuploidy compared to tumors without p53 mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. In fact, patients with Li Fraumeni syndrome who harbor germline p53 mutations have increased levels of aneuploidy in tissues and develop many different types of cancer - often in the same patient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. p53 is the top growth-restricting factor in aneuploid RPE1 cells, as determined through unbiased functional genomic methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. However, the underlying mechanisms by which aneuploidy leads to replication stress and subsequent p53 activation are poorly understood.</p><p id="P5">Here we utilize a functional genomics approach to characterize gene essentiality in net-gain aneuploid human mammary epithelial cells compared to isogenic diploid controls. By performing genome-wide CRISPR screens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> in paired aneuploid/diploid mammary cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and integrating transcriptomic, metabolomic, and bioenergetics data, we identify nucleotide pool insufficiency as a key underlying mechanism of p53 activation in net copy number gain aneuploid cells. Additionally, aneuploid cells exhibited increased mitochondrial ATP production, as well as increased glycolytic rates, to support the increased metabolic demands associated with increased chromosomal content. Nucleotide pool insufficiency associated with net-gain chromosomal aneuploidy could potentially be targeted therapeutically to enhance current chemotherapeutic modalities of breast cancer treatment, or stratify patients under current clinical standards of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Genome-wide aneuploidy synthetic lethality CRISPR screens</title><p id="P6">With the goal of fully profiling aneuploidy synthetic lethalities in a cancer-relevant system, we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens in isogenic diploid and aneuploid cell lines derived from diploid hTERT-immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (hTERT-HMECs, referred to as “HMECs” here), which are considered good models for the cell type of origin of multiple breast cancer subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. Additionally, HMECs are untransformed and do not contain driver mutations as assessed by deep whole genome sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, enabling us to isolate the aneuploidy synthetic lethality profile without the complications of background mutational status. We chose four different aneuploid clonal lines with largely non-overlapping chromosomal amplifications, except for chromosome 20 gain which is recurrently selected in HMECs <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> and is present in each line. We performed control screens utilizing three different clonally-derived diploid lines, also in duplicate, for a total of 14 genome-wide CRISPR screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 a</xref>). This library contains 5 guides per gene targeting ~18,000 protein-coding genes, for a total of ~90,000 reagents.</p><p id="P7">After infection with the Lentiviral CRISPR library at a multiplicity of infection of 0.3 and representation of 500 cells per guide, the initial “population doubling 0” (PD0) timepoint was collected, then cells were passaged for 6 population doublings and collected for the endpoint of the screen (PD6). Gene dropout/enrichment was determined based on sequencing coverage of guides after amplicon-seq of extracted genomic DNA using edgeR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. A slight bias in dropout/enrichment based on chromosomal location for genes on chromosomes affected by aneuploidy was observed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, which we implemented a computational correction to resolve (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 a</xref>).</p><p id="P8">A start-to-endpoint analysis of aneuploid and diploid screens revealed largely overlapping gene dropout and enrichment profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 b</xref>), however more genes were essential in aneuploid HMECs compared to diploid HMECs (FDR &lt; 0.05 and log<sub>2</sub> fold change &lt; -2). To generate aneuploidy epistasis profiles, we compared PD6 endpoints between the aneuploid and diploid screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 c-f</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis of epistasis profiles for each of the four aneuploid mutants used in the screens revealed differential dropout of guides targeting genes in pathways known to be stressed in aneuploidy, like ubiquitin mediate proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 d-f</xref>). Additionally, we observe significantly stronger enrichment of p53 pathway-targeting guides (as well as other tumor suppressor pathways) in aneuploid lines compared to diploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 d-f</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 b, c</xref>). Top-25 enriched hits in 3 out of 4 screens included prominent tumor suppressors TP53, CDKN1A, USP28, NF1 and CDKN2A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Net-gain aneuploid cells do not tolerate <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine synthesis disruption and are insufficiently rescued with uridine</title><p id="P9">Top differential dropout hits in the aneuploidy screens centered around nucleotide biosynthesis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 d-f</xref>). The three enzymes that catalyze the first six reactions of the <italic>do novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (CAD, DHODH, UMPS), were among the top 4 dropout hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1 e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1 d</xref>). DHODH is positioned in the mitochondrial membrane and catalyzes the vital pyrimidine biosynthesis reaction of dihydroorotate (DHO) reduction to orotate, passing reducing equivalents directly to the mitochondrial ubiquinone pool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 a</xref>). Thus, nucleotide metabolism and mitochondrial redox biology are inextricably linked, and this critical node renders mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation indispensable for tumor cell proliferation despite high flux and ATP production through glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Our data suggests this pyrimidine biosynthesis/mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation axis is especially critical for proliferation of cells with supernumerary chromosomal content, perhaps due to increased nucleotide and energy requirements.</p><p id="P10">To validate this dependency, we utilized CRISPR to mutate DHODH in representative aneuploid and diploid mammary epithelial cell lines. During the process of selection and recovery we supplemented cells with uridine to prevent cell cycle arrest/death. Complete protein loss in each line was confirmed via western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2 a</xref>). DHODH knockout resulted in S-phase accumulation when uridine was withdrawn from culture in both diploid and aneuploid lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 b-c</xref>). While the cell cycle arrest caused by DHODH mutation in diploid cells could be fully rescued by supplementing physiological plasma uridine concentrations (3-8 μM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>), DHODH knockout in aneuploid cells could not be fully rescued by the same dose range of uridine supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2 b</xref>). This indicates that net-gain aneuploid cells do indeed require more pyrimidine than diploid cells to replicate a higher chromosome load. This also indicates that, while diploid mammary epithelial cells are capable of fully sustaining growth using either nucleotide synthesis or nucleotide salvage alone, net-gain aneuploid cells cannot proliferate at full capacity using only pyrimidine salvage. This phenomenon could also be recapitulated with the DHODH inhibitor (DHODHi) brequinar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>, which only mildly impaired diploid cell growth but severely impaired aneuploid cell growth under the same uridine supplementation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 d, e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2 c</xref>). Aneuploid cells entering S-phase arrest induced by DHODHi were less likely than diploid cells to successfully re-enter and progress through the cell cycle when provided uridine after arrest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2 d-f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Net-gain aneuploid cells display insufficient pyrimidine synthesis relative to ploidy</title><p id="P11">To profile the metabolic constraints that may lead to nucleotide pool insufficiency in aneuploid HMECs, we traced de novo pyrimidine synthesis flux into UTP using <sup>13</sup>C<sub>4</sub>-labeled aspartate revealed that net gain aneuploid HMECs do not increase pyrimidine synthesis capacity, displaying equal label incorporation into UTP compared to diploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 a, b</xref>). However, since aneuploid HMECs have increased DNA content, this equivalent flux of de novo nucleotide synthesis compared to diploid cells represents a possible replication vulnerability, given that pyrimidine synthesis-to-ploidy ratios are effectively decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 c-e</xref>). Additionaly, we observe a significant decrease in GSH::GSSG ratios, indicating a disruption of redox balance and increased reactive oxygen species in aneuploid HMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 f</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Underlying insufficiency in <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine flux relative to nucleodide demand suggests a mechanism for sensitiviy of aneuploid HMECs to DHODH disruption, which would exacerbate this pre-existing insufficiency. We thus examined the underlying metabolic disruptions induced by low-dose DHODHi (2nM brequinar) in aneuploid and diploid cells using LC-MS/MS metabolomics. As expected, a buildup of the DHODH substrate, dihydroorotate (DHO), was observed with DHODHi, validating the on-target nature of the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 g</xref>). Diploid cells displayed minimal metabolomic changes associated with low-dose DHODHi, primarily a decrease in pyrimidine species, which were restored to baseline levels with uridine supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 g-i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). However, 2N- and 4N-range net-gain aneuploid cells exhibit greater metabolomic disruption with DHODHi beyond just decrease in pyrimidine species (which were also more significantly decreased than in diploids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 g-i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). Furthermore, in aneuploid HMECs, uridine supplementation rescues most (but not all) of the metabolic disruption caused by DHODHi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 g-i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Both oxidative phosphorylation and glycolytic rates are increased in net-gain aneuploid HMECs</title><p id="P13">Since we also observed increased dependence of net-gain aneuploid cells on mitochondrial pathways including oxidative phosphorylation, and metrics of redox stress like GSH::GSSG ratio were also apparent in aneuploid HMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 f</xref>), we asked whether baseline bioenergetic states of aneuploid and diploid cells were altered. We found that aneuploidy increases both oxygen consumption and proton efflux rates to a degree scaling with overall ploidy, indicative of increased oxidative phosphorylation and glycolytic flux, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 a-f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4 a, b</xref>). We next assessed total mitochondrial content relative to DNA ploidy across a broad range of aneuploidies in HMECs and found an increase in estimated mitochondrial DNA in 4N-range aneuploids (even relative to ploidy), along with an increase in both nuclear-encoded and mitochondria-encoded mitochondrial gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 g-k</xref>). Thus, mammary epithelial cells with higher chromosomal ploidies tend to increase mitochondrial content and mitochondrial gene expression and display higher rates of oxidative phosphorylation. The increased flux through oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis observed in net-gain aneuploids may serve to compensate for increased energy expenditure, since ratios of ATP::AMP are largely equivalent in aneuploids and diploids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4 c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Net gain aneuploid HMECs activate p53 and are sensitive to DNA-damaging drugs combined with DHODHi</title><p id="P14">To assess the relationship between nucleotide pool insufficiency and stress signaling in aneuploidy, we performed RNA-seq in representative aneuploid and diploid HMEC lines under steady state, mild nucleotide inhibition with DHODHi, or DHODHi plus UMP supplementation conditions. We validated that copy number-specific gene expression changes could be observed in this gene set, as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5 a-d</xref>). Low-dose DHODHi (2 nM brequinar) resulted in decreased ribosomal gene expression universally across all cell types, albeit to more significant degrees in aneuploid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 a, b</xref>) Diploid transcriptomes were otherwise unperturbed by DHODHi, and the modest ribosomal gene downregulation was fully rescued by uridine salvage. 2N- and 4N-range net-gain aneuploid HMECs displayed more significant and widespread transcriptomic responses to DHODHi, including a robust activation of p53 signaling as indicated by canonical target upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 a, b</xref>), as well as activation of lysosomal, cell adhesion, and NFκB target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5 e</xref>). Unlike in diploid cells, transcriptomic alterations in response to DHODHi were not fully restored to baseline with uridine supplementation in aneuploid HMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 a</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We wondered whether aneuploidy-associated nucleotide pool stress may result in sensitivity to chemotherapeutic DNA-damaging agents, which would exacerbate replication stress and nucleotide pool demand to support DNA repair. We exposed cells to 0.5 μM oxaliplatin for 3 days and found that aneuploid cells were significantly more sensitive to chemotherapeutic challenge than diploid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 d</xref>). To test the combination of both DNA damaging and DHODHi drugs, we pre-treated cells with 0.25 μM oxaliplatin for 3 days to induce damage, then inhibited pyrimidine biosynthesis across a range of DHODHi (brequinar) doses and uridine rescue conditions. Pre-treatment with oxaliplatin exacerbated the differential proliferative effects of DHODHi in aneuploid cells compared to diploid cells across a range of salvage conditions, but especially when salvage is restricted by low uridine levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 e</xref>). Additionally, 0.5 μM oxaliplatin treatment for 3 days resulted in a similar transcriptional response observed by DHODHi-induced nucleotide pool stress including downregulation of ribosomal gene expression and increased p53 signaling, but only in aneuploid cells, and this response was even more pronounced when treatments were combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Net-gain aneuploid tumors and cancer cell lines display similar metabolic features</title><p id="P16">To determine whether aneuploidy-associated nucleotide insufficiency phenotypes were also present in human tumors and cancer cell lines, we assessed large-scale metabolomics, sequencing, and functional genomics datasets.

The essentiality of genes encoding mitochondrially localized proteins was generally correlated with the degree of net-gain aneuploidy across cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6 e, f</xref>). A similar overall gene set enrichment profile was observed when analyzing net-gain aneuploidy in just breast cancer-derived cell lines (n = 33) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6 f</xref>). This indicates that net gain aneuploidy universally confers sensitivity to disruption of nucleotide, DNA repair, and mitochondrial pathways, in both non-cancer-derived and cancer-derived cell line models.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Breast cancer patients with net-gain aneuploid tumors have increased survival probability when treated with DNA-damaging chemotherapies</title><p id="P18">These combined functional genomics analyses suggest that nucleotide insufficiency in net-gain aneuploid tumors may represent a therapeutically exploitable vulnerability to drugs that affect the nucleotide pool and DNA replication, such as DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics (like platin-based therapies), nucleotide analogs (like 5-FU), or anti-metabolites (like methotrexate). Indeed, stratifying patients in the breast cancer TCGA cohort by aneuploidy (net gain vs. net loss) and treatment type (chemotherapy vs non-chemotherapy) revealed that patients with net-gain tumors treated with chemotherapy have a significantly higher survival probability than patients with net-loss tumors (HR = 2.67, p = 0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6 g</xref>). This difference in survival was not observed in patients who were treated with non-chemotherapeutic hormonal and/or targeted therapies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6 g</xref>). The best overall survival was achieved in the net-gain aneuploidy + chemotherapy treatment group (95% 5-year survival rate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6 g</xref>). This suggests that aneuploidy status could be used in therapeutic decision-making and patient stratification, and that patients with net-gain aneuploid tumors could benefit significantly from receiving DNA-damaging/nucleotide analog/anti-metabolite chemotherapies. Incorporating biosynthesis inhibitors like DHODHi into treatment regimens may provide additional benefit by exploiting the inability of net-gain aneuploid cells to proliferate using pyrimidine salvage alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6 h</xref>). Minimal uridine supplementation could be a way to buffer systemic toxicity but still maintain effectiveness in aneuploid cell growth restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6 h</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">In this study we performed genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens in human mammary epithelial cells with net-gain aneuploidy compared to isogenic diploid cells. In addition to known aneuploidy stress-related susceptibilities like ubiquitin-mediated protein homeostasis, we identified mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, TCA cycle, and de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis enzymes as top-scoring dropout hits in the screen. Additionally, we observed increased enrichment of sgRNAs targeting components of the p53 pathway in aneuploid cells compared to diploids, indicating that aneuploid cells derive greater benefit from loss of commonly mutated tumor suppressors. Aneuploidy has been shown to activate TP53 signaling in multiple cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> including HMECs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a-b</xref>), and loss of TP53 via mutation licenses aneuploidy <italic>in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup></italic> and is associated with increased aneuploidy in human tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Replication stress has been previously proposed as a mechanism linking aneuploidy and p53 activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, however the root causes of aneuploidy-associated replication stress are not well understood. Here, we identify nucleotide pool insufficiency as a metabolic vulnerability of net-gain aneuploid HMECs, which is associated with p53 activation and exploitable with pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors.</p><p id="P20">DHODH appears to be a key node linking increased reliance on mitochondria and nucleotide metabolism in aneuploid cells. DHODH is the sole mitochondrial-resident enzyme of the <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, which reduces ubiquinone in the dehydrogenation of dihydroorotate to orotate. While we observe significantly increased ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation, as well as increased glycolysis rates, in net-gain aneuploids, we do not observe increased flux through <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis, perhaps revealing why it is the top vulnerability of aneuploid HMECs. Knocking out DHODH with CRISPR revealed that, while diploid HMECs could proliferate using solely <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine synthesis or salvage (with the ability to switch seamlessly between the two), aneuploid HMEC proliferation was significantly impaired under the salvage-only condition. This indicates a constitutive reliance on <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis in mammary epithelial cells with extra chromosomes even when nucleotides are plentifully available for salvage, perhaps due to a fixed upper limit on import or salvage capacity (adding high levels of uridine couldn’t override the deficiency).</p><p id="P21">Mild impairment of DHODH function with low-dose brequinar treatment exacerbated the underlying p53 activation phenotype associated with aneuploidy in HMECs and led to global disruption of the metabolome, including depletion of almost all pyrimidine-based species (CTP, CDP, UTP, UDP, and UDP-conjugated sugars). Sensitivity to DHODH inhibition in net-gain aneuploid cells may ultimately be due to a mismatch between nucleotide synthesis rates and nucleotide demand. Interestingly, ribosomal gene expression is increased at baseline in aneuploid cells relative to diploids, then decreases dramatically in response to DHODHi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5 b</xref>, black bars). Ribosome biogenesis could be expected to compete with DNA replication for nucleotide pools given that the total rRNA content in a human cell (~8-16 pg) is greater than the total amount of genomic DNA (~6 pg)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>, thus the interplay between these major consumers of pyrimidines could be an intersection of vulnerability in net-gain aneuploid cells. p53 activation occurs in response to both rRNA/ribosome biogenesis disruption and replication stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>, again highlighting the central role of p53 in aneuploidy stress sensing and response.</p><p id="P22">Combination treatment of cells with brequinar and oxaliplatin showed that treatment with DNA-damagers increases cell sensitivity to DHODH inhibition, particularly in aneuploid cells. This data suggests the potential for adjuvant therapies utilizing smaller doses of nucleotide inhibitors in combination with other clinically available DNA damaging chemotherapies, which have been shown to increase reliance on <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine synthesis in breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. Additionally, physiological doses of uridine are more efficient in returning diploid cells to baseline transcriptomic and metabolomic conditions as compared to aneuploid cells, therefore allowing diploid cells to be successfully rescued from arrest in S-phase. This data suggests a potential for limited nucleotide supplementation to be used in conjunction with nucleotide inhibitors to titrate the toxicity of chemotherapies.</p><p id="P23">Altogether, we show that aneuploid cells with a net gain of chromosomes experience nucleotide pool stress due to an increased demand of nucleotides but insufficient compensatory flux through synthesis and/or salvage pathways. Furthermore, p53 activation in net-gain aneuploid mammary cells may result from intrinsic metabolic constraints on pyrimidine synthesis and salvage leading to replication stress, which can be further exacerbated by pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors or DNA damage. Nucleotide salvage should be further investigated as a targetable node, as has been explored in kidney cancers with FH mutation and subsequent reliance on purine salvage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Since many tissues can access both synthesis and salvage of nucleotides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>, further exploration of the generalizability of our findings to net-gain aneuploidy in other tumors types is warranted. Survival data across a large cohort of breast cancer patients indicate that net gain aneuploidy could be utilized as a biomarker to identify patients who are likely to respond to DNA-damaging and anti-metabolite/anti-nucleotide treatments.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Cell Culture</title><p id="P24">The hTERT–HMEC cell line was immortalized previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup> from primary HMECs purchased from ATCC (PCS-600-010).
