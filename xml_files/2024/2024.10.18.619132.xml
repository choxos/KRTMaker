For PV, this mechanism exploits the host secretory autophagy pathway. Virions are selectively incorporated into autophagosomes, double-membrane vesicles that travel to the plasma membrane, fuse, and release single-membrane vesicles containing virions. Loading of cellular cargo into autophagosomes relies on direct or indirect interactions with microtubule-associated protein 1B-light chain 3 (LC3) that are mediated by motifs referred to as LC3-interaction regions (LIRs). We have identified a PV mutant with a severe defect in non-lytic spread. An F-to-Y substitution in a putative LIR of the nonstructural protein 3CD prevented virion incorporation into LC3- positive autophagosomes and virion trafficking to the plasma membrane for release. Using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy to monitor PV-induced autophagosome biogenesis, for the first time, we show that virus-induced autophagic signals yield normal autophagosomes, even in the absence of virions. The F-to-Y derivative of PV 3CD was unable to support normal autophagosome biogenesis. Together, these studies make a compelling case for a direct role of a viral nonstructural protein in the formation and loading of the vesicular carriers used for non-lytic spread that may depend on the proper structure, accessibility, and/or dynamics of its LIR. The studies of PV 3CD protein reported here will hopefully provoke a more deliberate look at the presence and function of LIR motifs in viral proteins of viruses known to use autophagy as the basis for non-lytic spread.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Poliovirus (PV), the prototypical member of the <italic>Enterovirus</italic> genus of the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family of positive-strand RNA viruses, is among the best-understood viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). While PV has been essentially eliminated from developing countries due to effective vaccination measures, global eradication has yet to be certified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). We have used PV as a model system to understand the enzymology and cell biology of viral genome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) because of the more than 50 years of work by dozens of investigators establishing a solid foundation of principles governing PV multiplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>).</p><p id="P4">The latest emerging principle is that non-enveloped picornaviruses spread preferentially by concealing virions within vesicles and using a non-lytic mechanism instead of a lytic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Secretory autophagy is the predominant mechanism for the non-lytic spread of PV and other enteroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The literature supporting this conclusion has interrogated the extent to which what is known about the cellular mechanism of secretory autophagy and corresponding factors align with the virus-induced pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Very little is known about direct contributions of viral factors to non-lytic spread.</p><p id="P5">We have identified a derivative of the PV nonstructural protein 3CD that causes a defect in the non-lytic spread of the virus. Using a variety of approaches, including high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we show that 3CD is required for particle movement from the site of assembly into autophagosomes, proper formation of autophagosomes, and movement of virion-containing autophagosomes from the perinuclear region of the cell to the periphery and beyond. We suggest that one or more LC3-interacting regions of 3CD contribute to its post-genome-replication functions and that the multifunctional properties of 3CD are bestowed by its highly tunable, extraordinary conformational dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>A post-genome-replication function for PV 3CD protein</title><p id="P6">The processivity of nucleotides incorporated per binding event by poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (PV RdRp), without any accessory factors, is predicted to approach 10<sup>6</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). The best empirical evidence shows that PV RdRp can replicate through 3000 bp of dsRNA without dissociating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). The processivity of reverse transcriptases does not approach these values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Accessory factors enabling processivity are generally required for DNA polymerases to exhibit high processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). The structural basis for PV RdRp processivity is not known. One hypothesis has been that the intimate interaction between the fingertips and thumb subdomains of the RdRp yields a completely encircled active site that will not readily dissociate from the RNA template once engaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P7">The interface between the fingertips and thumb subdomains is comprised, in part, of three phenylalanine residues: F30 and F34 from the fingertips and F432 from the thumb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). We constructed a PV RdRp derivative in which F30 was changed to Y, this derivative is referred to herein as F30Y. Our rationale was that burying the tyrosine hydroxyl and any associated water molecules would destabilize the interface, creating a derivative with only reduced processivity.</p><p id="P8">We reasoned that an RdRp derivative exhibiting a destabilized interaction with primed-template would not assemble on the primed-template as well as WT RdRp does. Once assembled, the complex would also be predicted to be less stable, causing an increase in the steady-state rate constant for nucleotide incorporation and rate constant for dissociation of the derivative from the primed-template when compared to WT RdRp. Interestingly, the biochemical properties of F30Y RdRp were identical to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Because our in vitro tests could have been masking a phenotype that would be observed in cells, we engineered the F30Y derivative into a subgenomic replicon to indirectly monitor genome replication after transfection by measuring luciferase activity. This assay also failed to reveal a phenotype for the F30Y RdRp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We used a replicon expressing an inactive RdRp (GAA) as a negative control. Luciferase activity produced in this case reflects translation of the transfected RNA without genome replication.</p><p id="P9">For completeness, we engineered the F30Y change into the viral genome. We did not expect a difference between F30Y PV and WT, but F30Y PV exhibited a small-plaque phenotype when compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). This phenotype could reflect a reduction in infectious virus produced and/or a reduction in the efficiency of virus spread. We performed a one-step-growth analysis and monitored the production of infectious virus within cells (cell-associated) and the efficiency with which virus was released from cells (media-associated). WT PV reproducibly produced virus on the order of 10<sup>9</sup> plaque-forming units (pfu) per mL, with 10<sup>7</sup> pfu/mL detectable in media by the end of the experiment (panel i, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). In contrast, F30Y PV exhibited a one-log reduction in overall yield of cell-associated virus and three- to four-log reduction in media-associated virus (panel ii, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The primary form of the RdRp domain in PV-infected cells is the precursor 3CD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Previous studies have implicated this protein as a critical factor for genome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>) and in steps preceding genome replication, including activation of phospholipid biosynthesis and membrane biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The studies reported above are consistent with 3CD as the mediator of the observed effect and a post-genome-replication function for this protein. It is known that purified 3CD stimulates cell-free synthesis of PV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) through unknown mechanisms. We expressed and purified the corresponding 3CD derivative (F213Y) but will refer to it as F30Y 3CD to avoid confusion. The F30Y 3CD derivative could not support cell-free synthesis stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>), which is consistent with 3CD as the mediator of the observed biological defect and further supports a role for 3CD after genome replication.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>PV 3CD contributes to virion morphogenesis and non-lytic spread</title><p id="P11">Studies of the enterovirus lifecycle can be synchronized using two inhibitors. First, guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) at 2 mM is sufficient to inhibit genome replication by inactivating the ATPase activity of the viral 2C protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). However, the pioneer round of translation occurs, as the activity of genome-encoded reporters like luciferase can be detected (WT+GuHCl in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Second, 5-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) methyl hydantoin, referred to herein as hydantoin (H) also targets the viral 2C protein, but impairs virion morphogenesis without any impact on genome replication (WT+H in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), although at concentrations higher than 50 μg/mL, hydantoin can inhibit genome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To assess PV spread at the population level, we use a recombinant GFP-expressing PV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) to infect HeLa cells containing a plasma membrane red dye and place these on a monolayer of unstained, uninfected HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). As the primary infection proceeds, we observe the formation of yellow cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). As the virus spreads from the yellow cells to the uninfected cells, these cells appear green (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). We have provided a representative movie of PV spread using this assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie S1</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We monitored the number of GFP-positive cells as a function of time for WT PV (PV-WT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). We observed two phases. The first phase included a lag followed by linear accumulation of GFP-positive cells, with the rate of accumulation approaching a plateau by 15 hours post-infection (hpi) (PV-WT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). At 15 hpi, a secondary wave of GFP-positive cells accumulated, creating an inflection point that is presumably a reflection of PV spread (PV-WT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). That this second phase represented PV spread was supported by the sensitivity of this phase to the presence of hydantoin in the media (PV-WT+H in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We performed the same experiment using F30Y PV. We observed a linear accumulation of GFP-positive cells over the entire 30-h time course (PV-F30Y in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). The observed accumulation was not impacted by the presence of hydantoin (PV-F30Y+H in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>), suggesting a slow rate of infection establishment and a substantial defect to and/or delay in virus assembly and/or virus spread.</p><p id="P15">To investigate virus assembly, we used two monoclonal antibodies: A12 (human) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) and mAb234 (mouse) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). The epitope recognized by A12 is in the canyon and should be able to recognize assembled particles whether the viral genome has been encapsidated or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). On the other hand, mAb234 binds to the rim of the canyon and should favor binding to a viral genome-containing particle, the virion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>). We used these antibodies to assess infected cells at 6 hpi in the absence and presence of hydantoin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). For WT PV, mAb234 exhibited the greatest reactivity, consistent with the presence of primarily infectious virions at this time point (WT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A, C</xref>). In the presence of hydantoin, however, A12 exhibited the greatest reactivity, consistent with hydantoin interfering with encapsidation of the viral genome to form infectious virions (WT+H in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A, C</xref>). Importantly, F30Y PV appears to have no problem making infectious virions based on the accumulation of mAb234-reactive virions as observed for WT (F30Y in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B, C</xref>). However, the localization of the virions appears to be restricted to the perinuclear regions compared to WT PV (F30Y in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref>). Hydantoin also interfered with the maturation of the virus produced by F30Y PV (F30Y+H in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B, C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We have developed a system to isolate cell pairs in nanowells and to monitor the spread of infection from an infected to an uninfected cell. This system will be described in detail in a separate report based on a previous design we published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). To distinguish primary from secondary infections, recipient uninfected cells were stained with a red dye. In these experiments, a UnaG reporter was used instead of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). The infected cell is introduced into a chamber with an uninfected cell, and infection dynamics are monitored in each cell by measuring green fluorescence evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G</xref>). A movie illustrating the experiment and outcomes has been provided (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Movie S2</xref>). Three outcomes can be observed: no spread, lytic spread, and non-lytic spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2G, H</xref>). In a no-spread scenario, the infected cell lyses, but the released virus fails to establish infection in the uninfected cell.</p><p id="P17">We performed a single-cell-pairing experiment using two cell lines: HeLa and HAP1. Observations with each were essentially identical. The primary route of secondary infection for WT PV was by a non-lytic mechanism (non-lytic spread in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). The vast number of lytic infections for WT PV failed to result in secondary infections (compare no spread to lytic spread in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). Interestingly, F30Y PV was significantly and selectively impaired in its ability to spread by a non-lytic mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>). Also interesting was the observation that loss of non-lytic infection led not to more lytic infections that spread but to more lytic infections that failed to spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>PV 3CD comigrates with virions from the perinuclear region of the cell to the periphery</title><p id="P18">Experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2F</xref> above suggested a trafficking defect for virions produced by F30Y PV.

We infected HeLa cells in the absence or presence of hydantoin and used immunofluorescence to monitor virus particles/virions and 3CD as a function of time post-infection.

We quantified the staining by each antibody as a function of distance from the perinuclear region of the cell to the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).

However, the peak of fluorescence for both virions and 3CD shifted away from the perinuclear region of the cell towards the periphery (WT 6 hpi in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). By 8 hpi for WT PV, most of the virions were no longer in the cell (WT 8 hpi column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Any residual staining of virus particles/virions occurred in the perinuclear regions of the cell (WT 8 hpi in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). The level of 3CD observed in the cell at 8 hpi was also diminished (compare 3CD at 6 hpi to 8 hpi in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Immature virus particles do not move to the cell periphery</title><p id="P21">Hydantoin treatment is thought to trap an intermediate during genome encapsidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), likely in association with the replication organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>).

While much is known about the cellular factors required for non-lytic transmission, much less is known about viral factors contributing to transmission. We have discovered a PV nonstructural protein required for multiple steps of the pathway leading to vesicle-enclosed virions. This discovery should facilitate identification of the specific steps of the cellular secretory autophagy pathway and corresponding factors commandeered by the virus and may uncover novel targets for antiviral therapy.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A post-genome-replication function for PV 3CD protein</title><p><bold>(A) PV 3D RdRp structure.</bold> The PV 3D RdRp structure is depicted as a gray ribbon; the structure adopts a canonical right-hand shape with fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains.
