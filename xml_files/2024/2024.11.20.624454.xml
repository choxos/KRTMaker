Here, using <italic>Mus musculus</italic> SPO11, we report a biochemical system that recapitulates all the hallmarks of meiotic DSB formation. We show that SPO11 catalyzes break formation in the absence of any partners and remains covalently attached to the 5′ broken strands. We find that target site selection by SPO11 is influenced by the sequence, bendability and topology of the DNA substrate, and provide evidence that SPO11 can reseal single-strand DNA breaks. In addition, we show that SPO11 is monomeric in solution and that cleavage requires dimerization to reconstitute two hybrid active sites. SPO11 and its partner TOP6BL form a 1:1 complex that catalyzes DNA cleavage with a similar activity to SPO11 alone. However, the complex binds DNA ends with higher affinity, suggesting a potential role post-cleavage. We propose a model where additional partners of SPO11 required for DSB formation <italic>in vivo</italic> assemble biomolecular condensates that recruit SPO11-TOP6BL, enabling dimerization and cleavage.

To our surprise, we observed a robust plasmid DNA-cleavage activity that coincided with the peak of MBP-tagged SPO11 protein eluting from an ion exchange column (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c, d</xref>). This activity was abolished when the tandem active site tyrosines (Y137, Y138) found in SPO11 were mutated to phenylalanine (YYFF) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Cleavage depended on the presence of a divalent metal ion, with Mn<sup>2+</sup> being more effective than Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> also supporting low levels of cleavage (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Hence, mouse SPO11 has intrinsic double-strand DNA cleavage activity, even in the absence of any of the partners known to be required <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>SPO11 binds covalently to 5′ DNA strands</title><p id="P6">We verified that SPO11 remains covalently attached to the DNA breaks in four different ways.</p><p id="P7">First, we asked whether the linear cleavage product depended on deproteination of the sample prior to electrophoresis. Indeed, in the absence of proteinase K, the linear product was not detected and was instead converted to a smear due to the presence of covalently-bound denatured SPO11 proteins (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Second, we asked whether the broken DNA ends were protected from degradation by a 5′-3′ exonuclease. While a linear product generated by digestion with EcoRI was degraded in the presence of T5 exonuclease, the SPO11 cleavage products were resistant to exonuclease treatment (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Third, we tested whether phenol-chloroform partitioning leads to the enrichment of covalent protein-DNA adducts in the organic phase. As expected, cleaved DNA was detected in the organic phase in the presence of wild type SPO11, but not the YYFF mutant (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). If the samples were treated with proteinase K before phenol extraction, the cleavage products were absent from the organic phase and were instead found in the aqueous phase.</p><p id="P10">Fourth, we performed cleavage reactions with 5′ or 3′ fluorescently-labeled 80-bp duplex DNA substrates and separated covalent complexes by SDS-PAGE. Fluorescent signal of slightly lower electrophoretic mobility than <sup>MBP</sup>SPO11 was detected with the 3′ labeled substrate, but not the 5′-labeled substrate, and was absent with the YYFF mutant (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Hence, upon cleavage, SPO11 remains covalently bound to the 5′ broken DNA strands, as observed <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cleavage pattern and substrate preferences</title><p id="P11">To establish whether SPO11 produces the expected staggered breaks with 2-nucleotide 5′-overhangs, we performed cleavage reactions with 5′-labeled 80-bp duplexes and separated cleavage products by denaturing gel electrophoresis. We detected sites of preferential cleavage, creating products of 16, 30, 48 and 63 nucleotides on the top strand and 15, 30, 48 and 62 nucleotides on the bottom strand (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The position of the cleavage sites confirms the staggered cleavage pattern of SPO11 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, bottom). Seven out of the eight preferred cleavage sites had a guanosine in position -3 with respect to the dyad axis, suggesting that base composition of the substrate influences SPO11 activity.</p><p id="P12">In mice, the distribution of SPO11-dependent breaks across the genome is largely determined by sequence-specific binding of the H3K4 methyltransferase PRDM9 that defines the position of ∼100-300 bp regions of elevated DSB activity (DSB hotspots)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. However, whether intrinsic substrate preferences of mouse SPO11 contribute to fine-scale selection of cleavage sites within hotspots is unknown.</p><p id="P13">In addition to potential contacts with DNA bases, substrate selection by SPO11 could be influenced by structural features of the double helix, e.g. DNA bending or unwinding. To explore the factors that impact SPO11 target site selection, we digested the products of our standard plasmid cleavage reaction with a restriction endonuclease. Agarose gel analysis revealed a non-random distribution of cleavage sites across the plasmid (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). A single prominent cleavage site mapped within a synthetic sequence cloned within the pUC-derived plasmid, while cleavage was much less efficient within the plasmid backbone. Using a DNA bendability prediction tool, DNAcycP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, we found that the preferential cleavage site corresponded to a peak of predicted DNA bendability (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, bottom right).</p><p id="P14">To test whether DNA bendability impacts SPO11 target site selection, we performed cleavage reactions using a plasmid that contains 24 repeats of the highly bendable Widom 601 sequence, a strong nucleosome binding sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Restriction digestion of SPO11 cleavage reactions produced a strikingly periodic pattern, indicating that the Widom 601 sequences produce hotspots for DNA cleavage (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). To confirm this, we cloned 1, 3 and 6 copies of the Widom 601 sequence into a pUC19 plasmid and used this as PCR template to create linear substrates with a fluorophore at one extremity. Agarose gel analysis of SPO11 cleavage reactions allows us to map cleavage products along the linear substrate, which reveals a correlation between the cleavage sites, the position of Widom 601 sequences, and the predicted bendability of the substrate (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Nevertheless, bendability alone as predicted by DNAcycP is not sufficient to account for the target site preference of SPO11. In addition, we cannot exclude that the Widom 601 sequence produces hotspots because of favorable base-specific contacts with SPO11, irrespective of bendability.</p><p id="P15">Next, we asked whether SPO11 cleavage is affected by the topology of the DNA substrate. Time-course analysis revealed that supercoiled plasmids are cleaved more efficiently than nicked plasmids (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Hence, the cleavage activity of SPO11 is likely affected by a combination of inter-related factors including DNA sequence, bending, and topology.</p><p id="P16">Using AlphaFold3, we modeled the structure of a SPO11 dimer bound to a duplex DNA substrate (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). The model shows SPO11 poised for catalysis, with the active site tyrosine placed 3 Å from the correct phosphate groups to produce a break with 2-nucleotide 5′-overhangs. The substrate is bent with an angle of 100° with underwound DNA strands at the center of the complex, consistent with the observed preference of SPO11 for bendable and negatively supercoiled DNA.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Double-strand DNA cleavage requires two hybrid active sites</title><p id="P17">All type II topoisomerases, including SPO11, are thought to cleave DNA using two composite active sites at the interface between two subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The winged-helix domain of one subunit contributes the catalytic tyrosine, while the Toprim domain of the other subunit contributes metal-ion binding residues (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Most SPO11/Top6A homologs have two tandem tyrosines (Y137 and Y138 in mouse), except yeast that has a phenylalanine in the first position (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>). We confirmed by mutagenesis that Y138 is indeed the catalytic tyrosine in mouse SPO11 (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P19">The cleavage mechanism proposed for topoisomerases involves two metal ions, where metal ion A plays a direct role in catalysis, and metal ion B plays a structural role in stabilizing protein-DNA interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3c</xref>). The hybrid active site modeled by AlphaFold3 places Y138 in proximity to two metal ions, coordinated by residues E224, D277 and D279 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). These residues are highly conserved in Top6A and SPO11 homologs (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>) and correspond to the active site residues previously identified in a crystal structure of <italic>Methanocaldoccus jannaschii</italic> Top6A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. We infer from sequence alignments that residues E224 and D277 coordinate metal ion A and residues D277 and D279 coordinate metal ion B. In yeast, E233 and D288 (equivalent to mouse E224 and D277) are essential for DSB formation, while D290 (equivalent to D279) is not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Consistently, we found that mutating E224 to alanine abolishes the DNA-cleavage activity of mouse SPO11 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, lanes 8-13).</p><p id="P20">To formally establish that cleavage involves hybrid active sites, we performed cleavage reactions using mixtures of two catalytically-inactive mutants, YYFF and E224A. The assembly of heterodimers should restore one functional active site per dimer, causing single-strand DNA breaks. As expected, we found that mixing the two inactive mutants leads to the formation of nicked products (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Hence catalysis requires the concerted action of two SPO11 subunits to assemble hybrid active sites.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Dimerization controls DNA cleavage</title><p id="P21">The mutant protein mixing experiment suggests either that purified SPO11 is monomeric in solution, like the yeast Spo11 core complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> SPO-11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, or that dimers experience rapid subunit exchange. To determine the stoichiometry of SPO11, we subjected 4 µM <sup>MBP</sup>SPO11 purified by amylose affinity to size exclusion chromatography followed by multi angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). <sup>MBP</sup>SPO11 produced a main peak that yielded an experimental molecular mass of 87.25 ± 1.5 kDa, consistent with a monomeric stoichiometry (expected MW: 87.4 kDa). This peak was preceded by a smaller one that may correspond to dimers, although the molecular weight could not be determined. Hence, the dissociation constant of SPO11 dimers is likely higher than 1-5 µM.</p><p id="P22">The predominantly monomeric stoichiometry of purified SPO11 accounts for its low intrinsic activity. Indeed, while SPO11 is active within a broad range of temperatures (optimum between 36°C and 42°C) and pH (6.5-8.5) (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a, b</xref>), cleavage is sensitive to the enzyme and substrate concentrations and requires a large excess of protein. For instance, with 12.5 nM (25 ng/µl) plasmid, no activity was detected under 60 nM SPO11, and 500 nM SPO11 was required to reach full conversion of supercoiled substrate into linear product within two hours (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). When the substrate concentration was decreased, SPO11 cleaved DNA efficiently at concentrations as low as 50 nM, at least 10 to 100× lower than the expected KD (e.g. <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>, lane 2). Hence, cleavage is not limited by the pool of soluble dimers but is instead a function of the protein-to-DNA ratio.</p><p id="P23">We reasoned that SPO11 binding to DNA would in effect increase its local concentration and perhaps allow dimerization directly on the DNA when the substrate occupancy is high enough. This would explain that increasing the DNA concentration inhibits cleavage (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), because reducing plasmid occupancy will reduce the chances of SPO11 dimerization.</p><p id="P24">If monomers meet on the substrate, DNA binding should be much more effective than cleavage. Indeed, gel shift analysis shows that SPO11 binds DNA at concentrations that do not support cleavage (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). Instead, at concentrations that do support cleavage, SPO11 binds so abundantly to the substrate that it provides effective protection against DNase I treatment (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6</xref>). In addition, we found that cleavage is significantly more sensitive to salt than DNA binding (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>), likely because a mild reduction of plasmid occupancy caused by increasing salt concentration strongly reduces the chances of dimerization. Finally, we found that preincubation of plasmid substrates with an excess of inactive SPO11 facilitates cleavage upon addition of low levels of wild-type protein, presumably because decreasing the search space on the substrate increases the rate of dimerization and cleavage (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Overall, these data indicate that SPO11 monomers bind efficiently to DNA and that, above a certain threshold, monomers meet on the substrate, allowing cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>SPO11 can reseal single-strand nicks</title><p id="P26">In conditions where SPO11 mostly cleaves a single DNA strand, for example in reactions that contain a mixture of wild type and YYFF mutant or YYFF and E224A mutants, we observe additional bands that migrate between the position of the supercoiled and nicked products (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a, b</xref>). Phenol-chloroform partitioning shows that these products are not covalently bound to SPO11, indicating that they are plasmid topoisomers (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8c</xref>). Time-course analysis shows that these topoisomers accumulate more slowly than cleavage products (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8b</xref>).</p><p id="P27">The formation of topoisomers implies that SPO11 can sometimes re-ligate broken DNA strands. The most likely scenario is that the topoisomers are caused by the separation of the two monomers when catalysis is stalled at the single-strand break, either accompanied by a dissociation of the inactive subunit from the DNA substrate or not (<xref rid="F14" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8d</xref>). This would result in the swiveling of the DNA around the intact phosphodiester bond. Re-assembly of the dimer interface would then provide an opportunity for reversal of the reaction and liberation of SPO11 from the substrate.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>The SPO11-TOP6BL complex</title><p id="P28">Mouse SPO11 forms a complex with the topoisomerase-derived TOP6BL subunit, which is required for DSB formation <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. In Topo VI, the B subunit coordinates ATP-dependent dimerization of its GHKL domain with DNA cleavage by Top6A to control strand passage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. However, the role of TOP6BL in SPO11-dependent cleavage remains unclear.</p><p id="P29">To gain insight into the SPO11-TOP6BL complex, we used AlphaFold3 to model a 2:2 heterotetramer bound to a 40 bp duplex DNA (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Similar to the SPO11-DNA complex presented above, the model shows SPO11-TOP6BL engaged with a bent DNA substrate, with the active site residues poised for cleavage. The complex showed high structural similarity to Topo VI, with TOP6BL presenting well-defined GHKL and transducer domains (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9</xref>). However, Top6B has a helix two-turn helix (H2TH) motif located between the GHKL and transducer domains and some species have a structured C-terminal extension that are absent in TOP6BL. In addition, the ATP-binding site of Top6B is predicted to be degenerated in TOP6BL, consistent with previously reported models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">To investigate the properties of SPO11-TOP6BL complexes, we purified <sup>MBP</sup>SPO11-<sup>HisFlag</sup>TOP6BL from baculovirus-infected insect cells and analyzed complexes by SEC-MALS (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). This revealed an experimental molecular mass of 150.2 ± 2.2 kDa consistent with a 1:1 complex (expected MW: 157 kDa). Hence, just like SPO11, the cleavage activity of the SPO11-TOP6BL complex is likely to be limited by protein dimerization.</p><p id="P31">As anticipated, a plasmid cleavage assay revealed similar activities between SPO11 and SPO11-TOP6BL complexes, although this was context dependent. For instance, in our standard cleavage assay, at low protein concentrations, the SPO11-TOP6BL complex was slightly more active than SPO11 alone (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, lanes 2 and 4). However, in the presence of 0.01% NP40, the cleavage activity of SPO11 was strongly stimulated, while that of the SPO11-TOP6BL complex was not (lanes 6 and 8). We conclude that physicochemical parameters of the reaction impact differently the cleavage activity of SPO11 and SPO11-TOP6BL complexes, perhaps due to effects of TOP6BL on DNA binding. Indeed, purified mouse TOP6BL was recently shown to bind DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. In addition, the B subunit of Topo VI directly contacts DNA to coordinate substrate binding with ATP-dependent dimerization and catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P32">We previously showed that purified yeast Spo11 complexes, despite being catalytically inactive, bind with high affinity to DSBs through non-covalent interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. To investigate the end-binding activity of the mouse homologs, we performed gel shift analyses using a short hairpin substrate with a 2-nucleotide 5′-overhang at one extremity, which the yeast complex binds to with sub-nanomolar affinity. We found that the SPO11-TOP6BL complex binds efficiently to this substrate, while SPO11 alone does not (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). This confirms that TOP6BL affects the DNA-binding properties of SPO11 and supports a model where tight end-binding by SPO11-TOP6BL could impact DSB processing, as we previously proposed for the yeast complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P33">Here, we reconstituted the formation of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks <italic>in vitro</italic> using <italic>Mus musculus</italic> SPO11.

In addition, we show that SPO11 cleavage site selection is driven by a mild sequence bias and may reflect in part a preference for bendable and underwound DNA, and found that SPO11 is able to reseal a broken strand when stuck in a single-strand nicked intermediate.

In addition, we previously showed that the yeast orthologs of REC114, MEI4, IHO1 (Rec114, Mei4 and Mer2) assemble DNA-dependent condensates <italic>in vitro</italic> that recruit the yeast Spo11 core complex (Spo11, Ski8, Rec102, Rec104)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Despite extreme sequence divergence, the structure of these proteins is widely conserved across eukaryotes, although their DNA-binding and condensation activities appear to vary quantitatively between organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P37">Based on these insights, we propose that the mouse RMMI proteins control SPO11 cleavage by assembling biomolecular condensates within which SPO11-TOP6BL is recruited (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Recruitment of SPO11-TOP6BL complexes likely involves the interaction between a TOP6BL C-terminal α-helix that binds the pleckstrin homology (PH) fold of REC114<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Partitioning of SPO11-TOP6BL complexes within these condensates would allow them to reach a critical threshold required for dimerization and DSB formation.</p><p id="P38">In yeast and mice, SPO11 frequently catalyzes multiple closely-spaced DSBs, in particular in the absence of the DNA-damage response kinase Tel1/ATM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, which is consistent with local accumulation of SPO11 within condensates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The distance between these coincident breaks ranges from about 30 nt to several kb, and the more closely-spaced events show a 10-bp periodicity, indicative of co-orientation of SPO11 dimers on the DNA substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that, in addition to increasing the local concentration of SPO11, condensates function to co-orient SPO11 proteins to facilitate productive dimerization on the DNA substrate (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Substrate site selection</title><p id="P39">In mice, the distribution of meiotic DSBs across the genome is primarily dictated by the H3K4 methyltransferase PRDM9 that binds specific sequence motifs through a fast-evolving zinc-finger array<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Here, we show that <italic>in vitro</italic> the cleavage of SPO11 is directly impacted by a combination of a mild sequence bias (preference for a G three nucleotides 5′ of the dyad axis) and probably a preference for bendable and/or underwound DNA. These factors are likely to influence the fine-scale selection of target sites within DSB hotspots and may lead to preferential induction of DSBs at sites that are under topological stress.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Cleavage reversal and the dimer interface</title><p id="P40">We have shown that reaction conditions that accumulate single-strand cleavage products tend to generate covalently closed topoisomers, thereby revealing the ability of SPO11 to re-ligate a broken DNA strand. Partial relaxation of the plasmid before religation presumably requires the separation of the dimer interface, accompanied or not by the dissociation of the monomer that was not covalently bound to the broken strand. The swiveling of the DNA duplex around the intact strand that ensues is therefore a direct consequence of the weak dimer interface between SPO11 subunits. This is consistent with the monomeric state of the free protein and our model that dimerization controls DNA cleavage.</p><p id="P41">Given the weak dimer interface and the slow rate of the religation activity, we do not envision that SPO11 frequently reseals DSBs <italic>in vivo</italic>. Instead, DSB formation will most likely lead to rapid collapse of the dimer interface and separation of the two DNA ends. The ends may however remain in proximity through anchoring of SPO11-TOP6BL to RMMI condensates and loading of MRN complexes and their end-tethering activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S15"><title>Preparation of expression vectors</title><p id="P42">Plasmids are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.
