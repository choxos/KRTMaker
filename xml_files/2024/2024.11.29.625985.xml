By combining unbiased <italic>Polylox</italic> barcoding with computational inference, we comprehensively mapped tissue macrophage ontogeny in mice from gastrulation to adult organs. Our data reveal a lineage tree of all tissue macrophages. This tree originates from a pan-hematopoietic progenitor at embryonic day (E)6.5 and branches, via oligolineage progenitors (E7.5-E9.5), into organ-specific macrophage lineages by E10.5. Barcode analysis in embryonic tissues and adult organ fragments suggests that local macrophage colonies, formed by organ-specific progenitors, persist into adulthood. Indeed, spatial fate mapping with <italic>Polytope</italic> barcoding detects local Kupffer cell colonies of the size predicted by the lineage tree model. Our findings uncover the origin of tissue-resident macrophages from a lineage tree, and show how holistic barcoding can comprehensively map complex cellular lineage specification.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Tissue-specific macrophages are key components of tissue development and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Their ontogeny has been intensively investigated by fate mapping in mice, yet no consensus has emerged. On the one hand, an early-arising (at E8.5) erythro-myeloid progenitor (EMP) has been suggested as a common source of all tissue macrophage populations in the adult mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). On the other hand, distinct developmental waves of macrophage development have been invoked. In particular, it has been proposed that an early EMP generates the first wave that gives rise to microglia in the adult, whereas other adult tissue macrophages develop later, at about E13.5, via monocytes in the fetal liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Another model posits that most tissue-resident macrophages, except microglia, are derived from fetal hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Collectively, these data raise the fundamental question whether different kinds of tissue macrophages are generated by independent progenitors arising in distinct developmental stages or whether there is a single lineage tree of macrophage diversification deriving from a common macrophage progenitor.</p><p id="P3">Fate-mapping studies on macrophage ontogeny have used a wide range of gene loci to mark different progenitors via constitutive or inducible expression of Cre recombinase (including <italic>Csf1r</italic>, <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>, <italic>Kit</italic>, <italic>Runx1</italic>, <italic>Tie2</italic>, <italic>Tnfrsf11a</italic>, <italic>S100a4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). While providing physiological precursor-product relations, specific Cre drivers may be limited in their information, as it is difficult to ascertain whether and to what extent their expression covers in full the relevant progenitors at the appropriate developmental stages. Hence, contradictory results on the development of tissue macrophages could, at least in part, have resulted from different Cre drivers used. To address this major problem, we developed a holistic and quantitative approach for mapping cell ontogeny over developmental time.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Resolving macrophage origin with unbiased progenitor barcoding</title><p id="P4">To map macrophage ontogeny, we non-invasively barcoded cells in the entire embryo at successive developmental stages and analyzed barcodes in mature tissue-resident macrophages and hematopoietic lineages. First, we induced <italic>Polylox</italic> DNA barcodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>) at E6.5 in the embryo by applying 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A</xref>) to pregnant mice carrying <italic>Rosa<sup>Polylox/CreERT2</sup></italic> embryos, which acts for ~1 day to generate barcodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Barcodes were analyzed in adult mice in macrophage populations from the brain (microglia, M), liver (Kupffer cells, K), spleen (red pulp macrophages, R), lung (alveolar macrophages, A), kidney, and the peritoneum. Additionally, barcodes were examined in adult hematopoietic lineages (hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (H), granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2, S3</xref>). Barcoding was comprehensive and uniform across cell populations, with &gt;60% and &gt;95% of <italic>Polylox</italic> reads in the two analyzed mice corresponding to recombined barcodes (i.e., <italic>Polylox</italic> loci with at least one Cre-mediated recombination event) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Hence, most progenitors that gave rise to the analyzed mature populations had been barcoded in the embryo.</p><p id="P5">To focus on barcodes generated only in single progenitors (we refer to this as clonal barcodes because progeny from a barcoded progenitor constitute a clone, and all cells in this clone bear the same unique barcode), we filtered barcodes for low generation probability (<italic>Pgen</italic>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). <italic>P<sub>gen</sub></italic> cutoffs were adjusted for each induction timepoint to account for increasing growth, i.e. cell numbers, during embryonic development (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S14">Materials and Methods: Post-sequence processing</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). At E6.5, we identified 555 clonal barcodes out of 598 total barcodes (92.8%) after <italic>P<sub>gen</sub></italic> filtering in two mice across all sorted populations. Hence, we traced the fate of 555 single progenitors barcoded at E6.5, which gave rise to all analyzed tissue macrophages and hematopoietic lineages in the adult mouse.</p><p id="P6">In general, a high degree of barcode sharing between different cell types indicates a common progenitor, while barcodes unique for a single cell type identify independent origins. At E6.5, the by far most abundant barcode patterns were clonal barcodes that were shared across multiple cell populations, implying common, multi-lineage progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). We found that the vast majority of barcodes were reliably detected in sample repeats of the same population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>), hence barcodes were not undersampled. To quantify the lineage contributions of progenitors barcoded at E6.5, we focused on the most-studied macrophage lineages, i.e. microglia, Kupffer cells, alveolar macrophages, and red pulp macrophages, as well as on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (including Lin<sup>–</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>Kit<sup>+</sup> cells, common myeloid progenitors, granulocyte-monocyte progenitors and megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors). Using barcode read counts as proxy, we quantified the total contributions of distinct barcoded progenitors to adult populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The majority (&gt;80%) of hematopoietic progenitors (H), microglia (M), Kupffer cells (K), alveolar macrophages (A) and red pulp macrophages (R) originated from a common multi-lineage progenitor (HMKAR) in E6.5 barcoded mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In contrast, at this stage in development, fate-restricted progenitors, including those lacking microglia (HKAR progenitors), or generating microglia plus Kupffer cells (MK progenitors) made only minor contributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In brief, common progenitors for all tissue macrophages and definitive hematopoiesis dominate during gastrulation (E6.5-E7.5).</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Lineage specification of tissue macrophages at the onset of organogenesis</title><p id="P7">Next, we asked when hematopoietic and tissue macrophage lineages diverge from one another in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). To this end, we systematically introduced barcodes on consecutive days E7.5, E8.5, E9.5, or E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). From adult mice, barcoded as embryos, macrophages and mature hematopoietic lineages were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, F, H, J</xref>), and the barcode-based contributions of distinct progenitor fates were quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E, G, I, K</xref>). Progenitor barcoding was comprehensive with on average 75% (± 22%) of cells having a recombined <italic>Polylox</italic> barcode (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1B</xref>). Numbers of total clonal barcodes ranged between 348 and 1844 in the two mice for each timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, F, H, J</xref>). Barcode patterns and progenitor contributions were highly similar in each of the two barcoded mice analyzed for each induction timepoint, which demonstrates, next to robustness of the barcoding, temporal precision and consistent fate patterns underlying tissue macrophage developmental (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1E</xref>). Our experiments thus assessed the fates of several hundred progenitors per mouse in each time window.</p><p id="P8">The observed fate pattern and their eventual contributions to the different adult compartments depend entirely on the day of labeling as a ‘viewpoint’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-K</xref>). While a common progenitor for all lineages prevailed on E6.5, subsequently, fate restrictions emerged. In particular, after E7.5 there was a sudden appearance of oligo- and unilineage fates. Prominent fate-restricted progenitors included a joint microglia and Kupffer cell (MK) progenitor. These bilineage progenitors contributed substantially more to adult microglia than to Kupffer cells. After E7.5, a common progenitor for Kupffer cells, alveolar macrophages, and red pulp macrophages (KAR) emerged. This KAR progenitor substantially contributed to these lineages at E8.5 and gradually diminished by E10.5. With developmental progression, a trace of macrophage potential was retained in progenitors for hematopoietic cells until E9.5 (e.g. HKAR, HKR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G, I</xref>). Together, our data indicate a sequential fate restriction process, beginning with a multipotent progenitor at E6.5 and culminating in the emergence of unilineage progenitors independently generating hematopoietic progenitors, microglia, Kupffer cells, alveolar macrophages, and red pulp macrophages by E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1K</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Tissue-restricted residency of macrophages in fetal development</title><p id="P9">To trace macrophages after E10.5, and thus during fetal development, we induced barcodes on E10.5 and analyzed fetuses on E12.5, E13.5, and E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4, S5</xref>). Therefore, we isolated F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages from the fetal liver, and from cranial, trunk, and tail fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4, S5</xref>). Macrophages from the liver and from these fragments showed predominantly unique sets of barcodes with minimal overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A, B</xref>), and, accordingly, low correlations with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C, D</xref>). Further linkage and read-based contribution analysis revealed stable uni-tissue barcoding for all examined compartments between E10.5 and E14.5, suggesting that most macrophages were labelled <italic>in situ</italic>, and were tissue-resident already in the fetus (see liver, cranial, trunk and tail fragment samples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). In contrast to macrophages, monocyte barcodes showed a high degree of linkage between monocytes from different tissues (see monocytes from the fetal liver, and cranial, trunk and tail fragments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C, D</xref>). Comparison of barcodes between fetal monocytes and macrophages revealed on average only 18% clonal barcode overlap and 25% read-based sharing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5E, F</xref>). This barcode sharing may reflect a common origin of these cells after E10.5, or monocyte-derived macrophages. In any case, the majority of tissue macrophages were not fetal monocyte-derived, rather both were independent lineages. Further macrophage progenitor candidates, CD45<sup>+</sup>Kit<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>-</sup> progenitors with or without Csf1r expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), also lacked linkage to tissue macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C, D</xref>), excluding a major role for these progenitors in macrophage generation after E10.5.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Inference of clonal differentiation pathways and dynamics</title><p id="P10">The distinct fates and contributions of progenitors to macrophage compartments across successive timepoints of embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-K</xref>) suggest a reproducible, yet complex differentiation landscape. Using modeling based on our barcoding data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-K</xref>), we define differentiation pathways from individual common macrophage (MKAR) progenitors by the lineage restriction events that occur in the expanding progeny of this progenitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>). Principally, the several thousands of clones we measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B-K</xref>) might develop according to one canonical differentiation pathway, or alternatively, macrophage progenitors could use several distinct lineage pathways.</p><p id="P11">Robust fate calling is a key condition for the classification of progenitor fates, and this is sensitive to progenitor sampling (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Materials and Methods: Mathematical modeling and inference</xref>). For example, fate combinations such as AR, KR, and KA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1G, I, K</xref>) could correspond to clones originating from three distinct bilineage progenitors; alternatively, they could be incompletely sampled clones, with additional fates overlooked (e.g. a trilineage KAR progenitor). Hence, we controlled for sampling effects experimentally by repeat samples from every macrophage population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D, Fig. S6B</xref>). Moreover, in the case of the liver, we determined the absolute number of Kupffer cells, and the size of the samples drawn. We counted Kupffer cells in tissue sections of adult livers by immunofluorescent staining, microscopy, and image analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A-D</xref>), estimating a total of 1.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> Kupffer cells. Hence, we analyzed 1.2% of the total adult Kupffer cell population for barcodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7E</xref>) which allows for robust barcode analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8A</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To infer differentiation pathways from the experimental data, we devised a computational framework for simulating individual progenitor clones as they undergo proliferation and lineage restriction, factoring in experimental sampling to compare the <italic>in silico</italic> data with the experimental data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>). To visualize the principle, comparing information from early and late barcoding yields Δ<sub><italic>t</italic>xy</sub>, the time at which a multilineage progenitor (X plus Y) gives rise to restricted (X or Y) progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6A</xref>). To fit the experimental data in an unbiased manner, we enumerated the differentiation pathways that could emerge from multi-fate MKAR progenitors, yielding 86 theoretically possible pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). We then used Bayesian inference to fit the measured data of a total of 2444 individual clones (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S16">Materials and Methods: Mathematical modeling and inference</xref>). The best model closely reproduced the experimentally observed, time-resolved barcode data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6C</xref>). This model gave preference to a small number of related developmental pathways for the MKAR progenitor and fitted clonal expansion rates, thus making experimentally testable predictions.</p><p id="P13">Specifically, the model inferred the temporal succession of lineage-restricted progenitors, showing that only a small number of the theoretically possible fate combinations in progenitors are supported by the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8B</xref>). Indeed, three tree models accounted together for 80% of the clones emanating from the MKAR progenitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8B</xref>). Accordingly, from MKAR progenitors, unilineage microglia (M) progenitors, bilineage microglia-Kupffer cell progenitors (MK) and trilineage progenitors for Kupffer cells, alveolar macrophages and red pulp macrophages (KAR) developed between E6.5 and E8.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8C-E</xref>). To highlight one of these findings, the predominant bilineage MK progenitor pathway derived by the models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8D</xref>) has not been reported previously and is clearly evident also in the barcoding data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E, G, I, K</xref>). After E8.5, the KAR progenitor gave rise directly to unilineage progenitors for Kupffer cells, alveolar macrophages or red pulp macrophages, or a bilineage KA progenitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C, D</xref>). All other trilineage or bilineage progenitor populations were of negligible size, and, consistent with their paucity in the data, the model explains their occurrence by stochastic dropouts of mature fates in small clones. We also took a mature-cell perspective and quantified which progenitors, over time, contributed to what extent to a specific mature macrophage population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E-H</xref>). In sum, our data and the modeling show a canonical differentiation pathway to tissue macrophages, composed of few, closely related tree structures.</p><p id="P14">The precise fraction for Kupffer cell sampling allowed us to infer the numbers of precursors that contribute to Kupffer cells as a function of time, increasing from ~200 common macrophage progenitors at E6.5 to ~70,000 Kupffer cell precursors by day 10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>), when they could also be considered as premacrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). The model further inferred that early progenitors (up to ~E8.5) cycle about two to three times as rapidly as late progenitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9A, B</xref>). Unilineage Kupffer cell progenitors after E10.5 still undergo on average eight rounds of proliferative expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3I</xref>, expansion from ~70,000 to 1.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> adult Kupffer cells, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9A</xref>). On this basis, the model predicts Kupffer cell clone sizes in the adult liver as a function of barcoding timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Epitope barcoding with <italic>Polytope</italic> resolves spatial dynamics of Kupffer cell progenitor clones</title><p id="P15">To test Kupffer cell clone sizes experimentally, we employed a newly developed spatial fate-mapping system, called <italic>Polytope</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). The <italic>Polytope</italic> knockin locus (<italic>Rosa26<sup>Polytope</sup></italic>) consists of nine distinct epitope tag cassettes flanked by loxP sites, allowing for random excision of cassettes upon Cre recombinase activity which is based on the principles of the <italic>Polylox</italic> system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). The construct is expressed as an H2B fusion protein in the nucleus and epitope tags are detected by fluorescent immunostaining and multiplexed imaging. <italic>Polytope</italic> barcoding can generate up to 512 unique color codes, resolving spatial dynamics and sizes of clones in tissues.</p><p id="P16">We ubiquitously induced color codes in <italic>Rosa26<sup>Polytope/ERT2</sup></italic> embryos at E10.5, and analyzed liver cryosections at six weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10A</xref>). Kupffer cell clones were locally restricted (examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). We measured the distance of each color-coded Kupffer cell to others of the same color code in two-dimensional sections, drawing concentric rings and counting the cells of the same color code (i.e., clone) within each ring (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10B</xref>). We compared these measurements to randomly distributed color codes, using one hundred Monte Carlo-simulated datasets to assess whether the observed clustering was due to chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). The measured data showed substantial enrichment of neighbor cells belonging to the same clone within 200 μm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Clone density decreased with distance but only approached random distribution at a 1000 μm radius, indicating that clones can span up to 800 μm (with most clones being 200-400 μm in size). We counted on average ~400 cells per Kupffer cell clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10C</xref>), consistent with the model prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4F</xref>). Using <italic>Polytope</italic> for spatial fate mapping, we hence arrived at a similar order of magnitude compared to the model-based calculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E, F</xref>). In conclusion, epitope barcoding demonstrates the presence of Kupffer cell colony forming cells on E10.5, which expand locally, generating clones in the order of a few hundred cells in the adult liver.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Spatial segregation of embryonic macrophage progenitors by E10.5</title><p id="P17">To test whether tissue locality is a general principle of early tissue macrophage development, we addressed this possibility by <italic>Polylox</italic> barcoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). For barcode induction we chose one timepoint for shared barcodes (common progenitor at E7.5,see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, E</xref>), and one for unlinked barcodes (unilineage fates at E10.5, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J, K</xref>) between tissue macrophages. We analyzed adult mice by harvesting anatomically separated organ parts, including brain hemispheres, liver lobes, left and right lung, spleen halves, and left and right kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). In addition, we collected sample repeats from each tissue sample, except for the brain where we had one sample per hemisphere. As expected, after E7.5 induction, different samples from the same organ shared barcodes abundantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B, C</xref>). In contrast, most barcodes were unique for organ fragments after E10.5 barcoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B, C</xref>). To test whether the differences observed in E10.5 barcoded mice between organ fragments were ‘true’ or reflected incomplete sampling, we analyzed the sample repeats from the same organ fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11A</xref>). Indeed, these repeats showed substantially higher barcode sharing to each other than samples from different fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11B, C</xref>). Collectively, these data are consistent with a common macrophage progenitor on E7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>), tissue seeding by E10.5, followed by local expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1J, K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Consequently, once tissues are colonized, macrophages remain locally confined in their tissues.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P18">Using holistic barcoding, we aimed at resolving the entire landscape of tissue macrophage development in the mouse. While their embryonic origin has been proven, the pathways leading to tissue macrophages in different organs remained controversial despite considerable experimental efforts. Barcoding across all developmental stages from gastrulation to organogenesis, and <italic>a priori</italic> independent of cell types or stages, now offers a powerful approach to comprehensively resolve pathways of macrophage development. Despite the fact that the initial progenitors are no longer present at the time of analysis, barcodes are retrospectively informative. In combination with mathematical modeling, we quantitatively and temporally mapped developmental trajectories of tissue macrophages between E6.5 and E10.5, and beyond. Barcode analysis revealed initially shared fates, followed by an array of fate combinations, and subsequently fate restrictions beginning on E8.5. Regarding microglia, our data are in line with their early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), however, in this pathway, we also find a novel progenitor with shared fate for Kupffer cells. The bulk of the other organ-specific macrophages have been proposed to be derived via fetal monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Barcoding on E10.5, followed by analysis in fetuses between E12.5 and E14.5, revealed a clear developmental separation between tissue macrophages, fetal monocytes, and Kit<sup>+</sup> progenitors. The infrequent barcode sharing between tissue macrophages and fetal monocytes may reflect a precursor-product relationship for few tissue macrophages, yet it may also result from a common origin of tissue macrophages and fetal liver monocytes. In any case, our data do not support the notion that fetal monocytes are the primary source of tissue macrophages. In addition to the lineage independence of macrophages and monocytes, the observed and modeled tree of macrophage development concludes its progression by E10.5, hence several days prior to the emergence of fetal monocytes. Barcode analysis in four regions of the fetus, and in fragments from adult organs demonstrates very early tissue residency and maintenance of a rather stationary life of tissue macrophages. Hence, neither in fetal nor adult mice appear tissue macrophages to migrate between organs or even within one organ. The measured fate patterns were highly reproducible between mice, suggesting intrinsic, tightly controlled developmental programs. This landscape provides a quantitative framework for investigations into the molecular determinants regulating fate decisions.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Mice</title><p id="P19">Homozygous <italic>Rosa26<sup>Polylox</sup></italic> (<italic>B6-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1(Polylox:,Hrr</sup></italic>) and <italic>Rosa<sup>Polytope</sup></italic> (<italic>B6N-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup><italic>tm1(H2B-Polytope3.0)Jvr</italic></sup></italic>) were crossed to homozygous <italic>Rosa26<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> (<italic>B6.129-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1(cre/ESR1)Tyj/J)</sup></italic>) mice to generate <italic>Rosa26<sup>Polylo/CreERT2</sup></italic> mice and <italic>Rosa26<sup>Polytope/CreERT2</sup></italic> mice, respectively.

The differentiation events are modeled as distributing the progenitor cells, at differentiation time <italic>t</italic>’ into two or more lineage-restricted progenitor populations. Once distributed, the clones in each progenitor population expand until the next differentiation event. This process is repeated until all unilineage macrophage progenitors are specified. The expansion of clones between lineage restriction events was modeled as a pure birth process by drawing clone sizes from a shifted negative binomial distribution with mean <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> exp(<italic>λ</italic>Δ<italic>t</italic>) on integer support {<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> + 1, <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> + 2, …}. This is much more time-efficient than stochastic simulation. The fate restriction events, that distribute the cells from the current progenitor population (e.g., with fate AB) through a split into the two subsequent populations (e.g., with fates A and B, respectively), were realized as a binary sampling event for each progenitor cell with defined split probabilities (e.g., <italic>p<sub>A</sub></italic> and 1 – <italic>p<sub>A</sub></italic>, leading to a binomial distribution). Triple and quadruple lineage splits were realized as immediate successive binary splits. Given a certain lineage topology, this process of division phases followed by lineage splits was repeated until the final clone sizes, before experimental sampling, of all terminal populations were obtained. For topologies that have different progenitor routes leading to the same terminal population, the routes were simulated separately with the same iterative procedure, and the clones of a fate with multiple input routes were merged after the last division phase before the experimental capture (as the pure birth process is a branching process of statistically independent clonal expansions, the exact time of merging in the final phase is irrelevant). To compare simulations with experimental data, we drew sample repeats for each population. For this, the terminal clone sizes were subjected to multinomial sampling into three categories for sample repeat 1, sample repeat 2 and a third category for not- sampled / lost cells, with associated sampling probabilities <italic>p</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>p</italic><sub>2</sub> (1 – <italic>q</italic><sub>loss</sub>)/2 (symmetric sample repeats) and p<sub>3</sub> = <italic>q</italic><sub>loss</sub>.

A progenitor population without barcodes was simulated until the induction time (<italic>t</italic><sub>ind</sub>) of the given experiment.

The simulation was completed by iterating the remaining phases of divisions and lineage restriction, and tracking barcode identities. If multiple progenitor populations existed during the time of barcode induction, the barcodes were introduced with uniform probability in all the existent cells across the populations.
