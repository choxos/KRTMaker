This study investigates the role of Aff3ir-ORF2, a novel nested gene variant, in disturbed flow-induced endothelial cell activation and atherosclerosis. We demonstrate that disturbed shear stress significantly reduces Aff3ir-ORF2 expression in athero-prone regions. Using three distinct mouse models with manipulated AFF3ir-ORF2 expression, we demonstrate that AFF3ir-ORF2 exerts potent anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. RNA sequencing revealed that interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), a key regulator of inflammatory processes, mediates inflammatory responses associated with AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency. AFF3ir-ORF2 interacts with IRF5, promoting its retention in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting the IRF5-dependent inflammatory pathways. Notably, IRF5 knockdown in AFF3ir-ORF2 deficient mice almost completely rescues the aggravated atherosclerotic phenotype. Moreover, endothelial-specific AFF3ir-ORF2 supplementation using the CRISPR/Cas9 system significantly ameliorated endothelial activation and atherosclerosis. These findings elucidate a novel role for AFF3ir-ORF2 in mitigating endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis by acting as an inhibitor of IRF5, highlighting its potential as a valuable therapeutic approach for treating atherosclerosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Shear stress</kwd><kwd>Atherosclerosis</kwd><kwd>Nested gene</kwd><kwd>IRF5</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Atherosclerosis, characterized by the formation of fibrofatty lesions in the arterial wall, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, contributing to most myocardial infarctions and many strokes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Herrington, Lacey, Sherliker, Armitage, &amp; Lewington, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Libby et al., 2019</xref>). The activation of vascular endothelial cells (ECs), induced by various chemical and mechanical stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide and shear stress, is an initial step in the development of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Davignon &amp; Ganz, 2004</xref>). Consequently, atherosclerotic lesions preferentially develop at the branches and curvatures of the arterial tree, where blood flow is disturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Davis, Earley, Li, &amp; Chien, 2023</xref>). For decades, researchers have been interested in exploring the mechanisms underlying mechanotransduction during endothelial activation caused by disturbed flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Davis et al., 2023</xref>). Several mechanosensitive proteins, such as YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">B. Li et al., 2019</xref>), Annexin A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), BMP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Sorescu et al., 2004</xref>), and NAD(P)H oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hwang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Jo, Song, &amp; Mowbray, 2006</xref>), have been identified as key regulators of disturbed shear stress in ECs and have been implicated in the progression of atherosclerosis. Emerging evidence has revealed that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of endothelial YAP activation ameliorates the progression of atherosclerotic plaques in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">B.

However, the precise mechanisms by which the disturbed flow exerts detrimental effects remain unclear.</p><p id="P3">The interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors, comprising nine members (IRF1-IRF9) in mammals, is primarily characterized by its role in mediating antiviral responses and type I interferon production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sato, Taniguchi, &amp; Tanaka, 2001</xref>). Although these members share a conserved DNA-binding domain in their N-terminal region that recognizes similar DNA sequences, IRF5 plays a central role in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Almuttaqi &amp; Udalova, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Takaoka et al., 2005</xref>). IRF5 mediates the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-12b and IL-23a, and promotes the expression of inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Cai, Yao, &amp; Li, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Saliba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Weiss, Blazek, Byrne, Perocheau, &amp; Udalova, 2013</xref>). It promotes inflammatory responses in various immune cells, including macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Seneviratne et al., 2017</xref>), neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>), and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Savitsky, Yanai, Tamura, Taniguchi, &amp; Honda, 2010</xref>). Global or myeloid-specific knockouts of IRF5 have been shown to exert anti-atherosclerotic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Leipner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Seneviratne et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the established importance of IRF5 in immune cells, its restrictively regulatory mechanism and role in shear stress-induced endothelial activation remain unknown.</p><p id="P4">We recently reported that a novel protein-coding nested gene, <italic>Aff3ir</italic>, contributes to endothelial maintenance by promoting the differentiation of vascular stem/progenitor cells (SPCs) into ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zhao Y et al., 2024</xref>). AFF3ir-ORF2, encoded by the <italic>Aff3ir</italic> transcript variant 2, is predominantly expressed in the EC layer of the mouse aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zhao Y et al., 2024</xref>). Notably, our recent study indicated that the overexpression of AFF3ir-ORF2 could enhance laminar flow-induced mRNA levels of essential EC markers in SPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zhao Y et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that AFF3ir-ORF2 may be a novel mechanotransduction protein in ECs. However, the regulation of Aff3ir-ORF2 under disturbed flow and its role in atherosclerosis remain unclear.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which disturbed blood flow induces endothelial activation and atherosclerosis. Our study showed that disrupted Aff3ir-ORF2 expression in athero-prone regions led to inflammatory responses and development of atherosclerosis. Aff3ir-ORF2, the expression of which is reduced by disturbed shear stress, exerts critical anti-inflammatory effects by binding to IRF5 and mitigating disturbed shear stress-induced IRF5 activation. Additionally, we demonstrated that endothelial-specific supplementation with Aff3ir-ORF2 significantly ameliorated disturbed flow-induced endothelial activation and the development of atherosclerotic plaques, highlighting its promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Disturbed shear stress reduces the expression of AFF3ir-ORF2</title><p id="P6">Our recent study showed the active participation of <italic>Aff3ir</italic> in EC differentiation from vascular SPCs induced by laminar shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zhao Y et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting the potential involvement of this novel protein-encoding nested gene in mediating hemodynamic stimulation. To further elucidate the functional role of <italic>Aff3ir</italic> and its encoded proteins in disturbed shear stress-induced EC activation, we examined the expression of <italic>AFF3</italic> and <italic>AFF3ir</italic> in the intima of mouse aorta. We found that the mRNA level of <italic>AFF3ir</italic>, but not its parent gene <italic>AFF3</italic>, was significantly lower in the intima of the aortic arch, an area exposed to disturbed shear stress, compared to the intima of the thoracic aorta, which was exposed to steady unidirectional shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">B. Li et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>Aff3ir</italic> transcript variants can generate two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zhao Y et al., 2024</xref>), therefore, we measured the protein levels of AFF3ir-ORF1 and AFF3ir-ORF2. While AFF3ir-ORF1 and AFF3 showed comparable expression levels in the intima of aortic arch and thoracic aorta of mice, the expression of AFF3ir-ORF2 showed an 87% reduction in the intima of aortic arch compared to the intima of thoracic aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B, C</xref>), suggesting that AFF3ir-ORF2 may be a novel mechanosensitive protein that responds to disturbed shear stress. Enface immunofluorescence staining confirmed a marked reduction in AFF3ir-ORF2 expression in the inner curvature of aortic arch compared to both the outer curvature of aortic arch and the thoracic aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). Moreover, to demonstrate the change in AFF3ir-ORF2 within the same visual field, we examined its expression in longitudinal sections of the mouse aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">B. Li et al., 2019</xref>). We found that the expression of AFF3ir-ORF2, but not AFF3, was notably downregulated in athero-prone regions (the inner curvature of the aortic arch and bifurcation of the carotid artery) compared to that in the protective region in the outer curvature of the aortic arch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Additionally, we found that the expression of AFF3, AFF3ir-ORF1, and AFF3ir-ORF2 in the media and adventitia was comparable between the aortic arch and the thoracic aorta (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A, B</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Next, we explored the impact of disturbed shear stress on AFF3ir-ORF2 expression <italic>in vitro</italic>. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit responses consistent with those of ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wen et al., 2013</xref>), therefore, we investigated AFF3ir-ORF2 expression in MEFs from WT mice exposed to static or disturbed flow (0.5 ± 4 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1 Hz). Consistent with our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings, while disturbed shear stress increased the expression of VCAM-1, a critical inflammatory marker of ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Nakashima, Raines, Plump, Breslow, &amp; Ross, 1998</xref>), it significantly reduced both the protein and mRNA levels of AFF3ir-ORF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). The expression of AFF3 in response to the disturbed flow was minimally affected at both the mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). These results collectively demonstrate that disturbed shear stress induces a reduction in AFF3ir-ORF2 expression both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>AFF3ir-ORF2 ameliorates disturbed shear stress-induced inflammation and atherosclerosis</title><p id="P8">Disturbed shear stress-induced atherogenic responses are initial events in atherosclerotic plaque formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Davis et al., 2023</xref>). To elucidate the regulatory role of AFF3ir-ORF2 in disturbed shear stress-induced inflammation, we overexpressed AFF3ir-ORF2 in MEFs. AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression attenuated ICAM-1 expression induced by disturbed shear stress at both the protein and mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>). To further validate our findings in ECs, we overexpressed AFF3ir-ORF2 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Consistent with our previous results, AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression reduced the protein level of ICAM-1 induced by disturbed shear stress in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C-D</xref>). Moreover, AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression attenuated disturbed shear stress-induced expression of several inflammatory genes, including VCAM-1, IL-6, and IL-1β, in both MEFs and ECs. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A-B</xref>). Interestingly, we found that AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression did not affect the basal expression of these inflammatory genes under ST conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A-B</xref>), likely due to the relatively low levels of inflammatory gene expression under ST compared to OSS conditions. Furthermore, we measured the concentrations of inflammatory factors, including IL-6 and IL-1β, in the culture medium of MEFs. As expected, while AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression had little effect on the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-1β under ST condition, it significantly reduced their release induced by disturbed shear stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Given the anti-inflammatory effects of AFF3ir-ORF2, we speculated that it may ameliorate disturbed shear stress-induced inflammation and atherosclerosis <italic>in vivo</italic>. ApoE knockout (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>) mice were subjected to partial ligation surgery to induce disturbed flow in the left carotid arteries (LCAs). The endothelium of the LCAs was intravascularly infected with adenovirus (Ad-Scramble or Ad-AFF3ir-ORF2) prior to surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Nam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Enface immunofluorescence staining confirmed the successful AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression in the left carotid artery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C-D</xref>). Mice infected with Ad-AFF3ir-ORF2 exhibited a significant decrease in lesion area in the LCAs compared to those infected with Ad-Scramble (23±17% vs 63±14%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F-H</xref>), with no obvious plaque formation observed in the right carotid arteries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). Overexpression of AFF3ir-ORF2 also attenuated disturbed flow-induced inflammatory responses, as evidenced by decreased VCAM-1 expression in the endothelium of LCAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I-J</xref>). These findings suggested that AFF3ir-ORF2 ameliorates shear stress-induced inflammation and atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency aggravates inflammation and atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice</title><p id="P10">To explore the effects of AFF3ir-ORF2 on inflammation and atherosclerosis, we generated AFF3ir-ORF2 global knockout (AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Genotyping PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>) and western blot analysis of AFF3ir-ORF2 expression in mouse aortas (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B-C</xref>) confirmed the successful knockout. No obvious phenotypic abnormalities were observed in AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice up to 20 weeks of age and monitoring was discontinued thereafter. Additionally, AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency did not alter systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or mean arterial pressure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D</xref>), suggesting that AFF3ir-ORF2 is dispensable for physiological blood pressure maintenance. We then isolated MEFs from WT and AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the deficiency of AFF3ir-ORF2 in AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3E</xref>). Interestingly, the AFF3ir-ORF2 knockdown efficiency showed discrepancies between the western blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>) and RT-PCR results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3E</xref>). In addition to the technical differences between PCR and western blot, the characteristics of AFF3ir-ORF2 may also contribute to this inconsistency. The parent gene, AFF3, is located in a genetically variable region, and it can be excised via intron 5 to form a replicable transposon that translocates to other chromosomes, potentially contributing to leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chinen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hiwatari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Miller, Leventaki, Harker-Murray, Drendel, &amp; Bone, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">von Bergh et al., 2002</xref>). AFF3ir, located in intron 6, exists within this transposon, which may complicate the measurement of its expression. Furthermore, we found that AFF3ir-ORF2 deficient MEFs displayed higher expression of inflammatory genes, including <italic>ICAM-1, VCAM-1,</italic> and <italic>IL-1b</italic>, compared to those in WT MEFs, under disturbed flow stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3F</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Next, we crossed AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice with ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice to generate double-knockout (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Eight-week-old ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> and ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks to induce atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>En face</italic> Oil-Red O staining indicated that AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency accelerated the development of atherosclerosis in the entire aorta, AA, and TA. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Furthermore, AFF3ir-ORF2 deletion increased the lesion area and lipid deposition in the aortic roots of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice without altering the collagen fiber content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D, E</xref>). Similar results were observed in distributing arteries (LCAs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F, G</xref>). Given that the expression of adhesion proteins, such as VCAM-1 in ECs is crucial for monocyte infiltration into plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Kobiyama &amp; Ley, 2018</xref>), we assessed VCAM-1 expression in the aortic roots of these mice. We found that AFF3ir-ORF2 deletion increased VCAM-1 expression in the aortic roots of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H, I</xref>), indicating that the atherogenic effects of AFF3ir-ORF2 deletion may result from endothelial inflammation. Additionally, there were no significant differences between the two groups in body weight or triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A, B</xref>), indicating that the atherogenic effect of AFF3ir-ORF2 silencing is unlikely to be related to lipid metabolism. Taken together, these results indicate that AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency aggravates inflammation and atherosclerotic lesions in mice.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>AFF3ir-ORF2 mitigates disturbed shear stress-induced inflammation by interacting with IRF5 and retaining it within the cytosol</title><p id="P12">To explore the mechanism by which AFF3ir-ORF2 mitigates atherogenesis, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on MEFs from WT and AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The Principal component analysis plot depicted clear clustering of WT versus AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). We identified 1,167 upregulated and 310 downregulated genes in the AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> group, with a criterion of 1.5-fold change and P&lt;0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>). All the differentially expressed genes were subjected to bioinformatics enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) databases. GO analysis showed that these genes were mainly enriched in processes, including leukocyte cell-cell adhesion, regulation of cell–cell adhesion, and leukocyte activation involved in immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), which is highly consistent with the phenotypes observed in AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. To further investigate the function features of these differentially expressed genes in the context of the atherosclerotic microenvironment, we mapped the differential gene list onto the atherosclerosis-related gene dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Rouillard et al., 2016</xref>), resulting in 363 overlapping genes. GO analysis of these genes revealed enrichment in processes related to cell−cell adhesion and leukocyte activation involved in immune response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>), which is highly consistent with the observed effects of AFF3ir-ORF2 on VCAM-1 expression.</p><p id="P13">To further identify the upstream transcriptional regulators of these genes, we used the list of differentially expressed genes from the RNA-seq data to predict upstream transcription factors using the ChEA3 database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Keenan et al., 2019</xref>). Then, the top 20 transcription factors obtained from the ChEA3 database were mapped to the atherosclerotic disease-related gene list in the Disgenet database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Pinero et al., 2017</xref>). Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) and IRF8 were identified as key upstream regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). IRF5 and IRF8, which are members of the same family of transcription factors originally implicated in interferon production, have been identified as critical regulators of the inflammatory response and contribute to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Almuttaqi &amp; Udalova, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Salem, Salem, &amp; Gros, 2020</xref>). However, their potential roles in disturbed shear stress-induced inflammation remain unclear. We speculated that AFF3ir-ORF2 interacts with IRF5 and/or IRF8. Coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated that endogenous AFF3ir-ORF2 could bind to both IRF5 and IRF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). To determine which transcription factor that mediates the inflammatory effects of AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency, we silenced IRF5 and IRF8 in WT and AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs exposed to disturbed flow. Notably, silencing IRF5, but not IRF8, blunted the upregulation of inflammatory genes, including <italic>ICAM-1, VCAM-1, IL-6,</italic> and <italic>IL-1β</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that IRF5 was the predominant factor mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of AFF3ir-ORF2 in the context of disturbed shear stress. Consistently, we found that IRF5 silencing significantly inhibited the upregulation of ICAM-1 protein levels induced by AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency under disturbed shear stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G, H</xref>). In addition, neither IRF5 nor IRF8 expression levels were affected by AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref>). However, we found that AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency significantly increased the expression of IRF5-targeted genes (predicted by the ChEA3 database), including ICAM-1, CCL5, and CXCL10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5D</xref>). Notably, the protein level of IRF5 was not significantly affected by disturbed shear stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G, H</xref>). Consistently, the mRNA levels of IRF5 were previously reported to be barely changed in the context of disturbed shear stress (GSE276195, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5E</xref>) or the atherosclerotic environment (GSE222583, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5F</xref>). Given that the transcriptional activity of IRF5 depends on its nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Lv et al., 2024</xref>), we next explored whether AFF3ir-ORF2 affects the subcellular localization of IRF5. Subcellular fractionation assays indicated that IRF5 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm under static conditions, but exhibited obvious nuclear localization when exposed to disturbed shear stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I, J</xref>). While the total expression of IRF5 was barely affected by AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency or overexpression, nuclear localization of IRF5 increased with AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4I, J</xref>). To further ascertain the role of AFF3ir-ORF2 in regulating the transcriptional activity of IRF5, we performed a luciferase reporter assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Qiao, Lv, Qiao, Wang, &amp; Miao, 2022</xref>). AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression significantly decreased the transcriptional activity of IRF5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4K</xref>). In summary, these results suggested that AFF3ir-ORF2 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of IRF5 and exerts anti-inflammatory effects by retaining IRF5 in the cytosol.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>IRF5 knockdown prevents the aggravation of atherosclerosis induced by ORF2 deficiency</title><p id="P14">Next, we investigated the role of IRF5 in disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis <italic>in vivo</italic> and whether it mediates the atherogenic phenotype associated with AFF3ir-ORF2 deficiency. ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> and ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice were subjected to partial ligation surgery in the LCAs and intravascularly infected with lentiviruses expressing either IRF5-specific shRNA (lenti-shIRF5) or Scramble shRNA (lenti-shScramble). En-face immunofluorescence staining confirmed successful IRF5 deletion in the left carotid artery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A</xref>).

Notably, although ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>AFF3ir-ORF2<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited an increased plaque area in the LCAs compared to ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice, IRF5 deletion almost completely abolished these differences, reducing both the plaque area and VCAM-1 expression in the endothelium of the LCAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A–D</xref>).

In addition, AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression effectively suppressed VCAM-1 expression in the endothelium of the aortic roots of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F, G</xref>).

In the present study, we elucidated the role of the novel nested gene-encoded protein, AFF3ir-ORF2, in sensing disturbed shear stress. Moreover, we demonstrated that AFF3ir-ORF2 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of IRF5, a key regulator of the inflammatory response, thereby exerting potent anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Using three mouse models (global AFF3ir-ORF2 knockout, locally AFF3ir-ORF2 endothelial expression, and endothelial-specific AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression), we demonstrated that AFF3ir-ORF2 exerted potent anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerosis effects in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Notably, while AFF3ir-ORF2 knockout increased VCAM-1 expression in the endothelium and enlarged the plaque area in the aortic roots, it had a minimal effect on collagen deposition within the plaques. This discrepancy may be attributed to the differential expression patterns of IRF5 across various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Roberts, Collado, &amp; Barnes, 2024</xref>). Phenotypically modulated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) within the fibrous cap produce extracellular matrix molecules critical for plaque composition and stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bennett, Sinha, &amp; Owens, 2016</xref>). A previous study has shown minimal colocalization between IRF5 and the VSMC marker, α-smooth muscle actin, in aortic root lesions of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Seneviratne et al., 2017</xref>), indicating a relatively low IRF5 expression level in VSMCs. Consequently, AFF3ir-ORF2 likely exerts its anti-inflammatory effects primarily through endothelial IRF5. Consistently, endothelial-specific AFF3ir-ORF2 overexpression reduced the aortic plaque area, but had minimal effects on collagen deposition. Our findings establish the potent anti-atherosclerotic role of AFF3ir-ORF2 in early and advanced atherosclerosis mouse models. However, given the multiple critical roles of ECs throughout the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, further investigations are needed to explore the potential role of AFF3ir-ORF2 in other atherosclerotic processes, including endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, plaque rupture, and atherothrombotic occlusion. Additionally, we found that disturbed shear stress transcriptional downregulated the expression of AFF3ir. However, the protein levels of AFF3ir-ORF2, but not those of AFF3ir-ORF1, were reduced by disturbed shear stress. Since both AFF3ir-ORF1 and AFF3ir-ORF2 are derived from AFF3ir, different translation mechanisms may be involved in the production of AFF3ir-ORF1/2.</p><p id="P18">In addition to ECs, various other cell types, particularly immune cells, play crucial roles in the progression of atherosclerotic plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Wolf &amp; Ley, 2019</xref>). Although our results indicated the potent anti-inflammatory role of AFF3ir-ORF2 in ECs, the potential contributions of other cell types may also be involved, which could be further elucidated using AFF3ir-ORF2 tissue-specific knockout or overexpression mouse models. Macrophage polarization and inflammatory responses accelerate plaque development, leading to an increase in necrotic core and vulnerable plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Krausgruber et al., 2011</xref>). Elevated IRF5 expression and nuclear localization have been observed in macrophages within plaques of ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Seneviratne et al., 2017</xref>). IRF5 has been demonstrated to drive macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory state, thereby affecting plaque stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Seneviratne et al., 2017</xref>). Global or myeloid cell-specific deletion of IRF5 stabilizes atherosclerotic plaques by suppressing the inflammatory phenotypes of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Leipner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Seneviratne et al., 2017</xref>). Despite these findings, the role of IRF5 in shear stress-induced endothelial activation remains largely unknown. Our study provides evidence that disturbed shear stress is sufficient to induce IRF5 nuclear translocation and activation in ECs. Furthermore, IRF5 knockdown in ECs significantly reduced disturbed flow-induced plaque formation in LCAs. These findings suggest that targeting endothelial IRF5 may be an effective strategy for combating the early stages of atherosclerosis.</p><p id="P19">Given the key role of IRF5 in mediating inflammatory responses, it has been considered as an attractive therapeutic target, and various strategies have been developed to study and modulate its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Almuttaqi &amp; Udalova, 2019</xref>). For example, nanoparticle-delivered siRNA targeting IRF5 in macrophages promotes inflammation resolution, improves infarct healing, and attenuates post-myocardial infarction remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Courties et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, manipulating IRF5 protein levels through the E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM21, has been explored as a strategy for modulating its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Lazzari et al., 2014</xref>). Given the crucial physiological role of IRF5, strategies aimed at suppressing its pathophysiological activation without altering basal levels may offer additional benefits. Our study introduces a novel approach to inhibit IRF5 activation. We found that the novel nested gene-encoded protein, AFF3ir-ORF2, interacts with IRF5, leading to cytoplasmic retention and inactivation under disturbed shear stress conditions. Importantly, endothelium-specific supplementation with AFF3ir-ORF2 effectively attenuated endothelial activation and reduced the atherosclerotic plaque area in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting that targeting endothelial IRF5 activation with AFF3ir-ORF2 holds promise for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, as emerging studies have highlighted the substantial contributions of IRF5 to autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Graham et al., 2006</xref>), neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Masuda et al., 2014</xref>), obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Dalmas et al., 2015</xref>), and hepatic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alzaid et al., 2016</xref>), future research should investigate whether AFF3ir-ORF2 has beneficial effects in these contexts.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P20">In conclusion, this study provides novel evidence that the disruption of AFF3ir-ORF2 expression under disturbed flow promotes endothelial inflammatory responses and atherosclerosis.
