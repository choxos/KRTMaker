Here we investigated six representatives of three different terrestrial and marine clades of AOA in a longitudinal and quantitative study for their ability to form biofilm and studied gene expression patterns of three representatives. While all strains grew on a solid surface, soil strains exhibited the highest capacity for biofilm formation. Based on microscopic and gene expression data, two different colonization strategies could be distinguished. S-layer containing AOA (from both soil and marine habitats) initialized attachment as single cells and subsequently formed denser layers and three-dimensional structures, while the S-layer free species of the <italic>Nitrosocosmicus</italic> clade attached as suspended aggregates to the surface and henceforth showed fastest establishment of biofilm. Transcription profiles were significantly different between planktonic and biofilm growth in all strains and revealed individual reactions, often fulfilling shared functions. In particular the strong expression of different types of multicopper oxidases was observed in all strains indicating modifications of their cell coats. S-layer carrying AOA each additionally expressed a set of adhesion proteins supporting attachment. Detoxification of nitrous compounds, copper acquisition as well as the expression of transcription factor B were also shared reactions among biofilm producing strains. However, the majority of differentially expressed protein families was distinct among the three strains illustrating that individual solutions have evolved for the shared growth mode of biofilm formation in AOA, probably driven by the different ecological niches.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Nitrification, the microbially mediated oxidation of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) to nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) via nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), is a key process of the global biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. The first and rate-limiting step of ammonia oxidation (NH<sub>3</sub> to NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) is performed by ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and comammox, capable of complete oxidation of NH3 to NO3<sup>-</sup>. All ammonia oxidizing microorganisms contribute directly or indirectly to the production of nitrous oxide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, a potent greenhouse gas, and to the loss of nitrogen in natural and in fertilized agricultural systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. It is therefore of continuous importance to better understand their metabolisms and activities in diverse ecosystems. AOA are ubiquitous in most aerobic environments, ranging from the sediments of the Mariana trench <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> to the soils of Mount Everest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. They outnumber their bacterial counterparts in most oligotrophic environments including pristine soils and the open ocean<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> often orders of magnitude. Although physiological studies have indicated a specialization to low nutrient environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, AOA populations additionally outnumber AOB in highly fertilized agricultural soils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, indicating so far unknown metabolic capabilities or a wider range of growth modes than currently known</p><p id="P3">.AOA first belonged to the class Nitrososphaeria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> in the phylum Thaumarchaeota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> but have since been reclassified into the order Nitrososphaerales including the three major families “<italic>Candidatus</italic> Nitrosocaldaceae”, <italic>Nitrosopumilaceae</italic>, and <italic>Nitrososphaeraceae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. While most of the isolated AOA strains from aquatic or terrestrial environments have been isolated in liquid media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, some species from soil, in particular those of the <italic>Nitrosocosmicus</italic> clade were reported to grow on solid surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, or as aggregates in liquid culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, indicating the capacity to grow in biofilms. <italic>Ca</italic>.

Despite those observations, a systematic insight into the capability of biofilm formation of different AOA is lacking as is a fundamental understanding of their physiology under these conditions.</p><p id="P4">It has been hypothesized that most microorganisms form or are a part of biofilms in-situ. With estimates of 40-80% of cells on earth residing in biofilms, they are also hypothesized to drive all biogeochemical cycles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. While most soil microorganisms are thought to grow in biofilms, marine organisms can grow planktonically or particle associated, offering specialized niches for different species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Biofilms are defined by the IUPAC as “aggregates of microorganisms in which cells are frequently embedded in a self- produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that are adherent to each other and/or a surface”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. This is in line with previous and broad definitions of biofilms, including microbial aggregates, floccules and also adherent populations on surfaces, in contrast to single planktonic or single sessile cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Additionally, biofilms can have so-called emergent properties, differing substantially from the physiology of free-living cells. Those properties arise mostly from the EPS-matrix the cells are thriving in, and include but are not limited to: protection against biotic and abiotic stress, sorption of nutrients, retention of enzymes and localization of gradients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The EPS-matrix is typically mainly made of extracellular polysaccharides, proteins, lipids and DNA, however compositions vary between species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">We hypothesize that biofilm formation is a general trait of AOA and that general physiological changes can be identified in this potentially ecologically relevant mode of growth.

The ability of AOA to attach to CG and accumulate biomass over time was investigated by following nitrite production, which is a well established proxy for cell numbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Dataset S1</xref>). In this experimental setup, nitrite production did not exclusively stem from biofilms, as a planktonic fraction was observed for every transfer. However, only cells adhering to cover glass were transferred, implying that the planktonic fraction in the following cultures was seeded from biofilms. A faster rate of nitrite production should therefore represent an increased amount of biomass on the cover glass. The rate of nitrite production of all tested AOA increased over the course of multiple CG transfers indicating the capacity for biofilm formation.</p><p id="P11">The soil AOA <italic>N. viennensis</italic> and <italic>N. franklandianus</italic> exhibited a clear increase in nitrite production rate already after the initial cover glass transfer that continuously accelerated with each consecutive transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). A stable maximum for both species was reached after 8 and 6 transfers respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). Similarly, <italic>N. sinensis</italic> reached a stable maximum after 8 transfers well above the nitrite production of initial growth, however, its growth was considerably slower than the two soil strains and not exponential. The nitrite production rate of all marine AOA strains was less stable with successive CG transfers indicating a less pronounced capability of biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D-F</xref>). After peaking at the sixth transfer, the nitrite production rate of <italic>N. maritimus</italic> decreased and stabilized at a lower rate, while it steadily declined in <italic>N. adriaticus</italic>. Unlike the other marine strains, the nitrite production rate of <italic>N. piranensis</italic> started to decrease already with the first two transfers before eventually showing an increase in nitrite production rate. This along with its high standard deviations in successive CG transfers suggests the lowest capability for biofilm formation as compared to all other strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The stark differences between the initial growth and first transfer of the <italic>Nitrososphaeraceae</italic> and <italic>Nitrosopumilaceae</italic> species can be attributed to the different inoculation volumes used, ranging from 0.25% to 5% (v/v). These inoculation volumes were chosen in order to transfer the CG of all species after an equal period of time given for the initial transfer.

All tested AOA formed biofilms without external triggers in optimal growth medium. Soil strains, especially <italic>N. franklandianus,</italic> exhibited higher capacities for biofilm formation, as expected from previous studies on members of the <italic>Nitrosocosmicus</italic> showing a higher genomic potential for biofilm formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, or accelerated growth when surface associated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. Based on the presence of motility and chemotaxis genes, Bayer et. al. suggested that, although isolated from the same habitat, <italic>N. piranensis</italic> and <italic>N. adriaticus</italic> occupy different niches, floating in the water column or attached to marine snow/particles, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Our data support this hypothesis. The overall lower stability of biofilms from marine strains may be reflective of their environment, where communities attached to particles often undergo rapid successive changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. Conversely, biofilms of terrestrial ecosystems might be more stable over prolonged periods of time.</p><sec id="S14"><title>Attachment first</title><p id="P32">Two general strategies of biofilm formation were observed. <italic>N. viennensis</italic> and <italic>N. maritimus</italic> followed an attachment-first-strategy, gradually colonizing a surface, and subsequently building up a matrix. This strategy might be dependent on the presence of adhesion proteins, highly expressed in <italic>N. viennensis</italic> and <italic>N. maritimus</italic>. <italic>N. piranensis</italic> lacks these genes, potentially explaining its reduced biofilm-forming capabilities. Adhesion proteins are distributed irregularly among the different genomes of AOA hinting towards niche specialization by different AOA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Several other genes are potentially involved in adhesion. For example, a DUF11 domain-containing protein (NVIE_000970) has been linked to cell surface stabilization during the aggregation of Methanothermobacter sp. CaT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Additionally, a putative Ca2+-binding protein (NVIE_001010) is present in the adhesion region. Calcium, known to enhance adhesion in <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>, could similarly play a structural role in the biofilms of <italic>N. viennensis</italic>. In this context, a highly upregulated putative cation channel protein (NVIE_014290) may modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels of the biofilm. Adhesion proteins are recognized as key components of environmental biofilms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, and our findings suggest that these proteins are crucial for enabling the attachment strategy observed in these particular species.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Aggregation first</title><p id="P33">Alternatively, <italic>N. franklandianus</italic> exhibited an aggregation-first-strategy.

Fittingly, it is common to observe cell aggregates in planktonic culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, suggesting that <italic>N. franklandianus</italic> is growing as suspended aggregates. This appears to be a general feature of the <italic>Nitrosocosmicus</italic> clade as all enriched or isolated species were found to aggregate, or to be part of biofilms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. However, it is unclear how aggregates attach to surfaces, as specific mechanisms for attachment, such as adhesion proteins, are not present in the genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Interestingly, canonical S-Layer genes are not found in the genus <italic>Nitrosocosmicus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.

Based on our observations of strong biofilm formation by <italic>N. franklandianus</italic> we propose biofilms as the preferred growth mode of this strain, and likely also of other members of the <italic>Nitrosocosmicus</italic> clade.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>The role of Multicopper Oxidases (MCOs) in biofilm formation</title><p id="P34">MCOs have been consistently observed genomically and transcriptionally in AOA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, although the biological function of most of them remains unknown. MCOs couple the oxidation of a substrate, that can be either organic or metal ions, to the reduction of oxygen to water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, but can have a wide range of substrates, sometimes even acting promiscuously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. MCOs have previously been speculated to be involved in the second step of ammonia oxidation as a functional homologue to bacterial HAO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, but the fact that MCOs are not conserved in all AOA genomes suggests that they are not involved in a central pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. The patchy distribution of different MCOs among AOA instead points towards diverse functions.</p><p id="P35">MCO1, 4a, and 4b were highly upregulated in <italic>N. viennensis</italic> under copper limitation, potentially oxidizing Cu+ to Cu2+ for bioavailability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, a known function for MCOs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Contrastingly, in copper limited <italic>N. maritimus,</italic> the only upregulated MCO was of type MCO1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Combining these observations, it is likely that MCO1 is indeed used for copper acquisition. Alternatively, MCO4a from <italic>N. maritimus</italic> has recently been shown to produce HNO from NH2OH which was proposed as a waste production pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. In this study, MCO4a was moderately to highly expressed in planktonic cultures and biofilms of all three species, and additionally highly upregulated in <italic>N. viennensis</italic> and <italic>N. maritimus</italic> biofilms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). MCO4a may therefore help cells to deal with nitrosative stress in biofilms where reactive molecules may be more concentrated. The upregulation of a nitroreductase in all strains supports an increase of nitro compounds that need to be detoxified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P36">While MCO4a and MCO4b are overall similar, an alignment revealed that the T1 copper center in MCO4a is coordinated by histidines and a leucine, while the MCO4b copper center is coordinated by histidines and methionine (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, supplement). The methionine’s thioether group has been shown to modulate the redox potential of the coordinated CuII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> and might therefore be enabling a different function. The functional classification of MCOs using only primary structure is, however, significantly limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. MCO4b and MCO3 were the most highly upregulated MCOs in biofilms of <italic>N. viennensis</italic> and <italic>N. franklandianus</italic> respectively. It is possible that these MCOs modify cell surfaces by oxidizing components like glycoproteins and in particular the glycosylated cell envelope. That MCO4b was the highest upregulated gene under both copper limitation and in biofilms of <italic>N. viennensis</italic> suggests a dual role of these cell surface modifications: (1) modifying cell surface structures to enable biofilm formation, and/or (2) aiding in the sequestration of positively charged ions, such as coppe<italic>r</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Additionally, MCOs in <italic>N. franklandianus</italic> were also highly expressed in planktonic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5.</xref>), which is in line with the observed continuous formation of cell aggregates in this strain. Several bona fide biofilm genes are also in close association with MCOs. The soil strains encode an "antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase” next to MCO4a and MCO3, respectively, indicating another oxygenase function that could modify the cell coat (rather than being involved in antibiotic biosynthesis). The presence of a putative electron carrier in all three strains, the ferredoxin/flavodoxin family protein, potentially indicates the importance of supplying electrons to MCOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Dataset S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Transcription factor B as regulators in AOA biofilms</title><p id="P37">Transcription factors TBP and TFB, homologs of the eukaryotic basal transcription factors, are consistently found in all archaea and are essential for transcription.
