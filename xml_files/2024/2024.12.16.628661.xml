One of the features of embryo models is their multilineage differentiation, which allows the co-development of, and interactions between, tissues. Here, we utilise a human Trunk-like Structure (hTLS) model to explore trunk development. We show that hTLS have morphologically organised somites and a neural tube that form through self-organised, endogenous signalling including anteroposterior FGF, Wnt and Retinoic Acid (RA) gradients that modulate the fate of neuromesodermal progenitors. Comparison to an existing dataset from organogenesis-stage human embryos shows that hTLS cells approximate Carnegie Stage 13-14 (28-35 days post-fertilisation). The absence of a notochord leads to a dorsal identity, but exogenous exposure to smoothened agonist (promoting Sonic Hedgehog signalling) progressively ventralises both somites and neural tube in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we identify endogenous signalling from the neural tube to the somites, which leads to medially localised <italic>ALDH1A2,</italic> and subsequent RA signalling from the somites to the neural tube, which leads to spontaneous neural progenitor patterning and <italic>PAX6</italic> expression. Together, our data highlight the value of modularity in embryo models which we leverage to explore human trunk co-development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">In the embryo, tissues and organs are specified and mature alongside neighbouring tissues, using local interactions that are important for correct development and downstream function. For example, neighbouring tissues may provide positional information to cells through spatially localised cues, or they may provide signalling feedback that balances proportions of cell fates and promotes maturation to specific cell types. Inter-tissue interactions are also likely to be important for ensuring synchronised developmental timing across tissues, so that the embryo keeps a consistent pace during organogenesis. We refer to this inter-dependency between tissues as ‘co-development’, and believe this phenomenon is likely to be critical for fully understanding how tissues and organs form with implications for <italic>in vitro</italic> protocols aimed at generating specific cell types of interest in the future.</p><p id="P4">There is therefore a need to investigate organogenesis at the multi-tissue level, rather than focusing on a single tissue at a time. This has been challenging using embryos because signalling pathway convergence and overlapping communication across many tissues can make it difficult to identify specific reciprocal interactions between any two tissues of interest. Classical experimental embryology provides a route to explore tissue interactions in the development of functional organs through manipulations including explants, transplants and excisions (see for instance, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>). However, these approaches are not feasible in humans due to ethical and technical constraints, including limited long-term human embryo culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Stem cell-based embryo models offer a practical alternative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Their multilineage potential enables exploration of inter-tissue interactions, while bottom-up generation of specific tissues in the presence or absence of others can determine the necessity and sufficiency of these interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Importantly, human pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived models provide scalability, experimental flexibility, and species-specific relevance that cannot be achieved with embryos alone. As such, these models hold promise for deciphering the regulatory logic of co-development during early organogenesis.</p><p id="P6">Several models of early embryogenesis have now been developed that allow researchers to examine different stages of human development. Human gastruloids are self-organised aggregates of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) that spontaneously break symmetry, differentiate to all three germ layers, and undergo axial elongation and spatiotemporal gene expression along an anteroposterior axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. While they are a valuable research tool to explore early cell fate decisions, including the differentiation to early paraxial mesoderm, they lack morphological complexity including somitic epithelialisation. Mouse gastruloids can be induced to form axially-organised morphological somites through embedding in an extracellular matrix gel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> and even form integrated somite- and neural tube-containing structures called Trunk-like Structures (TLS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>). Likewise, three-dimensional human stem cell models of somitogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and caudal neural tube development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> have been described, as have structures that contain both neural and somitic mesoderm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, neuromuscular junctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and notochord progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. These models showcase the remarkable modularity of stem cell-based embryo models to include or exclude particular tissues, in a building block-like manner. We reasoned that this could be harnessed to explore co-development, focusing particularly on the tissue interactions during axial extension in early embryogenesis.</p><p id="P7">The somites and the neural tube are the sources of trunk musculature, dermis, bone and spinal cord, respectively. Their development needs to be coordinated in order to form functional organ systems, for instance, specific neurons emanating from the spinal cord must innervate specific muscles in order to form circuits. Additionally, their close proximity next to one another during development makes it likely that general communication and feedback between the tissues enables co-development of both tissues. There is evidence that signals from the neural tube promote myogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and prevent medial <italic>Sim1</italic> expression in the somites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>, while somitic signals to the neural tube promote neurogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. However, the exploration of these interactions in humans has been hampered for lack of appropriate experimental systems. Here we modify a somite-only axioloid protocol to develop robust and reproducible human Trunk-like Structures (hTLS) that could be directly compared with axioloids to explore trunk development in the presence or absence of the neural tube.</p><p id="P8">We find that, due to the absence of a notochord, the hTLS exhibit dorsal bias but exogenous activation of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signalling induces progressive ventralisation in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, even without a localized Shh source, we observed neural tube patterning orthogonal to the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, mediated by somite-derived Retinoic Acid (RA) signalling. This RA signalling was required for localized <italic>PAX6</italic> expression in the neural tube but not for initiating neurogenesis. Moreover, we found that the neural tube was able to induce <italic>ALDH1A2</italic> expression specifically in medial somites, a novel finding that we validated in mouse embryos, indicating that reciprocal interactions may promote somitic mediolateral identity. Additionally, in the presence of a developing neural tube, the development of the somites occurs at a pace that is comparable to that of the embryo. Our findings highlight the potential of stem cell-based embryo models to uncover the regulatory logic of co-development, and show that the modular nature of embryo models can offer insights into the spatial and temporal coordination of tissue interactions during early human organogenesis.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Establishing an hTLS protocol</title><p id="P9">While mouse gastruloids embedded in low percentage Matrigel can develop organised epithelial somite structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, human gastruloids had to be exposed to the Nodal signalling inhibitor, SB431542 (herein, SB43) during pre-treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, to generate segments when embedded in 20% Matrigel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>). These segments formed sequentially from the posterior, but they did not form rounded, epithelial structures characteristic of somitic morphology in the embryo. Instead, a protocol combining the Wnt/β-catenin activator CHIR99021 (herein, Chi) and SB43 at aggregation with embedding in 10% Matrigel enabled morphologically organised somitic tissue formation as axioloids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> (similar to <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>). We adapted this protocol from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>) by adjusting the Chi concentration according to cell line requirements (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>). In doing so, we noticed that higher concentrations of Chi biased the cultures towards the mesodermal fate, as expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, while lower concentrations enabled the co-formation of a morphologically organised neural tube alongside the somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). These structures increased in somite number, elongated over 120h and displayed an organised somitic and neural tube morphology in 79% of aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1c-h</xref>). Marker gene expression confirmed the presence of somitic (MEOX1+) and neural (SOX2+) identities with a pool of progenitors (SOX2+,TBXT+) at the posterior, and a presomitic mesoderm (PSM) domain (<italic>TBX6</italic>+,<italic>MESP2+</italic>) in the tailbud region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c-d</xref>). As such, the structures were clearly similar to recently-described human trunk-like structures (hTLS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, with the important distinction that the protocol could be ‘fine-tuned’ by adjusting the level of Chi to give somite-only or combined somite- and neural tube-containing structures, thereby allowing direct comparison between structures with the presence or absence of the neural tube.</p><p id="P10">Like several other <italic>in vitro</italic> models of somitogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, we noted that the morphological organisation of hTLS was critically dependent on embedding in Matrigel and exposure to retinal, since time-matched structures without these had some degree of gene expression organisation along an AP axis, but no or little morphological organisation of somites or neural tube (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1i-j</xref>). We were also able to adapt the protocol to a total of 7 cell lines (from 3 parental backgrounds), including both hESC and iPSCs, which showcases the versatility of the protocol beyond intrinsic line-to-line variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S11">Methods</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Characterising hTLS formation</title><p id="P11">To better understand the morphological organisation of hTLS, we performed Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to visualise the surface morphology of hTLS. This showed clear cell compaction differences, with loosely arranged cells in the posterior tailbud, medium compaction in the PSM, and tightly compacted epithelialisation in both the neural tube and somite domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>), in keeping with descriptions in vertebrate embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. Likewise, hTLS generated with a ZO1::mEGFP line showed that both the somites and neural tube had internal ZO1- and Actin-rich lumina, with cells organised as epithelia in both tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>). We therefore wanted to better understand how these epithelial tissues formed in hTLS.</p><p id="P12">This question is particularly interesting for the neural tube since it is known to form through two modes of morphogenesis in mammals: primary and secondary. Primary neurulation involves the folding of the neural ectoderm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> and has been extensively studied because malformations are the leading cause of neural tube defects (NTDs) in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. By contrast, secondary neurulation - when neural cells condense to form rods that later epithelialize to form a contiguous tube - is much less understood since it accounts for only the caudal-most portion of the axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Exactly how secondary neurulation occurs in humans, how the two modes are coordinated, and whether the human embryonic neural tube is branched at early stages or contiguous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> are still open questions in the field. Using the ZO1::mEGFP cell line, we sometimes saw multiple or branched neural tubes, particularly at the posterior pole (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1k</xref>). With live imaging we observed epithelial cysts that progressively merged to generate a contiguous tract (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1l &amp; Supplementary Movie 1</xref>). Therefore, it seems that the mode of neural tube formation in hTLS structures is more similar to secondary neurulation.</p><p id="P13">To further characterise the hTLS over time, we collected samples at 72h, 96h and 120h and performed 10x single cell RNA sequencing. We could detect populations including a neuromesodermal progenitor (NMP) cell state (expressing <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>TBXT)</italic>, PSM (<italic>TBX6, HES7, DLL1</italic>), determination front (<italic>RIPPLY1/2, MESP1/2</italic>), somitic (<italic>MEOX1, TCF15</italic>), and neural (<italic>SOX2, PAX6</italic>) clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3a-e</xref>). Cells from the early timepoints mostly populated the progenitor populations while those from later timepoints populated the more mature states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1h</xref>). In addition, we detected sub-clusters including a small population of endothelial cells (<italic>KDR+, ETV2+;</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3f</xref>) that match previous reports of a somite-derived endothelial population in mouse TLS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, human axioloids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Additionally, we observed a small population of more mature neural cells (<italic>ONECUT2, ELAVL3</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3g</xref>) indicating that neurogenesis is beginning by 120h in hTLS. By contrast, we saw no evidence of cell fates correlating to notochord, non-neural ectoderm, neural crest, endoderm, lateral plate mesoderm or others, corroborating the observation that the hTLS contain only neural tube and somitic progenitors and downstream lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1i</xref>). Bioinformatic projection onto an existing axioloid dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> confirmed that the hTLS contain neural cell types that are not present in the somite-only version (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>) indicating that, while comparable, hTLS are indeed distinct entities from axioloids.</p><p id="P14">To further examine whether our annotated clusters had equivalents to their corresponding <italic>in vivo</italic> states, we projected our dataset onto a human embryonic atlas of stages ranging from Carnegie Stage (CS) 12 to CS16 that incorporates all major cell types at early organogenesis stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Our data clearly mapped to the somitic and neural progenitor populations of this dataset, once again highlighting that the <italic>in vitro</italic> populations observed in hTLS match the expected cell types in the human embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1j</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5a-b</xref>). Interestingly, when we performed label transfer for our dataset, the vast majority of cells were called as CS13-14 equivalent (day 28-35 of human development; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5c-g</xref>) which is significantly later than that predicted for human gastruloids (approximately CS8-9; day 17-21 of human development)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>, indicating the significant step forward achieved by the hTLS protocol.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Axial elongation in hTLS is maintained by an NMP population</title><p id="P15">We next examined the spatial and temporal regulation of Hox gene expression, as these genes are known to be critical in the regulation of axial identity along the anteroposterior (AP) axis of vertebrate embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. We observed expression of <italic>HOXC6/8</italic> along the full AP axis of hTLS, while <italic>HOXC10</italic> was only present in the posterior portion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6a</xref>). Temporally, there was progressive expression of HOX gene paralogues across the timepoints sampled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 6b</xref>) consistent with spatiotemporal regulation. Together with the lack of expression of HOX11-13, this suggests that the hTLS model approximates the thoracic and lumbar regions of the AP axis, but not the sacral or caudal-most regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. However, given that the termination of axial elongation is thought to be triggered by expression of HOX13 in embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> which is not present in hTLS, we wondered what was mediating the extension and then termination of axial elongation in our hTLS model.</p><p id="P16">In the embryo, axis extension is supported by a population of neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs): bipotential progenitors that give rise to both the neural and somitic cell fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> One basic characterisation of NMPs is co-expression of <italic>TBXT</italic> and <italic>SOX2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> which is thought to underly their bipotency, and we observed cells co-expressing these markers in the posterior of hTLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). Using the RUES2-GLR cell line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, which contains TBXT-mCerulean and SOX2-mCitrine fluorescent reporters, we live-imaged hTLS under conditions that promoted co-development of neural tube and somites (hTLS), or conditions that biased towards somite-only (Chi high conditions) or neural tube-only fates (Chi low conditions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). We observed an early bias (between 78-90h) towards SOX2-only or TBXT-only expression in neural tube-only and somite-only structures respectively, with co-developing structures maintaining a TBXT and SOX2 co-expressing domain for the longest duration, consistent with the role of NMPs in contributing to both fates.</p><p id="P17">However, the NMP domain showed a clear decrease in volume over the hTLS time-course, as was confirmed by fixing and staining at the mRNA and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2d-e</xref>) and by our single cell RNA-sequencing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f-h</xref>). Indeed, RNA velocity analysis showed evidence of bidirectional fates predicted from this population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2i</xref>), and trajectory analysis rooted in the NMP cluster predicted endpoints in both somites and neural tube populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Together this data suggests that hTLS contain an NMP population capable of bipotential cell fate differentiation, and its gradual depletion may be responsible for the resultant maximum axial length and number of somites observed in hTLS <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Endogenous signalling patterns in hTLS</title><p id="P18">In vertebrate embryos, the sequential addition of somites from the posterior unsegmented region is determined by a combination of local intrinsic oscillations of gene expression and a global signalling landscape that leads to coordinated and organised somite formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. Using a HES7::Achilles iPSC line<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, we observed oscillatory expression in the PSM of hTLS, that moved posterior to anterior and stopped at the site of emergent somite formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a-b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 2</xref>), as has been described in embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.

Further research would be necessary to investigate the mechanism of this influence.</p><p id="P19">We then turned our attention to the signalling landscape of the hTLS along the AP axis. In the embryo, the signalling gradients primarily responsible for the wavefront are thought to be FGF and Wnt signalling at the posterior, and Retinoic Acid (RA) more anteriorly at the level of the somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>).

In embryo models, the presence or absence of such tissues can allow us to investigate the extent of positional information in a simplified system. For instance, Shh signals from the notochord play a key role in setting up the dorsoventral (DV) axis in both the neural tube and somites (see Sagner and Briscoe <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup> for recent review). We therefore wondered what DV identity our hTLS structures assumed in the absence of these tissues.</p><p id="P23">Based on transcriptomic data analysis, we found that the hTLS neural tube has a dorsal identity (<italic>PAX6, OLIG3</italic> and <italic>IRX3)</italic>, with no detectable ventral (<italic>OLIG2, NKX2-2/8</italic>), floor plate (<italic>FOXA2, SHH</italic>) or roof plate markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a-b</xref>).

Together, this suggests that the lack of notochord as a source of Shh signalling leads to an overall dorsalisation of both the somites and neural tube in hTLS.</p><p id="P25">To test whether hTLS do still have the capacity to ventralise, we exposed the structures to varying concentrations of Smoothened Agonist (SAG) which promotes Shh signalling, as well as to the small molecule Cyclopamine that inhibits Shh signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup> as a control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8b</xref>). Upon SAG addition we observed increasing ventralisation of hTLS structures in a dose-dependent manner, with increased expression of ventral neural tube (<italic>OLIG2, FOXA2</italic>) and ventral somite (<italic>PAX1, TWIST1</italic>) markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4e-f</xref>). Additionally, the morphology of hTLS appeared to be altered under increasing SAG exposure with less compacted anterior somites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8c</xref>), suggesting that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated with ventral (sclerotome) fates could be occurring, while cyclopamine had no observable effect on hTLS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8d</xref>). However, the dose-dependent ventralisation of hTLS exposed to Shh signalling was not simply all-or-nothing. Surprisingly, we observed that at high concentrations of SAG exposure, not only did populations of <italic>OLIG2+(PAX6-)</italic> and <italic>PAX6+(OLIG2-)</italic> appear in the neural tube, but these were organised across an axis orthogonal to the AP axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4g</xref>). In the embryo, it is known that negative feedback between transcription factors acts to establish discrete domains of neural progenitor identity along the continuous Shh gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>, and the same is likely happening in the hTLS model. However, since the hTLS are exposed to a single, exogenous concentration of SAG throughout (rather than a localised source) the appearance of a consistent axis was surprising. In this case, we reasoned that the juxtaposition of the somites next to the neural tube may establish some aspects of an axis in the neural tube, since the <italic>OLIG2<sub>+</sub>(PAX6-)</italic> domain was consistently localised adjacent to the somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4g</xref>).

Beyond the difficulties of accessing human embryonic material at these stages of development, the complexity of the signalling landscape – with signals emanating from diverse tissues and organs, across multiple spatial axes, and dynamically changing over time – makes it complicated to unravel the contribution of a single tissue. In this case, we were interested in asking what the signalling interactions are between the neural tube and somites, in the absence of all other tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>).</p><p id="P27">We turned first to unbiased, computational approaches to interrogate the putative signalling ligand-receptor interactions predicted between the two tissues. Building on the expression profile of ligands and receptors of known pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8e</xref>), we used CellChat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref></sup> to identify statistically significant, unidirectional interactions specifically from the somitic to the neural tissues (combining neural progenitor populations 1-3 and neuronal clusters), or the inverse interaction. This identified several putative signalling interactions, including RA, Notch, IGF, Fibronectin and EPHA signalling from somites to neural tissue, and Cholesterol, GDF, non-canonical Wnt, SEMA6 and SLITRK pathway signalling from neural to somitic tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8f-g</xref>).</p><p id="P28">We validated the expression signatures of somite-derived RA and neural tube-derived non-canonical Wnt signalling by examining the localisation of the gene corresponding to an RA-binding protein, <italic>CRABP2</italic> (alongside <italic>ALDH1A2</italic> and <italic>CYP26A1),</italic> which was expressed in the neural tube as predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>), and by expression of ligands <italic>WNT5A</italic> and <italic>WNT5B</italic> in the neural tube and receptor <italic>FZD7</italic> in the somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>).

This is in direct contrast with somite-only axioloid structures, where ALDH1A2 was shown to instead have an AP polarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, consistent with our own experiments in axioloids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9a</xref>). This hinted that the presence of the neural tube may bias the localisation of <italic>ALDH1A2</italic> expression to the neural tube-adjacent side, with important implications for the mechanism of medio-lateral polarisation in somites. Since we are not aware of this phenomenon being previously reported, we examined the same gene expression in E9.5 mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e</xref>) and likewise observed a clear medial bias of <italic>ALDH1A2</italic> expression in the somites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie 3</xref>). This suggests that the neural tube biases the localisation of ALDH1A2 to the medial somite domain in both embryos and models, which may in turn localise the RA signalling exposure towards the neural tube.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Somite-to-neural tube RA signalling in hTLS</title><p id="P30">We therefore turned our attention to the downstream role of localised <italic>ALDH1A2</italic>. In the embryo, RA signalling from the somites to the neural tube is thought to have three main functions: (i) AP axis organisation and morphogenesis of the neural tube, (ii) promoting cellular neurogenesis, and (iii) mediating the dorsoventral patterning of neural tube populations (see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">72</xref></sup> for review). At subsequent stages of development, additional roles include coordination of neural crest cell specification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, interneuron specification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>, establishment of the lateral motor column neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup> and maintaining the bilaterality of the somites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref></sup>. It has also been shown that the FGF pathway antagonises RA signalling, and that additional interplay with Wnt and Shh signalling might further refine the role of RA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. Indeed, joint exposure of neural progenitors to RA and FGF is sufficient, even in the absence of Shh signalling, to induce motor neuron differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup>. In addition, in the absence of RA signalling, there is an expanded domain of ventral gene expression in the neural tube<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>, suggesting it has a dorsalising influence on the neural tube.</p><p id="P31">To test whether similar effects were also occurring in hTLS structures, we prevented RA signalling either by removal of the exogeneous retinal or by exposure to the pan-RA receptor (RAR) inhibitor, BMS493<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>. Following early (72-120h) exposure to BMS493, hTLS structures were morphologically impaired, with a smaller overall area, and were composed of fewer organised somites, smaller neural tube and increased tailbud size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9b-c</xref>). This is consistent with the role of RA signalling in axial organisation and morphology, as <italic>Raldh2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse embryos die mid-gestation with aberrant morphology that precludes turning and includes a truncated posterior axis, small somites and an irregularly folded neural tube<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup>. However, when hTLSs were exposed to BMS493 at later timepoints (96-120h) there was no significant effect on morphometrics measured (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9b-c</xref>) suggesting that at this point, morphology had already been established and blocking the RA signalling might specifically affect the ongoing interactions between somites and neural tube. Indeed, hTLS structures exposed to BMS493 at either timepoint showed much lower or no <italic>CYP26A1</italic> in the neural tube, in contrast to control structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9d</xref>) consistent with published data from chick embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>. We therefore further investigated the proposed role of somite-derived RA signalling on the neural tube focussing on the latter timepoint, including its proposed role in promoting neurogenesis and setting up DV identity.</p><p id="P32">To investigate the role of somite-derived RA on early neurogenesis, we examined markers expression in hTLS structures, including <italic>DLL1</italic> and <italic>NGN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5f</xref>). Upon RA signalling inhibition, we could still observe <italic>DLL1</italic><sub>+</sub> cells in the neural tube, comparable to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5f</xref>). This is interesting because in Vitamin A deficient (VAD) quails that lack the precursor to retinoic acid, retinal, <italic>Delta-1</italic> expression is depleted from the caudal neural tube in 9-19 somite-stage embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, but in the <italic>Raldh2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model, <italic>Delta1</italic> expression is comparable to wildtype at the 14-15 somite stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref></sup>. This suggests that there might be differences between species in how RA signalling inhibition affects the neurogenesis cascade. As such, the observation that hTLS show RA-independent neurogenesis indicates that human development is likely to be more similar to the mouse than the avian embryo in this regard.</p><p id="P33">Finally, we examined the role of somite-derived RA signalling on patterning in the neural tube. It is known that <italic>Raldh2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and VAD quails have depleted expression of <italic>Pax6</italic> in the neural tube compared to wildtype embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>. We therefore examined the expression of <italic>PAX6</italic> in the hTLS with late RA signalling inhibition and observed a substantial depletion of this neural marker from the neural tube structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5g</xref>). Conversely, addition of all-trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA) onto hTLS structures increased the expression of <italic>CYP26A1</italic> in the neural tube, with no obvious difference in <italic>DLL1</italic> expression, and with broad expression of <italic>PAX6</italic> across the whole neural tube (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9d-e</xref>). Taken together, this shows that somite-derived RA signalling is required for <italic>PAX6</italic> expression in hTLS and, given the neural tube patterning observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), makes it likely that RA signalling is responsible for establishing this patterning. Similar Shh-independent RA signalling effects on neural progenitor identity have been shown in chick embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73">73</xref></sup>, but not in a human system.</p><p id="P34">Taken together, these data show that interactions between tissues include initial signalling from the neural tube to the somites, resulting in the medial somitic localisation of ALDH1A2 adjacent to the neural tube which, in turn, leads to localised RA signalling from somites to the neural tube that promotes <italic>PAX6</italic> expression specifically at the side adjacent to the somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5h</xref>). Integration with the Shh pathway leads to progressive ventralisation while maintaining the self-organised patterning in the neural tube established by localised signalling from the somites. This reciprocal signalling between somites and neural tube may therefore play an important role in ensuring that correct axial patterning is coordinated between tissues and shows that elements of a mediolateral or dorsoventral axis can be established, even in the absence of well-known signalling centres such as the notochord or lateral plate mesoderm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P35">The hTLS model presented here showcases the development of the thoracic and lumbar trunk in a human system, which would not otherwise be possible given the inability to culture human embryos to this relatively late stage in culture or to study dynamic development in samples from terminations. As a result, the hTLS model serves as a platform to perform experiments that would otherwise be technically intractable, with the scale and experimental flexibility afforded by pluripotent stem cells. Complementary experiments using rare and highly valuable human embryonic material could validate predictions made from such <italic>in vitro</italic> models, thus yielding new insights into how the human embryo employs specific mechanisms for tissue co-development.</p><p id="P36">Our system has revealed a number of features associated with development of the paraxial mesoderm and neural tube. Interestingly, although hTLS represent the thoracic and lumbar region, the neural tube structures develop through a process similar to secondary neurulation, which is characteristic of the tail region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. This suggests that, in the embryo, the mode of neurulation is dependent on the early morphology at gastrulation, including the flat, epiblast-generated neuroectoderm, and since hTLS bypass these morphological stages they utilise secondary neurulation mechanisms instead. This may also help explain why different species evolutionarily rely on primary and secondary neurulation to different extents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref></sup>, as a function of their early morphological constraints. It would be interesting to explore whether this substitution in the mode of neurulation plays a role on the cell biology or fate decisions in the neural tube in follow-on research.</p><p id="P37">However, the most significant findings from this work concerns signalling interactions between developing paraxial mesoderm and the neural tube. For instance, the hTLS model revealed medially localised <italic>ALDH1A2</italic> in the early somites of both hTLS and E9.5 mouse embryos, which to our knowledge had not previously been described. It could be that this early organised gene expression is necessary for subsequent differentiation into the epaxial and hypaxial muscles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref></sup>, and may represent the earliest distinction of mediolateral identity in the developing somites. It also proves that neural tube-derived signals are <italic>sufficient</italic> to initiate mediolateral patterning in the somites, even in the absence of the intermediate or lateral plate mesoderm that would normally be localised laterally. The simplistic, modular nature of the hTLS model therefore provides enormous flexibility for experimental design, allowing us to systematically investigate the influence of particular tissues on the development of others.</p><p id="P38">We also identified spontaneous patterning of the neural tube orthogonal to the AP axis, based on somite-adjacent localization. We showed that this was due to RA-induced signalling emanating from the somites and leading to differential gene expression along the neural tube-to-somitic axis. While this is more likely to reflect RA-dependency rather than DV axis patterning <italic>per se</italic>, somite-derived signals in the human embryo could certainly contribute to DV axis patterning alongside the influence of the notochord. Previous research in animal models has suggested that RA signalling indeed plays an important role in DV patterning, but its precise function is often difficult to isolate due to the complex interactions with other signalling pathways, including Shh, Wnt, and FGF pathways. For instance, VAD quail embryos exhibit a ‘dorsal shift’ in neural tube patterning, with expanded domains of genes associated with a ventral identity compared to wildtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup>, suggesting a dorsalising role for RA signalling. However, this interpretation is complicated by the concomitant increase in Shh expression in the neural tube, which is normally restricted to the floor plate. In such complex systems, it is difficult to delineate the respective roles of interacting pathways. Embryo models like hTLS might therefore allow us to isolate pathways, disentangling the roles of different signalling mechanisms in tissue patterning. In this study, we observed that <underline>combined</underline> exposure of neural tube cells to both SAG and somite-derived RA led to increased ventralisation, suggesting that the cells integrate the two pathways in a combinatorial manner. We show that even in the absence of a localized Shh source, RA signals emanating from the somites are sufficient to drive patterning in the neural tube. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying this signal integration, and how these pathways contribute to boundary formation during human neural tube DV patterning, could provide deeper insights into this interesting observation.</p><p id="P39">The multilineage composition of the hTLS model is a crucial feature, as it allows for the study of inter-tissue interactions, which are essential for proper embryonic patterning and organization. These interactions provide insights into the regulatory logic that governs multiscale coordination within the developing embryo, or co-development. However, while the hTLS model offers many advantages, it is important to recognize its limitations. For example, our data suggest that the notochord is not strictly required for neural tube-derived signalling to the somites, but we cannot exclude the possibility that additional relay interactions—such as notochord-induced floor plate maturation—may occur in the embryo, potentially influencing somite development. Similarly, while we observe that <italic>ALDH1A2</italic> expression is excluded from the lateral somites, we cannot determine whether this exclusion has functional implications for the development of the neighbouring intermediate or lateral plate mesoderm in the human embryo. These considerations highlight the distinction between embryo models and embryos, emphasizing the complementary role of such models in developmental research.</p><p id="P40">Moreover, we anticipate that hTLS models could be of value in disease modelling in the future, given their origin from human induced pluripotent stem cells. One notable observation from our study is the formation of the hTLS neural tube via a secondary neurulation-like process, which could prove valuable for investigating rare neural tube defects (NTDs). This is particularly interesting given that in the embryo secondary neurulation only occurs in the posterior-most neural tube and implies that the mode of neurulation can be experimentally decoupled from the AP identity. Furthermore, the ability to generate hTLSs from both ESCs and iPSCs with high reproducibility offers the potential for modelling patient-specific phenotypes, providing a platform for investigating disease mechanisms.</p><p id="P41">Overall, we have shown that interactions between the somites and neural tube leads to patterning events including mediolateral <italic>ALDH1A2</italic> expression in somites and elements of a DV-like axis in the neural tube, mediated through localised RA signalling. All of these events are spontaneous and self-organised, and can enable us to explore how feedback and relay mechanisms combine to enable co-development across tissues in a human developmental context.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Mouse work</title><p id="P42">All experiments carried out on mice were conducted according to the UK Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act under license PP6551133.
