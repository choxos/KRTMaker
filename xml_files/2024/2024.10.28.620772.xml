Nevertheless, they are associated with a high risk of infections, largely due to biofilm formation on catheter surfaces. Silicone is not inherently prone to bacterial adhesion; therefore, it is unclear as to what drives catheter infection and consequent biofilm formation. Previously it has been shown that circulating immune cells, including neutrophils and monocytes may adhere onto and die by apoptosis on silicone surfaces. This study investigates how immune cell death on silicone surfaces contributes to bacterial biofilm formation. The results show that neutrophil apoptosis on silicone surfaces significantly increases biofilm formation. Also, components of dead neutrophils were sufficient to cause increased biofilm formation. Further, silicone surfaces modified with a hyaluronic acid/polyarginine (HA/PA) coating reduce immune cell attachment and consequently biofilm formation. These findings suggest that to prevent catheter infection and biofilm formation, in addition to preventing bacterial attachment, it is necessary to minimize immune cell death on the catheter surface.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Catheter</kwd><kwd>neutrophil</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>nosocomial infections</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Venous catheters, particularly silicone-based ones, are indispensable in modern healthcare, facilitating vital functions such as the administration of intravenous medication and sampling of blood. Despite their widespread use, venous catheters pose a significant risk of infections. For example, central venous catheters have been linked to bloodstream infections, which constitute a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients, with mortality rates ranging from 12% to 40% <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">The most common microbial pathogens associated with venous catheter related infections are gram-negative bacilli such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and the grampositive <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> species <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. These microorganisms possess virulence factors that facilitate adherence to catheter surfaces and biofilm formation, perpetuating the risk of infection. However, silicone, the material used to make the catheter tubing, is not known to promote bacterial adherence or biofilm formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Hence, the question that remains to be answered is what facilitates the adhesion of bacteria onto silicone-based catheters that results in biofilm formation.</p><p id="P4">Silicone surfaces are known to affect neutrophil function, chemotaxis and promote death of these cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Additionally, recent investigations have revealed that exposure to silicone-based materials can induce alterations in the activation, cytokine production, and phagocytic capacity of monocytes and macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. These studies led us to hypothesize that innate immune cell alterations and death on silicone catheter surfaces promotes bacterial biofilm formation. Herein, we demonstrate that the attachment of innate immune cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes, on silicone surfaces promotes bacterial biofilm formation. Specifically, we show that death of neutrophils on the surface is a driver of biofilms. Finally, we demonstrate that a hyaluronic acid/polyarginine (HA/PA) surface coating reduces cell attachment onto the silicone surface, resulting in lower bacterial biofilm formation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell Lines</title><p id="P5">HL-60 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), CCL-240), a neutrophil-like cell line, were cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM [Merck, USA]) supplemented with 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Thermo-fisher Scientific, USA) in 25 cm<sup>2</sup> or 75 cm<sup>2</sup> cell culture flasks as required.

Post coating, BSA solution was removed from the tubes and 2 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS), or IMDM/RPMI media supplemented with FBS (Complete media [CM]), or 1 million HL-60/THP-1 cells in IMDM/RPMI media supplemented with FBS was added to three different PS or silicone tubes.</p><p id="P8">The PS tubes served as a material control to compare against silicone.

The falcon was centrifuged at 500 rcf for 20 min at room temperature in the absence of braking to stop the centrifugation, which enabled separation of blood cells into different layers based on their density. The plasma layer appears at the very top, with a thin layer of PBMCs (buffy coat) between the plasma and Histopaque layer, followed by a pellet containing the PMNLs and RBCs. The buffy coat and bottom layer containing PMNLs and RBC were transferred to two different 15 mL tubes. Human RBC lysis buffer (150 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 10mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 mM EDTA) was added to each tube (1 mL to the tube containing PBMCs, and 10 mL [1:10 ratio] to the tube containing PMNLs) and allowed to rest for 20 min at room temperature for the lysis to occur. The tubes were spun at 500 rcf for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were then resuspended in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Thermo-Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS and counted.

Next, the tubes were thoroughly washed with deionized water to get rid of the excess crystal violet stain and allowed to air dry. Later, 1 mL of 33% glacial acetic acid was added to the tubes, which were then placed on a rotor for 30 min for de-staining to occur.

Based on this information, we hypothesized that innate immune cell surveillance of and death on silicone catheter surfaces makes it conducive for bacteria and other pathogens to attach and form biofilms. To test this hypothesis, innate immune cell surveillance experiments using HL-60 and THP-1 cell lines were performed.</p><p id="P22">Silicone surfaces are not conducive for bacterial growth, and we observe the same in our control studies in which the surface was treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by bacterial exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1a</xref>). Exposure of the silicone surface to cell culture media containing serum proteins also did not result in a significant increase in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation. In contrast, we observed that surveillance of the silicone surface by THP-1 or HL-60 cells for 8 or 24 hours results in increased <italic>E. coli</italic>-based biofilm formation as measured using a crystal violet assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1a</xref>). Confirming the crystal violet quantification data are representative scanning electron micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1</xref>) that show biofilms on silicone surfaces after they have been exposed to cells. The increase in biofilm formation post-immune cell surveillance occurred on polystyrene surfaces (used as a material control) too but was more apparent on the silicone surfaces.</p><p id="P23">Counting the immune cells post their surveillance of the surfaces revealed a loss in cell number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2A</xref>) suggestive of either cell attachment to the material surface or death due to interaction, or both. The planktonic bacterial counts (colony forming units of <italic>E. coli</italic>) after 48 hours of incubation in the tubes revealed no differences in total numbers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2B</xref>) demonstrating that the bacteria did not grow more in the tubes that had been surveyed by immune cells.</p><p id="P24">To confirm that the findings were not due to the use of cell-lines, the same experiment was performed using whole blood, polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNLs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from apparently healthy human volunteers. PMNL and whole blood surveillance of the silicone surface resulted in higher biofilm formation on the surface post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). However, PBMC surveillance of the surface did not follow the trend.

As a further confirmation that cell death was driving the biofilm formation, we first lysed the HL-60 cells, and incubated the lysed components with the silicone surfaces. After such an exposure, bacteria were added to these surfaces, and we observed that the lysed cell components were indeed sufficient to promote bacterial biofilm formation on silicone surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Silicone surface modification to prevent catheter infection</title><p id="P28">Microbial attachment on bare silicone surfaces is known to be negligible.

Hence, silicone surfaces need to be modified to not only prevent bacterial but also neutrophil adhesion. We demonstrate that a HA/PA coating reduces neutrophil death on the modified surface, which in turn results in lower bacterial biofilm formation on these surfaces. In summary, coating of silicone surfaces that reduces neutrophil and other immune cell death, is a promising approach to minimize biofilm formation on catheters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary</label><media xlink:href="EMS199776-supplement-Supplementary.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d5aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a DBT-Wellcome India Alliance Intermediate fellowship to SJ (grant number IA/I/19/1/504265).
