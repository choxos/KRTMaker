While these changes result in altered mechanotransduction, the epigenetic basis of rejuvenating aging cells remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effects of compressive forces on nuclear mechanotransduction and epigenetic rejuvenation in aged HDFs. Using a compressive force application model, the activation of HDFs through alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) is demonstrated. Sustained compressive forces induce significant epigenetic modifications, including chromatin remodeling and altered histone methylation patterns. These epigenetic changes correlate with enhanced cellular migration and rejuvenation. Small-scale drug screening identifies the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway as a key mediator of compression-induced epigenetic activation. Furthermore, implanting aged cell spheroids to an aged skin model and subjecting the tissue with compressing forces resulted in increased collagen I protein levels. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that applying compressive force to aged fibroblasts activates global epigenetic changes through the ERK signaling pathway, ultimately rejuvenating cellular functions with potential applications for wound healing and skin tissue regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mechanical rejuvenation</kwd><kwd>epigenetic activation</kwd><kwd>ERK signaling pathway</kwd><kwd>human dermal fibroblasts</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Classification</title><kwd>Biological Sciences</kwd><kwd>Cell Biology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cellular aging is accompanied by various changes in the characteristics of cells, such as genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic changes, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). For example, dermal fibroblasts secrete various extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) into the dermal compartment and contribute to matrix stiffness of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Many studies have shown that aging leads to accumulation of senescent fibroblasts resulting in decreased ECM production thereby leading to a loss of skin tissue integrity and of wound healing properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). A major challenge in the field is how such aging cells can be activated or rejuvenated. Current strategies to combat aging include induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and mechanical reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>), metabolic manipulation (daily or intermittent caloric restriction), blood transfusion, small molecule drugs (Rapamycin, Metformin, Ascorbate and Aspirin) and senescent cell ablation (Senolytics) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Mechanical forces (stretch, shear, compression) have also been shown to activate major signaling pathways, cytoskeleton/chromatin remodeling and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Sincecells sense extracellular mechanical cues in tissue microenvironments, we hypothesized that compressive forces could enable the activation/rejuvenation of aging cells. Recent literature has also shown that cancer cells under tissue compression could get activated to a metastatic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Based on previous studies, including our own, on the effects of compressive force on cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>), we designed an engineered tissue embedded with aging cells and revealed that tissue compression could provide important avenues for cell activation/rejuvenation.</p><p id="P3">In this paper, we develop a force application device, which includes human dermal fibroblasts (derived from a 75 year old healthy male donor) embedded in a 3D collagen hydrogel matrix and subjected to external loading in the form of static compressive force. Using a fibroblast spheroid model, we show that HDFs can be activated by compressive force, as evidenced by increased levels of α Smooth Muscle actin (αSMA) and the accompanying cellular memory responses. In particular, we measure the levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC) levels, cytoskeletal remodeling, chromatin modifications, reduced DNA damage, global gene expression, and cell migration to demonstrate the activation of HDFs. A key element of the activation process involves the clumping of aged cells into spheroids before the application of force, as single cells embedded in a collagen matrix under compressive force do not undergo activation. We also validated our findings in an artificial aged skin model and observed an increase trend in collagen 1protein levels in the spheroid injection group compared to the single-cell injection group. Collectively, our results provide compelling evidence that tissue compression results in the activation of potential rejuvenation of aging cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Compressive force induces transient activation of fibroblasts and promotes rejuvenation</title><p id="P4">We established two models for 3D cell culture: one involves embedding aged fibroblasts as single cells in a collagen hydrogel (hereafter called the single cell model), and the other involves aged fibroblasts as spheroids embedded in a collagen hydrogel (called spheroid model) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref>). To achieve the spheroid model, GM08401 fibroblasts (75 year old donor, old group) and GM09503 fibroblasts (10 year old donor, young group) were cultured on fibronectin-coated micropatterns overnight to form spheroids with diameters ranging from 50 μm to 150 μm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>), resulting in spheroids with cell numbers ranging from 30 to 100 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). We added collagen hydrogel 1 mg/ml concentration on top of the spheroids and applied a metal or glass ring to confine the 3D matrix, preventing collagen hydrogel shrinkage during the cell culture process (see Methods). Finally, a compressive force ~5% strain (referred as 1xload) and ~15% strain (referred as 2xload) was added on top of the collagen hydrogel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A, S1D and S1E</xref>) followed by culturing for 48 hours.</p><p id="P5">After two days of culture, we evaluated fibroblast activation using immunofluorescence markers such as αSMA and pMLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). We found that cells in the single cell 3D model showed low expression of αSMA, when compared to the 3D spheroid model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), although the F-actin expression level is higher in the single cell model as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>. These results suggest that the activation of fibroblasts was more pronounced in spheroid models, highlighting the importance of compressive forces in 3D spheroid to regulate cellular function. In subsequent studies, we will therefore use the spheroid model to assess its applications to cellular rejuvenation.</p><p id="P6">Under compressive force conditions, both old and young fibroblasts became activated, as indicated by the increased level of αSMA compared to the unload group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A and Figure S3B</xref>). The increased level of pMLC also implies that these cells are in an active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Since senescence is a hallmark of aging, we sought to determine if the application of compressive force alters senescence-associated properties. Towards this we performed beta-galactosidase staining and found fewer positively stained cells in the 2xload group, suggesting that the applied load reduces senescence of aged cells as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>. Next, we measured the persistence of the activated state of the fibroblasts in the 2xload group. To do this we removed the load after culturing the cells in 3D under load condition for 48 hours and continued to culture for 5 days as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>. We found that the αSMA level increased at day 1 and then decreased at day 4 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>) suggesting that fibroblasts were transiently activated. Further, many of the cellular and nuclear morphometric parameters that changed with compressive force were also reversed upon the removal of compressive force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C and S3D</xref>). In summary, the increased cell contractility, as evidenced by elevated αSMA and pMLC levels, along with reduced senescence under compressive force conditions and the ability to revert back to a non-activated state after removing the load, suggesting that our spheroid model with load application has the potential to induce rejuvenation properties in aged cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Mechanical force stabilizes microtubules and facilitates chromatin remodeling</title><p id="P7">Since cellular aging is accompanied by alterations in cytoskeletal and chromatin remodeling, we next evaluate the role of compressive forces on such cytoskeletal and chromatin remodeling. Upon application of compressive forces, microtubule reorganization was more evident as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, compared to F-actin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2E</xref>). α-tubulin intensity, a component of microtubules, is higher after the application of compressive load, and the microtubule network is much more complex compared to the unload group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9A-C</xref>). In addition, Lamin A/C, a nuclear protein playing a key role in force transmission from the cytosol into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), showed not much significant differences between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Lamin B interacts with chromatin and contributes to nuclear organization, by anchoring heterochromatin to the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Compared to unload group, Lamin B intensity increased in 2xload group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6C</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Cells undergo chromatin remodeling in response to mechanical forces as a protective mechanism to maintain genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Our subsequent investigation focused on chromatin organization, highlighting key players such as H3K9me3 (Histone 3 Lysine 9 Trimethylation), H3K4me3 (Histone 3 Lysine 4 Trimethylation) and HP1a (Heterochromatin Protein 1 alpha). H3K9me3 and H3K4me3 are commonly associated with distinct chromatin regions, with H3K9me3 linked to heterochromatin and H3K4me3 associated with euchromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), while HP1a, binding to H3K9me3, plays a crucial role in forming and maintaining heterochromatin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). In line with these findings, compressive forces on HDFs resulted in increased levels of H3K9me3, and HP1a, and decreased levels of H3K4me3, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A, S6B</xref>. Interestingly, upon removal of the load, HP1a level exhibited an increase trend as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6B</xref>. Consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, high resolution DAPI-stained images of nuclei showed increased puncta like structure in 2xload group and an analysis of nuclear morphology and chromatin intensity features demonstrated condensed chromatin under mechanical load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) and an increased ratio of heterochromatin to euchromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6D and TableS4</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that mechanical force not only stabilizes microtubules but also contributes to increased chromatin condensation possibly contributing to genome stability.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Mechanical force enhances cell migration primarily through nucleus-cytoskeleton axis</title><p id="P9">Upon observing the activation of fibroblasts and increased microtubule organization with compressive forces, we subsequently investigated its role on cell migration. Since cellular aging results in reduced cell migration, the goal of these experiments was to assess if mechanical forces increased cell migration, as possible routes to cellular rejuvenation. In both old and young groups, under compressive force conditions, cell migration was significantly higher than in the unloaded groups, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>. In addition, cell migration speed in the aged cells increases with the applied load, as depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C and S2D</xref> also shows cell migration enhanced with compressive load and after removal of the load. Since cellular perception of compressive forces are transduced via membrane proteins such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), Piezo, integrins, and calcium channels, and transduce these signals into the nucleus via cytoskeletal components including actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), we carried out a small-scale drug screen to identify critical signaling intermediates in our compressive force induced HDF activation and migration.</p><p id="P10">In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-E</xref> (large area as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A-C</xref>), we applied several inhibitors to perturb possible intermediators shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>. We found that Latrunculin A, Nocodazole, and PD98059 are the three most effective inhibitors which inhibit cell migration among these interventions. Apart from the above-mentioned inhibitors, the Y27632 (ROCK inhibitor) group reduces the cell migration area but the cell number increases. On the other hand, in the PF-573228 (FAK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>)) group, cell migration was not significantly affected compared to the 2xload group. Collectively, we identified that inhibition of actin, microtubules and ERK pathway had a critical role in force induced HDF activation and migration. Given the specific roles of ERK pathway in aging and rejuvenation, we next assessed the interplay between compressive forces, chromatin organization, DNA damage and transcription control with a particular focus on ERK inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Mechanical load orchestrates chromatin reorganization, and diminishes DNA damage through ERK Signaling</title><p id="P11">Based on our findings showing that PD98059 inhibits cell migration to a greater extent, our next step is to investigate the effect of ERK inhibitor on chromatin remodeling and gene expression. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, immunofluorescence of pERK reveals that ERK undergoes phosphorylation and translocates into the nucleus upon compressive forces. After adding drug PD98059, pERK level decreased in the nucleus as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> (images are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Next, we measured H3K9me3 and H3K4me3 levels and observed an increase of these markers in the PD98059 group as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6A</xref>. Increase in H3K9me3 and H3K4me3 suggests that ERK plays a role in the regulation of chromatin organization through histone modification. Lamin B expression level decreased after adding PD98059 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6C</xref>. This suggests that the nuclear translocation of pERK may potentially affect chromatin structure and the activity of transcriptional regulators.</p><p id="P13">We then examined whether cells experienced DNA damage by assessing γH2AX, a well-established DNA damage marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Surprisingly, our observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref> revealed a notable mitigation of cellular DNA damage under mechanical load as indicated in foci number. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7A</xref>, where the fixed unload group and fixed load group serve as control groups, DRAQ7 staining data revealed the appearance of dead cells in the spheroid center under compressive force conditions. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7B</xref>, upon addition of the drug PD98059, we observed an increase in the level of γH2AX in the unload condition, indicating an elevation in DNA damage. To further investigate the impact of mechanical load on DNA damage response, we introduced cisplatin, a known inducer of DNA damage. Remarkably, in the 2xload+cisplatin group, cellular damage decreased compared to the unload+cisplatin group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The observed protective effects against DNA damage prompts the hypothesis that compressive force promotes DNA repair. Next, we sought to investigate whether ATM, a key protein kinase, is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage under force conditions. Surprisingly, in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), the administration of KU55933 (an ATM inhibitor) did not significantly affect DNA damage compared to 2xload group, and cell migration remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D and 3E</xref>). Similarly, there were no statistically significant changes observed in the γH2AX levels between the 2xl+PD98059 group and the load groups. Moreover, the γH2AX level in the 2xl+PD98059 group shows a non-significant decreasing trend compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). This prompts the hypothesis that compressive force prevents DNA damage not via an ATM-dependent ERK signaling pathway, but possibly through a mechanism involving physical force-induced chromatin interactions. Next, we investigated whether DNA damage affects the activation properties under mechanical force using immunofluorescence levels of αSMA. As shown In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>, the immunofluorescence images from all four conditions showed lower levels of αSMA in cisplatin groups compared to compressive load conditions. These findings underscore the intricate involvement of ERK in governing cellular processes, ranging from chromatin organization to DNA damage response.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Coupling between ERK signaling and differential gene expression upon compressive forces</title><p id="P15">To further characterize transcription profiles and gene expression changes associated with enhanced migration, rejuvenation, and ERK signaling pathways, we conducted global RNA sequencing analysis under different conditions as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10A-D</xref>. From the RNA-Seq analysis, we observed significant upregulation of 278 genes in the 2xl group compared to the unload condition (fold change &gt; 2, adjusted p value &lt; 0.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>), and 612 genes were upregulated in the 2xl group compared to the PD98059 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Gene Ontology (GO) biological process analysis of these differentially expressed genes (278 and 612 DEGs) revealed enrichment in cell migration along with other important cellular processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the 278 DEGs highlighted the involvement of Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) during this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S12A</xref>). GO cellular component analysis of the 278 DEGs revealed that they are associated with extracellular matrix, while GO molecular function analysis indicated enrichment in growth factor activity, extracellular matrix structural constituent, and metallopeptidase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10E</xref>). Similarly, KEGG analysis of the 612 DEGs validated the importance of MAPKs in this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S12B</xref>). GO cellular component analysis for the 612 DEGs showed enrichment in the extracellular matrix, while GO molecular function analysis highlighted their association with growth factor receptor activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10F</xref>). The overlap of 119 genes between the 278 DEGs and 612 DEGs showed consistent results in terms of GO biological process analysis, GO cellular component analysis, GO molecular function analysis, and KEGG pathway analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10D and S10G</xref>). Additionally, FOXO signaling pathway involvement was noted in KEGG pathway analysis, underscoring its significance in rejuvenation.</p><p id="P17">Subsequent analysis of gene expression using DE-seq normalized results revealed changes in several genes. We divided these into groups based on their enrichment in the functional pathways such as ERK-related genes, microtubule-related genes, migration-related genes, DNA repair-related genes, and rejuvenation-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Among the ERK-related genes, downregulation was observed in most genes in the PD98059 group, while upregulation of Insulin Receptor (<italic>INSR</italic>), Son of Sevenless homolog 1 (<italic>SOS1</italic>), Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase A1 (<italic>RPS6KA1</italic>), B-Raf Proto-Oncogene (<italic>BRAF</italic>), Epidermal Growth Factor (<italic>EGF</italic>), and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (<italic>EGFR</italic>) in the 2xload group suggested their involvement in ERK activation, directly or indirectly.

DNA repair-related mechanisms encompassing base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination, mismatch repair, Fanconi anemia pathway, and non-homologous end-joining were examined (KEGG pathway information reviewed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S13 A-F</xref>). Notably, upregulation of <italic>USP1, RMI2,</italic> and <italic>FANCE</italic> in the 2xload group, associated with the Fanconi anemia pathway, was observed among DNA repair-related genes.

Our previous work demonstrated that compressive force induces actin depolymerization and leads to transcriptional quiescence at 2D single cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). However, in 3D, compressive forces have been shown to activate cancer cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). In this paper, we hypothesized that by forming spheroids of aged cells which lead to the depolymerization of cytoskeletal filaments, may trigger activation pathways upon the application of compressive forces.</p><p id="P21">In particular, cells and nuclei adopt a relatively rounder morphology, compared to polarized single cells, when clumped in the designed pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). In this configuration, they exhibit a soft, highly sensitive state, poised to respond to external cues and initiate cellular processes. When such cells experience external forces at a global level, the highly viscoelastic cytoskeletal organization can activate cytoskeletal remodeling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). This process entails the dynamic reorganization of actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments, forming networks that serve as mechanotransducers. These networks could facilitate the direct transmission of mechanical signals from the extracellular environment to the nucleus via the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, ultimately influencing downstream gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Conversely, the nucleus, which exhibits active rheological properties, can function as the primary mechano-sensor when subjected to sudden compressive forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). In our model, we observed a clear increase in cell contractility, as indicated by elevated levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC). Additionally, we noted a complex reorganization of the microtubule network, accompanied by an increase in Lamin B expression and enhanced chromatin remodeling marked by increased levels of H3K9me3 and HP1a, while H3K4me3 decreased. These findings suggest that mechanical forces trigger cytoskeleton reorganization and chromatin remodeling.</p><p id="P22">Previous study has demonstrated that mechanical forces increase αSMA expression and its incorporation into actin filaments by activating two distinct signaling pathways: Rho/Serum Response Factor (SRF) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase p38 (MAPK p38)/SRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Consistent with these findings, our results indicate an increase in αSMA expression under compressive loading conditions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>. As cells age, it is commonly observed that H3K9me3 levels decrease while H3K4me3 levels increase, accompanied by decreased HP1a levels and reduced LaminB expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Surprisingly, in our novel model, we observed a converse trend. These findings suggest that the clumped HDFs (spheroids), upon sensing compressive forces, initiate fibroblast activation pathways including their potential rejuvenation, a notion further supported by our beta-galactosidase staining results.</p><p id="P23">Previous research has elucidated the role of mechanical compression in regulating cancer cell migration through the MEK1/ERK1 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In this study, compressive force enhanced cell migration, but whether this migration is driven by microtubules is unknown. During migration, cells extend filopodial or lamellipodial protrusions, form focal adhesions, and undergo cytoskeletal reorganization to generate force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). ERK phosphorylates key proteins involved in these processes, including microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), calpain, and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), thereby providing essential cues for cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Additionally, phosphorylated ERK functions as a mechanosensory transcription factor capable of shuttling between the nucleus and cytosol to regulate gene expression, thereby exerting influence over cell migration dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). In our study, we demonstrated the significance of the force transmission pathway between the cytoskeleton and nucleus, as well as ERK signaling, in influencing cell migration. Employing a targeted approach, we conducted small-scale inhibitor screening and utilized a dominant-negative (DN) KASH construct to dissect the specific pathways involved. Our findings revealed that inhibitors targeting the cytoskeleton, including Blebbistatin, Cytochalasin D, Latrunculin A, Nocodazole, and Withaferin A, significantly impeded cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-E</xref>). This underscores the critical role of the cytoskeleton in mediating force transmission essential for cell motility. Moreover, disruption of the LINC complex by the DN KASH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B-E</xref>) construct corroborated these observations, further emphasizing the importance of the cytoskeleton-nucleus connections in governing cell migration dynamics. Inhibition of ERK1/ERK2 with PD98059 resulted in a notable decrease in cell migration distance. This highlights the pivotal role of ERK signaling in cell migration. In contrast, inhibition of FAK with PF-573228 had minimal effects on cell migration, highlighting the differential roles of focal adhesion-related signaling pathways.</p><p id="P24">Upon activation, ERK undergoes phosphorylation, resulting in its transformed state, pERK, which then translocates into the nucleus to regulate histone modifications. While a previous study suggested that ERK activation increases H3K4me3 levels in 2D culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), interestingly in our 3D model with compressive forces, inhibition of ERK led to an increase in H3K4me3. We propose a possible mechanistic explanation for this observation: under compressive force conditions, perturbation of ERK affects cytoskeletal structure, resulting in reduced cytoskeletal formation and increased softness of the nucleus, as indicated by decreased laminB levels. This could result in higher levels of both H3K4me3 (a euchromatin marker) and H3K9me3 (a heterochromatin marker), reflecting a global change in chromatin architecture in response to ERK perturbation under compressive force conditions.</p><p id="P25">Our RNA-seq data revealed that under compressive force conditions, the expression of genes such as <italic>INSR, BRAF, EGF, and EGFR</italic> increased. These genes are upstream regulators of the ERK pathway, which initiates ERK signaling cascades in response to various extracellular stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). Additionally, the expression of <italic>RPS6KA1</italic>, also known as <italic>RSK1</italic>, increased. <italic>RPS6KA1</italic> is a downstream effector of the ERK pathway and is involved in mediating cellular responses to ERK activation. Several studies have highlighted the role of mechanical force in regulating key signaling molecules such as the insulin receptor, <italic>BRAF</italic>, and <italic>EGFR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Our study presents novel findings demonstrating that mechanical force activates aged dermal human fibroblasts through the ERK signaling pathway. As mechanosensory genes, we observed an upregulation of <italic>YAP1</italic>, <italic>TRPV4</italic>, and <italic>PIEZO2</italic> gene expression levels under 2x load conditions compared to the unloaded state, while <italic>PIEZO1</italic> was downregulated under 2x load conditions. Intriguingly, when the ERK inhibitor PD98059 was applied, <italic>TRPV4</italic> and <italic>PIEZO1</italic> gene expression levels were further inhibited, indicating a potential link between ERK and <italic>TRPV4/PIEZO1</italic> in our model. Consistently, previous research has demonstrated that mechanical forces can regulate <italic>TRPV4</italic> and <italic>PIEZOs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>). Moreover, another study has shown that mechanical force can activate TRPV4, subsequently leading to the induction of the ERK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>). These findings align with our observations and support the notion of a mechanistic relationship between mechanical force, <italic>TRPV4/PIEZO1</italic>, and activation of ERK signaling pathway. Upon inhibiting ERK, we observed the upregulation of <italic>CLASP2</italic>, <italic>MAP2</italic>, <italic>MAPT</italic>, and <italic>HSPA1A</italic> genes, which are known to be involved in microtubule dynamics. This suggests the presence of a compensatory response or feedback mechanism triggered by the inhibition of ERK signaling, highlighting the intricate interplay between mechanical force, ERK signaling, and cellular responses related to microtubule dynamics.</p><p id="P26">We observed a reduction in DNA damage under compressive force conditions, as indicated by decreased γH2AX immunostaining, suggesting enhanced DNA repair mechanisms. Our RNA sequencing data revealed the involvement of the Fanconi anemia pathway, known for anti-oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>). This reduction in DNA damage aligns with the activation or rejuvenation required for aging cells. Previous study demonstrated decreased DNA damage under load conditions attributed to heterochromatin organization and low levels of H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>).</p><p id="P27">However, our results showed an upregulation of H3K9me3, potentially due to differences in cell culture models (2D vs. 3D). Notably, we observed no change in nucleus stiffness, as indicated by Lamin A/C immunostaining data. In our RNA sequencing data, rejuvenation-related genes such as <italic>MBD2</italic>, <italic>KL</italic>, <italic>SIRT1</italic>, <italic>NFE2L2</italic>, <italic>LBR</italic>, and <italic>FOXO3</italic> were upregulated. <italic>MBD2</italic> can reduce CpG methylation levels, delaying aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>). <italic>KL</italic> has been shown to improve cognitive function, serving as a longevity factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). <italic>SIRT</italic> and <italic>FOXO3</italic> are known to slow cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>), while <italic>NFE2L2</italic> acts as a transcription factor sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO), induced by exercise, and protects cells against cytotoxic and oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). Upregulation of LBR can increase cell proliferation and suppress genomic instability, supporting the rejuvenating process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Upon load removal, cells maintained their migration behavior, initially exhibiting sustained high levels of αSMA followed by a decrease in our model, along with sustained increased expression of HP1a. The persistent expression of HP1a indicates that chromatin organization remains unchanged even after load removal within 5 days. The sustained expression of αSMA initially followed by a decrease in our model represents an intriguing finding, particularly considering that prolonged αSMA expression is associated with fibrosis. In the skin tissue model, after two days of incubation, the spheroid group exhibited higher secretion of collagen 1 compared to the single-cell group, highlighting the significance of compressive force induced tissue regeneration properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Collectively, the activation of fibroblasts upon compressive force, cytoskeletal and chromatin remodeling, and transition from a mesenchymal to collective migration mode of aged HDFs may signify cellular rejuvenation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>), crucial for both tissue regeneration and wound healing and could serve as a valuable platform for drug screening.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Fabrication of micropatterned PDMS stamps and microcontact printing</title><p id="P29">Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, SYLGRAD™ 184 Silicone Elastomer Kit) elastomer is prepared by blending the base and curing agent at a 10:1 ratio. A typical quantity of 20-25g proves sufficient to entirely coat the custom wafer surface (1,800 μm<sup>2</sup> rectangles, (aspect ratio 1:5), distance between rectangles is 500μm). PDMS is poured onto the wafer, and subjected to degases within a vacuum chamber for 30 minutes until the absence of air bubbles on the surface is achieved. Subsequently, the curing process is initiated at a temperature of 60°C for a duration of 3 hours. Following the cooling phase, the PDMS material is carefully detached from the substrate using a pair of tweezers. It is then sectioned into a round 1cm<sup>2</sup> square pieces and stored within clean containers to avert the accumulation of particulate matter. The PDMS surface is activated by a Plasma machine (Henniker Plasma, HPT-200). Briefly, O2 gas was used by exposing the stamps to it for 1.5 min at 75% power, with pressure 0.4mbar.

Statement</title></caption><p>Partial rejuvenation of aging cells is desirable but is still a major challenge. In this paper, we demonstrate that aged human dermal fibroblasts, embedded in a 3D collagen hydrogel matrix as spheroids, subjected to external static compressive force exhibit partial rejuvenation. Through immunofluorescence, small-scale inhibitor screen and gene expression analysis, we identify some of the critical mechanotransduction pathways in this process. Collectively, our results provide compelling evidence that tissue compression results in the activation of potential rejuvenation pathways in aging cells.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Establishment of 3D collagen hydrogel in-vitro model upon compressive forces and characterization activation, rejuvenation and memory properties of the regenerated phenotypes.</title><p>(A) Schematic of 3D in-vitro collagen model (single cell embedding and spheroid embedding) and illustration of the cell culture process.
