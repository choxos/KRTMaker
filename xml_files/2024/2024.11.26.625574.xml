In malaria, the risk of severe disease increases with age in non-immune individuals. Malaria severity is in part driven by inflammation, but the specific cells and mechanisms contributing to age-dependent disease risk are incompletely understood. Here, we assessed inflammatory cytokines in non-immune children and adults with clinical malaria, and the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional differences of in vitro innate cell responders to malaria parasites in naive children and adults. During naturally acquired malaria, age was associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CXCL8, CXLC9, along with CRP, and IDO, which were associated with clinical symptoms. In malaria naive individuals, classical monocyte and Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cell responses from adults were characterized by higher inflammatory cytokine production, and transcriptional activation following stimulation with malaria parasites. Classical monocyte responses in adults were dominated by CCL2 production, while in children the response had increased IL10 production and enrichment in IL10 signaling pathways upon parasite stimulation. This heightened inflammatory response in adults was not mitigated by parasite induced Tregs. Taken together, these findings identify cellular mechanisms of age-dependent host responses that play crucial roles in driving inflammatory responses in malaria.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd>age</kwd><kwd>disease severity</kwd><kwd>monocytes</kwd><kwd>γδ</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Age is an intrinsic factor in the host response to infection, with implications for disease pathogenesis and severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). A recent systematic analysis revealed that for many infections, disease severity follows a ‘J’ or ‘U’ curve with age, with a relatively high risk in infants followed by the lowest risk in older children, before severity risk increases again in adults and the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). The immune mechanisms underpinning these age dependent changes are largely unknown. For malaria, caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasite infection, the global clinical burden predominantly occurs in children, who experience the highest risk of severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). In high-transmission endemic areas, children are repeatedly infected before developing immunity which protects into adulthood, with disease severity following an ‘L’ distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). However, in areas where malaria control has reduced transmission intensity, the burden of severe disease shifts from infants to older children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Further, in low-transmission regions with unstable malaria, exposure and clinical immunity in childhood is much less common, and clinical disease, severe malaria and fatal <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria is seen in both children and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). As seen for other infections, host age in these non-immune populations is an intrinsic factor in malaria pathogenesis and disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). In malaria-naive migrant populations moving from malaria-free to endemic areas, risk of severe disease is higher in adults compared to children during initial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Consistent with this, amongst patients with severe disease, risk of death is higher in adults compared to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Age-dependent mechanisms contributing to the risk of severe malaria are incompletely understood.</p><p id="P4">Acquisition of adaptive immunity increases with exposure, concurrently with age, complicating our ability to identify age-intrinsic mechanisms of disease risk. Indeed, few studies have compared innate immune inflammatory responses in children and adults with naturally acquired falciparum malaria, which is only possible in low transmission areas where immunity is also low, and all ages are susceptible to malaria. Clinical symptoms of malaria occur during the blood stage of parasite infection, where activation of immune cells and production of inflammatory mediators contribute to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Important innate immune cell responders include classical monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), and the innate lymphocyte γδ T cell subset expressing Vγ9Vδ2 TCR (Vδ2 T cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). These cells produce key inflammatory cytokines which are associated with severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>), and control of these inflammatory responses is associated with tolerogenic immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). For example, in immune Malian adults there is an expansion of regulatory monocytes which produce IL10 in response to malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). This expansion is malaria-driven, with Malian children having monocytes phenotypically and functionally similar to malaria-naive adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). However, no malaria-naive children were included in this study, so the influence of age on the monocyte response to malaria parasites is unknown. Similarly, reduced risk of malaria disease following repeat falciparum infection is associated with a reduction in the inflammatory cytokine response by γδ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). However, age associated changes to Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells have also been reported, with increased inflammatory and cytotoxic potential expanding markedly after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). The impact of these age-driven changes on the ability of malaria-naive individuals to respond to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites is unknown.</p><p id="P5">Here, leveraging a unique cohort of children and adults with falciparum malaria from a pre-elimination low transmission area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), we identify inflammatory cytokines which are associated with age and clinical symptoms. To dissect cells mechanisms contributing to age-dependent inflammation during malaria, we examined monocyte and Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells responses to parasite stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic> using cells from malaria-naive children and adults. Together, data dissected the impact of host age on the innate immune cell responses to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Inflammatory cytokine levels correlate with age in naturally acquired malaria</title><p id="P6">Malaria disease severity, partly driven by inflammation, is associated with age in non-immune populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). In malaria endemic areas with high transmission, immunity develops with age, and adults rarely experience symptomatic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). To examine the effect of age on malaria-induced inflammation during natural infection, we analyzed inflammatory markers in plasma samples collected from children and adults who were enrolled in previously completed studies in a low malaria transmission area in Malaysia, where all ages remain susceptible to disease due to the limited prior exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) (total n=97, 78 male (80%), age 21[15-45] years (median[IQR]), n=79 from patients presenting with malaria at Kudat Division district hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), and n=18 enrolled at a tertiary referral hospital for the West Coast and Kudat division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Amongst malaria patients, 73 (75.3%) had uncomplicated malaria, with the remainder having severe disease. Amongst malaria patients in this sample set, parasitemia was not associated with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <italic>rho</italic>=0.055, <italic>p</italic>=0.59). Plasma concentrations of 13 analytes related to immune inflammation were analyzed, revealing a positive correlation among inflammatory markers CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, as well as IDO and IL10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). These cytokines also correlated with parasitemia, consistent with a role of parasite burden in inflammation and disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Age was significantly correlated with CRP, CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3, CXCL8, CXLC9, and IDO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b/c</xref>). Age associations were not driven by severe disease, with all correlations remaining significant when considering only patients with uncomplicated malaria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>). To assess if age-dependent inflammatory cytokines may contribute to disease, associations between disease symptoms and analytes were explored. Inflammatory analytes that were significantly associated with age, were also higher in patients with symptoms of rigors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>), myalgia (muscle pain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>), headache (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>) and arthralgia (joint pain) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1c</xref>). CRP was significantly higher in patients with these symptoms, while chemokines CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1α) and CXCL8 (IL-8) were significantly higher in patients with rigors and myalgia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1b-d</xref>). These relationships with symptoms were maintained when only analyzing patients &gt;12 years of age, to account for potential reduced self-reporting of symptoms in children (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1d</xref>). We also examined age relationships with objective clinical findings. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) data was available for 62 individuals (64%) and was weakly associated with increasing age (<italic>rho</italic>=0.24, <italic>p</italic>=0.06) and CCL2 (<italic>rho</italic>=0.22, <italic>p</italic>=0.081) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1e/f</xref>). Elevated ALT, a clinical measure of liver function, has been linked to parasite load and inflammatory responses during uncomplicated malaria caused by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>) and <italic>P. vivax</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) in populations with little pre-existing immunity. However, these findings suggest that patient age may also play a significant role in ALT elevations in non-immune individuals. Finally, we re-analyzed all clinical data from district hospital cohort, previously compared to other malaria species infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>), for difference in clinical presentation based on age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Among symptoms at enrollment, rigors, headache, myalgia and arthralgia were more frequent in adults consistent with increased inflammation and associations between inflammatory markers and symptoms. However, as mentioned this may be confounded by higher reported symptoms in adults. The objective clinical measure of oxygen saturation was also lower in adults, consistent with increased clinical disease with age. Together data highlight the relationship between age, inflammation and disease in malaria.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Inflammatory cytokine production in monocytes following malaria stimulation is higher in naive adults</title><p id="P7">To understand cellular responses that may mediate increased inflammation during malaria, we analyzed phenotypes, functions and transcriptional activation profiles of immune cells relevant to malaria responsiveness in a cohort of malaria-naive individuals (children, &lt;12 years, <italic>n</italic>=13, age 8 [3-12] years (median[IQR]), 38% female; adults <italic>n</italic>=13, age 42 [29-46] years (median[IQR]), 54% female, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Analysis of <italic>ex vivo</italic> cell frequencies and phenotypes identified several differences, including higher proportions of CD14<sup>+</sup> (classical) monocytes, CD16<sup>+</sup> (non-classical) monocytes, classical dendritic cells (cDCs) and natural killer cells (NKs) in adults and a higher proportion of Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells in children (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Among CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, adults had a higher proportion of Tfh cells, while other CD4+effector T cells and FoxP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cell (Treg) proportions were similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2d-e</xref>). Age dependent differences in expression of markers associated with activation and function (HLA-DR, CD86, CD16 and ICOS) were also detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2f-h</xref>). There was increased MHC-class II (HLA-DR) and Fc receptor (CD16) expression by classical DCs in adults but decreased co-stimulatory marker CD86 in cDCs, plasmacytoid DCs and classical monocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2d, f-h</xref>). Activation of Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells (CD86) and Tregs (HLA-DR and ICOS) was also higher in adults compared to children (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2d, f-g, i</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Classical monocytes are key innate cell responders to malaria parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) and are major contributors of the inflammatory cytokines associated with severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Additionally, monocytes are major contributors of the age associated chemokines/cytokines present in the clinical data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>), including CCL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>), CCL3/CCL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>) and IL10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). As such, we investigated if monocytes responded to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites in an age dependent manner. To investigate the impact of age on classical monocyte responses to malaria, PBMCs from malaria-naive children and adults were stimulated with <italic>P. falciparum-</italic>infected red blood cells (pRBCs) and production of IL10, IL6, IL1β, TNF and CCL2 quantified by intracellular staining (children <italic>n=</italic>13, adults <italic>n=</italic>12, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3a</xref>). The majority of parasite-induced cytokines were from classical monocytes, which could be distinguished from non-classical monocytes based on CD64 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3b/c</xref>). CD64 has stable expression in culture, unlike CD16 which is down regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Stimulation with pRBCs increased cytokine production in classical monocytes compared to uninfected red blood cells (uRBCs) in both children and adults for all the cytokines tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). However, the magnitude of parasite-induced cytokines was higher in adults for CCL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), while children produced significantly higher IL10 following activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). Further, amongst all cytokine-producing monocytes, the composition of parasite-driven cytokines differed significantly between adults and children. Although both children and adults had high CCL2 production, children had a significantly more diverse cytokine response, while adults had a CCL2-dominant response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>). Indeed, polyfunctionality of classical monocytes was significantly lower in adults, who had a higher proportion of monocytes producing only a single cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3d</xref>). Furthermore, there was a positive association between age and monocytes that produced only one cytokine, and a negative association between increasing age and monocytes that produced two cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>). This age-associated pattern was also observed for monocytes producing three and four cytokines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3e</xref>), suggesting monocyte polyfunctionality is age-dependent. While age differences in the distribution of monocyte subsets have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>), amongst our cohort there was no difference in the proportion of classical, non-classical, or intermediate monocytes between children and adults (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3f</xref>). Together, these data show that classical monocyte responses to malaria parasites in naive individuals are strongly influenced by age, with adults having a focused inflammatory response while, children had a polyfunctional monocyte cytokine response with higher IL10.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The transcriptional response to malaria parasites in classical monocytes is more inflammatory in naive adults</title><p id="P9">To explore the pathways driving the increased inflammatory response in monocytes from adults and increased immune regulatory response in children, we assessed the transcriptional profile of classical monocyte cells <italic>ex vivo</italic> and following <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria parasites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4a/b</xref>). Data were analysed using a general linear mixed model (glmmSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>)) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with age (children compared to adults), malaria stimulation (before compared to after stimulation), and genes which respond in an age-specific manner (significant for age and stimulation, and/or with a significant interaction between age and stimulation). Using this approach, a total of 10,562 DEGs were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>, Supplementary Data 1). Malaria stimulation resulted in a large transcriptional change, with 10,395 DEGs identified. 26% of these (2,735 DEGs) were also differentially expressed with age or had a significant interaction term between age and stimulation, indicating a large age dependent response to malaria <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>, Supplementary Data 1). Principal Components Analysis (PCA) revealed differences between adults and children, as well as before and after parasite stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4c</xref>). Age-dependent gene differences exemplified the polarization of response, with upregulated genes having a larger increase in adults, and down regulated genes having a larger decrease in children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). DEGs were categorized into 14 groups, based on whether genes were higher or lower in children or adults prior to and after stimulation, and whether expression increased or decreased in response to parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). The largest group of genes (876 DEGs) were higher at baseline in children but increased in adults only in response to stimulation, while decreasing in children. The second largest group (619 DEGs) were genes that were higher in children at baseline, and increased in both children and adults, but with a larger increase in adults. Both gene groups resulted in higher expression in adults after malaria parasite stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). Of all DEGs which were upregulated in response to stimulation, 1,624 resulted in higher expression in adults and only 149 were higher in children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>). Consistent with higher baseline (uRBC control) cytokine production in children compared to adults for all cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>), the majority of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-responsive adult genes were higher in children <italic>ex vivo</italic> (2,036 vs 699 DEG).</p><p id="P10">We performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of all upregulated DEGs that were higher in adults following pRBC stimulation. Most enriched pathways were uniquely enriched in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>). Consistent with increased inflammatory cytokine responses in adults, adult-specific upregulated pathways included inflammatory IFNg signaling pathways, MHC Class II presentation, as well as chemokine signaling and the macrophage alternative activation signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e</xref>). Furthermore, consistent with significantly higher IL10 production by monocytes in children, the IL10 signaling pathway was upregulated in children. Further, Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor (RHOGDI) signaling was also inhibited in adults but activated in children. This pathway refers to the regulatory mechanisms involved in modulating the activity of Rho GTPases which regulate inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>).

Additionally, adults had higher expression of the MHC Class II gene <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> after stimulation, consistent with a more robust response with higher functional potential (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4d</xref>). Consistent with IPA, upstream regulators predicted to be uniquely activated in adults were also indicative of an increased inflammatory response to malaria parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>). Transcriptional factors increased in adults compared to children included KLF6, which drives pro-inflammatory gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), and STAT4 which is a critical driver of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). In contrast in children, upregulated transcriptional factors included HOXA3 which inhibits M1 polarization and drives M2 polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>), and KLF3, a suppressor of monocyte inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref>). Inflammatory cytokines were predicted to be more activated in adults, including IFNγ, TNF, IL6, IL1β and type 1 IFNs (IFNα and IFNβ). In addition, CD40LG, IL-2 and CXCL12 were predicted to be activated in adults and inhibited in children. IL10 was predicted to be activated in both children and adults but was higher in children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3g</xref>). Further, within the transmembrane receptor category of upstream regulators, Toll-Like Receptors 4 (TLR4), a pathogen recognition receptor that can bind to GPI anchors derived from the malaria parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), was activated in adults and inhibited in children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3h</xref>), consistent with an increased ability of monocytes from adults to bind parasite products and induce inflammation. In contrast, of the 149 DEGs (5%) which were higher in children after parasites stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>), only two pathways were detected by IPA, with minimal differences in children and adults in upstream regulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5a-d</xref>). Taken together, transcriptional and cytokine production data show that classical monocytes’ responsiveness to malaria is age dependent, with enhanced inflammatory responses in adults compared to children in malaria naive individuals. This finding is consistent with the major role of monocytes in malaria pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) and the increased risk of severe disease in adults during primary infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Inflammatory cytokine production from Vδ2+ γδ T cells following malaria stimulation is higher in naive adults</title><p id="P11">Inflammatory transcriptional signatures in monocytes included the chemokine CXCL11, which has been linked to expansion of Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells in adults during a primary <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>).

As such, the increased cytokine response of Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells in adults is due to both the expansion of responsive effector memory cells within the Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cell compartment, and an increased capacity of responding cells to produce cytokine.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Transcriptional response to malaria parasites in Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells is similar in naive children and adults</title><p id="P13">As for monocytes, we next examined the transcriptional profile of purified Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells <italic>ex vivo</italic> and following stimulation with parasites to identify pathways mediating increased inflammation in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>, Supplementary Data 2). As seen for monocytes, Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells had a large transcriptional response to parasite stimulation, with 8,766 DEGs identified after stimulation, of which 35% (3,062) were also significant for age, or had a significant interaction with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a</xref>).

Interestingly, gene expression levels of IFNγ and TNF were significantly increased after parasite stimulation but were not different between age groups (Supplementary Data 2). The disconnect between transcriptional and functional data may be due to the differences in timing of assays, or due to post-translational age-dependent control of inflammation and IFNγ/TNF expression.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Increased innate cell inflammatory responses in naive adults is not balanced by induction of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs</title><p id="P14">Inflammation from innate immune cells in response to pathogens requires control to avoid immunopathogenesis. In malaria, control of inflammation can be mediated by multiple cell responses, including Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>). Tregs expand during primary <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection in adults, and expansion is associated with reduced inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>).

As such, we tested whether age impacted the malaria induced expansion of Tregs in naive individuals, hypothesizing that increased inflammation in response to malaria parasites in adults would be balanced by increased induction of Tregs. Following stimulation, Tregs were identified as CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD25high/CD127low/Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells, activation measured by CD38, ICOS or Ki67 and inhibition potential measured by CCR4, TNFR2 and PD-1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8a/b</xref>). Treg expansion occurred to comparable levels in both children and adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6b</xref>). Parasite expanded Treg populations had increased expression of activation markers compared to control-stimulated cells, but with no significant difference between age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6c</xref>). Further, while the expression of inhibitory markers was higher in adults in cells stimulated with either parasite infected or uninfected RBCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 8c</xref>), there was no difference in the magnitude of induction of inhibitory markers between adults and children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6d</xref>). Within these data, we also investigated whether the inflammatory CD4 T cell subset (Th1) was expanded or activated during in vitro pRBC stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 9a/b</xref>). IFNγ production from CD4 T cells is associated with parasite clearance, but also disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>).

In a cohort of patients with clinical malaria, plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines were associated with age and disease symptoms. This is despite age being independent from circulating parasitemia. In unexposed individuals, both monocytes and Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells produced significantly higher inflammatory cytokines in adults compared to children following <italic>in vitro</italic> parasite stimulation. Higher inflammation was not balanced by more robust induction of Treg cells, nor was there age associated differences in Th1 CD4 T cell responses. Together with previous studies in the same clinical population showing age-dependence of endothelial activation in falciparum malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), our findings suggest that age-dependent immune mediated inflammation contributes to age-dependent disease risk in malaria.</p><p id="P16">In the absence of migration of naive individuals into areas of disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), or emergence of new pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, understanding age intrinsic factors influencing the immune response to infection is confounded by prior exposure and the development of adaptive immunity. Thus, while it is well recognized that the immune system evolves with age, with important consequences for disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), few studies have defined age specific mechanisms between children and adults in responses to individual pathogens. Here, we identify that both monocytes and Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells are significantly more inflammatory in adults compared to children in response to malaria. These cells have been shown to be major producers of cytokines associated with severe malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Monocytes produce inflammatory cytokines to malaria parasites via several pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), including via TLR2 and TLR4 recognition of Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), TLR8 responding to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>), and via TLR4 binding hemozoin bound with parasite proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Previous studies have shown that monocyte responsiveness to TLR2 and TLR4 stimulation varies with age, but responsiveness to TLR7/8 is age-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). This suggests that the age dependent response to malaria may be driven by specific pattern recognition pathways. Indeed, data presented here suggests that increased inflammatory responses to malaria parasites may be mediated by increased TLR4 activation, which was transcriptionally activated in monocytes in adults and not children in response to parasite stimulation.</p><p id="P17">Amongst top upregulated genes in monocytes from adults following parasite stimulation was the chemokine CXCL11, which acts as a chemotactic for activated T cells and is increased in symptomatic malaria compared to asymptomatic infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). CXCL11, along with CXCL9 has also been linked to expansion of Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells in adults during a primary <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). Consistent with this link, Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells from malaria naive adults have a higher inflammatory response to malaria following <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation compared to children and circulating CXCL9 was correlated with age in patients with malaria. This increased inflammatory response was both due to the expansion of EM cells within the Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cell population, and increased reactivity of all memory subsets to parasite stimulation. Along with roles of Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells during infection, these cells also have been associated with protection induced by whole parasite irradiated sporozoite vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). While these vaccines induce sterile protection in malaria-naive adults, they have failed to induce any efficacy in infants in endemic areas with this failure hypothesized to be linked to Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Our data supports this hypothesis by identifying a clear age dependent responsiveness of γδ T cells to malaria parasites.</p><p id="P18">In contrast to responses in adults, cell responses in children had increased regulatory potential, particularly in monocytes, with both transcriptional enrichment of regulatory pathways including IL10 and RHODGI signaling in children, as well as increased production of IL10 in response to parasite stimulation. In malaria endemic areas, responses from monocytes isolated from immune Malian adults produce more IL10 and less inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL6 and IL-1b) compared to both non-immune children, and malaria unexposed adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>), consistent with the induction of immunoregulatory networks by malaria exposure associated with protection from disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Here we show that in naive populations, monocytes from children also produce more IL10 compared to adults, in an age intrinsic manner, distinct from malaria induced regulator networks. In contrast, while frequencies and functions of Tregs cells are highest early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>), we found no evidence that induction of Tregs by malaria parasites was age dependent. However, it should be noted that circulating IDO levels were increased with age in patients with malaria, so increased Treg induction may still occur during clinical disease. Further studies are required to investigate the age dependent induction of other regulatory cell responses during malaria, such as Tr1 CD4 T cells which co-produce IL10 with IFNγ and dominate the CD4 T cell compartment during malaria infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>).</p><p id="P19">While increased inflammatory response with age may increase disease severity and risk, this heightened responsiveness may also be benefitable for the development of adaptive immunity.

This age-dependent acquisition of anti-parasitic immunity, largely mediated via adaptive responses, has also been shown in Ugandan children in high transmission areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>).

Additionally, no cellular samples were available from our clinical cohort of natural infection, thus we were not able to investigate age-dependent changes to monocytes and γδ T cell activation during clinical malaria. Further, due to limited cell numbers in malaria naive donors, we were also unable to investigate other innate cell responses which may have roles in malaria disease risk.</p><p id="P21">In conclusion, these data identify classical monocytes and Vδ2<sup>+</sup> γδ T cells as important drivers of the inflammatory response in malaria-naive adults upon first exposure to malaria parasites.

RNA sequencing libraries were constructed using the NEBNext® Single Cell/Low Input RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (E6420S) and NEBNext® Multiplex Oligos for Illumina® (96 Unique Dual Index Primer Pairs) (E6440S). The libraries were sequenced using a paired-end NextSeq 500/550 high output kit v2.5 (150 cycles) (Cat number 20024907).</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Data Analysis</title><sec id="S23"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p id="P31">For the <italic>ex vivo</italic> phenotyping panel we used the R package SPECTRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>) to identify cell subsets of interest. Unsupervised clustering was performed using both children (<italic>n=</italic>12) and adult (<italic>n=</italic>11) PBMC sample, and cell clusters were visualised with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2a/b, Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Expression of lineage markers were used to annotate cell clusters into 12 high level cell states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2a/b</xref>). For functional assays, data was analysed with FlowJo v10 (BD, 2019) and R/R studio was used for statistical analysis and data visualisation.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Bulk-RNAseq</title><p id="P32">Raw sequencing reads were first trimmed to remove adapter sequences and low-quality bases using Cutadapt (v1.9). Trimmed reads were then aligned to the Human GRCh37 reference genome, incorporating Ensembl v97 gene models, using STAR (v2.5.2a). Alignment files were processed, sorted, and converted to the required formats using SAMtools (v1.9). Gene and transcript expression levels were quantified with RSEM (v1.2.30), providing normalized expression estimates. Quality assessment of the RNA-seq data was performed using RNA-SeQC (v1.1.8) to ensure data reliability. All analyses were carried out using Python (v3.6.1) and Perl (v5.22) for scripting and workflow automation. Low-count genes (fewer than 10 counts) were removed, and dispersion was estimated using edgeR (v4.40) workflow in R. To compare gene expression in paired pre- and post-stimulated samples from children and adults, we used negative binomial mixed-effects models with the glmmSeq R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). The design matrix accounted for random effects of individual samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4b</xref>) and included an interaction term between state (pre- vs. post-stimulation) and age (adult vs. child). Fold change due to stimulation was calculated by subtracting the response term of unstimulated from stimulated samples. Fold change due to age was calculated by subtracting the response term of children from adults for both stimulated and unstimulated samples. We corrected for multiple testing using Storey’s q-value method, defining significance for q-values lower than 0.05 with the q-value R package.</p><p id="P33">Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for canonical pathway enrichment and predicted upstream regulator analysis using DEGs with a false detection rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05, with no fold-change cut-off.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P34">Non-parametric testing was performed for all analysis. Continuous data for all cellular responses and plasma cytokines were compared between the children and adults’ groups using Mann-Whitney U test or correlated with age as a continuous variable with Spearman’s correlations. Statistical comparisons were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed in R (version 4.4.4). Graphical outputs were made in ggplot2 (version 3.5.1) and ggpubr (version 0.6.0). No sample size calculation was performed, instead all available participant data was included. No subgroup analysis was performed. Data generation was performed with blinding to participant demographic data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures and Tables</label><media xlink:href="EMS201603-supplement-Supplementary_Figures_and_Tables.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d50aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all participants in this study; the clinical and laboratory research staff and the hospital directors at the study sites, the head of Clinical Research Centre Malaysia and colleagues and staff of the UK medical research council <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> Monkeybar Project.
