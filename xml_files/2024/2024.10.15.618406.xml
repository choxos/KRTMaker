The widely used quinolone class of drugs use a water-metal ion bridge in interacting with the GyrA subunit of DNA gyrase. Zoliflodacin sits in the same pocket as quinolones but interacts with the GyrB subunit and also stabilizes lethal double-stranded DNA-breaks. Gepotidacin had been observed to sit on the twofold axis of the complex, midway between the two four base-pair separated DNA-cleavage sites and has been observed to stabilize singe-stranded DNA-breaks. Here we use information from three crystal structures of complexes of <italic>Staphlococcus aureus</italic> DNA gyrase (one with a precursor of gepotidacin and one with the progenitor of zoliflodacin) to propose a simple single moving metal-ion catalyzed DNA-cleavage mechanism. Our model explains why the catalytic tyrosine is in the tyrosinate (negatively charged) form for DNA-cleavage. Movement of a single catalytic metal-ion (Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>) guides water mediated protonation and cleavage of the scissile phosphate which is then accepted by the catalytic tyrosinate. Type IIA topoisomerases need to be able to rapidly cut the DNA when it becomes positively supercoiled (in front of replication forks and transcription bubbles) and we propose that the original purpose of the small Greek Key domain, common to all type IIA topoisomerases, was to allow access of the catalytic metal to the DNA-cleavage site. Although the proposed mechanism is consistent with published data, it is not proven and other mechanisms have been proposed. Finally how such mechanisms can be experimentally distinguished is considered.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Novel Bacterial Topoisomerse Inhibitor (NBTI)</kwd><kwd>spirocyclic pyrimidine trione (SPT)</kwd><kwd>fluoroquinolone</kwd><kwd>moxifloxacin</kwd><kwd>gepotidacin</kwd><kwd>zoliflodacin</kwd><kwd>type IIA topoisomerase</kwd><kwd>DNA-cleavage</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">One of the aims of modern structural biology is to understand how movement is coupled to the chemical making and breaking of bonds, that is to “watch chemistry happen” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] . In physics, ‘the three body problem’ pertains to describing the motion of three bodies under gravitational attraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. ‘ <italic>At first glance, the difficulty of the problem is not obvious, especially when considering that the two-body problem has well-known closed form solutions given in terms of elementary functions. Adding one extra body makes the problem too complicated to obtain similar types of solutions. […] solutions do not exist because motions of the three bodies are in general unpredictable, which makes the three-body problem one of the most challenging problems in the history of science</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].’ There is an analogous problem in chemistry, where the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically for the hydrogen atom, owing to the simplicity of the two-particle physical system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. This explains why physics has so far failed to properly explain catalytic chemistry, and why experimental structural science is still required.</p><p id="P3">One of the long-standing challenges for structural biology is a catalytic mechanism of topoisomerases – complex and flexible enzymes which modify the topology of DNA. Topoisomerases are divided into two classes; type I and type II (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure S1</xref>). While type I topoisomerases use single-stranded DNA breaks to modify DNA topology, type II use double-stranded DNA breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The introduction of double-stranded DNA breaks is potentially lethal to cells and is normally carefully controlled. Type IIA topoisomerases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) include two human enzymes, topoisomerase IIα and IIβ, as well as the bacterial enzymes topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase. Interestingly, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> only has DNA gyrase (i.e. it lacks topoisomerase IV) and a type IA topoisomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], which is mechanistically similar. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, panel b, shows a simplified view of the function of a type IIA topoisomerase. A double-stranded break is made in one segment (the gate or G-DNA duplex) and another DNA-duplex is passed through that break. This is accompanied by large movements of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P4">How the two bacterial type IIA topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, cleave DNA and modulate DNA topology is of interest because three classes of antibiotics stabilizing DNA-cleavage complexes with these targets have now successfully passed phase III clinical trials. The flexibility these enzymes require, in making a double-strand DNA-break in one DNA-duplex and then passing a second DNA-duplex through that break, has caused problems in obtaining high resolution crystal structures. A clear definition of how the catalytic metal ion(s) regulate this DNA-cleavage process in a normally safe manner follows from high-resolution (better than 2.2Å) crystal structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The deletion of the small Greek Key domain in <italic>S. aureus</italic> DNA gyrase improved the resolution of crystal structures with GSK299423 (a precursor of gepotidacin) from 3.5 Å (with the Greek Key domain) to 2.1 Å (with the Greek Key domain deleted) and gave a clear view of a catalytic metal at the 3’(A) position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. This <italic>S. aureus</italic> DNA gyrase Greek Key deletion construct has been successfully used in a large number of crystal structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], but has not yet been successfully replicated in other type IIA topoisomerases - which all contain the small Greek Key domain.</p><p id="P5">An initial structure of moxifloxacin with <italic>A. baumanii</italic> Topoisomerase IV in a DNA-cleavage complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] showed the presence of the water-metal ion bridge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] and explained two common target-mediated resistance mutations. However, the DNA used in this initial structure was from a previous lower-resolution structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and the limited resolution of the data (3.25 Å) precluded a clear visualisation of the register of the DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Subsequent higher-resolution structures with a shorter version of this DNA, quinolones and a <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> DNA gyrase construct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] clearly showed that the asymmetric DNA sequence was in two orientations in the crystal - related by the twofold axis of the complex. The register of the DNA sequence in the initial <italic>A. baumanii</italic> Topoisomerase IV structure is uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. A 2.95Å structure of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> DNA gyrase Greek Key deletion construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures S2 and S3</xref>) in a DNA-cleavage complex with moxifloxacin (pdb code: 5cdq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]), used a 20 base-pair symmetric (palindromic) DNA sequence to avoid the possibility of the DNA suffering from static disorder around the twofold axis of the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. This moxifloxacin structure (5cdq-BA-x.pdb - <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>) is very similar to the moxifloxacin DNA-cleavage complexes with <italic>A. baumannii</italic> Topo IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. However, the 2.95 Å structure is with the Greek Key deletion mutant (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The water-metal ion bridge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] is conserved in moxifloxacin DNA-cleavage complex structures between <italic>A. baumanii</italic> Topoisomerase IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and <italic>S. aureus</italic> DNA gyrase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] and in a modified form in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> DNA gyrase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]- note the presence of an alanine at position 90 in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> GyrA cf serine in other bacteria). Interestingly the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis ‘genome encodes only one copy of type I and one copy of type II topoisomerase’</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P6">An extensive corpus of biochemical and structural information strongly suggests that type IIA topoisomerases require a catalytic metal (preferentially Mg<sup>2+</sup>) in the Toprim domain for proper DNA cleavage and religation; while type IA topoisomerases seem to only require the metal ion for religation by the Toprim domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], DNA-cleavage being accomplished with the aid of a lysine residue. Type IA topoisomerases only work on negatively supercoiled DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. There are currently three theories (see Table 4 and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S5">discussion</xref> in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]) of how the G-segment DNA is cleaved by type IIA topoisomerases such as DNA gyrase: (i) a two metal mechanism which was proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] based on a misinterpretated electron density map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. To date, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no structural data published that is consistent with such a model, and therefore it is unlikely to be correct (ii) a single-metal mechanism in which DNA-cleavage is proposed to take place when the metal ion is at the 3’(A) site described (pages 3438-3447) in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. This model is also unlikely to be correct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]; noting that it does not explain why the catalytic tyrosine is in the tyrosinate (negatively charged) form, nor explain how the enzyme uses supercoiling to control DNA-cleavage and (iii) the single moving metal mechanism described in this paper, which explains why the catalytic tyrosine is in a tyrosinate (negatively charged) form for DNA-cleavage, and which also proposes that the small Greek Key domain controls metal access to the catalytic site to allow rapid relaxation of positively supercoiled DNA ahead of replication forks and transcription bubbles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In this paper a chemically sensible single moving metal mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] is proposed, based on three published crystal structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. The aim of this paper is not to prove a mechanism, but to present a new mechanism consistent with existing data (including chemistry). Experiments are then proposed to “watch chemistry happen”.</p><p id="P7">Metal binding Toprim domains were named for topoisomerases and primases and were characterized in a multiple sequence alignment in a 1998 paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. However, the first Toprim domain in a type IIA topoisomerase was described in the structure of the catalytic core of yeast topoisomerase II published in a paper in 1996 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. This stated that in addition to the Toprim domain there is a simple Greek key domain ‘<italic>(residues 565-605) is inserted between the fifth strand and final helix</italic> [of the Toprim domain]’. Although Toprim domains are found in many other proteins, including other topoisomerases (e.g. type IA topoisomerases) the insertion of the simple Greek Key domain between the fifth strand and subsequent helix of the Toprim domain seems to be a feature which is found uniquely in all type IIA topoisomerases. In Gram negative DNA gyrases (such as <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA gyrase), the Greek Key domain is augmented by an inserted domain of some 174 residues; this inserted domain is not present in other type IIA topoisomerases, which have only the small Greek Key domain inserted in the Toprim domain (see sequence alignment in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). The small Greek Key domain in type IIA topoisomerases tends to be mobile - it was not seen in the 2.15Å structure of etoposide with human topo IIB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>].</p><p id="P8">A <italic>S. aureus</italic> DNA gyrase fusion construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) in which the small Greek Key domain was deleted (residues 544-579 replaced with two amino acids) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], allowed a clear visualization of a 3’(A) site metal (with a YtoF mutant and GSK299423). A long-standing question has been why type IIA topoisomerases have the additional Greek Key domain within the Toprim domain. One of the conclusions of this paper is that the Greek key domains within type IIA topoisomerases first arose to allow control of metal access to the active site - specifically allowing rapid access of metal ions to control relaxation of positively supercoiled DNA in front of replication forks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><p id="P9">In developing the mechanism/movie proposed in this paper we use just four complexes from three crystal structures (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>): (i) the 2.1Å ternary complex with GSK299423 (a precursor of gepotidacin) and uncleaved DNA (PDB code 2xcs, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]), which has the catalytic tyrosine mutated to phenylalanine and gives a clear view of a 3’(A)-site metal ion (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>); (ii) A 2.5Å DNA-cleavage complex stabilized by QPT-1 (PDB code 5cdm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]), the progenitor of zoliflodacin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> panel c), which has a single metal ion observed at the Y(B) site and (iii) the two complexes (<underline>6fqv-c1.pdb</underline> and <underline>6fqv-c2.pdb</underline>) from the 2.6Å binary complex (PDB code 6fqv).

In 6fqv-c2.pdb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>) the catalytic tyrosine (from the second complex in the asymmetric unit from 6fqv.pdb) is not in the catalytic pocket. Whereas in 6fqv-c1.pdb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>), that catalytic tyrosine has a position where it can displace a water from the normal coordination sphere of a Y(B)-site metal. However, no metal ions are observed in the catalytic pocket in either complex in the 6fqv crystal structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. This seems to be because the phosphate prior to the scissile phosphate is too far away from the metal binding site to interact with a water. In high-resolution crystal structures where a Y(B)-site metal is observed (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]), a water molecule is observed sitting between the catalytic metal ion and the phosphate prior to the scissile phosphate (from the DNA). In this paper the Y(B), 3’(A) nomenclature is used for the two observed metal positions (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] for details).

Because the catalytic tyrosine appears to move (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) the terminal oxygen of the tyrosine can be moved about 1.6 Å back towards its position in 6fqv-c2.pdb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) to be closer to the position of water 5095 - and displace it from the Mn<sup>2+</sup> coordination sphere (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S6">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). In this starting position the tyrosine is accepting a hydrogen bond from Arg 122’, but the slight move backwards means Arg 122’ is too far from the scissile phosphate to donate a hydrogen bond to the scissile phosphate. The catalytic tyrosine (A123 or C123’) is believed to be in the tyrosinate (O- rather than OH) form before it cleaves the DNA (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S5">discussion</xref>).

In the DNA-cleavage mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), on entering the active site the metal ion (Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>) is attracted towards two negative charges, on the scissile phosphate and on Glu 435, and as it moves it maintains its contact with the side chain of Asp 508 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). Water 5093 which protonates the 3’ oxygen to effect DNA-cleavage, moves as the metal ion moves (Mn<sup>2+</sup> - purple sphere - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p><p id="P18">After the DNA has been cleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) the DNA gate can be pushed open by a traversing T-DNA duplex, while the metal ion moves back to the Y(B) site, where it acquires a new water - water 5095 - replacing the tyrosine oxygen in the metal ion coordination sphere (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>). Once the T-DNA has passed through the doubly cleaved DNA - presumably the metal at the B-site can religate the DNA.</p><p id="P19">It is possible, in principle, to propose a simple religation scheme, where water 5095 moves to protonate the tyrosine oxygen, regenerating the tyrosine from the phosphotyrosine. The metaphosphate-like intermediate is presumably then attacked by the 3’ O- ion to regenerate the intact DNA. However, such a religation mechanism has some complications. The 3’OH probably loses a proton to Glu 435, before becoming the attacking 3’ O- ion, but more problematical is the exact conformation of the phosphotyrosine when it is protonated by water 5095. We have not yet fully elucidated such a scheme.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="discussion"><label>3</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">The scheme for DNA-cleavage shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> suggests that the initial step in the cleavage of the DNA is the protonation of the 3’ oxygen. This contrasts with many DNA-cleavage mechanisms which propose that the initial step is caused by a tyrosinate ion attacking a tetrahedral negatively charged phosphate (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4c</xref> in a paper on a type IA topoisomerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]). The nucleophilic attack of a negative tyrosinate ion on a negatively charged phosphate ion seems chemically unlikely. The mechanism proposed in this paper for <italic>S. aureus</italic> DNA gyrase suggests that (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) - the DNA is first cleaved by protonation of the negatively charged scissile phosphate and then the extremely reactive metaphosphate-like planer intermediate is attacked by the catalytic tyrosinate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> panel c). The mechanism proposed in this paper is informed by the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of methylphosphate mechanism (Figure 10.1 and Scheme 10.1 in Frey and Hegeman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]). The proposed mechanism is also informed by previously proposed mechanisms for phosphotransfer reactions as described in Agrawal <italic>et al</italic>., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], and Bax, Chung, and Edge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] and Dehghani-Tafti <italic>et al</italic>., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. However, how exactly the protons (hydrogens) move during catalysis is not yet clear (see below for details).</p><p id="P21">One mechanism proposed in this paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) starts with protonation of the negatively charged DNA backbone, which generates a highly reactive metaphosphate like intermediate. If the negatively charged tyrosinate ion is not positioned to attack, then the metaphosphate will presumably immediately re-attack the 3’-OH, regenerating the uncleaved DNA. This mechanism seems chemically more sensible than the conventional mechanism which starts with the tyrosinate ion making a nucleophilic attack on a negatively charged tetrahedral phosphate from the DNA and ends with protonation of the 3’ oxygen (see for example the mechanism discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]). Although the proposed mechanism seems chemically more sensible - it is not proven and it depends on hydrogen atom transfer. Alteratively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure S9</xref>) water 5093 could be directly protonated by Arg 122’ to effect the DNA-cleavage. Such a mechanism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure S9</xref>) suggest that the single-stranded DNA-cleavage seen with NBTIs such as GSK299423 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] and gepotidacin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] is likely due to incomplete religation at one of the two active sites. Seeing such chemistry happen will require carefully designed experiments where hydrogen atoms could observed, such as by neutron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>] or electron diffraction experiments. Advancements over the last 10 years in electron diffraction show that this technique has potential to better locate hydrogen atoms, and could in the future be used to understand this mechanism further [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Experimental definition of hydrogen atom positions is challenging, and perhaps this explains why QM/MM studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] are still used despite their obvious limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. A more definitive answer awaits the development of experimental techniques that allow hydrogens to be clearly visualized in multiple macromolecular structures.</p><p id="P22">In a 1993 paper entitled: ‘<italic>A general two-metal-ion mechanism for catalytic RNA</italic>’ Steitz and Steitz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>], proposed a rather pedestrian mechanism for catalytic RNA along the lines of Francis Crick’s old central dogma of molecular biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>], i.e. the simple mantra “<italic>DNA makes DNA makes RNA makes Protein</italic>” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. The theory developed in their paper is based on four factors that were observed in early structures of the rather rigid catalytic proteins determined in the 1960s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. However, they seemed to have not noticed that RNA ‘invented proteins’ to be flexible molecular machines that could enhance catalytic rates by using ‘directional movement to protonate specific oxygen atoms on phosphates to catalyze phosphotransferase reactions’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. While Tom Steitz’s 2009 Nobel Prize winning talk was entitled “<italic>From the structure and function of the ribosome to new antibiotics</italic>” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>], the company he co-founded in 2000, Rib-X (which sought to exploit expertise in (ribosomal) structural biology and molecular modeling to design new antibiotics) was taken over by Melinta Therapeutics and their first marketed drug was the DNA gyrase-targeting quinolone delafloxacin.</p><p id="P23">In 2010 Schmidt <italic>et al</italic>., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] proposed a modified version of the Steitz and Steitz theory in ‘<italic>A novel and unified two-metal mechanism for DNA cleavage by type II and IA topoisomerases</italic>’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. However, this proposal was based on a poorly refined low-resolution structure that does not have sensible metal-ion coordination geometry at either of the two different active sites. This structure has been re-refined (<underline>RR-3l4k.pdb</underline>) to have chemically reasonable geometry and a single metal ion at each active site, consistent with single moving metal mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Similarly a paper by Bax <italic>et al</italic>., 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], contains a <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> entitled ‘Dynamic model for the cleavage religation cycle catalyzed by a single metal ion’, which lacked sensible chemistry. Although it is difficult to disprove mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>], this does not mean they are true. We assert that proposed mechanisms should be consistent with the current knowledge of metal ion coordination geometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><p id="P24">We believe that the most likely current explanation of the observed synergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>] between different metal ions in type IIA topoisomerases is that when one active site contains a Y(B) site metal the other uses a 3’(A) site metal. Presumably differences in the ionic radius of calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>] account for calcium’s tendency to give more DNA cleavage in the absence of a compound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. Similarities between type IA and type IIA topoisomerases, which both have Toprim domains, suggest that they likely have similar mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Although type IA topoisomerases only work on negatively supercoiled DNA and can cleave a single-stranded DNA segment in the absence of a divalent metal ion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] they require a divalent metal ion for DNA-religation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Dual targeting of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] is important to prevent the likelihood of developing resistance to drugs. If a compound could be found that inhibits both <italic>M. tb</italic> topo I and DNA gyrase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>) it would be interesting to measure the likelihood of resistance to such a compound.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="materials | methods"><label>4</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P25">The aim of this paper is to present a new moving metal mechanism which is consistent with existing crystal structures. The mechanism depends on the accuracy of the metal-ion coordination geometry and re-refined coordinates are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] for the two crystal structures containing catalytic metal ions (<underline>2xcs-v2-BA-x.pdb</underline> and <underline>5cdm-v2-BA-x.pdb</underline>). However, we note that crystal structures are static pictures of thousands of molecules that make up a crystal.</p><p id="P26">What we are concerned with in this paper is how DNA-gyrase cleaves DNA. To do this we used the following procedure: (i) Coordinates from crystal structures were manually edited in coot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>] - so that each coordinate set contained a complete set of single atoms. Also the DNA sequence was manually edited so that it was the same in the three starting structures (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> for details). This gave: 2xcs-v2-one-DNA.pdb, 5cdm-v2-one-DNA.pdb and 6fqv-c1-one-DNA.pdb. Note 6fqv-c1-one-DNA.pdb contains no catalytic metal ion and Glu B435 was modelled in in a conformation similar to that observed in 5cdm. The two sets of coordinates with a metal ion, 2xcs-v2-one-DNA.pdb, 5cdm-v2-one-DNA.pdb, were read into Maestro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] and; (ii) hydrogens were added onto all atoms in ‘prepare’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. The structure was written out from Maestro (export structure) and edited so the header contained a CRYST1 record. Then, because the hydrogen atoms placed on waters were all pointing in the same direction, the relevant waters were manually rotated (in coot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]) around the oxygen atom to chemically sensible positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. The coordinates with manually rotated waters were then read back into Maestro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>], the relevant waters, including hydrogens were selected and then energy minimized in Maestro (minimize selected atoms). The manganese atom had a formal charge of +2 in Maestro. We used this procedure to keep heavy atom coordinates (non-hydrogen atoms) used for making movies close to those experimentally defined from crystal structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. This gave: 2xcs-v2-two-DNA.pdb, 5cdm-v2-two-DNA.pdb as explained in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>; and with and 6fqv-c1-one.pdb, these were used to help guide the making of the molecular DNA-cleavage movie</p><p id="P27">To aid visualisation of our proposed mechanism of DNA cleavage in type IIA topoisomerases, we created a molecular movie that morphs between four states (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>): (i) uncleaved DNA with no metal ion present; (ii) entry of the metal ion coordinated by the catalytic tyrosine; (iii) transient state at the point of DNA cleavage; and (iv) cleaved DNA with the metal ion still bound. The movie was produced using the ProSMART library for structure analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>], similarly as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. The procedure involves applying hierarchical aggregate transformations to residues, backbone and side chain atoms, resulting in a parsimonious morphing between states. This required preparation of coordinate models corresponding to four states.</p><p id="P28">State 1 - uncleaved DNA (6fqv-c2): Due to this model being the second complex in 6fqv, the chain nomenclature is different due to the requirement for uniqueness. Specifically, the protein chains named R/S/T/U (authors’ original annotation) correspond to the conventionally named chains A/B/C/D, and similarly the nucleic acid chains V/W correspond to E/F. To achieve an equivalent coordinate frame for producing the movie, the complex was superposed onto the other complex, aligning chain S in 6fqv-c2 to chain B in 6fqv-c1 using ProSMART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. In 6fqv-c2, Arg122 is modelled in two conformations; conformer A was removed and B retained, so as to retain the hydrogen bond between the Tyr C123 terminal oxygen and Arg C122(NH2); an interaction that is relevant to the proposed mechanism.</p><p id="P29">State 2 - entry of the metal ion (6fqv-c1): Despite the metal ion not being present in 6fqv, we transplanted the Mn<sup>2+</sup> and coordinating waters from 5cdm, keeping the metal ion coordinated to Asp B508(OD2) and Asp B510(OD2). We manually adjusted the positions of the coordinating waters (B5091, B5093 and B5094) to ensure reasonable coordination geometry, with hydrogen positions optimised using Maestro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Model 5cdm also has water B5095 coordinating the metal. However, we propose that the metal is brought into the binding site by Tyr C123, and that the C123 side chain oxygen atom takes the place of the water B5095 observed in 5cdm. Consequently, we manually adjusted the position of Tyr C123 (by rotating the side chain) so that the C123 side chain oxygen atom coordinates the metal ion in place of B5095. This resulted in the C123 side chain oxygen atom moving a distance of some 1.3 Å. Similarly, we manually adjusted the adjacent Arg C122 so as to maintain the hydrogen bond between C122(NH2) and side chain oxygen atom of C123. These ‘manual’ adjustments were applied in Coot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>], ensuring reasonable geometry of the adjusted residues.</p><p id="P30">State 3 - transient state at the point of DNA cleavage (between 6fqv-c1 and 2xcs): The model 2xcs exhibits uncleaved DNA, with the catalytic tyrosine C123 mutated to phenylalanine, and the metal ion coordinated by the OP1 atom of the uncleaved phosphate DG E9. Our proposed mechanism involves the metal ion inducing cleavage prior to the structure entering the state observed in 2xcs - i.e. it is proposed that the metal ion does not quite reach the scissile phosphate. However, we do not have access to an intermediate state at the exact point at which cleavage occurs; it is clear why it would be difficult to observe such a transient state using conventional crystallographic methods. Consequently, it was necessary to generate an intermediate between the previous state (derived from 6fqv-c1) and 2xcs. This State 3 was generated by morphing between State 2 and 2xcs (using ProSMART, as for the main movie), and extracting an intermediate set of coordinates at the point at which (we hypothesise) the DNA-cleavage-inducing chemical reaction occurs.</p><p id="P31">We also hypothesized that a water moves into the binding site, to a position (reasonably close to water E52 in 2xcs) that is between Arg C122, Tyr C123, water B5093 and the phosphate of DG9. We manually placed such a water in a position that we believed most chemically sensible. In the movie, this water is seen to move in through an open pocket just prior to DNA cleavage. This water (E52=5095 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and Nicholls-et-almovie1.mp4) is protonated by Arg 122’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and the movie. However, as can be seen if <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>, if Arg 122’ moves more slowly another possibility is that Arg 122’ directly protonates water 5093 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary Figure S9</xref>).</p><p id="P32">State 4 - cleaved DNA (5cdm): The final state is that with cleaved DNA observed in 5cdm.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="conclusions"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P33">In 1979 Brown and Cozarelli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>] proposed a sign inversion mechanism to explain the observed activity of <italic>E.coli</italic> DNA gyrase. They proposed that: ‘<italic>a positive supercoil is directly inverted into a negative one via a transient doublestrand break</italic>’ and that the ‘<italic>reverse process is the path by which gyrase, in the absense of ATP, relaxes negatively supercoiled DNA</italic>.’ Since the initially proposed model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] was based on relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA (and decatenation), it seems logical to suggest that relaxation of positively supercoiled DNA should proceed by the reverse direction of strand transfer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). If this is the case then the small Greek Key domains would be ideally placed to regulate access of metal ions to the active sites for fast relaxation of positively supercoiled DNA.</p><p id="P34">Human topoisomerase IIα and DNA gyrase are able to relax positively supercoiled DNA at enhanced rates ahead of replication forks in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. A simple model would be that the N(ATP-dependent)-gate tends to be closed during relaxation of positive supercoils; i.e. that the enzyme acts rather like a rocker switch with the ATPase and G-gates closed for relaxation of positive supercoils, but the C-gate open. In such a simplistic model the C-terminal domains of human topoisomerase IIα or DNA gyrase would bind positively supercoiled plectonemes in front of replication forks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>], and the small Greek Key domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) would recognise the incoming T-DNA segments facilitating rapid and safe relaxation of positive supercoils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>] in front of replication forks.</p><p id="P35">While the the ATPase domains are not 100% required for relaxation of negative supercoils by human topoisomerase IIβ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>] similar experiments have not yet been done, to the best of our knowledge, for relaxation of positive supercoils. The generation of positively supercoiled plasmids with reverse gyrase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>] may be technically more challenging than the generation of negatively supercoiled plasmids with DNA gyrase, however, if Brown and Cozzarelli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>] are correct then the relaxation of positively supercoiled DNA may proceed in the opposite direction from the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA; such experiments may be worthwhile.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS199512-supplement-Supplementary_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d8aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S8"><title>Funding</title><p>This research was funded by a Medicines Discovery Institute/Diamond Light Source PhD to H.M., and F.L. and G.N.M. are supported by MRC grant No. MC_UP_A025_1012.
