However, the mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unknown as interrogating human cerebellar development alongside other species has to date been unfeasible. To address this, we developed a minimally guided cerebellar organoid protocol that combines unguided neural induction with precise temporal calibration of posteriorizing morphogens. This approach effectively overrides default telencephalic fate in cerebral organoids and induces stable cerebellar identities. Cerebellar organoids derived from both human and mouse ESCs exhibit species-specific size differences at comparable developmental stages and show robust induction of cerebellar master regulators and progenitor cell types. This model provides a powerful tool for investigating the mechanisms underlying cerebellar development in the context of both evolution and disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The cerebellum contains 80–90% of the neurons in the adult brain and plays a crucial role in both motor control and cognitive functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Cerebellar development is initiated in the most anterior region of the hindbrain, rhombomere 1 (r1), adjacent to the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) organizer, which separates the anterior from the posterior brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The induction of the MHB is established through the antagonistic interaction between <italic>OTX2</italic> and <italic>GBX2</italic>, which define the anterior and posterior epiblast, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Once the MHB is formed, ligands secreted from the organizer, such as WNTs and FGFs, promote cerebellar competency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). These signals, together with master regulators such as <italic>PAX2, EN1</italic>, and <italic>EN2</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, initiate a morphogenetic cascade guiding the formation of cerebellar progenitors and mature neurons. While these early patterning events are broadly conserved across vertebrates, the cerebellum underwent rapid expansion during human evolution, significantly contributing to the overall increase in brain size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. In primates, cerebellar expansion occurred in tandem with neocortical growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. However, humans and other apes deviate from this pattern, exhibiting a disproportionately large cerebellum relative to neocortex size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. This is in line with the key role of the cerebellum in modulating technical abilities, communication and emotional processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. However, investigating mechanisms underlying these human-specific features has been hampered by the lack of tractable cerebellar models for humans and other species.</p><p id="P3">Alongside these evolutionary aspects, cerebellar growth is disrupted in several human neurodevelopmental conditions, including Dandy-Walker malformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, Joubert syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, and ataxia telangiectasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, as well as in medulloblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> the most common paediatric brain cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. While animal models have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of these diseases, they often do not fully replicate human-specific pathophysiological features. Thus, comparing the effects of disease determinants between humans and other species is essential to uncover the mechanisms underlying human-specific penetrance or expressivity of disease.</p><p id="P4">To date, a few cerebellar organoid models have been developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>which have opened up the possibility to explore development of different cerebellar neuron types. These models rely heavily on guided differentiation protocols, allowing for robust determination of the different cerebellar cell types. An alternative, minimally guided method with minimal to no extrinsic manipulation has not yet been described but would enable investigation of species-specific differences in intrinsic developmental programs that may underlie differences in tempo and/ or the topology of developmental transitions.</p><p id="P5">Notably, unguided cerebral organoids have provided crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying evolutionary differences in brain size <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> as well as into human diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. In these models, neural progenitors default towards telencephalic fates and self-organize into distinct cortical progenitor layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. While these models well recapitulate anterior brain development, spontaneous acquisition of posterior identities like the cerebellum occurs at a negligible frequency.</p><p id="P6">To address this issue, we combine unguided neural induction with temporally calibrated WNT and FGF signalling activation to override telencephalic fates and stabilize cerebellar identities. This approach, which relies on minimal and conserved cerebellar determinants, enables cross-species applicability. Indeed, cerebellar organoids derived from both human and mouse recapitulate species-specific differences in size at comparable developmental stages, they also display robust induction of cerebellar master regulators and the generation of cerebellar progenitor cell types with timing that closely mirrors in vivo development. This platform provides a powerful tool for cross-species comparisons and investigation of human-specific features in cerebellar development across evolution and disease.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Overriding the default telencephalic program to induce posterior brain identities</title><p id="P7">Under unguided conditions, hESCs exit pluripotency and differentiate into neuroepithelial progenitors as the default, predominantly acquiring telencephalic identities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that providing caudalizing signals after neuroepithelial identity is determined but before telencephalic fate becomes irreversible could promote posterior identities. To test this hypothesis, we first investigated the timing of hESC exit from pluripotency and the initiation of forebrain marker expression. Using a defined media composition, we generated unguided brain organoids from H9 hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-D</xref>). We then examined the expression of pluripotency markers <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic>, alongside early forebrain markers <italic>LHX2</italic> and <italic>TBR2</italic>, a marker of cortical intermediate progenitors, during the first 20 days of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Notably, <italic>NANOG</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> expression were significantly reduced by day 7 and absent by day 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, <italic>LHX2</italic> and <italic>TBR2</italic> expression were already detectable at day 7 and increased progressively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that by day 7, the forebrain specification program was already underway. Based on these findings, we aimed to introduce caudalizing cues before this critical time point. Given the conserved role of WNT signaling in early anterior-posterior (A/P) patterning, where early pathway activation prevents forebrain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and inhibition suppresses formation of midbrain and hindbrain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>; we investigated whether activation of WNT signaling just prior to day 7 would prevent telencephalic identities while still allowing the earlier neuroepithelial establishment. To determine the correct time window and dosage, we performed a dose response experiment using the WNT signalling activator CHIR at day 5, 6 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C and F</xref>). CHIR was maintained for 4 days and expression of <italic>LHX2</italic> and <italic>TBR2</italic> was assessed at day 15 using qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Upon treatment, expression of both <italic>LHX2</italic> and <italic>TBR2</italic> scaled with the CHIR dosage, with no detectable expression for either marker at the 12 μM dose, regardless of treatment onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, at this high concentration, organoid morphology was compromised (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). We therefore sought to identify a dosage that would both maintain proper neuroepithelial morphology and effectively suppress forebrain identities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Notably, CHIR administration at lower doses revealed that treatment initiated on day 5 was more effective at suppressing anterior marker genes compared to treatments started on days 6 or 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). For instance, the 3μM dose had little effect on <italic>LHX2</italic> and <italic>TBR2</italic> expression when given at day 6 or 7 but reduced expression of both markers about twofold when given at day 5 without gross morphological abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1</xref>). This further supports the notion that, by day 7, neural progenitors are already committed to anterior identities and this specification can be prevented by early posteriorizing cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). With this temporal and dose information, we next sought to steer progenitor fates towards cerebellar identities.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Combinatorial WNT and FGF signalling activation stabilizes cerebellar identities</title><p id="P9">In the embryo, cerebellar development relies on the coordinated activity of WNT and FGF signaling at the MHB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). WNT signaling is essential for the formation and maintenance of the MHB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> while FGF signaling plays a crucial inductive role in establishing cerebellar competency within neuroepithelial progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. The synergy between these pathways is critical, as FGF signaling on its own can promote telencephalic identities during early brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Although these relationships are well established in vivo, the situation in vitro remains less clear. Since the pioneering work of Yoshiki Sasai and collaborators <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> cerebellar identities have been successfully generated in both 2D and 3D systems. These protocols typically employ dual SMAD inhibition followed by either combined FGF and WNT activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> or FGF signalling alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, showing that both approaches can effectively promote cerebellar identities.</p><p id="P10">To address this in our system and preserve as much as possible the intrinsic developmental program, we combined unguided neural induction (i.e., without dual SMAD inhibition) with treatment at day 5 using either 3 μM CHIR in combination with FGF2 or FGF2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Although FGF8 is the main inducer of cerebellar fates in vivo, FGF2 has been shown to be superior in vitro in inducing the expression of <italic>EN2</italic> and widely used to reproduce cerebellar identities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">At first, we sought to explore whether addition of FGF2 alongside CHIR would enhance or reduce WNT mediated suppression of <italic>LHX2</italic> and <italic>TBR2</italic> observed at day 20. Notably expression of both genes was fully suppressed by combinatorial signalling activation, an effect that was much stronger compared to either CHIR or FGF induction alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, in line with previous results, expression of <italic>LHX2</italic> and <italic>TBR2</italic> was still present if combinatorial treatment was performed at day 7 instead of day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, these minimally guided organoids displayed distinct morphological features compared to their unguided counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B and 2C</xref>), showing smaller buds and a few neural crest cells developing on their surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>); events which are developmentally coupled with posterior neural tube <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> and posterior neural plate border induction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, respectively. Supporting this, the loss of anterior markers was accompanied by the induction of posterior brain markers <italic>GBX2</italic> and <italic>PAX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2B</xref>). We also observed a mild reduction in the expression of the neural progenitor marker <italic>SOX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A</xref>), consistent with the presence of non-neural identities potentially coming from neural crest.</p><p id="P12">To gain further insight into the A/P positioning of minimally guided organoids we probed for expression of an array of key master regulator genes spanning from the anterior to the posterior end of the brain at days 11 and 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D-E</xref>). Expression profiles across all batches were integrated using principal component analysis (PCA). Interestingly, organoids organized in PCA space with a distinct trajectory along PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>) which represented A/P axis. This was assessed by looking at PCA loadings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>) as well as plotting relative expression values against PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Accordingly, unguided organoids predominantly clustered on the left side of the plot, driven by high expression of anterior markers <italic>TBR2</italic> and <italic>LHX2</italic>. Similarly, organoids treated only with FGF2 and CHIR+FGF2 at day 7 displayed a comparable pattern, with a few showing intermediate, midbrain-like identities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, combinatorial treatment at day 5 had a stronger caudalizing effect resulting in a marked shift in organoid identities driven by robust induction of <italic>EN1</italic> and <italic>EN2</italic> and the anterior hindbrain markers <italic>HOXA2</italic> and <italic>HOXB2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, the combination of WNT and FGF activation can effectively override anterior identities and reproduce MHB signalling and expression of cerebellar master regulators. We next investigated whether this would also lead to the generation of cerebellar progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Minimally guided cerebellar organoids exhibit cerebellar progenitor zones</title><p id="P13">The cerebellar primordium is subdivided into two distinct progenitor zones positioned along the dorsal-ventral axis: the ventricular zone (VZ) and the rhombic lip (RL). The VZ is located ventrally and is marked by <italic>PTF1A</italic> and <italic>KIRREL2</italic>. This region will give rise to Purkinje cells (PCs), deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and interneurons. Instead, the RL, which is more dorsal, is marked by <italic>ATOH1</italic> and gives rise to granule cells (GCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). If this minimally guided approach effectively recapitulates early cerebellar induction, we should expect the emergence of these distinct progenitor zones over time in the organoids. To test this, we assessed expression of the distinct VZ progenitor markers <italic>PTF1A</italic> and <italic>KIRREL2</italic> as well as RL marker <italic>ATOH1</italic> in both unguided and minimally guided organoids at day 20 and day 35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). In line with the above results, expression of these genes was uniquely induced upon early CHIR and FGF2 treatment and increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). A similar trend was observed for induction of the post mitotic Purkinje cell progenitor marker <italic>SKOR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>).</p><p id="P14">To complement these experiments, we performed immunostaining for the VZ markers KIRREL2 and SKOR2 at day 40, just after the onset of <italic>SKOR2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). In line with gene expression data, both markers were robustly expressed in minimally guided organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Notably, <italic>SKOR2</italic> expression was organized in a radial pattern around the organoid, resembling radial migration of VZ progenitors in vivo <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Overall, these data show that alongside cerebellar competency, minimally guided organoids develop further into the cerebellar program by generating VZ and RL identities.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Minimally guided induction of cerebellar identities translates across species</title><p id="P15">Given this protocol seems to recapitulate early cerebellar development in human organoids, we next explored whether this approach could also be applied to mouse ESCs and enable cross-species comparisons of cerebellar development. To achieve this, we made brain organoids using mouse E-14 ESCs. Notably, brain development in mouse occurs at a much faster pace compared to humans, therefore protocol steps were scaled according to mouse developmental tempo as previously performed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. Similarly to our previous approach, we tested the effect of applying posteriorizing cues at different times during the organoid differentiation protocol. Application of CHIR + Fgf2 beginning at day 2 or 3 resulted in the visible development of mesenchymal cell identities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>), suggesting a non-neuroepithelial identity. Instead, treatment from day 4 prevented this effect, leading to the formation of organoids which resembled the morphology observed in human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We next looked at expression of early cerebellar markers using qPCR at days 10 and 20. Intriguingly, as with human organoids, combinatorial Wnt and Fgf activation at day 4 suppressed the expression of anterior markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>) but induced robust expression of <italic>Gbx2</italic> alongside <italic>Pax2, En1</italic> and <italic>En2</italic> as well as the Purkinje progenitor marker <italic>Skor2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), without any detectable effect on <italic>Sox2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>). However, we did not detect significant <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression (data not shown), suggesting that in mouse organoids, RL progenitors may be underrepresented. Notably, consistent with in vivo mouse development where <italic>Skor2</italic> expression begins around embryonic day 12 (E12) in the cerebellum <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, minimally guided mouse organoids did not express <italic>Skor2</italic> until after day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). This shows that these organoids follow a developmental tempo comparable to that of in vivo embryogenesis.</p><p id="P17">To directly compare cerebellar progenitor marker expression between mouse and human organoids, we performed immunostaining for Skor2 and Kirrel2 at analogous developmental stages. Mouse organoids were stage matched based on the timing of <italic>SKOR2</italic> expression in human organoids (which begins around day 35, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>) and sliced at day 15. Immunostaining revealed a striking similarity with the human data in the expression pattern for both markers which displayed a comparable radial organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Intriguingly, in addition to these gene expression similarities, stage-matched mouse organoids were noticeably smaller than their human counterparts, resembling the in vivo differences in cerebellar size between the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>). This observation highlights how this minimally guided protocol recapitulates not only molecular features but also broad species-specific anatomical differences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">Overall, we developed a minimally guided cerebellar organoid model that effectively recapitulates early events in cerebellar development in both human and mouse ESCs. Building on unguided organoid models, we show that posterior brain identities can be induced using minimal signalling guidance. Indeed, by introducing posteriorizing cues before anterior commitment becomes irreversible, we successfully override anterior brain specification and promote cerebellar identities. This opens the possibility to explore specie-specific mechanisms underlying differences in cerebellar size. For instance, it has been shown that humans display a two-fold higher early Purkinje cell proportion compared to mouse, it would be intriguing to test whether this difference is dependent specie-specific delay in neurogenesis or due the unique presence of basal progenitors in the human cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">Furthermore, the cross-species adaptability of this approach offers a valuable tool for investigating human-specific expressivity of cerebellar diseases.

Directly comparing how the same disease determinants affect both human and mouse organoids is key to understanding why human cells are vulnerable to degeneration while mouse cells are resistant.

To visualize individual batched in PCA space, PC1 and PC2 coordinates were extracted and used for plotting in Prism10. Contribution of the different gene variables to PC1 and 2 was displayed using the <underline>fviz_pca_var</underline> function from the same package. Finally, plotting of relative expression value for each gene against PC1 was performed using the ggplot2 package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/</ext-link>). Statistical analysis on qPCR data was performing using Prism10 and a t test with with Welch’s correction, P values are reported into figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Fixing and sectioning</title><p id="P23">Human organoids at day 40 and mouse organoids at day 15 were washed in Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) and incubated in 4% PFA in phosphate buffer (PB) O/V at 4 °C. After fixation organoids were washed in PBS and moved in 30% sucrose/0.02% Sodium Azide (Sigma, S2002) in PB at 4°C until the tissue sank. The tissue was then embedded in 7.5% gelatin/30% sucrose in PB and frozen in a cold isopentane bath (Sigma, 277258) at -50°C. Samples were kept at -80°C until sectioning. Blocks were sectioned using a <underline>cryostat</underline> (Leica, CM1950) at 12 μm and sections were collected on charged slides (ThermoFisher Superfrost Plus, J1800AMNZ) and stored at -20°C until further processing.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging</title><p id="P24">Cryosections were rinsed in PBS 3×5 min. Slides were incubated in blocking buffer (0.1% Triton-X 100 with 4% donkey serum in PBS) for 1h at RT. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer at the following dilutions: rabbit anti-SKOR2 1:200 (Sigma, HPA046206), rabbit anti-KIRREL2 1:200 (Proteintech, 10890-I-AP). Primary antibody incubation was performed overnight at 4°C. The next day slides were washed in PBS and incubated with a secondary Donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 at 1:250 (Life Technologies) and DAPI 1:1000 in blocking buffer for 2h at RT. After PBS washes sections were let dry at RT and mounted in Prolong™ Diamond (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36961) and stored at 4°C. Mounted sections were imaged with a Nikon W1 Spinning Disk scope using an a 10X objective.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Organoids generation and neuronal patterning</title><p id="P25">To generate human and mouse unguided brain organoids single cell suspensions were obtained through incubations in Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich, A6964) for 4min at 37 °C. Next for both human and mouse ESCs, 4000 cells were seeded in U-bottom ultralow attachment 96 well plates (Corning, CLS7007) to generate embryo bodies (EBs) in defined EB media made of 2ml B27-A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12587010), 1 ml GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35050038), 1 ml of MEM-NEAA (Sigma, M7145), 96 ml DMEM-F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11330032) and supplemented with 50μM ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (Millipore, SCM075). EB media was kept from day 0 to day 5 for human organoids and from day 0 to day 2 for mouse organoids. Next EBs were moved in neural induction medium, composed of 1ml N2 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17502048), 1 ml GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 35050038), 1 ml of MEM-NEAA (Sigma, M7145), 100 μl Heparin solution (1mg/ml in PBS) in 96.9 ml DMEM-F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11330032). While in neural induction media, organoids were embedded in Matrigel droplets (Corning, 356234), this was done at day 6 for the human protocol and at day 4 for mouse and kept for 8 and 4 days respectively prior Matrigel removal using a fine scalpel. Human organoids were next incubated in improved differentiation medium without vitamin A (IDM-A) at day 7 as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup> while for mouse this was done at day 5. As a final step, human organoids were moved to an orbital incubator at day 14 and bathed in improved differentiation medium plus vitamin A (IDM+ A) from day 18 until day 31, from this day on organoids were fed with IDM+A with 1 ml dissolved Matrigel per 50 ml media <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Diversely, mouse organoids were moved to IDM+A at day 7 and to an orbital incubator at day 9 until sample collection. For the CHIR dose response, unguided human BOs were treated with either 1.5, 3, 6 or 12 μM CHIR (Tocris, 4423) and treatment was started at either day 5, 6 or 7 and maintained for 4 consecutive days. For this experiment organoids were embedded liquid Matrigel (5% in dNI media) instead of droplets which was added at day 5 and diluted through media change at each following day. For MHB patterning human organoids were treated with 50ng/ml human FGF2 (Human FGF-basic, Peprotech, 100-18B-100) from day 5 to day 14 and with 3 μM CHIR from day 5 to day 9, given FGF2 has a very short half-life at 37°C media was changed every day during the treatment. For mouse, 3 μM CHIR treatment was performed from day 4 alongside 50ng/ml Fgf2 (Murine FGF-basic, Peprotech, 450-33-100). CHIR treatment was maintained for two days while Fgf2 was maintained for three additional days.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="EMS199215-supplement-Supplementary_Material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d92aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank members of the Lancaster lab for their helpful feedback and discussions.
