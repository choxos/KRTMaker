Species names of lichens refer to the fungal partner, i.e. the quantitatively dominant mycobiont; the photobiont has its own name and phylogeny. Lichenisation is an ancient, ecologically successful nutritional strategy, going back at least to the lower Devonian (420 My, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Honegger et al. 2013</xref>), approx. 17 % of extant fungi being lichenized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lücking et al. 2017</xref>). Lichen thalli were defined as consortia with an unknown number of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Honegger 1991</xref>) or as complex ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hawksworth and Grube 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Morphologically advanced lichens have internally stratified thalli where photobiont cells are placed in optimal positions regarding illumination and gas exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Honegger 1986</xref>). The false reindeer lichen <italic>Cladonia rangiformis</italic> has a massive tubular fungal axis, the podetium, which branches abundantly in its terminal, youngest parts. The green algal photobionts (<italic>Asterochloris mediterranea</italic> or other <italic>Asterochloris spp</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Moya et al. 2015</xref>) are kept in islets at the periphery of the podetia below a thin cortex. In the fruticose <italic>C. arbuscula</italic> large numbers of bacteria grow on the inner surface of the tubular podetium and between thick-walled, glucan-rich conglutinate hyphae of the fungal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 6.5.g-j</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Honegger 2023</xref>). Like true reindeer lichens, <italic>C. rangiformis</italic> rarely reproduces sexually, pycnidia and ascomata being formed at the tip of the youngest branches. The thalli of reindeer lichens are elastic when wet, but very brittle when dry and in this state prone to fragmentation, e.g. by trampling. Fragments containing the mycobiont and photobiont and their microbiome are successfully dispersed by wind, animals or humans. Unintentional intercontinental anthropogenic dispersal of the West European <italic>C. rangiformis</italic> occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Clayden et al. 2021</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Diversity of the lichen microbiome is often assessed by using operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as proxy for species. Bacteria are typically classified based on 16S rDNA sequences, where samples with ~98% sequence identity are defined as belonging to the same species, while ~96% identity places them in the same genus. Eukaryotes species are routinely defined through internal transcribed spacers (ITS) sequences of rDNA, where samples of the same species usually share &gt;98% ITS sequence identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Janda and Abbott 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Edgar 2018</xref>). However, OTU counts should be considered carefully because sequence identity cutoffs may vary between studies. For example, a study on microbiomes from <italic>Cladonia</italic> lichens identified 79 abundant ITS OTUs, ~81% were fungi and 18% algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Shishido et al. 2021</xref>). However, most fungal sequences came from only four <italic>Cladonia</italic> species, while most green algae OTUs were from <italic>Asterochloris mediterranea</italic>.</p><p id="P10">The composition of microbiomes in <italic>Cladonia</italic> lichens seems to be generally similar. Shishido and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Shishido et al. 2021</xref>) identified 158 OTUs for bacterial 16S rDNAs, most belonging to <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> and <italic>Acidobacteria</italic>. Similar findings were made in the antarctic lichen <italic>Cladonia squamosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Noh et al. 2020</xref>) where most of the ~800 OTUs belonged to the <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> and <italic>Acidobacteria</italic>, with <italic>Rhodospirillales</italic> and <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> being the most abundant orders. In <italic>C. arbuscula</italic>, <italic>Acetobacteraceae</italic> closely related to the genera <italic>Gluconacetobacter</italic>, <italic>Acidisphaera</italic> and the species <italic>Rhodovastum atsumiense</italic> were found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cardinale et al. 2008</xref>). However, the microbiome of <italic>Cladoniaceae</italic> may also vary depending on the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Paulsen et al. 2024</xref>), or even along the axis of single thalli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wicaksono et al. 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Studies that aim at unravelling entire lichen metagenomes are rare. The main challenge working with metagenome assemblies is that they comprise a complex mixture of thousands of sequence contigs from fungi, algae and bacteria, which have to be assigned to individual species. Genomes reconstructed from metagenomes are referred to as metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Here, taxon-specific characteristics such as GC content, oligonucleotide frequencies and gene content can be used to infer to which species contigs belong. Additionally, there are specialized software such as MetaBAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kang et al. 2019</xref>) or CONCOCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alneberg et al. 2014</xref>) that use sequence coverage information to produce contig „bins” which ideally represent complete MAGs.</p><p id="P12">The first lichen metagenome published was from <italic>Umbilicaria pustulata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Tzovaras et al. 2020</xref>), using a combination of PacBio long reads and Illumina short reads. The genome of the <italic>U. pustulata</italic> fungus has a size of 33 Mb, while the <italic>Trebouxia</italic> sp. photobiont has a 53 Mb genome. The study found that the two organisms were present at a relative abundance of fungal to algal nuclei of ~20:1. The bacterial community was characterized through identification of sequence contigs containing 16S rDNA sequences. It was dominated by <italic>Acidobacteriaceae</italic> and contained bacteria similar to those typically found in lichens (e.g. <italic>Lichenibacterium</italic>, Pankratov et al. 2020). Very recently, 400 publicly available lichen metagenome sequences were re-examined, leading to the assembly of nearly 1000 MAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Tagirdzhanova et al. 2024</xref>). Genome sequences for <italic>Cladonia</italic> lichens are rare. We found genome assemblies for only nine <italic>Cladonia</italic> fungi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>), four of which are assembled into (near) chromosome-scale scaffolds, while the other five are fragmented into hundreds or even thousands of sequence contigs. One reason for the fragmented assemblies may be repeat-induced point mutations (RIP), a fungal mechanism to silence transposable elements (see below). The publicly available <italic>Cladonia</italic> fungi genomes are 32-39 Mb in size, which is rather typical for fungi (mycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/mycocosm/home/1000-fungal-genomes). Additionally, we are aware of only four published algae genomes from the <italic>Asterochloris</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>.). Furthermore, a few genomes from bacteria that commonly live in <italic>Cladonia</italic> lichens have been assembled: <italic>Lichenibacterium minor</italic>, <italic>Lichenibacterium ramalinae</italic> and <italic>Lichenicoccus roseus</italic> have been grown in culture and sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pankratov et al. 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">b</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Considering the limited data on metagenome sequences in lichens in general and <italic>Cladonia</italic> in particular, we aimed at producing a reference metagenome for <italic>C. rangiformis</italic> that includes fungus, alga and bacteria.

DNA from soil samples was extracted using the NucleoSpin(R) Soil kit from MACHEREY-NAGEL (REF: 740780.10).</p><p id="P17">All samples were sequenced at the Functional Genomic Center at the University of Zurich (FGCZ) with Illumina technology using mostly 150 bp paired-end reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref>). The Illumina DNA sequencing libraries were made with the Truseq PCR Free Truseq PCR Free kit to reduce the amplification bias. Additionally, the reference sample of <italic>C. rangiformis</italic> was sequenced with PacBio technology, creating large insert libraries, and using the PacBio Sequel system and four SMRT Cells 1M. The output reads were assembled by trying various assemblers (including SPAdes, flye, HGAP4 and megahit software) at FGCZ. The assembly with flye (metaflye mode) was one of the best and was used for further processing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S5</xref>). Illumina reads were then used to “polish” PacBio sequence contigs. Illumina reads for all samples were also assembled with the metaSPAdes software (v3.13.1) at default parameters. These assemblies were used for a limited set of analyses, such as species definition using ribosomal DNA (rDNA, see below). RNA was also sequenced for sample GR004 using Illumina technology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Pre-processing the PacBio reference assembly</title><p id="P18">The Illumina reads of the reference genome were mapped onto the PacBio assembly using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (v0.7.17) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Li and Durbin 2009</xref>). We used the functions view, fixmate, sort, markdup and index from the SAMtools package to further process the mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Li et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Danecek et al. 2021</xref>). The mapping was used to subsequently calculate average read coverage of individual PacBio sequence contigs.</p><p id="P19">We screened the PacBio assembly for potential chimeric contigs (i.e. sequence contigs belonging to different species that were wrongly merged). Here, we calculated GC content over a sliding window of 200 bp to identify abrupt changes in GC content along contigs in order to distinguish, for example, between segments that come from bacteria (GC content &gt;50%) from segments that come from the fungus (GC content of &lt;50%). Additionally, fungal genomic sequences contain regions with very low GC content as a result of RIP. These were then examined by dot plot alignments of the sequence against itself which allowed narrowing down the boundaries between regions of high and low GC content (Examples in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). With this method we identified 9 chimeric contigs that joined fungal and bacterial segments. In two cases, the boundary could be determined precisely since it contained fungal telomeric repeats (multimers of CCCTAA) while in two cases, the boundary contains long poly C/G stretches. Chimeric contigs were then split by hand and the segments assigned either to fungal or bacterial contig groups.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Assigning PacBio contigs to species groups</title><p id="P20">Frequencies of all 256 possible nucleotide tetramers were calculated for all PacBio sequence contigs larger than 10 kb. Shorter contigs were set aside because their tetramer frequency profiles are less representative. From this, a tetramer frequency matrix was generated which was then used for principal component analysis using R in order to separate the main species groups fungi, algae and bacteria.</p><p id="P21">Contigs shorter than 10 kb were assigned to the main species groups based on transposable element (TE) sequences. TE sequences are highly species-specific and due to their repetitive nature, can be used to assign genomic DNA segments to the respective species. Here, we first defined a reference set of large sequence contigs &gt;300 kb that were assigned to the alga and the fungus based on tetramer frequency, the presence of known plant and fungi-specific TEs, and genes with homology to previously published <italic>Cladonia</italic> or <italic>Trebouxia</italic> genomes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>) but had no hits to contigs we defined as belonging to bacteria. This was done to exclude any contigs coming from bacteria that still may have ended up in the fungal or algal contigs. This resulted in a set of 43 high-confidence fungal and 32 algal contigs. We then used the &lt;10kb contigs in blastn searches against the two reference datasets and identified all contigs with blastn hits &gt;300 bp. These hits were interpreted as coming from algal or fungal TEs, respectively, and the contigs assigned accordingly to alga or fungus contig pools.</p><p id="P22">Additionally, we searched the contigs shorter than 10 kb for RIP signatures. Here, we searched for sequences that had either an overall very low GC content of less than ~30%, and/or showed regions with abrupt changes from high to very low GC content. Of the 411 contigs identified in this approach, 403 were already assigned to the fungus in the TE search described above, which confirmed that low GC regions are mostly derived from fungal TEs. This step turned out to be largely confirmatory, since only 8 additional contigs were newly and uniquely identified through this approach to belong to the fungus.</p><p id="P23">Using tetramer frequencies for large contigs and the TE and RIP-based approaches for short contigs, we assigned 1420 contigs to the fungus and 198 to the alga pool.

Here, 1 kb segments at 10 kb intervals of the <italic>C. squamosa</italic> and <italic>Asterochloris</italic> reference chromosomes were used in blastn searches against the fungal and algal PacBio contig pool, respectively. This allowed identification of collinear segments that were then used to order the PacBio contigs into chromosomes. We were able to anchor 151 fungal and 55 algal contigs into chromosome-scale scaffolds.

The sample was whole-metagenome sequenced using PacBio long reads and Illumina short reads. The primary PacBio assembly of the <italic>C. rangiformis</italic> reference sample yielded 2,707 sequence contigs. Nine contigs were identified as miss-assembled hybrids and broken up accordingly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">methods</xref>) resulting in an assembly of 2,716 contigs with a cumulative length of 226.5 Mb. This primary assembly is a mixture of sequences from fungi, algae and bacteria which had to be assigned to individual species. To facilitate the species assignment, we also sequenced metagenomes of 28 additional lichen samples from five European countries (Greece, France, Finland, Iceland and Switzerland, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</xref>) with Illumina short read technology. Since the main focus of this study were <italic>Cladonia</italic> lichens, 16 of the samples represent this genus, but more distantly related lichens were also included (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Tables S2</xref>). The rationale for having these additional samples was to have quantitative sequence read coverage data from which the abundance of individual species in the respective samples can be inferred (i.e. species with higher abundance will be represented with higher number of sequence reads in the Illumina data). This data from the additional lichen samples proved essential in defining and isolating individual bacterial genomes in the reference <italic>C. rangiformis</italic> (see below).</p><sec id="S16"><title>Separation of main groups of organisms in the <italic>C. rangiformis</italic> metagenome assembly</title><p id="P39">To isolate genomes of individual species we used multiple steps and criteria to separate contigs into “bins”, which ideally represented genomes of individual species. The simplified workflow is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> (more detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). First, we isolated the mitochondria and chloroplast genomes which were assembled in single contigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>). We then classified the remaining sequence contigs into the three main organism groups, fungi, algae and bacteria using k-mer frequencies. Here, frequencies of all 256 possible tetranucleotides were calculated for all 2,716 sequence contigs. For initial identification of the main groups, we only used contigs larger than 10 kb, because the species-specific tetramer frequencies can be poorly represented in shorter contigs. Principal component analysis (PCA) clearly segregated three distinct groups of contigs (group 1, 2 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Group 1 contigs showed a wide range in GC content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4b</xref>), indicating that it represents the fungal genome. In fungal genomes we expected gene-containing regions to have higher GC content, while TE-derived sequences have very low GC content due to RIP (see below).</p><p id="P40">To assign contigs to fungi, algae and bacteria we also searched the contigs for sequences encoding canonical TE proteins such as transposase, reverse transcriptase or integrase. This confirmed group 1 contigs to represent the fungal genome, as they encode proteins with highest similarity to fungal retrotransposon superfamilies. Group 2 contigs contained numerous sequences with homology to plant TEs and thus represent the algal genome. Group 3 contigs were classified as representing bacteria genomes, because many encoded proteins with homology to typical Class 2 (DNA) transposons from bacteria, while retrotransposons were absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4c</xref>). Additionally, rDNA sequences identified in 41 contigs (38 bacterial, one algal and two fungal contigs) were also mapped onto the PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4d</xref>).

Therefore, we assigned sequence contigs that contain TE sequences to either fungus or alga based on DNA sequence homology: we used the contigs &lt;10 kb as queries in blastn searches against the sequence contigs &gt;10 kb that were assigned to the alga and the fungus, respectively in the previous step. Additionally, we identified fungal contigs based on signatures of repeat-induced point mutations (RIP, see methods).

RIP highly efficiently silences TEs through conversion of C-&gt;T during sexual reproduction, resulting in repetitive sequences being depleted in G and C content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cambareri et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Mazur and Gladyshev 2018</xref>).

Using this threshold, 62.5% of 500 bp genomic windows were counted as unripped and 37.5% as ripped.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, genes are practically unaffected by RIP, and their flanking sequences have in most cases roughly the same GC content. This is either due to the low-copy nature of protein coding genes, or because RIP in genes is selected against. In contrast, retrotransposons are primarily found in regions of very low GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, 2e</xref>). This could either mean that retrotransposons specifically target “ripped” regions, or that insertions into gene-containing (i.e. “unripped”) segments are effectively selected against. Additionally, the retrotransposons themselves are mostly ripped except for a few copies which were inserted into unripped regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Interestingly, DNA transposons are found in ripped as well as unripped regions, interspersed with genes. Furthermore, the DNA transposons themselves often show no RIP signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c, 2e, 2f, 2g and 2h</xref>). Indeed, some DNA transposon families were probably recently active, as many sequences contain newly inserted TEs which are characterized by a GC content similar to that of genic regions.

We interpret the latter as TEs that were more recently active and thus went through fewer RIP cycles (for example the <italic>DHH_Sana</italic> and <italic>RLC_Giouvetsi</italic> elements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 2g</xref>).</p><p id="P49">Curiously, the two families of DNA transposons identified here (<italic>DTX_Dionysus</italic> and <italic>DTM_Hades</italic>) show generally much lower levels of RIP than retrotransposons, although they are found at roughly even proportions in ripped and not ripped regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f</xref>). Additionally, for retrotransposon families there are only very few copies that are not ripped, presumably the most recently inserted ones, while all other copies show a rapid decline toward GC content of 10-20% when copies are ordered by their GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref>).

Indeed, a phylogenetic tree showed that 16S rDNA sequences coming from the same genome consistently clustered together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>), further validating the bacterial genome assemblies. In total, we estimate that our <italic>C. rangiformis</italic> metagenome assembly contains sequences from at least 23 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p><p id="P60">Interestingly, only four of the 18 bacteria had matches with at least 98% identity in NCBI, a commonly used cutoff for bacteria to be classified as the same species, indicating that our reference sample contains mainly poorly described bacteria.

They could be further classified into families such as <italic>Acetobacteraceae</italic>, <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic> and <italic>Sphingomonadaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a and 4b</xref>). BacN which might represent a chromid does not contain an rDNA sequence and therefore remained unclassified.</p><p id="P61">Of particular interest was BacD, which has a main chromosome (chr1) and a putative chromid (chr2). We are confident that the two chromosomes belong to the same species as all six 16S rDNA sequences found on chr1 and chr2 (3 on each) are identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4a</xref>).

Approximately 100,000 reads could be classified at minimum to the bacterial family level, and about 90% of them were from eight families (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">This protein also clusters with bacteriaFig. S10</xref>). Most of these reads mapped to our 18 bacterial genomes with only about 10% mapping to unassigned bacterial contigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The read mapping validated the bacterial genome assemblies as all of them had predominantly reads from a single family mapped to them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Additionally, the classification using MEGAN was consistent with the phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a and 4b</xref>). About 4,800 reads classified as <italic>Acetobacteriaceae</italic> were not assigned to a genome.

The profile of bacterial families present in both samples differs considerably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c, 4d</xref>). In comparison to <italic>C. rangiformis</italic>, the soil comprises a wide variety of different bacterial families, most prominent are representatives from the class of Actinobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>).

Furthermore, most of the taxonomic groups for which we could assemble bacterial genomes are strongly enriched in the lichen sample compared to the soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>), indicating that their presence in the lichen is not coincidental.

To identify putative HGT events, we searched for annotated genes in the <italic>C. rangiformis</italic> fungus and <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> algal chromosomes where Illumina reads mapped, that had been classified by MEGAN as coming from bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13</xref>). In this way, we identified a very strong HGT-candidate gene in <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13b</xref>). The gene <italic>GR013A_c05g006500</italic> encodes a protein that shows much higher similarity to bacterial proteins from NCBI (average 93%) than to algal proteins (average ~50%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S14</xref>). In fact, one of the closest homologs comes from <italic>Lichenicoccus roseus</italic> (TLU73585.1), a species for which we could reconstruct a bacterial genome (see above). The genes neighboring the HGT candidate have highest similarity to proteins from <italic>Trebouxiophyceae</italic> algae, indicating a single gene transfer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13b</xref>). We emphasize that we found no indication of a sequence miss-assembly in that region, excluding the possibility of a technical artifact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S13b</xref>). Additionally, the HGT candidate has a predicted novel exon at its 5’ end that has no homology in bacterial proteins.</p><p id="P69">The HGT candidate <italic>GR013A_c05g006500</italic> encodes a Glutathione S-transferase (GST).

The rationale was to determine whether plants have such homologs and whether they can be clearly distinguished from the bacterial proteins. We indeed found homologs from numerous plant taxa, including one in <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> (gene <italic>GR013A_c02g008250</italic>). We then produced a NeighborNet network that also included the top 100 bacterial homologs deposited at NCBI. The resulting network shows that the HGT candidate <italic>GR013A_c05g006500</italic> clusters with the bacterial proteins, while the ancestral plant homolog <italic>GR013A_c02g008250</italic> from <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> groups with other plant homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Additionally, we did not find a <italic>GR013A_c02g008250</italic> homolog in published genomes of <italic>Trebouxia</italic> species. We conclude that plants generally have ancestral GST, but that <italic>GR013A_c05g006500</italic> was horizontally transferred possibly from a <italic>Lichenicoccus</italic> relative into <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> after the <italic>Asterochloris</italic> lineage separated from the <italic>Trebouxia</italic> lineage.</p><p id="P71">Surprisingly, the closest plant protein to GR013A_c05g006500 deposited at NCBI comes from the Dalmatian chrysanthemum (<italic>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</italic>), a flowering plant of the Asteraceae family.

A recent study published the metagenome of the lichen <italic>U. pustulata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Tzovaras et al. 2020</xref>). However, that study focused on the assembly of fungal and algal genomes, while analysis of bacterial genomes was limited to rDNA. In contrast, 400 publicly available lichen metagenome sequences were re-examined, leading to the assembly of nearly 1000 MAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Tagirdzhanova et al. 2024</xref>), most of them from bacterial species.</p><p id="P74">Because of rapid technological development, the number of lichen metagenomes will grow in the future. We, therefore, considered it timely to assess and combine multiple different strategies to assemble high-quality MAGs for the fungus, alga and bacteria. Here, we want to emphasize a few particularly successful approaches:</p><p id="P75">At a basic level, k-mer analysis proved highly effective in separating the main organism groups: fungus, alga and bacteria. This method also worked for much more fragmented short read assemblies of lichen metagenomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Puvar et al. 2020</xref>). Additionally, because of their species-specificity and repetitive nature, TE sequences were highly effective to distinguish between plant and fungal sequences, and in some cases even between bacteria. To assemble chromosome-scale scaffolds for <italic>C. rangiformis</italic> and <italic>A. mediterranea</italic> we also took advantage of recently published genome assemblies. Although from different species, chromosomes were sufficiently similar to anchor our sequence contigs. Furthermore, for assemblies of bacterial genomes, considering sequence read coverage was essential. Here, it proved particularly useful that we had metagenome data from additional various lichens. Our combined use of the correlation matrices as well as the software CONCOCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alneberg et al. 2014</xref>) and MetaBat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Kang et al. 2019</xref>) allowed reliable reconstruction of bacterial genomes, while use of only one of the approaches may not be sufficient. Ultimately, we succeeded in assigning ~80% of the ~220 Mb assembly to individual species.</p><p id="P76">Due to limited resources, the initial assembly was done on PacBio Sequel technology. It is conceivable that use of the latest long read technology combined with chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C), may produce less fragmented meta-genome assemblies. Nevertheless, our chromosome-scale assemblies are of comparable quality as recently published algal and fungal genomes that were produced from pure cultures (e.g. <italic>C. grayi</italic> and <italic>A. glomerata</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Armaleo et al. 2019</xref>). However, while organelles assembled into single contigs, our bacterial MAGs are still fragmented to some degree.</p><p id="P77">The chromosome-scale assemblies allowed detailed insight into the organization of gene-containing and repetitive fractions of <italic>C. rangiformis</italic> and <italic>A. mediterranea</italic>, analyses that, to our knowledge, have not been done in lichens so far. We found both genomes to be highly compartmentalized regarding TE sequences. In <italic>A. mediterranea</italic>, we identified a pair of centromere-specific TEs that had strikingly resembling counterparts in grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Heuberger et al. 2024</xref>) where autonomous <italic>RLG_Cereba</italic> and non-autonomous <italic>RLG_Quinta</italic> retrotransposons are the main components of functional centromeres. Interestingly, the two systems must have evolved independently in algae and grasses, since <italic>RLG_Beelzebufo</italic> and <italic>RLG_Cereba</italic> represent different evolutionary lineages and contain different types of chromodomains, indicating that they acquired these domains independently.</p><p id="P78">The <italic>C. rangiformis</italic> fungus showed very strong RIP signatures, levels of which have been found in only a few fungi so far. RIP is proposed to occur during sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Cambareri et al. 1989</xref>). The fact that we find only very few “unripped” TE sequences could mean that <italic>C. rangiformis</italic> frequently undergoes sexual recombination, despite clonal propagation being an important mechanism for the spread of symbiotic “propagules” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Yahr et al. 2006</xref>). Alternatively, <italic>Cladonia</italic> fungi may have TE silencing pathways additional to RIP. InterestGlutathione Plant Growthingly, we also identified putative HGT events from bacteria into the eukaryotic partners. However, it is notoriously difficult to prove HGT, especially if it occurred a long time ago and/or the prokaryotic gene donor is not known. Indeed, while some studies reported HGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Armaleo et al. 2019</xref>), others found no evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Tzovaras et al. 2020</xref>). We were able to detect the origin of the GST which we regard as a likely horizontally transferred gene by, amongst others, relying on the annotation of proteins in the NCBI database. If proteins originating from assemblies of lichen (meta-)genomes are annotated as such and deposited in the NCBI database, a horizontally transferred protein will potentially have a higher similarity to proteins from other lichens than to the donor of the HT sequence, for example bacteria, when using the blastp search against the NCBI database. We, therefore, expect that the detection of HGT events becomes increasingly difficult as more metagenomic resources for lichens become available.</p><p id="P79">Our study was particularly informative with regard to the microbiome. The 18 bacteria species for which we assembled genomes were found at much lower abundance (or not at all) in surrounding soil, indicating they specifically proliferate in the lichen thallus. There are likely additional, less abundant species which we did not capture with our sequencing depth. Nevertheless, a recent study reported bacteria of the families <italic>Acidobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Acetobacteraceae</italic>, <italic>Beijerinckiaceae</italic> and <italic>Sphingomonadaceae</italic> to occur most frequently in lichens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Tagirdzhanova et al. 2024</xref>). These four families were also present in our 18 bacterial genomes. Additionally, all 18 were also found at least to some level in our 16 <italic>Cladonia</italic> samples coming from all over Europe. This indicates that the bacterial genomes isolated here are common and abundant cohabitants of lichens. Furthermore, we found two bacterial genera (<italic>Lichenicoccus</italic> and <italic>Sphingomonas</italic>) that were described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Tagirdzhanova et al. 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P80">Particularly surprising were the presence of <italic>Edaphobacter</italic> and <italic>Granulicella</italic> species, previously described as soil bacteria adapted to arctic climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Koch et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Rawat et al. 2013</xref>). We found them in consistent abundance in samples from north to south Europe. The two genera seem to be adapted to low carbon concentrations and metabolizing complex polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Koch et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Rawat et al. 2013</xref>). These bacterial inhabitants of lichen thalli might mobilize carbohydrates from the glucan-rich fungal cell walls for their own nutrition. At this point it is still not clear which roles the bacteria play in the symbiosis and whether there are additional species which we did not detect due to low abundance. Contrary to our expectations, we found none of the marker genes associated with nitrogen fixation, as reported in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Tagirdzhanova et al. 2024</xref>), indicating that nitrogen fixation is not a typical feature of the microbiome of <italic>C. rangiformis</italic>. Moreover, we also found none of the previously described lichenicolous fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Pino-Bodas and Stenroos 2021</xref>).
