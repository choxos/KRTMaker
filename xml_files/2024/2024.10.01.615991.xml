However, the large footprint, closed hardware and software ecosystems, and expense of commercial systems often hamper widespread adoption. Here, we present a compact, simple-to-build, low-cost, multimaterial, and high-throughput direct ink writing 3D printer platform with detailed assembly files and instructions provided freely online. In contrast to existing low-cost 3D printers and bioprinters, which typically modify off-the-shelf plastic 3D printers, this system is built from scratch, offering a lower cost and full customizability. Despite its low cost, we demonstrate advanced active mixing and multimaterial multinozzle 3D (MM3D) printing methods, which previously have relied on expensive and custom motion control platforms. We finally introduce embedded multinozzle and 3D gradient nozzle designs that offer high throughput and graded 3D parts. This powerful, easy-to-build, and customizable printing platform can help stimulate a vibrant biomaker community of engineers, biologists, and educators.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>3D bioprinting</kwd><kwd>active mixing</kwd><kwd>auxetic lattice</kwd><kwd>embedded 3D printing</kwd><kwd>multinozzle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Direct ink writing (DIW) is a versatile and rapidly advancing method for 3D printing soft and biological viscoelastic materials.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]</sup> In contrast with other 3D printing methods such as inkjet and stereolithography (SLA), DIW is ideally suited to printing multiple materials and can work with a wide spectrum of ink viscosities and chemistries.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]</sup> Thus, DIW has found a broad range of applications from printed biological tissues,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]</sup> 3D soft robots,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]</sup> energy and electronic materials,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]</sup> and structural light-weight and metamaterial lattices.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]</sup> Complementing this diverse materials palette is a collection of different DIW modalities, including embedded 3D printing,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]</sup> multimaterial gradients,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]</sup> chaotic,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]</sup> core-shell,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]</sup> material switching,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]</sup> and multimaterial multinozzle 3D printing.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]</sup></p><p id="P3">However, existing commercial printers for DIW and 3D bioprinting remain expensive, typically ranging from $10,000-$200,000, and often present researchers with a closed ecosystem of unmodifiable hardware, materials, and software.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]</sup> We posit that open source and open access hardware is ideally suited for keeping pace with rapid advancements in 3D printing, allowing free modification of all components. However, existing open source 3D printers usually modify off-the-shelf x, y, z-gantry systems,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]</sup> robotic arms,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]</sup> or even compact disc drives<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Their frequent reliance on commercial backbones can add significant cost, reduce design versatility, and rely on continued support and production of the base hardware that is being modified. In contrast, a bottom-up 3D printer design can offer greater flexibility, allowing on-the-fly customization of printer build volume, motors and axes, and printheads.</p><p id="P4">Here, we present the “Printess,” a $250 bottom-up open-source 3D printer constructed from six linear actuators and drivers, a microcontroller, and 3D-printed and laser-cut components. The printer is lightweight (3kg), compact (23 cm x 23 cm x 40 cm), and can be carried with one hand into and out of a sterile environment such as a biosafety cabinet. Despite its low cost, the printer exhibits a high degree of motion accuracy, achieving 10-μm motion repeatability. Underscoring the versatility of the Printess, we demonstrate its use in multimaterial bioprinting of a wide variety of inks, curing chemistries, and applications, including cell-laden biological materials for tissue printing, photocurable hydrogels for trileaflet valve printing, and thermally curing elastomers for soft auxetic multimaterial printing. Most importantly, the Printess supports many emerging advanced printing modalities, including multimaterial, multimaterial active mixing, multimaterial multinozzle, and embedded 3D printing. Two of these methods, active mixing<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]</sup> and multimaterial multinozzle 3D printing,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]</sup> were previously demonstrated using custom motion control stages costing over $300,000, hindering widespread adoption. To illustrate the versatility of the Printess, we further present two novel printing modalities: embedded active mixing and embedded multinozzle printing to produce gradients and high-throughput arrays of 3D geometries, respectively. To facilitate adoption and modification, a comprehensive list of drawings, instructions, code, and editable 3D files for the printer and its nozzles are provided online.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><label>2</label><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Design and Construction</title><p id="P5">The Printess chassis is constructed from two laser-cut acrylic sheets and 3D printed supports and adaptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). All components are screw-mounted using heat set inserts, allowing repeated assembly and disassembly from a boxed kit to facilitate transportation, customization for research, and use in hands-on student learning workshops. These structural components are used to mount six NEMA 11 linear actuators: base-mounted x- and y-axes (100 mm) that move the print bed, two mounted z-axes (100 mm) that can independently translate a pair of custom syringe pumps above, and two extrusion axes (50 mm) for volumetric material deposition. The collective build dimensions are 80mm x 80mm x 80mm. The six linear axes are controlled by an open source RepRap RUMBA+ 3D printer board housing six stepper motor drivers. The microcontroller operates on an ATmega2560 microcontroller running a six linear axis version of the Marlin computer numerical control (CNC) firmware. The Printess can also be expanded with a number of optional features, including fans, heat beds with temperature control, a touchscreen, and end-stops. The printer is connected via USB, can be operated through the Pronterface graphical user interface, and is compatible with machines running Windows or MacOS.</p><p id="P6">At its core, the six-axis machine is designed for multimaterial 3D printing of soft materials with two syringe pump extruders. The syringe pump can house 1, 3, 5, and 10 mL disposable and sterile syringes that are installed by a snap-fit geometry and can be temperature-controlled with a custom syringe cooling sleeve (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supporting Methods</xref>). This snap-fit design avoids having to sandwich the syringe barrel with a screw-on barrel holder and ensures an uninterrupted view of the contents of the syringe throughout printing for debugging, process monitoring, and educational purposes. The extruded material is deposited onto a print bed with a bed leveler and sample holder that can be customized for glass slides, Petri dishes, multiwell plates, or a temperature-controlled metal plate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supporting Methods</xref>). In addition to these core components for multimaterial and embedded 3D printing, the build can be modified with additional components to enable active gradient multimaterial mixing and multimaterial multinozzle 3D printing.</p><p id="P7">A complete parts list for the Printess can be found in the Supporting Information with all purchased components and raw materials costing approximately $250 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). We have tested manufacturing the Printess in two separate laboratories using printed components from two different commercial fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printers loaded with two different filament materials: 1) Prusa I3 MK3S loaded with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and 2) Markforged Mark II printer loaded with nylon with chopped carbon fibers (Onyx) inlaid with continuous carbon fibers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Note that depending on 3D printer performance and settings, the 3D printed component dimensions may need to be adjusted; editable 3D files are provided for this purpose. Once components are printed and laser cut, the printer can be assembled in under one hour. To date, our laboratory has constructed a fleet of sixteen Printesses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>), where they find daily use for research, education, and workshops.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><label>2.2</label><title>Characterization and Multimaterial Printing</title><p id="P8">The Printess linear actuators are driven by NEMA 11 stepper motors. To reduce printer cost and complexity, the Printess does not use encoders, so the actuators are driven in an open-loop fashion. To measure the error associated with stepper motor skipping or thread backlash, we commanded a 10 mm sawtooth motion in the x-, y-, or z-axes while measuring true linear position using an external optical linear encoder. Both the z-axes were commanded as a dual carriage. The resulting error between real and nominal distances as the motors change direction between the forward and backward directions arises chiefly from thread backlash, which is about ±75 μm for the x-axis, ±150 μm for the y-axis, and ±50 for the z-axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A-B</xref>). These backlash errors are similar to other published bioprinter designs,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]</sup> and can be reduced by compensatory motion to overcome thread backlash upon a change in direction. The roughly 50 μm amplitude oscillatory behavior observed during motion correlates with the 1mm pitch of the lead screw. The average repeatability for each axis was about ±5 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Real velocities aligned closely with commanded velocities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). For the remainder of our experiments in this manuscript, we have not compensated for this thread backlash.</p><p id="P9">We assessed effective printing accuracy by printing a simple two layered crosshatch geometry onto a glass slide using Pluronic F-127 ink with red or yellow-green fluorescent dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Video S1</xref>). The centroid location of each printed filament along the x- and y-axes was found from analysis in ImageJ, and the average calculated pitch was 513 ± 11.4 μm from a commanded pitch of 500 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p id="P10">To measure the maximum pressures that the extrusion actuators can generate for printing viscous bioinks, luer-lock syringes (BD) were connected to a pressure gauge (Ashcroft, 25W1005) and plunged until the actuators stalled. Maximum pressures for 1 mL, 3 mL, 5 mL, and 10 mL syringes were 433 psi, 141 psi, 75 psi, and 52 psi, respectively, which all correspond to a total force generation of approximately 57.5 N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G-H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><label>2.3</label><title>Multimaterial Active Mixing Printing</title><p id="P11">Active mixing nozzles employ a rotating impeller to mix two or more incoming streams of material, and are especially well suited to efficiently mixing thick, non-Newtonian and yield stress fluids which are hard to efficiently mix via passive means.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]</sup> In addition, active mixers can be programmatically turned on and off to create well mixed or two-sided (Janus) filaments. However, these active mixers have previously been applied solely to non-living inks.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]</sup> Here, we use the Printess to demonstrate an active mixing nozzle capable of real-time active mixing of cell-laden bioinks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The mixing nozzle is mounted onto the Printess and features a 3D-printed printhead and a small rotary motor, powered and controlled from the RUMBA control board on the Printess, to drive a 3D printed impeller that churns two incoming bioink streams together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). The revolutions per minute (RPM) of the impeller and mix ratio between the two inks can be easily and arbitrarily modulated during printing using G-Code commands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). We characterized the ink switching dynamics by printing a snake pattern switching between uncolored and green Pluronic inks in a step and ramp regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). In the step regime, we observed a 120 μL delay from command to actual material switching, which we subsequently compensated for with an initial purge to demonstrate precise patterning control. Similarly, we observed a 200 μL delay in the ramped regime, which can also be compensated for with an initial purge. We next characterized the nozzle’s mixing efficiency by printing filaments with two Pluronic inks with different fluorescent beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). Without active mixing, the two inks remain separated as a Janus filament after extrusion, while partial and full mixing can be observed at mixing speeds of 100 RPM and 200 RPM, respectively.</p><p id="P12">We then demonstrated that the active mixing nozzle could be used to print human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), human dermal fibroblasts (HNDF), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) using gelatin-fibrinogen bioinks. The mixed condition (200 rpm) yielded printed cells exhibiting high viability compared to casted (non-printed) control (&gt;95%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). To assess the effect of active mixing on printed and cultured tissues, we co-printed and cultured HUVECs and HNDFs in both mixed and unmixed conditions, staining immediately post-printing and after 9 days with fibroblast marker TE-7 and endothelial specific adhesion molecule vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). To track cell migration across the mixed or Janus filaments, the average row pixel intensities of the fluorescent channels were assessed along the filament width. In both the mixed and unmixed conditions, the fibroblasts had spread across the full width of the filament, supporting highly migratory behavior.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]</sup> In contrast, the endothelial cells had undergone vasculogenesis throughout the width of the mixed filament, but the Janus (unmixed) vascular networks were found only towards the side on which endothelial cells were initially printed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G-H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref>). Prior studies have demonstrated robust endothelial cell angiogenesis towards a spatially separated source of fibroblasts.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]</sup> Given the rate at which fibroblasts can migrate through fibrin filament, the spatial separation of HUVECs and HNDFs in our printed filament and potential biochemical gradients is quickly lost, and the densely compacted fibroblasts may be impeding efficient angiogenic sprouting. Overall, these data confirm that active mixing nozzles can effectively mix living bioinks at a shear rate compatible with high cell viability for multimaterial tissue printing.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><label>2.4</label><title>Multimaterial Multinozzle Printing</title><p id="P13">Multimaterial multinozzle 3D (MM3D) printheads enable high throughput and versatile printing, with broad applications in robotics, origami metamaterials, and bioprinting. However, previous MM3D printheads utilized precise pressure control and a custom motion control stage, costing over $300,000.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]</sup> To facilitate broader adoption of this method, we have developed and characterized an MM3D printhead module that is compatible with the Printess platform, and editable MM3D printhead files have been made available online. The MM3D printhead is printed via SLA and features two parallel channel networks that ultimately combine at an array of eight nozzles, greatly increasing throughput of multimaterial printing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). This nozzle is mounted onto the Printess using a dual z-axis multinozzle backmount. Flow consistency across each of the eight nozzles is critical and dictated by the uniformity of flow path resistance and, ultimately, the SLA print-fidelity of the MM3D printhead. This consistency can be tuned to accommodate different SLA printers by modifying the diameters and lengths of each nozzle individually. The multinozzle used in these experiments has a flow deviation of less than 10% across all nozzles as measured by extruded mass of Pluronic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). A powerful feature of MM3D printheads is their ability to rapidly switch extruded materials within a single filament. Using the low cost syringe pump linear actuators of the Printess, we tested various material switching frequencies, demonstrating a consistent resolution down to 1 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref>), which, at a print speed of 5 mm/s corresponds to a 5 Hz switching frequency. While this switching frequency is below the 50 Hz achieved previously in MM3D using rapidly switching pressure controllers,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]</sup> the results here are generated with a homemade $30 syringe pump.</p><p id="P14">One application of this multinozzle is the printing of multimaterial auxetic structures, whose frequently periodic structure is amenable to parallelized manufacturing with MM3D printheads. Auxetic lattices have diverse functions, including as biomimetic support devices, wearable electronics, and mechanical grippers.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]</sup> While these are typically manufactured using a single material, multimaterial auxetic lattices manufactured with a combination of stiff and soft struts can exhibit improved auxetic performance.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]</sup> We designed a re-entrant honeycomb auxetic structure and printed four versions with the horizontal struts and the oblique legs composed of different combinations of stiff and soft silicones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>). Uniaxial tensile testing showed about an order of magnitude difference in Young’s modulus between the stiff (1.247 ± 0.034 MPa) and soft (0.135 ± 0.011 MPa) silicones. We measured the Poisson ratio of each auxetic structure from video analysis during uniaxial tensile testing and demonstrated that the Poisson ratio can be tailored by material selection alone with no change in geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4G, 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Video S2</xref>). A lower ratio of stiffness between the horizontal struts and oblique legs corresponded to a lower Poisson ratio. Overall, the Printess MM3D platform printed these auxetic lattices in a single parallelized pass in approximately 2 minutes, supporting higher-throughput and multimaterial printing methods.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><label>2.5</label><title>Embedded and Multimodal Printing</title><p id="P15">Embedded 3D printing into a viscoplastic and self-healing support bath can allow for freeform 3D writing of soft materials.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]</sup> To demonstrate and characterize embedded printing on the Printess, we printed a variety of objects at different scales. At large scale, we printed a 7 cm-long dragon using Carbopol with pigment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). To further quantify accuracy, we then printed a 2 cm-long Stanford bunny using carbopol with lithium bromide as a contrast agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Video S3</xref>). We took micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) scans of the printed bunny to compare with the model used for G-code generation and calculated a Hausdorff Distance of 0.25 ± 0.34 mm (mean ± RMSE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Most of the deviation from the model occurred when the extruders made frequent jumps and retractions between the ears due to layer-by-layer slicing. This error could be reduced with the use of alternative, non-layer-by-layer slicing algorithms that minimize these jumps.</p><p id="P16">To illustrate functional embedded printing, we designed, printed, and hemodynamically tested an idealized trileaflet valve and root of 25 mm inner-diameter. Several examples of fabricated valves using various 3D printing methods and materials have been previously presented,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]</sup> and we demonstrate a comparable valve that can be generated on our low-cost platform. We printed our valve using carbopol with PEGDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Post-UV curing, the valve was mounted in a univentricular simulator for hemodynamic testing,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]</sup> which demonstrated adequate performance of the 3D-printed valve under native pulmonary valve conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Video S4</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref> illustrates co-axial images of the valve in the open and closed states at peak-systole and end-diastole, respectively. Superimposed right ventricular and pulmonary artery representative pressure and pulmonary artery flow waveforms over five consecutive cycles confirm appropriate valve opening with effective forward flow throughout the cardiac cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>). For an average cardiac output of 2.4 L/min (heart rate = 60 bpm; stroke volume = 46.1 mL) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>) and peak-systolic right ventricular pressure of 34.7 mmHg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>), the valve effective orifice area was 1.7 ± 0.4 cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5B</xref>), and the mean and maximum transvalvular pressure gradients were 5.1 ± 0.3 mmHg and 10.7 ± 1.8 mmHg, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5C</xref>). Mean back-pressure during diastole was 15.4 ± 2.8 mmHg. Retrograde flow (regurgitant fraction of 28.5 ± 7.7%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5D</xref>) was likely due to perivalvular leak at the suture points, as appropriate coaptation of the leaflets was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Leaflet motion analysis showed that opening and closing velocities are consistent across leaflets within each printed valve and across valves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref> and S5E). Further, leaflet closing velocities (22.5 ± 2.9 mm/s) are consistently lower than opening leaflet velocities (40.3 ± 5.8 mm/s), which is in line with physiologic behavior.</p><p id="P17">Finally, we demonstrated novel multimodal printing by combining embedded printing with multimaterial active mixing and multinozzle printing. We printed a vase with color gradient using our active mixing printhead attached to a long nozzle for embedded printing using carbopol with red or blue pigment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). We also designed and 3D printed a high-throughput 32-multinozzle array, which combines ink flows from two parallel syringes and then splits the flow, using bifurcating trees, four ways in <italic>x</italic> before splitting each flow eight ways in <italic>y</italic>. Each path terminates in a male Luer connector for attaching a long metal nozzle for embedded 3D printing. Using this high-throughput nozzle, we printed a ‘forest’ of 32 tree models in 3.5 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Video S5</xref>). Using a single nozzle, this print would have required 2 hours. Future applications of these new printing modalities include using multiple cell- and matrix-based biomaterials to generate tissue constructs or support baths with variable compositions and properties as well as for high-throughput generation of small-scale tissue arrays.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><label>3</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P18">We developed an open-source, low-cost multimaterial 3D printer for use in research laboratories and educational settings. It is built from scratch using stepper motors and off-the-shelf materials, has highly customizable components, including syringe mounts and platforms, and is exceptionally low-cost at approximately $250. We demonstrate its capability of several printing modalities, including multimaterial, multimaterial mixing, multimaterial multinozzle, and embedded. In conjunction with commercially available slicing software, it can print arbitrary 3D models and reconstructed scans.

We plan to continue development of these printing modalities to study gradients in cell type and matrix environment towards printing and maturing functional tissues. The Printess contributes to broadening the accessibility of bioprinting with the long term aim of furthering the field of tissue engineering. Lowering the cost of bioprinters is an important step toward achieving broad adoption of biofabrication techniques across disciplines.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>4</label><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="S10"><label>4.1</label><title>Printess Materials and Methods</title><p id="P20">All CAD files, firmware, and scripts are available open-source on Zenodo at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13173619">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13173619</ext-link>.

Two 100 mm motors move the printing stage in the X and Y directions, two 100 mm motors independently raise and lower each extruder in the Z direction, and two 50 mm motors independently control extrusion from two syringes. 3D printed components and M3 screws secure each motor to the back and base acrylic plates. Precision and accuracy of motors was measured using an optical linear encoder (US Digital; EM2-0-2000-N) with a 2000 lines per inch strip (US Digital; LIN-2000-1-N). The strip was mounted directly to the stepper motor table, the linear encoder was mounted alongside the table, and a 10 mm sawtooth motion with 10 cycles was commanded.
