Classic histological analyses have revealed that this process shows hierarchical spatiotemporal patterning known as the spermatogenic cycle, wave, and descent of segmental order, indicative of currently underexplored mechanisms of tissue- and organ-scale homeostasis. Here, using mice, we conducted high-resolution, wide-field, and âultraâ long-term live imaging studies <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic>, combined with whole-organ mapping of differentiation stages. Such trans-scale measures demonstrate how stereotypic local cell turnover is coordinated into characteristic phase waves propagating along the seminiferous tubules, further organized into organ-scale patterning over the tubule loops. Minimal mathematical modeling shows that such higher-order dynamics can emerge from the local coupling of autonomous oscillators, which are rooted in delayed feedback interplay between stem and differentiating cells via retinoic acid signaling. These findings highlight a selforganization mechanism underpinning organ-scale homeostasis and constant sperm production.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">In long-lived organisms, tissues and organs maintain homeostasis over extended periods, during which multiple generations of differentiating cells are supplied by stem cells and turnover. Through intensive studies, substantial knowledge has been gained into stem cell properties and niche-based regulation. However, the mechanisms that ensure the consistent supply and turnover of differentiating cells remains underexplored.</p><p id="P4">Mouse spermatogenesis is an ordered process of cell turnover that supports continual sperm production, presenting an ideal system to address this question<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In the mouse testis, spermatogenesis takes place within the seminiferous epithelium. The seminiferous epithelium is arranged three-dimensionally into convoluted seminiferous tubules, whose diameter is 150-200Î¼m. Seminiferous tubules, which reach up to 2 meters in length and are split into approximately 10-11 loops, make up the entire testis. Each testis produces around 5 million sperm per day, translating to over 10<sup>9</sup> sperm per individual over a lifetime.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup></p><p id="P5">In the seminiferous epithelium, the entire process of stem cell self-renewal and commitment, differentiation, maturation and sperm production occurs within a sheet of somatic Sertoli cells, which form tight junctions (also called blood-testis barrier) separating the basal and adluminal compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). A minority population of undifferentiated spermatogonia (A<sub>undiff</sub>) residing on the basement membrane functions as stem cells, balancing self-renewal and the production of committed A<sub>1</sub> spermatogonia. A<sub>1</sub> spermatogonia experience a series of mitoses on the basement membrane, progressing through A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, A<sub>4</sub>, intermediate (In), and B spermatogonia before initiating meiosis. During meiosis, early spermatocytes detach from the basement membrane and translocate to the adluminal compartment through exquisite reorganization of Sertoli cells' tight junction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> After meiosis, haploid cells gradually move toward the lumen, transforming from round spermatids to elongating spermatids before being released through spermiation. Spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids form syncytia, connected by intercellular bridges that result from incomplete cytokinesis during mitotic and meiotic divisions. A<sub>undiff</sub> includes singly isolated (A<sub>s</sub>) cells and syncytia containing as many as 16 cells, while tens to hundreds of spermatocytes may form a syncytium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup></p><p id="P6">Notably, the A<sub>undiff</sub>-to-A<sub>1</sub> transition and subsequent differentiation proceed in a locally synchronized, temporally periodic manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>, right). This leads to a layered organization of the seminiferous epithelium, with maturing cell generations positioned more centrally. Vertically aligned germ cells display definite associations, indicative of stereotypic coordination between cell generations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S1</xref>). As each generation of sperm is released into the lumen, younger cell generations transition into a more mature state, restoring the tissue periodically to the same composition. This periodic change in the germ cell composition is known as the âspermatogenic cycleâ (or cycle of seminiferous epithelium) with each cell association defining a certain âstageâ of the cycle. In mice, S-phase labeling studies have estimated the cycle period to be 8.6 to 8.9 days, which is divided into 12 distinct stages (I to XII), with stage-specific durations varying from around 8 to 22 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> During adult homeostasis, Sertoli cells are post-mitotic and long-lived, while their gene expression and morphology change in synchrony with the spermatogenic cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup></p><p id="P7">In mouse, each stage of the cycle extends uniformly over cylindrical segments of the seminiferous tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Along the tubule length, such segments are typically found in an ordered sequence from stage I to XII and then back again to stage I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, right). Given the ordered temporal transition of the stages, this spatial arrangement indicates that the stage sequence moves along the tubule, a phenomenon termed the âspermatogenic waveâ or âwave of the seminiferous epitheliumâ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup></p><p id="P8">At larger length scales, the seminiferous tubule loops, each of up to 20 cm in length, are minimally branched, with ends open to the outlet of sperm, called rete testis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Histological observations show that the stages of the cycle are typically arranged in decreasing order (e.g., XII, XI, X, and so on) in the direction away from the rete, with the order reversing around the middle of the loop. This large-scale patterning is known as the âdescent of segmental orderâ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup></p><p id="P9">The spermatogenic cycle, wave, and descent of segmental order have shown that seminiferous tubules exhibit well-coordinated cell turnover, captivating scientific interest. However, the trans-scale nature of this processâfrom the micrometer scale of individual cells to the tens of centimeters scale of tubule loopsâhas hindered attempts to achieve a mechanistic understanding of the underlying cell behaviors. Critically, the dynamics of this system have been inferred only indirectly from static measurements obtained from the analysis of fixed specimens, limiting insights into the core dynamical principles and regulatory mechanisms. In addition, static observations have revealed that the spatial wavelength (the tubule length spanning the entire sequence of 12 stages) is highly variable. Moreover, although the stages generally follow a sequential order, there are short stretchesâknown as 'modulations'âwhere the stage order is reversed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> These irregularities make capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of mouse spermatogenesis more challenging.</p><p id="P10">To address the mechanism of coordinated cell turnover, it is crucial to determine how the A<sub>undiff</sub>-to-A<sub>1</sub> transition is regulated. Among various factors regulating the fate of spermatogenic stem cells, retinoic acid (RA) is known to be a critical driver of this process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> Local RA concentration within seminiferous tubules varies in synchrony with the spermatogenic cycle, showing pulse elevations at stages VII to VIII.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> This RA pulse induces the A<sub>undiff</sub>-to-A<sub>1</sub> transition, as well as other differentiation events such as initiation of meiosis and spermiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> Further, when germ cell differentiation is halted by RA depletion, its restoration synchronizes the stage of spermatogenic cycle across the testis, followed by gradual stage dispersion to recover the original distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> Another cue arises from a rat-to-mouse germ cell transplantation study: When rat germ cells are nourished by mouse somatic cells, the reconstructed spermatogenesis exhibits a 13-day cycle, consistent with the natural cycle of the rat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> These experiments indicate that changes in RA concentration are crucial to control the germ cell differentiation timing, and that germ cells play a crucial role in establishing the tempo of the spermatogenic cycle. However, their specific functions remain to be elucidated either at the cell biological level or from a dynamical systems perspective.</p><p id="P11">To overcome current limitations and capture the spatiotemporal coordination of germ cell differentiation, continuous live imaging across broad temporal and spatial scales is vital. Previously, an intravital (<italic>in vivo</italic>) live-imaging platform was developed that enabled the observation of fluorescence-labeled cells within the testis of adult mice kept under anesthesia for up to 3 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> Yet, this duration represents only a fraction of the spermatogenic cycle. By contrast, advances in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> culturing of seminiferous tubules using a gas-permeable microfluidic device allows spermatogenesis to be maintained for several months,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> providing the opportunity to develop continuous live imaging over periods greatly in excess of the cycle time. At the organ scale, the anatomy of all constituent seminiferous tubule loops and the stage distributions have been reconstructed in 3D from serial sections of whole testes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup></p><p id="P12">Here, we refined live-imaging platforms to continuously film germ cell turnover within mouse seminiferous tubules for up to 9 days <italic>in vivo</italic> and one month <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Combining these observations with precise spatial mapping of the stage distribution across tubule loops, we captured quantitatively the spermatogenic wave dynamics across multiple length and time scales. Based on these measures, we developed a minimal mathematical framework to understand the nature of the local cell turnover and its large-scale coordination along the seminiferous tubules. Together, these results suggest that the robust phase wave dynamics emerges as a self-organization phenomenon within the context of spatially homogeneous seminiferous tubules, independent of external positional cues or scale-specific mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Trans-scale live-imaging of spermatogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic></title><p id="P13">To visualize germ cell differentiation and the dynamics of the spermatogenic cycle and wave, we used <italic>Stra8-EGFP</italic> mice harboring a modified BAC expressing EGFP-tagged Stra8 (Stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8) protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup> Endogenous Stra8 is expressed in early spermatocytes during stages VII to IX and in spermatogonia during stages VII to I in response to the RA pulse that occurs in stages VII-VIII.

Such coupling may arise from mechanisms such as local RA diffusion within the seminiferous tubules, while RA diffusion between neighboring tubules is assumed to be suppressed by an RA inactivating enzyme (Cyp26b1) expressed in peritubular myoid cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> From stochastic simulations, we found that the 1D-extended RA model could reproduce the intricate behaviors of the stochastic Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model, showing irregular phase waves superimposed on a global V-shape pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7I-J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Supplementary Theory Figure T16</xref>).</p><p id="P39">These findings support the hypothesis that the known feedback mechanisms between stem cells and differentiating cells via RA can generate a coupled oscillator, ensuring the robustness of the spermatogenic cycle. Further, through neighborhood coupling, this mechanism also explains the intricate phase wave behaviors along the tubules, recapitulating the dynamics of the stochastic Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model. Our model only defines minimal essential components to capture the critical property of higher-order dynamics. However, at molecular and cellular scales, many other factors must also be involved in proceeding with this feedback mechanism. These include additional RA metabolizing enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> and other signaling molecules.

Here, to capture the long-term dynamics of mouse spermatogenesis across length scales, we developed âultraâ long-term live-imaging techniques. By linking these observations with precisely mapped macroscopic wave patterns using mathematical modeling, we demonstrated that the intricate dynamics of the spermatogenic wave can be understood as a self-organizing phenomenon, emerging from uniform seminiferous tubules that form coupled oscillators, without the recourse to external guidance cues. We further propose how RA-mediated feedback interactions between stem cells and differentiating cells can generate an autonomous local oscillator and phase wave dynamics along the seminiferous tubules. These results provide mechanistic insights into the spatiotemporal coordination of spermatogenesis. More generally, the current study extends the traditional view that homeostasis relies on tissue stem cells and their niche.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> Instead, these results point at a broader paradigm, where stem cells and differentiating cells are tightly coordinated across cell, tissue, and organ scales, facilitating persistent cell turnover through a self-organization mechanism.</p><p id="P42">Self-organization phenomena in biological systems have been extensively explored, particularly in the context of morphogenesis during development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> Specifically, local oscillations and phase wave formation have been observed in processes such as vertebrate somitogenesis, neurogenesis, and fruiting body formation in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup> These morphogenetic patterns occur on spatiotemporal scales orders of magnitude smaller than those in mouse spermatogenesis. For instance, mouse somitogenesis exhibits a 2-hour cycle and spatial wavelengths of hundreds of micrometers (i.e., tens of cells), forming within millimeter-scale presomitic mesoderm tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> In these microscopic dynamic processes, the underlying physical principle and its biological basis have been intensively studiedâthough still not fully understood. By contrast, the macroscopic coordination of cell dynamics during homeostasis has remained underexplored, primarily due to the challenges posed by their large spatiotemporal scales. The current study highlights that, while the spermatogenic wave may rely on the same class of physical mechanisms as developmental morphogenesis, it exhibits distinct features tailored to the functional requirements for tissue and organ-scale homeostasis.</p><p id="P43">First, the origin of the massive differences in time and space scales is an intriguing problem. In somitogenesis, individual cells primarily act as oscillators, with intracellular levels of gene products and metabolites fluctuating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup> In this scheme, time-delayed feedback regulation is rooted in molecular processes such as transcription, translation, protein maturation, localization, and degradation. By contrast, the current study suggests that, in adult spermatogenesis, a group of cells within a local tissue region, including both stem cells and differentiating cells, function collectively as a phase oscillator. Herein, cell differentiation proceeds periodically, with the levels of intercellular signaling molecules such as RA oscillating. In this system, differentiating cells can mediate feedback coupling by regulating the fate of the stem cells from which they originate, with time delays arising from the duration required for stem cells to differentiate into certain stages. This lengthy process explains the characteristically long 9-day rhythm. These findings highlight how the same physical mechanism can operate across different biological hierarchies, functioning on diverse spatiotemporal scales and serving distinct rolesâin this case, morphogenesis and homeostasis.</p><p id="P44">Second, building on the previous point, it is worth emphasizing that while phase waves in developmental patterning are transient, the adult spermatogenic wave is persistent. In the former, phase waves provide spatiotemporal cues for progenitor cells to differentiate irreversibly into specific cell types. At this point, oscillation and phase waves terminate, fixing the spatial pattern. However, in adult spermatogenesis, although the phase waves similarly dictate the differentiation of stem cells, these cells robustly maintain a self-renewing compartment that produces differentiating cells in subsequent cycles if exposed by RA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> Consequently, the oscillations and traveling phase waves do not terminate but persist. This difference underscores their distinct biological functions: phase waves in developmental patterning imprint a blueprint for future structure while, in homeostasis, they sustain long-term cell turnover and sperm production.</p><p id="P45">Finally, it is important to note that spermatogenic waves exhibit significant irregularities in their spatiotemporal patterns. This feature contrasts with developmental morphogenesis, where phase wave dynamics typically generate spatially ordered patterns from unstructured conditions, as seen in somitogenesis from the presomitic mesoderm. Indeed, this spatial irregularity in spermatogenesis becomes even more pronounced in non-rodent species like humans and birds, where the spatial arrangements within the seminiferous tubules are more intricate and less organized, despite being based on similarly stereotypic local cycles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref></sup> While the mechanisms underlying the species difference remains to be explored, this suggests that, instead of generating spatially regular patterns, phase waves in mouse spermatogenesis serve two key functions in homeostasis: maintaining local phase coherence and facilitating phase dispersion over greater length scales. Microscopically, phase coupling minimizes gaps in differentiation timing between neighboring sites. This mechanism effectively prevents stage-specific signaling molecules from diffusing into adjacent regions at distant stages of the cycle, or a single Sertoli cell from nurturing germ cells at distinct stages. Macroscopically, the formation of phase waves effectively disperses stages of the spermatogenic cycle, which is further averaged by the V-shape pattern over the tubule loops. This property underpins organ-scale homeostasis and stable sperm production.</p><p id="P46">Mouse spermatogenesis is an ideal system for characterizing tissue-to-organ scale patterning, thanks to the dramatic changes in cell morphology during differentiation and the prominent local synchrony resulting from syncytia formation. However, such macroscopic patterns, if present, might remain unrecognized in other cycling tissues and organs during adult homeostasis. A close analogy can be drawn with the hair follicle, which undergoes periodic bouts of growth and regression, with cycles extending over a couple of months (the hair cycle).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup> Reminiscent of spermatogenesis, hair cycles can become globally desynchronized under regenerative conditions and certain genetic backgrounds, leading to phase wave-like propagation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref></sup> It remains a vital question for future research whether the dynamics of coupled oscillators caused by feedback interplay between stem cells and differentiating cells, or other self-organization mechanisms, are employed in the regulation of stable homeostasis in skin or other organ contexts over similarly extended spatiotemporal scales. Equally, it will be intriguing to see how these mechanisms may alter in non-homeostatic contexts such as growth, aging, regeneration, and disordered states. Trans-scale live imaging technologies may provide essential insights for addressing these questions and advancing our understanding of a wide range of biological processes.</p><sec id="S11"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p id="P47">The <italic>ex vivo</italic> live-imaging studies conducted in this study used juvenile, rather than adult, testis explants as source material, due to current technical limitations.

These include RA actions and metabolism not described in the model explicitly, extracellular signals other than RA, and somatic cells such as Sertoli cells. Further, while focusing on cell turnover during homeostasis, our model does not account for other contexts in which the spermatogenic cycle is established from conditions where differentiating germ cells (e.g., LP and RT) are absent, including the first-wave of spermatogenesis in postnatal mice or regeneration following insult or transplantation.

spatiotemporal coordination of germ cell differentiation in mouse testis at distinct scales</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> In the seminiferous epithelium, A<sub>undiff</sub> (blue) on the basement membrane form the stem cell compartment, supplying differentiating cells that mature into sperm via spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids. This differentiation, accompanied by cell movement toward the lumen, proceeds periodically to establish the layered architecture (left). As germ cells turn over each generation, the cell association cycles, a phenomenon known as the spermatogenic cycle (right, rectangles, and purple gradient). Based on cell associations, this cycle is morphologically divided into stages I to XII (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12">Figure S1</xref> for details). PL, preleptotene; L, leptotene; Z, zygotene; P, pachytene; D, diplotene. <bold>(B)</bold> On larger scales, the seminiferous epithelium is shaped into seminiferous tubules. The rectangle indicates the scale shown in (A). In the seminiferous tubules, each spermatogenic cycle stage extends over a cylindrical segment (left). Along the tubule length, the stages typically follow their chronological order (I to XII and back to I) as illustrated by purple gradients (right). This organization is known as the spermatogenic wave. <bold>(C)</bold> At the organ scale, seminiferous tubules form long loops connected at both ends to the rete testis, the common outlet for sperm (left). The rectangle indicates the scale described in (B). About 10 loops compose a single testis (middle, right). Typically, the spermatogenic wave is arranged so that the stage number descends away from the rete testis, known as the descent of segmental order (shown by the purple gradient on the left side of the panel). The asterisk marks the site of reversal of the wave direction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199917-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title><italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> live-imaging studies using <italic>Stra8-EGFP</italic> mice visualize the spatiotemporal coordination of germ cell differentiation</title><p><bold>(A-C)</bold> Characterization of <italic>Stra8-EGFP</italic> mouse testis.
