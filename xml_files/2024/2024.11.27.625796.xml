Sex-specific prioritisations (e.g. mating, maternal care), or generalised prioritisations (e.g. feeding, drinking, sleeping) may differently influence approach-avoidance behaviours based on the level of “risk” and homeostatic need state of the organism. However, given known sex differences in key aspects that may influence this behaviour, direct comparison of how male and female mice make decisions to approach or avoid a dangerous area while in a fasted state have yet to be conducted.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P2">We conducted several approach-avoidance tasks with varied levels of risk and reward in male and female mice that were either fasted or sated (fed). Mice underwent a light-dark box, elevated plus maze, baited large open field and runway task to assess their approach and avoidance behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results</title><p id="P3">In the light-dark box and elevated plus maze, when no reward was available, fasted female mice showed greater approach behaviours than male counterparts. In the baited large open field, when reward was available, both sexes showed increased approach behaviours when fasted. However, when sated, male mice conversely showed greater approach behaviours compared to sated female mice. In the runway task, while sated mice failed to learn, fasted male mice inhibited their reward consumption in response to increased shock intensity; however, fasted female mice were resistant to increased shock intensity.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P4">Our study identifies sex differences in decision making behaviour in mice based on satiety state across a number of approach-avoidance tasks. We highlight several nuances of these differences based on reward availability and punishment intensity. These results shine a lens on fundamental differences between the sexes in innate, survival driven behaviours that should be taken into account for future studies.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sex differences</kwd><kwd>hunger</kwd><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>approach-avoidance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S7" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P9">When making decisions, both benefits and risks must be considered, requiring integration of various internal and external stimuli, and usually prioritised based on current physiological needs and/or reproductive goals of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">McNamara and Houston, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">McFarland, 1977</xref>). When an animal is hungry, it will engage in foraging behaviour; however, an approach-avoidance conflict can arise when there are two divergent goals, creating competition between incompatible motivations (Miller, 1944). For example, when foraging for food, an animal must leave its nest, which may put it at risk of predation. In this situation, an organism must dynamically calculate the value of the food reward relative to the risks associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gilliam and Fraser, 1987</xref>). Core aspects of decision making under this motivational conflict can be modelled using approach and avoidance behaviours. First described by Gray in the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory, there are two main motivational systems engaged by a stimulus to achieve a goal - the behavioural approach system (move towards a reward) and the behavioural inhibition system (avoid a punishment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Gray, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dunnet, 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Rodent models of “risky” decision making often utilise a variable reward schedule of small safe or large risky reward using rodent gambling tasks. However, these models do not encapsulate the threat associated with survival, given the “risk” in these tasks is associated with delay or reward omission and a subject can chose to disengage with the task completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Visser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lockie et al., 2017</xref>). Several groups have modified classical approach-avoidance behavioural tests (light-dark box, elevated plus maze, large open field) to include a foraging element to probe how physiological hunger signals modulate decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lockie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Teegarden and Bale, 2007</xref>). Indeed, rodents are generally more likely to engage in approach behaviours after fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Towers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lockie et al., 2017</xref>); however, the majority of these studies have focused on male subjects despite known sex differences in decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Orsini &amp; Setlow, 2017</xref>), stress/threat sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bangasser et al., 2019</xref>); reward seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Maddern et al., 2024</xref>) and metabolic hormone signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Börchers et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Pearl et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Asarian &amp; Geary 2013</xref>). Further understanding of how biological sex may impact approach-avoidance decision making is required.</p><p id="P11">Reproductive maturity can differentially affect behavioural decision-making between sexes based on both sex-specific prioritisations (e.g. mating, maternal care), or generalised prioritisations (feeding, drinking, sleeping) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Mowrey et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, behavioural decision-making may be highly specialised in each sex, depending on homeostatic need state. Therefore, here we assessed approach-avoidance behaviours across several approach-avoidance tasks with varying degree of reward and risk in adult male and female mice to assess how mice adapt their decision-making under conflict, dependent on energy status.</p></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Animals</title><p id="P12">C57BL6J mice (N = 65) were obtained from ARC (Animal Resources Centre, WA, Australia) at ~6 weeks of age. Mice were acclimatised to a reverse light cycle (lights off 8:00-20:00 AEST). All mice had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food (laboratory chow, Barastoc, VIC, Australia) and water except where detailed. Mice were habituated to peanut butter chips (Reese’s, The Hersey Company, Hershey, PA, USA) and sucrose (8% w/v) in their cage before the tasks begun to prevent neophobia. All experiments were conducted between 9:00 – 13:00 AEST. All studies were performed in accordance with the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (2004), under the guidelines of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Experimental Purposes in Australia (2013), in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Percie du Sert et al., 2020</xref>) and approved by The Florey Animal Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Light-Dark Box</title><p id="P13">Male and female mice with free access to food (n = 8/sex) or which had been fasted overnight (~16 hours; n = 8/sex) were tested in automated locomotor cells (Activity Test Chamber #ENV-510; Med Associates Inc, USA) as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Maddern et al., 2024</xref>; Anversa et al., 2024). The locomotor cell was equally divided into 2 distinct zones (“light” and “dark”) connected with a small opening (10cm x 10cm) enabling mice to move freely between the zones. The “light” zone was lit by an array of light-emitting diodes (750 LUX) that were centrally placed. Mice were placed into the dark zone to begin the 10 min test, with movement tracked by Tru Scan 2.03 software (Coulbourn Instruments, USA). Mice were given at least 5 days free feeding before undergoing Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) testing.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Elevated Plus Maze (EPM)</title><p id="P14">The elevated plus maze (EPM) apparatus was a standard mouse plus maze (30 cm [L] × 5 cm [W] × 15 cm [H]) in a room with lighting adjusted to 175 LUX with illuminance within the maze at ~15 LUX. Fed (n = 8 males, 9 females) or fasted mice (~16 hours fasting overnight; n = 8 males, 7 females) were placed at the junction of the four arms of the maze facing an open arm, and the duration in each arm was automatically tabulated with TopScan TopView analysing system 3.0 (CleverSyst Inc, VA, USA) for 5 min. Mice were given at least 5 days free feeding before undergoing subsequent testing.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Baited Large Open Field (LOF)</title><p id="P15">The baited Large Open Field (LOF) was conducted as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lockie et al., 2017</xref>). The open field arena consisted of a circular area (100 cm diameter) and was illuminated with a bright light (&gt;1000 LUX). The arena was separated into three areas, an outer zone, which extended 100 mm from the outer wall, a centre zone (10 cm diameter), in which a peanut butter chip (Reese’s™) was placed in the middle and secured to the floor of the arena with Blu-Tack (Bostic) and a transition zone between. Mice that either had access to food (fed, n = 8/sex) or were fasted overnight (~16 hours; n = 8/sex) were placed into the transition zone and allowed to explore the arena without interruption for 10 min. Tracking software TopScan TopView analysing system 3.0 (CleverSyst Inc) automatically tracked the mice within the defined zones. After 10 min, mice were removed from the arena and placed back in the home cage with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water. The peanut butter chip reward was removed and weighed.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Runway task</title><p id="P16">The runway task was conducted in a separate cohort of male (n = 18) and female (n = 15) mice as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Choi et al., 2022</xref>) that were either free feeding or food restricted. Food restricted mice were maintained at 85-90% free feeding weight, starting 2 days before training. For the runway task mice were placed into a Perspex linear track (120 cm [L] x 15 cm [W] x 40 cm [H]) that was divided into 3 sections: the Start box (22 cm) constructed from grey Perspex walls and floor; the runway (88 cm) constructed of white Perspex floor and walls; and the Goal box (10 cm) constructed from grey Perspex walls and a stainless-steel grid floor. The Start box was separated from the runway with a transparent Perspex door; and the Goal box contained a stainless-steel receptacle extending 3 cm from the end wall to which the reward is delivered. The level of illumination of Start and Goal boxes was ~200 LUX, while the runway proper was ~350 LUX.</p><p id="P17">For training, mice underwent 4 trials per day for 4 days. Trials commenced with manual removal of the door between the Start box and the runway, with 5 μl of 8% w/v sucrose liquid/solution available from the receptacle in the Goal box on each trial. The trial was manually ended after mice consumed the sucrose reward or timed out after 120 seconds. At the end of each trial, mice were returned to the Start box for ~30 s until the start of the next trial. Following training mice had 1 day of rest before beginning the conflict task. For conflict, fasted mice underwent the same procedure; however, the grid floor in the Goal box was electrified using a 0.05, 0.075, or 0.1 mA current. Mice received 1 day of conflict at 0.05 mA (D5), 2 days at 0.075 mA (D6-7), and 2 days at 0.1 mA (D8-9).

Sex-specific prioritisations (e.g. mating, maternal care), or generalised prioritisations (feeding, drinking, sleeping), may differently influence approach-avoidance behaviours based on the level of “risk” and homeostatic need state of the organism. Therefore, we investigated how both levels of “risk”, and satiety (fed vs fasted) alter approach-avoidance behaviour in male and female mice. Overall, we highlight novel sex differences in how fasting alters approach-avoidance decision-making that depend on reward availability and level of risk in the task. Specifically, we show female, but not male, mice increase approach behaviours in the light-dark box and EPM after fasting, without food available. However, in the baited LOF, where a food reward is available, both sexes showed enhanced approach behaviour. Finally, neither male nor female mice were able to learn the runway task when sated; however, when fasted, female mice were more resistant to the mild foot shock, showing increased approach behaviours under high risk probability and reward availability.</p><p id="P31">To assess approach-avoidance conflict, our mice were subjected to distinct behavioural tasks that varied in the availability of reward, and the level of risk. In the light-dark box and EPM, which have relatively low risk and no food reward availability, fasted female mice showed greater approach/exploratory behaviours compared to fed counterparts, while no difference was observed in fed vs. fasted males. Previous studies have shown no difference in how male mice explored the light-side of the light-dark box after overnight (~16h) fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lockie et al., 2017</xref>); however, an increase in time spent in the open arms of the EPM was observed in both sexes after 24 h fasting in another study, although sexes were combined and sex effects not reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, this effect differed based on circadian variation, with differences observed in the early, but not late light period; and 12 h fasting was not sufficient to increase time in the open area of the open field task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Of note, the current experiments were conducted in the early-mid dark phase, when mice would naturally engage in foraging behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kronfeld-Schor and Dayan, 2008</xref>), and after overnight (~16 hours) fasting, which may explain some differences. Seasonal variations in activity and age-related variations have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Pernold et al., 2021</xref>). Our experiments were all undertaken in early adult mice (8-12 weeks ages throughout) and in the summer/autumn of the southern hemisphere in matched cohorts, but the impact of these variations cannot be ruled out. Collectively, these data suggest that fasting state is a major factor in decision-making under conflict in females, who are more willing to explore “risky” areas, despite no food availability.</p><p id="P32">To assess the generalisability of sex differences in approach-avoidance after fasting we increased the motivational conflict by employing a baited LOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lockie et al., 2017</xref>). Here our findings that fasted male mice had increased motivational drive and consummatory behaviour compared with sated male mice, align with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lockie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dodd et al., 2021</xref>). We extend these findings to show similar behaviour in fasted female mice. Interestingly, while approach and consummatory behaviours were similar between the sexes, where they decided to spend their time outside of the target (reward) zone showed distinct differences between the sexes, based on fasting state. When fed, male mice were more likely to spend time in the middle (transition) zone and, conversely, fed female mice spent more time in the outer (safe) zone. This aligns with our integrated avoidance score, which showed fed females spend less time in the “risky” zones compared to fed males, and previous literature suggesting female mice are generally more risk averse than male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Francesconi et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Orsini et al., 2016</xref>). To our knowledge this is the first assessment of female mice risk-taking behaviour using this task and highlights nuances in decision making between the sexes based on ability to obtain a reward. Independent of reward availability, fasted female mice were more likely to explore risky areas; however, when sated, they showed less risky behaviour compared to males.</p><p id="P33">To determine how intensity of “risk” may impact decision making between the sexes we employed the runway task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Choi et al., 2022</xref>). Here, after training, mice must overcome an electrified grid to receive a reward. Our training showed that fed mice did not consistently collect the reward, even in the absence of punishment, therefore we only continued to the conflict stage of the task with fasted mice. During conflict, fasted female mice showed greater approach behaviours, which were resistant to increases in shock intensity. As shock intensity was increased, male mice inhibited their behaviour, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Choi et al., 2022</xref>). When examining behavioural phenotypes male mice spent more % time resting compared to females, aligning with previous literature suggesting female rodents show greater locomotor activity under similar conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Maren et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aguilar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bethancourt et al., 2011</xref>). Increased shock intensity enhanced avoidance behaviour (moving away from reward) and sniffing the reward in both sexes, while rearing was increased, and approach behaviour reduced specifically in males during high conflict compared to females. Previous studies have shown rearing increases after stress in male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Füzesi et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting the task may elicit a stress response in fasted males; however, this was not the case in female mice. Sex differences in response to a foot shock have been previously described, with female rodents freezing less than male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dalla &amp; Shors, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aguilar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Bethancourt et al., 2011</xref>). Studies suggest this may be driven by different types of fear responses, not pain thresholds, with females showing greater levels of active fear response (darting) behaviours than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Dalla &amp; Shors, 2009</xref>). Therefore, sex differences observed in the runway task may be driven by active vs. inactive responses to the electrified grid during conflict.</p><p id="P34">Another factor that may contribute to the sex differences observed is learning. Previous research using an explore/exploit task, the spatial restless two-armed bandit, reported that male mice had higher levels of exploration than females throughout the task, but that was due to males being more likely to get ‘stuck’ exploring before committing to a favoured choice. In contrast, female mice showed elevated reward-driven learning specifically during shorter bouts of exploration, which led them to start exploiting a favoured choice earlier than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Other studies have shown sex differences in stress-induced binge eating, with fed female, but not male mice displaying binge-like behaviour after a mild psychological stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Anversa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">2023</xref>). Further, differences between the sexes may be driven by changes in demand for highly palatable foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Freeman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Tapia et al., 2019</xref>); however, we have not observed differences in taste preferences between the sexes previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Maddern et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P35">Metabolic differences have also been reported between sexes. For example, sex differences in the levels of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin, which increases when the stomach is empty in preparation for a meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Cummings et al., 2001</xref>) have been observed across species, with females exhibiting higher levels of acylated ghrelin in a fasted state than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Makovey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Beasley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Tai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Leone et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Borchers et al., 2022</xref>). Further, while ghrelin increases activity of midbrain neurons in both sexes, females show greater response to bath application of ghrelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Pearl et al., 2024</xref>), and greater ghrelin receptor (GHSR) expression has been observed in the female rodent brain, including the amygdala, hippocampus, lateral hypothalamus and Edinger-Westphal nucleus, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Pearl et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Borchers et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, the intensity of “hunger” may be perceived differently between the sexes and/or ghrelin may exert different actions within the brain driving changes in how approach-avoidance decisions are made. However, further studies are required to understand these interactions and how the brain integrates signals of threat and hunger to make appropriate decisions.</p><p id="P36">A limitation of our study lies in the lack of oestrus cycle tracking. However, the findings were relatively consistent across tasks that were performed 3-5 days apart in the same animals (L/D box, EPM, LOF). Given the oestrus cycle in female mice can vary in duration (~5-8 days) and be irregular between littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Ryherd et al., 2023</xref>), this suggests stage of the oestrus cycle is not likely a major contributor to enhanced approach behaviour in fasted female mice, although this cannot be ruled out and requires further examination. However, it should be noted that fluctuating hormone levels during adulthood are only one small aspect of biological sex differences. Organisational effects of both sex chromosome complement, epigenetic regulators, and sex hormone levels during development all contribute to fundamental sex differences that may underpin differences observed in behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Maddern et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kopsida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Williams and Meck, 1991</xref>). Studies in this area are critical to determine organisational vs. activation effects of hormones and their impact on behaviour generally.</p></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P37">In summary, here we identify sex differences in decision making behaviour in mice based on satiety state across a number of approach-avoidance tasks. We highlight several nuances of these differences based on reward availability and punishment intensity. In sated conditions male mice show greater approach behaviour compared to female mice, while when fasted, female mice have greater approach behaviours. Further in female mice, this is less sensitive to punishment, suggesting homeostatic need state drives greater foraging and reward driven behaviours in female mice. These results shine a lens on fundamental differences between the sexes in innate, survival driven behaviours that should be taken into account for future studies. Research exploring fundamental sex differences in approach-avoidance decision making, the impact across the life span, and the neurocircuitry that drive these behaviours should be investigated.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S24"><title>Funding</title><p id="P38">This project was supported by the Australian Research Council discovery grant (DP240101831) awarded to LCW and AJL.

summary</title></caption><p>Everyday decision making is often accompanied by conflict - whether we make the most appropriate decision or not can be influenced by both internal and external factors. Environmental threats and physiological pressures, such as hunger, can influence decision-making processes skewing the risk/reward ratio, yet how this may differ between the sexes has not been explored in detail. Here we used several tasks that assess decision-making in mice while manipulating the levels of risk or reward. Our findings show fasted female mice are more willing to engage in “risky” behaviour compared to fed female mice when risk levels were low, and no food reward was available. However, when a food reward was available, but risk levels were low, both male and female fasted mice were more likely to engage in risky behaviour compared to fed mice. Finally, when risk levels were high and food reward was available, fasted female mice continued to engage in risky behaviour, while male fasted mice were not. Together our study identifies nuanced sex differences in how male and female mice make decisions influenced by both physiological (hunger) and environmental threats and highlight the importance of understanding fundamental differences between the sexes in behaviour.</p></boxed-text><boxed-text id="BX2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Highlights</title></caption><p><list list-type="simple" id="L1"><list-item><label>-</label><p>Fasted female mice showed greater approach behaviours compared to fasted male counterparts in tasks without reward availability.</p></list-item><list-item><label>-</label><p>Fasted mice of both sexes displayed greater approach behaviours when a reward was available, compared to sated controls.</p></list-item><list-item><label>-</label><p>Fasted male mice inhibited reward consumption under increased shock intensity, whereas fasted female mice were resistant to mild foot shock.</p></list-item></list></p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Fasting alters approach-avoidance behaviour in light-dark box of female, but not male mice.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic of light-dark box. <bold>(B)</bold> Female fasted mice spent more time in the light zone compared to sated counterparts, while no difference was observed in males. <bold>(C)</bold> Differences were observed across the time course when comparing female fed vs. fasted mice. <bold>(D)</bold> No differences were observed between fed and fasted male mice.
