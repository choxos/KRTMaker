They are implicated in multiple neurological disorders including stroke, epilepsy and neurodegeneration and can regulate neuronal excitability through interactions with ion channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Polyamines have been linked to pain showing altered levels in human persistent pain states and modulation of pain behaviour in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. However, the systems governing polyamine transport within the nervous system remain unclear. In undertaking a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) of chronic pain intensity in the UK-Biobank we found significant association with variants mapping to the <italic>SLC45A4</italic> gene locus. In the mouse nervous system SLC45A4 expression is enriched in all sensory neuron sub-types within the dorsal root ganglion including nociceptors. Cell-based assays show that SLC45A4 is a selective plasma membrane polyamine transporter, whilst the cryo-EM structure reveals a novel regulatory domain and basis for polyamine recognition. Mice lacking SLC45A4 show normal mechanosensitivity but reduced sensitivity to noxious heat and algogen induced tonic pain that is associated with reduced excitability of peptidergic nociceptors. Our findings thus establish a role for neuronal polyamine transport in pain perception and identify a new target for therapeutic intervention in pain treatment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Chronic pain affects around one in five of the adult population and has a major negative impact on quality of life with profound socioeconomic consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Indeed, when all pain conditions are taken, into account chronic pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, current treatments are often inadequate due to poor efficacy and tolerability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The molecular causes of chronic pain are not fully defined although enhanced excitability of nociceptors (those sensory neurons which detect injurious stimuli) and the central nociceptive circuits to which they project are important determinants of sensitised pain states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">One group of endogenous metabolites that has been proposed to contribute to chronic pain are the polyamines which include putrescine (Put), spermine (Spm) and spermidine (Spd). These are ubiquitous polycationic alkylamines that have important roles in the synthesis, maintenance and stability of nucleic acids, cell signalling (including the stress response) and growth but can also modulate ion channel function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Serum and tissue polyamine levels are raised in pain states such as inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Injection of polyamines into the paw<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup> or spinal intrathecal space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> elicits pain behaviour (in rodents) and blocking their synthesis has been reported to reduce inflammatory pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. However, it is unclear from previous studies as to the direction of effect, locus of action or how best to therapeutically intervene. The regulation of ion channels by polyamines is critically dependent on their location (intracellular versus extracellular) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and so understanding their transport is essential in determining the impact on neuronal function. Furthermore, excess polyamines are toxic and therefore tight cellular homeostasis is required to preserve cellular function but how this is achieved in the body is still unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">To date only intracellular polyamine transport systems have been identified, which include the lysosomal polyamine transporter ATP13A2 (PARK9) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> which is linked to Parkinson’s Disease and the vesicular polyamine transporters ATP13A3 and SLC18B1 (VPAT) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> leaving the identity of the plasma membrane polyamine system unknown. Here we demonstrate that SLC45A4 encodes a plasma membrane polyamine transporter genetically linked to chronic pain in the human population, which presents an opportunity to understand the regulatory network linking polyamine biosynthesis and neuronal excitability.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Variants in SLC45A4 are associated with altered pain perception in humans</title><p id="P5">Pain has a significant heritable component that varies depending on the sub-type of pain studied but median heritability in twin studies is 36%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. To investigate the genetic factors we undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using data from the enhanced pain phenotyping questionnaires administered in the 2019 UK-Biobank (UKB) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, enabling accurate case definition of chronic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. As the outcome measure, we used reported pain intensity on a numerical rating scale for the most bothersome chronic pain (n= 132,552, European ancestry, pain distribution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). We identified a total of 29 genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with pain intensity, including two independent loci with lead SNPs (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended data Table 1</xref>, and top 100 GWAS results in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI table 1</xref>): rs3905668 (p = 1.22 x 10<sup>-8</sup>) which is intergenic and near the <italic>MSL2</italic> (MSL Complex Subunit 2) gene and rs10625280 (p = 3.37 x 10<sup>-8</sup>) which maps to the <italic>SLC45A4</italic> (Solute Carrier Family 45 Member 4) gene.</p><p id="P6">We focused on the <italic>SLC45A4</italic> locus (locus zoom plot <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>) given that it encodes a solute carrier (SLC) transporter, the function of which was unclear (although it had previously been proposed as a sucrose-proton transporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>). rs10625280 is situated within an intron of the <italic>SLC45A4</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1c</xref>), with a subset of SNPs demonstrating linkage disequilibrium (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.6), localising to the same genomic region. One of these is a missense variant in <italic>SLC45A4</italic> (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.98, rs3739238, p.Asn718Asp, p = 3.63 x 10<sup>-8</sup>) which was significantly associated with pain intensity. Moreover, both SNPs were identified as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for <italic>SLC45A4</italic> and <italic>DENND3</italic> (DENN Domain Containing 3) across several databases including Open Targets Genetics, EyeGEx, GTEx, and eQTLGen database. The locus-to-gene (L2G) analysis pipeline prioritised <italic>SLC45A4</italic> with an overall L2G score of 0.86 (rs3739238) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Having identified a genetic link between SLC45A4 and pain perception in the UKB- data, we then analysed data from the Million Veteran Program (MVP) in which a recent multi-ancestry genetic study of pain intensity in approximately 600,000 veterans identified 125 independent genetic loci, one of which was <italic>SLC45A4</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. The top SNP identified in MVP was rs59918340. The direction of association was dependent on ancestry. A review of the SNPs identified in our UKB GWAS of chronic pain intensity successfully replicated both the lead SNP rs10625280 (p = 1.21 x 10<sup>-8</sup>) and missense variant rs3739238 (p = 7.24 x 10<sup>-9</sup>) in the European ancestry GWAS of pain intensity in MVP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended data Table 1</xref>). The Finnish Genetics project (FinnGen) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> GWAS also confirmed the association of these two variants with pain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Extended data Table 1</xref>). The direction of effect was consistent across different databases and studies, underscoring the robustness of these genetic associations.</p><p id="P8">We employed a Phenome-Wide Association Analysis (PheWAS) to examine secondary phenotypes linked with genetic variants rs10625280, rs3739238, and the <italic>SLC45A4</italic> gene, utilising data from the UKB, FinnGen, and the GWAS Catalog. rs10625280 showed significant association with 25 different traits, including skeletal (osteoarthritis) and several immunological traits concerning blood cell parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI table 2</xref> shows traits with significant association following Bonferroni correction). rs3739238 showed significant association with 35 traits, spanning immunology, skeletal (osteoarthritis), metabolism, psychiatry, and reproduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI table 2</xref>). The <italic>SLC45A4</italic> gene demonstrated associations with 55 distinct traits across a variety of health domains such as skeletal, reproductive, psychiatric, immunological, cardiovascular, neurological, and metabolic functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI table 2</xref>). Additionally, the Open Targets Genetics’ locus-to-gene pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> identified a strong association between <italic>SLC45A4</italic> and multisite chronic pain (p = 2 x 10<sup>-8</sup>), highlighting its potential role in pain perception.</p><sec id="S2"><title>SLC45A4 is a polyamine transporter</title><p id="P9">We next sought to understand the function of SLC45A4 at the molecular level. Based on distant homology to the plant sucrose transporter (SUC) in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, SLC45A4 was proposed as a proton coupled sucrose transporter <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. However, the human SLC45A4 protein only shares ~ 26 % sequence identity to the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> SUC1 transporter, which coupled with recent studies reporting conflicting functions for this protein in metal ion transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, leaves the role of SLC45A4 in the cell an ongoing enigma. We therefore sought to identify possible substrates using a correlation analysis between metabolomics and expression datasets, which can predict substrates for SLC proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Our analysis highlighted that the expression of SLC45A4 across more than 1000 cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia correlated positively to the levels of g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1a</xref>). However, neither GABA nor sucrose elicited a change in the thermal stability of purified SLC45A4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data. Fig. 1b</xref>), prompting us to consider alternative metabolites. Although GABA is commonly synthesised from glutamate via glutamate decarboxylase enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, an alternative pathway is available via the degradation of the polyamine Put<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. We therefore tested a panel of substrates involved in GABA synthesis via the arginine/ornithine/putrescine (AOP) pathway. Surprisingly we observed a notable decrease in thermal stability in the presence of biogenic amines, with the polyamines Spm and Spd eliciting the largest response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). Cell-based radioactive uptake assays confirmed that SLC45A4 functions as a non-selective polyamine transporter with a pH optimum of between pH 7.5 – 8.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b, c</xref>) and no inhibition observed in the presence of L-lysine, L-ornithine or L-arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1c</xref>). Additionally, our data reveal that SLC45A4 is also selective in polyamine recognition. The longest polyamine, Spm, has an IC<sub>50</sub> of 240 mM, followed by Spd (123 mM), with the smaller polyamines Put and cadervine (Cad) having the highest affinity (74 mM and 67 mM respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Although it was long recognised that polyamines play a fundamental role in modulating neuronal excitability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, the identity of a specific neuronal biogenic amine transporter has remained mysterious. Our results clearly identify SLC45A4 as a plasma membrane polyamine transporter.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Cryo-EM structure of SLC45A4</title><p id="P10">To understand the structural basis for polyamine transport we proceeded to determine the structure of human SLC45A4 using cryo-EM. We determined the structure in both detergent and nanodisc to 2.80 and 3.25 Å respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">SI Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">3</xref>). The structures are similar with a root mean square deviation of 0.32 Å over 425 C<sub>α</sub> atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). SLC45A4 consists of 12 trans-membrane spanning alpha helices which adopt the canonical Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) fold consisting of two six helical bundles in an inward open state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2f, g</xref>). A unique feature of SLC45A4 is the presence of a large 25.5 kDa cytoplasmic domain inserted between TM6 and TM7. Although the majority of this domain is disordered in the volume, we observe clear density between Arg414 and Gln462, which extends into the canonical MFS binding site formed between the two six-helical bundles and plugs the transporter in an autoinhibited state by packing against the intracellular gating helices TMs 4 and 5 and TMs 10 and 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figs. 3e</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">4a</xref>). The plug domain (414-462) forms an extended coil that places two conserved basic side chains, Lys450 and Arg453, into a solvated central cavity within the transporter domain that is noticeable for the extreme negatively charged surface, which facilitates the anchoring of the plug domain into the cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). Lysine 450 interacts with Asp173, which together with Asp169 and Glu176 form an acidic ladder on TM4 and, through a cation-pi interaction with Tyr672 (TM11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). Arginine 453 interacts with Tyr66 (TM1) and makes a cation-pi interaction with Trp519 (TM7), which together with Tyr66 and Tyr672 is one of several conserved aromatic side chains within the binding site. Arg453 also interacts with a water molecule network linking the side chain to Asp169. Additional interactions between the plug domain and the transporter are also observed. Most notably, Ser452 hydrogen bonds with Glu176, while Tyr459 interacts with Arg180 (TM4), which serve to further stabilise the plug domain against the intracellular gating helices in the transporter. Finally, we noticed that in the nanodisc structure the membrane thins ~ 9 Å where the plug domain enters the transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>). Previous structures of the lysosomal polyamine transporter, ATP13A2, proposed a mechanism of membrane destabilisation to facilitate polyamine exit into the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. Our structure suggests a similar mechanism for polyamine release may operate within SLC45A4.</p><p id="P11">Efforts to capture a substrate bound state using both detergent and nanodisc samples however proved unsuccessful. However, like polyamines, both lysine and arginine contain primary and secondary amine groups. The positioning of these side chains within the canonical MFS binding site implies the plug domain functions as a pseudo substrate to auto inhibit the transporter. Interestingly, the distance between the amines in Lys450 and Arg453 side chains is ~ 5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2h</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>), which is close to the length of the higher affinity substrates Put and Cad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>), suggesting that polyamines may interact similarly with the binding site. We therefore used the interactions made by Lys450 and Arg453 to guide our mutational analysis. The acidic ladder on TM4 is both strictly conserved within the SLC45A4 family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Extended Data Fig. 1d</xref>) and essential for polyamine uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2i</xref>), with alanine variants showing no detectable transport in our cell-based assay. Also essential is Glu63 (TM1), which is another conserved acidic side chain that sits close to Glu176. In the nanodisc structure Arg453 adopts a different rotamer and interacts with Glu63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>), suggesting this side chain also interacts with polyamine substrates along with the side chains in the acidic ladder. However, whilst Tyr66Ala and Tyr672Ala mutants showed reduced activity, conservative mutations to phenylalanine showed wild-type (WT) levels of transport, suggesting bulky hydrophobic side chains at these positions facilitate transport. However, Trp519 was less important as mutating it to either alanine or phenylalanine only reduced function to around ~ 50 % compared to WT levels.

Finally, we examined the nocifensive behaviours (paw lifting, licking and shaking) in response to intra-plantar administration of the algogen formalin, as a model of tonic pain. This behaviour occurs in two phases. The first phase is thought to primarily relate to direct activation of nociceptors through the ligand gated ion channel TRPA1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> and the second phase occurs due to spread of this activation and also spinal sensitisation. <italic>SLC45A4</italic> KO mice showed a significant reduction in their nocifensive behaviours during the first phase of the formalin response, compared to WT and HET mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3 l &amp; m</xref>). As our expression studies and behavioural data both pointed towards a role of SLC45A4 in sensory neurons, we undertook anatomical and electrophysiological assessment of DRG physiology. There was no loss or change in sensory neuron subpopulation distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 a &amp; b</xref>) and normal cutaneous nerve fibre density in <italic>SLC45A4</italic> KO mice compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 c &amp; d</xref>), suggesting no major developmental phenotype in regard to sensory neuron survival or axon-outgrowth. On undertaking patch-clamp analysis of dissociated sensory neurons, we focused on two major nociceptor populations, non-peptidergic nociceptors (IB4-binding) and peptidergic nociceptors (defined in culture as small DRG neurons that do not bind the lectin IB4). We observed normal passive membrane properties (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Extended data table 2</xref>) and comparable action potential thresholds (rheobase, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 e &amp; f</xref>) in <italic>SLC45A4</italic> KO neurons compared to WT. Interestingly, while non-peptidergic nociceptors were normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig.4 g &amp; h</xref>), we found a selective reduction in the supra-threshold excitability of peptidergic nociceptors from <italic>SLC45A4</italic> KO mice, in response to static (step) and dynamic (ramp) current injections, compared to neurons from WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4 i &amp; j</xref>).</p><p id="P16">In summary, our results provide compelling evidence that <italic>SLC45A4</italic> is a neuronal membrane polyamine transporter that shows genetic association with human pain. It is expressed in sensory neurons and ablation of this function results in altered thermal coding and pain perception in mice. These behavioural changes are accompanied by a marked reduction in the excitability of peptidergic nociceptors which are known to encode thermal pain and the response to many algogens. Polyamines are known to functionally modulate a number of ion channels that may be candidates for impacting on excitability of nociceptors including: the Transient Receptor Potential family (TRPV1, 3,4) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, inward rectifier K<sup>+<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> and acid-sensitive ion channels (ASICs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.

Scale bars 100 µm. <bold>c</bold>, Example images of intra-epidermal nerve fibre density (IENFD) in WT and KO mice, scale bars 20 µm. <bold>d</bold>, Quantification of IENFD highlights no loss of nociceptive nerve terminals in glabrous skin of KO mice, compared to WT (WT n = 3 mice, 303 fibres, 9 sections, KO n = 3 mice, 312 fibres, 9 sections, unpaired t-test, P &gt; 0.05). <bold>e</bold>, Example images of an IB4-positive and IB4-negative small sensory neuron, distinguished by the presence or absence of IB4-488 live binding, scale 10 µm. Bottom: example traces of action potentials elicited by a threshold current injection, from IB4-postive and IB4-negative neurons from WT and KO mice. <bold>f</bold>, Threshold excitability (rheobase – minimum current required to elicit and action potential) is similar between WT and KO small sensory neurons that are IB4-postive or IB4-negative (IB4-pos: WT n = 9 cells, KO n = 10 cells, IB4-neg: WT n = 11 cells, KO n = 13 cells, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test, P &gt; 0.05). <bold>g</bold>, IB4-postive nociceptors from KO mice show normal repetitive firing patterns to step-current injections, compared to WT. (RM two-way ANOVA, post hoc Holm-Sidak’s test, P &gt; 0.05). <bold>h</bold>, IB4-postive nociceptors from WT and KO mice are comparable when challenged with ramp-current injections (WT n = 7 cells, KO n = 10 cells, RM two-way ANOVA, post hoc Holm-Sidak’s test, P &gt; 0.05). <bold>i</bold>, IB4-negative nociceptors (peptidergic nociceptors) from KO mice are hypo-excitable to suprathreshold step-current injections, compared to WT neurons (RM two-way ANOVA, post hoc Holm-Sidak’s test, 100 pA * P = 0.039, 150 pA ** P = 0.0027, 200 pA *** P = 0.0002, 250 pA *** P = 0.0006, 300 pA * P = 0.047). <bold>j</bold>, Peptidergic nociceptors from KO mice are hypo-excitable to ramp-current injections, compared to WT neurons (RM two-way ANOVA, post hoc Holm-Sidak’s test, 300-1000ms * P = 0.036, 0.021, 0.011, 0.013, 0.021, 0.015, 0.021, 0.036, respectively).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS199162-f004"/></fig></floats-group></article>
