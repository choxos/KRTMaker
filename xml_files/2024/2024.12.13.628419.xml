Understanding these interactions is vital as most early pregnancy loss occurs during this time. A major challenge in understanding uterine function and early pregnancy is lack of appropriate <italic>in-vitro</italic> models. Two-dimensional models are available, but do not recapitulate the endometrium’s complex multicellular structure. Here, we describe a hormonally responsive organoid model of the bovine endometrium, developed as a tool for studying endometrial function and early pregnancy. Bovine glandular epithelial cells were isolated from reproductive tracts and cultured in an extracellular matrix hydrogel (Cultrex 2) at 38.5°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (n=3). RNA was extracted and qPCR confirmed the presence of gland markers: <italic>leukemia inhibitory factor, mucin-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, kruppel-like factor-5</italic> and <italic>forkhead box protein-A2</italic>. Organoids were imaged at specific time-points to monitor growth and passaged 3 times in 1:2 or 1:3 ratios after growing for a minimum of 10 days per passage. Morphologically, organoids were spherical and fast-growing at passages 0 and 1, but this declines following passage 2. Bovine endometrial organoids (n=3, passage 0) were treated with 1000 ng/ml recombinant ovine Interferon Tau (IFNT) or 10 μg/ml progesterone (P4) for 24 hours and analysed by RNASeq to assess hormone responsiveness. Differential expression analysis by DeSeq2 negative binomial distribution model followed by Wald test and Benjamini-Hochberg correction identified 373 transcripts significantly upregulated (padj&lt;0.05 or log<sub>2</sub>fold change &gt;0.05) in response to P4 treatment, with downstream analysis showing significant overrepresentation (FDR&lt;0.05) of genes associated with positive regulation of protein localisation to plasma membrane and cell periphery. Of the 240 genes significantly downregulated by P4 these were significantly overrepresented (FDR&lt;0.05) in biological processes of cilium and cytoskeleton organisation. IFNT treatment resulted in significant upregulation of 414 genes and downregulation of 119 genes. The largest cluster associated with differentially expressed genes in response to IFNT is defence to virus and interferon signalling. There were 30 genes altered by both P4 treatment and IFNT treatment. Organoids were also shown to express conserved microRNAs, and it was possible to culture them in a microfluidics device - making them a useful model for a multitude of potential investigations. This model provides a tool to investigate bovine endometrial function and peri-implantation communication, subsequently allowing species comparison to understand diversity in reproductive strategies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Understanding endometrial function, particularly in domestic species, has been limited by the lack of in vitro models that mimic the in vivo scenario, as well as the cost of in vivo approaches. Whilst in vivo approaches have been used to understand uterine luminal fluid (ULF) composition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, actions of critical pregnancy cues like progesterone (P4) and Interferon Tau (IFNT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, as well as the biosensor capability of the endometrium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, it has been difficult to study endometrial function in a high throughout manner. An endometrium that functions correctly is critical to pregnancy success in all mammals, given it is the site of implantation, and it provides nutrient support via ULF to the developing conceptus (embryo and extra-embryonic membranes) prior to development of the placenta. Moreover, dysfunction of the endometrium leads to pregnancy loss. In cattle, embryonic loss most commonly occurs in the first 3 weeks of pregnancy and is detrimental both financially - to the meat and dairy industries; as well as having a negative effect on sustainability and the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. For these reasons, unravelling how the complex roles of the endometrium in embryo development and conceptus-maternal interactions interplay for successful early pregnancy is imperative.</p><p id="P3">For successful pregnancy in cattle, an adequately developed, elongated conceptus must meet an optimally primed endometrium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. The bovine endometrium is a complex tissue whose transcriptional and translational profile changes throughout the cycle and pregnancy. It comprises a stromal cell layer, with an overlying epithelial cell layer containing uterine glands (both superficial and deep glandular in nature with different phenotypes) which extend into the underlying stromal layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. Factors secreted from the luminal and glandular epithelium are integral for conceptus elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup> highlighting the necessity to understand the components of these secretions.</p><p id="P4">Until recently, 2D in vitro cultures were the most used approach to study conceptus-maternal interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy. Many 2D cell culture models utilise cell lines, which can introduce drawbacks. One of the main concerns with using cell lines is that genetic drift or contamination may occur following repeated passaging, potentially altering the physiological behaviour of the cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The “normal” functioning of the cell may also be affected due to the fact that cells are often immortalized; or cancer derived cells which behave differently to a non-cancerous cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Although primary cells can be used to mitigate some of these issues, 2D single cell type monolayers do not accurately recapitulate tissues and organs, introducing the need for more complex in vitro systems. Despite their limitations, these methods are robust and convenient; and if taken tentatively with knowledge of their limitations, provide effective data. For example, treatment with molecules important for early pregnancy can reveal cell type specific functional effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. However, it is undeniable that single cell type, static, in vitro cultures do not represent the complex multicellular endometrium in vivo. A study investigated the impact of using 2D vs 3D culture for bovine uterine gland fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The mRNA expression of secretory proteins thought to be involved in conceptus development was significantly lower in 2D culture compared to 3D. Cell morphology in the 3D culture was also more physiologically accurate, with cells exhibiting cubic shapes and displaying apical and basolateral localisation of Zona Occluden 1 (ZO-1) and Beta catenin; whereas 2D culture cells were flat with non-specific localisation. This demonstrates the need to develop 3D endometrial culture approaches that more closely mimic the in vivo situation.</p><p id="P5">One such approach is the use of in vitro organoids which are self-organising, 3D structures, derived from primary tissue to represent the more complex organ that can be cultured in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Previously used to model various tissues involving epithelial cells including colon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, prostate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> and fallopian tube<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>; a breakthrough paper developed human endometrial organoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> using both endometrial gland tissue and decidual cells. These endometrial organoids are responsive to key cycle-related hormones P4 and estrogen (E2), can withstand long-term culture and passaging, making them an excellent candidate tool to investigate endometrial function. Collection of these cells requires an invasive endometrial biopsy procedure, however more recently, menstrual flow derived organoids have been produced which respond appropriately to hormonal cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. This advancement improves accessibility and availability in menstruating species. Development of oviductal organoids from other species has also been achieved in cow, pig, dog, and horse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Applying this technology to the endometrium to develop bovine endometrial organoids would provide an additional tool for understanding complex conceptus-maternal interactions in the peri-implantation period of pregnancy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and characterise a method to generate bovine endometrial organoids that respond to key cues important for pregnancy success to facilitate higher throughput studies of endometrial function in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="P6">Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were sourced from Sigma (UK).

Tracts were washed with 70% ethanol, transferred to a hood and further washed with 70% ethanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). The ipsilateral horn was identified, and the horn was cut above the uterine body. A cut was made down the horn toward the oviduct to expose the uterine endometrium. The endometrium was washed with 25 ml of endometrial wash buffer (Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) and 1% ABAM) dissected from the underlying myometrium and placed in 25 mL of endometrial strip wash (HBSS with no calcium and magnesium and 1% antibiotic, antimycotic (ABAM)). The strip wash was removed and replaced with 25 ml HBSS to wash, before fragments were transferred to a petri dish for further dissection with a scalpel into approximately 1 mm fragments and returned to HBSS before digestion. Three different compositions of digestion solution were used to optimise yield of glandular epithelial cells, differing in concentration of dispase and DNase I. Each digestion composition contained 0.5 mg/ml collagenase II, along with: 1) 100 mg/ml DNase I; 2) 100 mg/ml DNase I and 1 mg/ml dispase; or 3) 1 mg/ml DNase I and 1 mg/ml dispase.</p><p id="P8">Each digestion composition was separately subjected to a 30 min and 1 hr incubation at 38.5°C whilst being agitated to optimise length of digestion. After incubation, solutions were filtered through two filters, firstly 100 μM and then 40 μM. Different fractions of the digestion were collected in order to select the one that was most glandular cell enriched. The first fraction was collected by inverting the 40 μM filter and rinsing with 5 ml stop solution (50 ml HBSS and 5 ml Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS)), followed by a 5 min centrifugation at 500 g. Supernatant was aspirated and pellet snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent analysis. The 100 μM filter was also inverted and rinsed with 5 ml stop solution; this fraction containing tissue chunks was centrifuged for 5 min at 300 g. The supernatant was transferred to another tube, centrifuged for 5 min at 500 g, supernatant aspirated and pellet snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.

The 100 μM filter was discarded, whilst the 40 μM filter was inverted and rinsed with 5 ml of stop solution into a falcon tube. This was centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min, the supernatant discarded, and the remaining pellet resuspended in 1 ml of Advanced DMEM/F12 medium. This was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and another 5 min centrifugation step (500 x g) was performed. The size of the pellet was estimated and resuspended in a volume of Advanced DMEM/F12 medium relative to pellet size - for a ‘just visible’ pellet approximately 250 μl was used and for a larger, readily visible pellet up to approximately 500 μl was used.</p><p id="P11">Glandular organoids were then cultured using the same method as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Keeping the Cultrex (Cultrex Reduced Growth Factor Basement Membrane Extract, Type 2, R&amp;D Systems) on ice, 12 μl of resuspended cells was taken for each well and added to 48 μl of Cultrex. After gentle pipetting up and down to mix, a 60 μl drop was placed in the centre of a well of a 24 well plate. The 24 well plate was placed in the incubator for 30 min to set and afterwards each drop was covered with 500 μl of expansion media. The expansion media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> is composed of Advanced DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies), N2 supplement (Life Technologies), B27 supplement minus vitamin A (Life Technologies), Primocin 100 μg/ml (Invitrogen), N-Acetyl-L-cysteine 1.25 mM (Sigma), L-glutamine 2 mM (Life Technologies), recombinant human EGF (Peprotech) 50 ng/ml, recombinant human Noggin 100 ng/ml (Peprotech), recombinant human R-Spondin-1 400 ng/ml (Peprotech), recombinant human FGF-10 (Peprotech) 100 ng/ml, recombinant human HGF (Peprotech) 50ng/ml, nicotinamide 10nM (Sigma), and ALK-4, -5, -7 inhibitor (System Biosciences).

The medium was replaced every 2-3 days.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Passaging of organoids</title><p id="P12">We also sought to determine for how long these organoids could be passaged. To test this, passages were carried out approximately every 10 days (or more at later passages where organoids were slower to expand), once the majority of organoids in the droplet had reached approximately &gt;300 μm. If organoids were allowed to continue beyond this size they would begin to collapse and become dark in the centre. For passaging each well of the culture dish contained 500 μl of expansion media and one droplet consisting of the organoids in cultrex. These droplets were broken up in the well without removing culture media by manual pipetting 4-5 times. Two well’s worth of organoids i.e. 2 technical replicates were transferred to a single Eppendorf and centrifuged at 2400 x g for 6 min. The supernatant was removed and 150 μl advanced DMEM/F12 added, followed by manual pipetting 300 times to break up the organoids and residual Cultrex. One ml of advanced DMEM/F12 was added and tube centrifuged at 600 x g for 6 min before aspiration of supernatant. Another 150 μl advanced DMEM/F12 was added and subjected to manual pipetting a further 100 times before adding an additional 1 ml advanced DMEM/F12 and centrifuging at 1200 x g for 6 min. Following this centrifugation step, the majority of the supernatant was aspirated. The remaining media and organoid mixture was resuspended in multiples of 48 μl of ice-cold Cultrex depending on the number of wells to be seeded in a given passage. Organoids were usually split in a 1:3 ratio.

Liquid PDMS (10:1) was casted and cured on SU8 2100 moulds (Microchem, MA, USA). SU8 2100 photoresist was spun on a silicon wafer at 2000 rpm for 30 sec to obtain a 150 μm thick layer. Wafer covered with SU8 was exposed to UV light (wavelength= 375nm, energy=250mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) through a film photomask designed using computer-aided design (CAD) software (AutoCAD). Once cured, the PDMS layer was peeled off from the SU8 mould and inlet and outlet ports were opened using a 1.5mm round puncher (Integra Mylex, NJ, USA). The device was then assembled by treating a glass slide (2.54 x 5.08 cm) and the PDMS layer by Oxygen Plasma (600mTorr, 100W, 30s). 500 μL Pyrex cloning cylinders (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA, US), used as reservoirs for cell media, were bonded to the port regions using liquid PDMS. Prior to use, devices were sterilized by UV exposure (wavelength= 254nm for 25 min). Briefly, the device consisted of a rhomboidal shaped chamber (area: 48.85 mm<sup>2</sup>) with 60° angled inlet and outlet microchannels. The design includes round PDMS pillars (diameter 100 μm) to provide structural support for the culturing chamber. For the culture of the organoids, the chamber was filled with Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PvP), subsequently the organoids were loaded into the device and then left for 3 days in the incubator to set. After this time, they were treated with IFNT as previously described.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S16"><title>Optimisation of Cell Isolation Process</title><p id="P23">In order to select the optimal protocol for isolation of bovine endometrial epithelial gland cells, two time points (30 min and 1 hr) and three digestion compositions were used, as well as collection of different fractions of digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) to be analysed.

There was consistently lower gland marker expression for all genes in cells obtained from digestion composition 3, as well as absence of each gland marker from at least 1 sample. Cells isolated using digestion 1 and 2 displayed similar, and higher (compared to digestion 3) gland marker expression values for each gene, which resulted in selection of Digestion 1 due to fewer components and it being consistent with the ability to isolate stromal cells from the same individual. Cells isolated from the 70 μM strainer show reduced gland marker expression for all animals at both 30 min and 1 hr timepoints compared to cells isolated from the 40 μM strainer. For this reason, cells collected from inverting the 40 μM strainer were selected for use. All gland markers exhibit higher expression following 1 hr incubation compared to 30 min. Overall, conditions selected were: 1 hr incubation with Digestion mix 1, using cells taken from the 40 μM cell strainer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Response to passaging over time</title><p id="P24">Bovine endometrial organoids (n=3) were cultured with imaging at regular time points to evaluate growth and passaging outcomes.

Glandular endometrial organoids are a great model for studying endometrial function and early pregnancy events such as implantation, as uterine gland secretions are thought to be vital for implantation and fertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. We also demonstrate that these organoids express gland marker genes, conserved microRNAs, and can be cultured in microfluidic devices - vastly increasing the future research opportunities for this model. Moreover, these respond to P4 and IFNT and demonstrate a deep glandular phenotype. Collectively these data show a novel way to study specific aspects of endometrial function in cattle.</p><p id="P33">The full extent of the essential interactions between conceptus and uterus required to support establishment of a successful pregnancy have yet to be fully elucidated. Organoids have been successful in different human systems including endometrium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> and adding this form of complexity to the bovine endometrial system could help tailor a more physiological approach to investigate interactions <italic>in vitro</italic>. In our model, variation can be observed in growth rate and organoid size over time between animals. To some degree this highlights animal to animal variation which is to be expected, and has been previously shown in other in vitro bovine models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. However, this could also be attributed to plating density, as cell pellet volume was estimated when resuspending to plate the cells. Furthermore, for the purpose of this experiment, each animal’s organoids were passaged on the same day irrespective of the organoid size, which may not have been at an optimal stage for some animals. It is possible that for some animals, the organoids never reached the appropriate size or cell density and so remained consistently smaller throughout the time course. A drawback of this model is the limited longevity of the organoids, with growth halting at passage 3. This result suggests that these organoids should be used for experiments during earlier passages for optimal results. However, potential changes to the modify expansion media for species specificity may help with further passaging given this media was optimised for human endometrial organoid culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Future work to improve this model would be to analyse and optimise media composition which may improve growth and allow the organoids to persist in culture further than passage 3.</p><p id="P34">Candidate gland marker expression profile was quantified in the organoids to show presence or absence of gland markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2O</xref>). At many stages of growth, the expression appears very similar between animals despite there being no normalization of the data.</p><p id="P35">Large differences between gland marker expression at early stages could be due to variation in organoid growth rate and differences in plating densities.</p><sec id="S24"><title>Response to cues</title><p id="P36">We have shown that these organoids respond to some key cues important for early pregnancy. The organoids are P4 responsive, with many genes that are differentially expressed following exposure linked to and enriched in important biological processes during early pregnancy events. The gene exhibiting highest upregulation following P4 treatment is <italic>GREB1</italic> (growth regulating estrogen receptor binding 1). Fascinatingly, this gene in humans is characterised as a P4 regulated gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>; however, it is found to be necessary for stromal cell decidualization, which does not occur in non-invasive implantation as in bovine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. In other systems, <italic>GREB1</italic> is linked to oestrogen upregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> and hormone induced growth of breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> and prostate cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is possible that P4 upregulation of <italic>GREB1</italic> in bovine organoids is important for growth and proliferation of the endometrium. Janus kinase 3 (<italic>JAK3</italic>) is another upregulated gene following P4 treatment, which modulates immune response; and an increased immune response has been observed when <italic>JAK3</italic> is inhibited in the intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Correct control of the immune response during early pregnancy to allow tolerance of the developing, genetically different offspring is vital. Considering that P4 is elevated during implantation and pregnancy, in turn upregulating expression of <italic>JAK3</italic>, this may be a mechanism to reduce immune response against the conceptus.</p><p id="P37">From our data we demonstrate bovine endometrial organoids also respond to the pregnancy recognition signal IFNT, with those transcripts that are differentially expressed implicated in processes important for early pregnancy. Defence to virus is the pathway containing the largest number of differentially expressed genes demonstrating that bovine organoids have a classical ISG response to IFNT. Genes that have classical ISG response in the organoids include upregulation of <italic>MX1, MX2</italic> and <italic>ISG15</italic>. Ion transport is another biological process enriched in genes altered by IFNT treatment. As the ULF is known to contain ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>, and the organoids display deep glandular phenotype, this may indicate that conceptus produced IFNT acts upon the deep gland cells to alter composition of the ULF in order to support conceptus development and implantation. STRING interaction networks also highlight retinol metabolism, with differentially expressed genes involved in this process significantly upregulated with high fold changes. Retinol metabolism is important for correct development of the conceptus during early development, and it is likely that this process is involved in interactions between the endometrium and conceptus.</p><p id="P38">When comparing response of the glandular endometrial organoids to IFNT and P4, 30 transcripts are changed by both treatments. Enrichment maps and STRING networks are interesting as they demonstrate the interaction between the genes altered by each or both treatments, as both of these molecules are present during the peri-implantation period. According to transcriptional response by the organoids, it is clear these molecules have specific and different roles when interacting with these deep glandular phenotype cells of the endometrium, with only a small number changing the same pathways and networks. For example, collagen formation and extracellular matrix is highlighted as a network in which genes from both treatments interact. Extracellular matrix remodelling is a vital process during early stages of pregnancy to support implantation and subsequent placentation, with dynamic changes in extracellular matrix protein abundance throughout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. It appears P4 and IFNT contribute to this by acting upon the deep glandular epithelial cells of the endometrium. In addition, the differences in response of these organoids to P4 and IFNT likely reflect the fact this is a deep gland phenotype of the organoids i.e. they retain expression of progesterone receptor and have a classical ISG response compared to e.g. the luminal epithelial cells during pregnancy recognition.</p><p id="P39">Our microfluidic experiment shows that it is possible to culture bovine endometrial organoids within microfluidic chambers which will allow experiments utilising this model to be carried out under controlled dynamic fluid exchange and tuned shear stress. The allows us to test hypotheses in an environment that better mimics the in vivo scenario. In addition, organoids have also been treated with IFNT within these devices, and the results indicate that this upregulated expression of genes that are increased in deep uterine glands during the pregnancy recognition process in ruminants i.e. it mimics the in vivo response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. This increase in expression was found for both static culture and culture within microfluidic devices. This is important as the endometrium responds to the pregnancy recognition signal. In vivo, both classical and non-classical ISGs are stimulated in the different cells of the endometrium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. We show that these organoids express classical ISGs following IFNT stimulation but not non-classical ISGs. This could be due to duration of exposure as previous in vitro approaches have shown that 24 hr exposure is sufficient to induce classical <italic>ISGs</italic> but non-classical requiring more sustained exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Another major benefit of this protocol is for the possibility to isolate luminal epithelium and stromal cells as well as organoids from the same animal. This will facilitate future complex building of <italic>in vitro</italic> models incorporating all three cell types.</p><p id="P40">Interestingly, many of the miRNAs identified to be conserved across placental mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> are expressed in these bovine endometrial organoids. Whilst none of the miRNAs exhibited differential expression in response to IFNT or P4, these data would be more conclusive with a larger sample size due to the variation between individuals which is already a known issue. In response to P4 treatment, the vehicle has a large effect on expression of many of the miRNAs. This being 100% ethanol, a different vehicle such as water or DMSO would be beneficial to examine differential expression in response to P4 without the influence of the vehicle.</p><p id="P41">Future approaches will involve isolation of secretome from the organoids, culture under flow conditions to examine transcriptional response in a more physiologically accurate model, knockout of specific genes via CRISPR/CAS9, as well as optimisation of culture components to be species-specific. Furthermore, incorporation of stromal cells to produce endometrial assembloids which has already been achieved in humans (Rawlings Makwana Taylor et al 2021) would assist in creating an <italic>in vitro</italic> multicellular model of the bovine endometrium for investigating early pregnancy events.</p><p id="P42">In conclusion, we have characterised a bovine endometrial organoid culture method that results in expression of markers of endometrial glands and has important organoid features. Moreover, we show it responds to the two key molecules responsible for changing the transcriptomic landscape of the bovine endometrium during early pregnancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.
