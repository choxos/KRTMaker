However, little is known about the molecular basis of this adaptation. Here, we characterize the evolution of a protein interaction network within the PIWI-interacting small RNA (piRNA) genome defence pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> at unprecedented scale and evolutionary resolution. We uncover pervasive rapid evolution of a protein interaction network anchored at the Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) paralog Rhino. Using complementary phylogenetic analysis, high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid matrix screening, and <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction analyses in cross-species transgenic flies, we characterized three distinct evolutionary protein interaction trajectories across ~40 million years of <italic>Drosophila</italic> evolution. The data set covering 11 piRNA pathway proteins of five <italic>Drosophila</italic> species revealed several protein interactions that are fully conserved, indicating functional conservation despite overall rapid amino acid sequence change. Other interactions are preserved through co-evolution and were detected only between proteins within or from closely related species. We also identified sets of species-restricted protein interactions which, through rewiring of a Rhino-anchored transcription factor network, may preserve critical roles in enabling and adapting piRNA production from heterochromatic loci. In sum, our analyses dissected principles of interaction evolution in an adaptively evolving protein-protein interaction network uncovering evolutionary and functional insight into germline piRNA production across <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. Our work provides key experimental evidence in support of a model proposing that intermolecular interaction innovation is a major molecular mechanism of evolutionary adaptation in protein-coding genes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The patterns of adaptive evolution, also referred to as positive selection, across protein-coding genes make strong predictions about the molecular processes driving such innovation. Specifically, amino acids located at the surface of folded protein domains – and thus available to make intermolecular interactions – evolve faster than buried residues not exposed to the surrounding solvent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Consistently, amino acids in protein termini and intrinsically disordered regions, which are often solvent exposed, evolve faster than central and ordered regions, respectively, and are often targeted by adaptive evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, large-scale comparison of protein architecture, functional annotation, and sequence evolution suggest that adaptive protein evolution is mainly driven by intermolecular interactions, such as protein-protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. A few studies have examined the evolution of proteinprotein interactions between yeast species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup> or across vast evolutionary time between yeast and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, we lack studies with the stepwise granularity in evolutionary time needed to connect to the molecular innovation step in the studied proteins. Specifically, investigations comparing only two species captures only one possible evolutionary trajectory. Other evolutionary outcomes are left undiscovered, limiting our grasp of the diverse mechanisms of sustaining an essential pathway under evolutionary pressure to change. Large-scale examination of protein-protein interactions in adaptively evolving protein interaction networks therefore remains outstanding.</p><p id="P3">The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway is a major transposable element (TE) silencing mechanism in gonads of most animals. Here, PIWI-clade Argonaute proteins guided by their bound piRNAs induce transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing of target transposable elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. While the piRNA pathway is present in most animals, the piRNA source loci, biogenesis mechanisms, and regulatory targets differ between model organisms and developmental stages. Furthermore, functional diversification of the piRNA pathway has taken place in the recent evolutionary history of multiple animal species, including several <italic>Drosophila</italic> species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and teleost fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> key genes of the piRNA pathway evolve rapidly under positive selection, including genes involved in piRNA precursor synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and in piRNA-mediated silencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, factors assumed to be essential for piRNA-mediated silencing based on studies using <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have been found to be dispensable for transposon silencing in closely related species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Given the experimental tractability of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> model organism, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> piRNA pathway represents a tractable model system to investigate the molecular mechanistic diversification resulting from rapid evolution within animal protein interaction networks.</p><p id="P4">Amongst the fastest evolving piRNA pathway genes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are several involved in germline piRNA precursor biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Most germline piRNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are produced from heterochromatic loci and therefore require a dedicated transcription and export machinery for their expression. At the base of this mechanism is the HP1 homolog protein, Rhino (<italic>rhi</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, which is recruited to piRNA source loci through binding to heterochromatic Histone 3 trimethyl-modifications at Lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and Lysine 27 (H3K27me3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> as well as the sequence-specific zinc finger protein, Kipferl (<italic>Kipf</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Via the adaptor protein Deadlock (Del), Rhino in turn recruits a network of effector proteins that enable the production of piRNA precursors from the heterochromatic piRNA source loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, an alternative basal transcription factor complex consisting of the Transcription-factor-IIA (TFIIA) homolog, Moonshiner (Moon), TFIIA-S and TATA box binding protein-related factor 2 (Trf2) is recruited to initiate heterochromatin-dependent piRNA precursor transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, while canonical activation of transposon promoters is thought to be suppressed by the C-terminal Binding Protein (CtBP) transcriptional repressor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Following, co-transcriptional splicing as well as cleavage and polyadenylation is suppressed via recruitment of the DXO-like protein Cutoff (Cuff)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Finally, piRNA precursor export is mediated by an alternative RNA export complex containing Nuclear export factor 3 (Nxf3), NTF2- related export protein 1 (Nxt1) and Bootlegger (Boot), which further connect to the general mRNA export complex THO via the UAP56 protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. While these factors are all essential for transposon control and female fertility in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, several observations suggest that proteins enabling germline piRNA precursor production undergo rapid adaptation. For example, ovaries of the progeny of hybrid crosses between the closely related species <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> show elevated TE activity and reduced piRNA precursor production from dual-strand clusters, indicating that the sequence divergence in piRNA precursor biogenesis genes has resulted in functional divergence between the two species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Furthermore, two studies found that the <italic>D. simulans</italic> orthologs of Rhino, Deadlock and Cutoff proteins are not able to rescue the respective ortholog mutants in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, likely due to divergence in the protein-protein interaction surfaces connecting Rhino, Deadlock and Cutoff<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that recurrent molecular innovation, likely at the level of protein-protein interactions, is required to maintain efficient germline transposon silencing in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, how adaptive evolution has diversified the proteins but preserved the functional output of piRNA biogenesis remains unknown.</p><p id="P5">Here, we comprehensively examine the evolution of protein-protein interactions within the piRNA precursor biogenesis pathway in five <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, representing spans of 2 to 40 million years of evolution. To do so, we performed high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) matrix interaction screening with 11 proteins within and between species, complemented by molecular evolution analysis, <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell culture assays, and <italic>in vivo</italic> cross-species co-immunoprecipitations (coIPs) from ovaries. We find that the overall interaction network structure of piRNA precursor biogenesis proteins, despite pervasive signatures of rapid, adaptive evolution, is conserved across the investigated species. However, our data also reveals a highly heterogenous mix of individual protein interactions between piRNA precursor biogenesis factors, including conserved interactions (e.g. DelCuff), protein-protein co-evolution (e.g. Del-Boot), as well as species-restricted innovation in the protein interaction network by “rewiring” that alters how transcription factors acting at germline piRNA source loci are recruited. Thus, by simply asking the central question of protein-protein interaction compatibility amongst different species, this study shows how rapid evolution has shaped a protein network under positive selection and reveals substantial mechanistic diversity in piRNA precursor production between even closely related species. We speculate that such biochemical innovation reshapes the expressed piRNA population to counteract threats to genome integrity.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Rapid evolution and positive selection in genes mediating piRNA precursor biogenesis</title><p id="P6">Evidence of positive selection or patterns of rapid evolution have been reported for several genes in the Drosophila piRNA pathway. However, a broader coherent molecular evolution analysis, including more recently discovered factors, is missing for a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary history of the piRNA pathway. To fill this gap, we performed molecular evolution analyses of factors required for germline piRNA precursor biogenesis in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). This piRNA precursor production relies on highly specialized piRNA pathway genes as well as deeply conserved genes that serve general functions in RNA polymerase II-based gene expression, including TFIIA-S, CtBP, and UAP56. Deeply conserved functions are expected to be reflected in very low frequency of amino acid-altering (non-synonymous) mutations, thereby providing a within-pathway control group. Indeed, comparing coding sequences between two closely related Drosophila species pairs (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to <italic>D. simulans</italic> and <italic>D. persimilis</italic> to <italic>D. pseudoobscura),</italic> dN/dS (ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence) estimates for all tested piRNA pathway-specific factors was notably elevated compared to the three genes also serving more general roles in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Of note, for Trf2, which functions both in the piRNA pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and in canonical gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, we observed high sequence divergence concentrated in the long isoform, for which the function remains unresolved. Rapid sequence divergence can be explained by either genetic drift (lack of functional constraint) or by adaptive evolution (positive selection for new sequence variants). To determine the extent of adaptive evolution within the germline piRNA precursor biogenesis network, we performed likelihood ratio tests between species of the <italic>melanogaster</italic> species group, spanning ~25 million years of divergence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. We inferred a history of adaptive evolution for Rhino, Deadlock, Kipferl, Moonshiner, and Trf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). In sum, we extend previous observations of rapid evolution within the piRNA pathway to uncover pervasive rapid, adaptive evolution in genes involved in germline piRNA precursor production. These observations suggest recurrent functional innovation within the essential protein interaction network supporting <italic>Drosophila</italic> piRNA biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>A systematic Y2H screen defines the protein interaction network evolution of piRNA precursor biogenesis</title><p id="P7">Germline piRNA precursor biogenesis is facilitated by protein-protein interactions that lead to the recruitment of effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) driving transcription, co-transcriptional processing, and piRNA precursor export<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Interestingly, recent studies have uncovered incompatibilities amongst the factors Rhino, Deadlock and Cutoff from the closely related <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Given the recent predictions that adaptive evolution in protein-coding genes is mainly driven by intermolecular interactions rather than innovation in e.g. protein stability or folding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, we therefore hypothesized that the functional innovation suggested by our evolutionary analyses has occurred at the level of protein-protein interactions. To test this hypothesis, we performed a cross-species, all-versus-all yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) matrix screen, a method previously used to study host-pathogen relationships (reviewed in refs. 43,44), protein interactome essentiality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, and subcomplex contacts in the nuclear pore complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Here we screened 11 proteins involved in germline piRNA precursor biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) from five different <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. simulans, D. erecta, D. persimilis,</italic> and <italic>D. virilis),</italic> representing different evolutionary distances across 40 million years of divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). As Kipferl is absent in <italic>D. persimilis</italic> and <italic>D. virilis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, this resulted in a set of 54 proteins from five species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>) allowing a systematic assessment of 308 intra- and 1123 inter-species unique protein pairs for interaction.</p><p id="P8">Y2H experiments are prone to false negative results due to specific tagging, as fusions might interfere with folding or mask binding surfaces. To reduce the potential false negative rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, we cloned all coding sequences as bait and prey, each fused C- and N-terminally with a DNA-binding (DBD) or a transcription activation domain (AD), respectively. Therefore, every protein is represented as four individual constructs, and every protein interaction is tested in eight combinations using different constructs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2A-B</xref>). Bait proteins that did not show any interactions or, conversely, resulted in a set of well-sampled protein-protein interactions were screened two times. The other baits were screened three times, with three or four technical replicates each (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C-F</xref>). Excluding 10 auto-active bait and two auto-active prey constructs from the analyses, we examined a total of 89,088 individual pairs. For scoring Y2H interactions, we applied thresholds for colony size and technical as well as biological replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). Here, each unique configuration of a protein-protein interaction can lead to a maximum score of one. After combining all eight potential configurations for a protein pair, the sum of the scores can reach a maximum of eight. We then benchmarked the success of the screen by assessing protein-protein interactions previously described between piRNA precursor biogenesis factors in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Using a conservative Y2H replication score cutoff of 0.75, we report 199 interacting protein pairs, 46 intra- and 153 inter-species interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). The five most central protein interactions known from studies of the network in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> were confirmed by Y2H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, blue dots). The four previously described interactions that were not detected by Y2H (Boot-Nxf3, Boot- UAP56, Trf2-Moon, and Trf2-TFIIA-S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-C</xref>), are all part of multimeric complexes in the form of either Nxf3–Nxt1–Bootlegger–UAP56<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> or Trf2–TFIIA-S-Moonshiner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, thus likely preventing their detection via pairwise Y2H assays. Additionally, the previously described ability of CtBP and UAP56 to homodimerize<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> was supported by Y2H signal in tests where the same protein was tagged as bait and prey (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). We therefore conclude that our Y2H screen recapitulated known pairwise interactions within the germline piRNA biogenesis pathway.</p><p id="P9">Not only are the vital <italic>Drosophila</italic> piRNA pathway genes evolving rapidly; some proteins found to be essential for the piRNA pathway in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are dispensable in closely related species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> revealing a remarkable evolutionary plasticity within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> piRNA pathway. We therefore investigated the degree of conservation of the core interaction network of germline piRNA biogenesis factors by comparing intra-species protein interactions across the investigated <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. Our Y2H assays showed that the central interactions connecting Deadlock to Rhino, Cutoff, and Bootlegger are detected in at least three of the four tested <italic>non-melanogaster</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Similarly, we observed interaction between Rhino and Kipferl in all species harboring the <italic>kipferl</italic> gene. Furthermore, we did not find evidence for the proposed interaction between Cutoff and CtBP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup> and only the <italic>D. simulans</italic> orthologs supported the proposed interaction between Moonshiner and Deadlock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). These results could reflect that (i) the Cutoff-CtBP and Moonshiner-Deadlock interactions are technically difficult to detect by Y2H, (ii) CtBP and Moonshiner are not involved in piRNA precursor biogenesis in some <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, or (iii) unknown and potentially evolutionarily labile interactions connect CtBP and Moonshiner to Rhino-dependent piRNA source loci in different <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. In sum, we uncovered an overall conserved interaction network structure amongst <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline piRNA biogenesis factors – with notable exceptions indicating evolutionarily labile recruitment of the CtBP and Moonshiner transcription factors.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cross-species analysis reveals diverse protein interaction evolution within the piRNA pathway</title><p id="P10">The conservation of a core protein interaction network within the piRNA pathway can be explained by at least two evolutionary trajectories: (i) protein interaction site conservation and (ii) protein interaction co-evolution, whereby compensatory mutations evolve that restore protein-protein interaction following sequence changes that otherwise diminish it. Interestingly, such interaction site co-evolution has previously been suggested for interactions between Rhino, Deadlock and Cutoff based on observed species incompatibilities between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. We therefore looked for signatures of either interaction site conservation or co-evolution in our cross-species Y2H data representing evolutionary distances from 0 to 40 million years of divergence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). We reasoned that conserved interaction surfaces should yield Y2H interaction signals for proteins across the tested species (inter-species interactions), while co-evolving interactions should instead tend to show interaction signals between proteins from the same species (intra-species interactions) or from closely related species. We found that the Deadlock–Cutoff and Rhino–Kipferl interactions are detected at similarly high frequency in intra-species and interspecies interaction tests across all tested evolutionary distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5A</xref>), compatible with a model of conserved interaction surfaces. Conversely, the interactions of Deadlock–Rhino and Deadlock–Bootlegger showed a higher frequency of intra-species and short-distance interspecies interactions compared to tests between more distantly related orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C-D</xref>), indicative for a model of co-evolution.

What might be the biological advantage of such rapid biochemical innovation in a network of essential genes? At least three broader evolutionary forces may contribute to such rapid evolution despite the essential function of the piRNA pathway. First, the adaptive walk model of evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref></sup>, states that young genes are expected to evolve faster and with larger mutational fitness effect because they are further from their fitness optimum compared to older genes. Adaptive walk effects may therefore contribute to the rapid evolution of young, Drosophila-restricted piRNA pathway genes such as Rhino, Deadlock, Cutoff, Moonshiner, Bootlegger and Nxf3. Second, the piRNA autoimmunity model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref></sup> proposes that the rapid evolution of the genomic loci giving rise to piRNAs would frequently give rise to piRNAs that target important host genes for silencing. Under this model, such self-targeting would drive adaptation for changes in piRNA pathway proteins that reduce the host gene silencing, e.g. by altering the piRNA biogenesis mechanism or the silencing potency. Third, the evolutionary arms race model suggests that recurrent rapid evolution of piRNA pathway genes occurs in response to transposon evolution towards evasion of piRNA silencing or ‘anti-silencing’ by inhibition of the piRNA pathway. While such “Red Queen” evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref></sup> has been proposed based on observations of functional diversification of piRNA pathway genes between closely related species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref></sup>, only the recent identification of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> transposon expressing piRNAs that target a piRNA pathway factor for silencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref></sup> supports the existence of such piRNA pathway inhibitors. Finally, our data also suggest a fourth, ‘piRNA locus balancing’, model to explain rapid piRNA pathway evolution. This model rests on the observation that germline piRNA source loci differ in their dependence on specific piRNA precursor biogenesis factors. Some source loci, for example, are expressed independently of Moonshiner and Trf2 and instead rely on DNA-encoded promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Other loci do not require the zinc-finger protein Kipferl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and a few germline piRNA source loci (e.g. <italic>cluster20A</italic>) are expressed independently of any of the factors in the Rhino interaction network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. We propose that altering the interactions between proteins at germline piRNA clusters could impact piRNA production from specific loci. Depending on current transposon activity in a population, altered piRNA sub-pools could provide a mechanism to shift the target focus between transposon families. This model is thus consistent with the recent observation that while piRNA clusters tend to be syntenic between <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, they share little sequence content and instead contain large insertions of recently active transposons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">In sum, our study of the evolution of protein-protein interactions across <italic>Drosophila</italic> evolution has uncovered principles of interaction evolution within an adaptively evolving protein network. Our findings uncover how pathway function is maintained despite rapid biochemical innovation and lay the foundation for better mechanistic understanding of the biochemically labile piRNA pathway and the evolutionary forces driving such innovation.

Cells were imaged 30 - 48 hours post transfection without fixation with a Nikon AX-CLSM (Heidelberg, Germany) or Zeiss Axio LSM980 (Aarhus, Denmark) in confocal imaging mode.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental figures 1-8</label><media xlink:href="EMS199276-supplement-Supplemental_figures_1_8.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d29aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Table_S1_PAML</label><media xlink:href="EMS199276-supplement-Table_S1_PAML.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d29aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Table_S2_Protein_IDS_Y2H</label><media xlink:href="EMS199276-supplement-Table_S2_Protein_IDS_Y2H.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d29aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Table_S3_Flies_used_in_this_study</label><media xlink:href="EMS199276-supplement-Table_S3_Flies_used_in_this_study.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d29aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S26"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We much appreciate the helpful comments on earlier versions of the manuscript from Julius Brennecke and Anne F.
