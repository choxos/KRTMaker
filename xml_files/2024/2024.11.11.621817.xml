Pathogenic missense mutations in the alpha actin isotype 2 gene (<italic>ACTA2</italic>) primarily affect smooth muscle cell (SMC) function and cause multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome (MSMDS), a genetic vasculopathy that is associated with stroke, aortic dissection, and death in childhood. Here, we explored genome editing to correct the most common MSMDS-causative mutation <italic>ACTA2</italic> R179H. In a first-in-kind approach, we performed mutation-specific protein engineering to develop a bespoke CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme with enhanced on-target activity against the R179H sequence. To directly correct the R179H mutation, we screened dozens of configurations of base editors (comprised of Cas9 enzymes, deaminases, and gRNAs) to develop a highly precise corrective A-to-G edit with minimal deleterious bystander editing that is otherwise prevalent when using wild-type SpCas9 base editors. We then created a murine model of MSMDS that exhibits phenotypes consistent with human patients, including vasculopathy and premature death, to explore the <italic>in vivo</italic> therapeutic potential of this base editing strategy. Delivery of the customized base editor via an engineered SMC-tropic adeno-associated virus (AAV-PR) vector substantially prolonged survival and rescued systemic phenotypes across the lifespan of MSMDS mice, including in the vasculature, aorta, and brain. Together, our optimization of a customized base editor highlights how bespoke CRISPR-Cas enzymes can enhance on-target correction while minimizing bystander edits, culminating in a precise editing approach that may enable a long-lasting treatment for patients with MSMDS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CRISPR-Cas</kwd><kwd>genome editing</kwd><kwd>base editing</kwd><kwd>bystander editing</kwd><kwd>ACTA2</kwd><kwd>MSMDS</kwd><kwd>moyamoya disease</kwd><kwd>MDMS</kwd><kwd>pediatric disease</kwd><kwd>vasculopathies</kwd><kwd>aortic aneurysm</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Vascular disorders underlie ~90% of cardiovascular diseases, which are the leading cause of death and disability in the world<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Genetic vascular diseases are accelerated disorders that cause early severe disability and up to 10% of childhood strokes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. For example, multisystemic smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome (MSMDS) is a smooth muscle cell (SMC) myopathy characterized by severe symptoms in organs enriched with SMCs including vessels, lungs, gut, eye, and bladder, ultimately resulting in death in childhood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Life threatening manifestations include cerebral artery stenosis, aortic enlargement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, and impairment of cerebrovascular autoregulation and blood-brain barrier function, which together substantially increase risk for aortic or peripheral vascular dissections and strokes in the first decade of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. MSMDS is caused by heterozygous various missense variants at arginine 179 of the alpha actin isotype 2 (<italic>ACTA2</italic>) gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, the most common of which is c.536G&gt;A that causes p.Arg179His (R179H)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>), although R179C and R179S have also been observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Mutant ACTA2 R179H protein acts in a dominant negative manner to destabilize the cytoskeleton of SMCs, pericytes, and other smooth muscle actin-expressing cells, undermining their contractile function. There are no medical or surgical therapies available for patients with MSMDS that can prevent the life-threatening manifestations of stroke or vascular dissections, and, despite extensive symptomatic care, they typically die before adulthood.</p><p id="P5">Given this tremendous unmet medical need, we sought to develop a genome editing approach to correct the <italic>ACTA2</italic> R179H mutation to provide therapeutic benefit for MSMDS patients, while also establishing a framework to treat the broader class of genetic vascular diseases. The development of CRISPR-Cas9-based base editors (BEs) has enabled the installation of nucleotide-level genetic changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. BEs are typically comprised of a fusion of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 (SpCas9) to a nucleotide deaminase domain, and when directed by a guide RNA (gRNA) to a target genomic site can initiate specific DNA base edits. Two main classes of BEs include cytosine base editors (CBEs) that catalyze C-to-T edits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> and adenine base editors (ABEs) that catalyze A-to- G edits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The deaminase domains of CBEs and ABEs typically function in a relatively narrow â€˜edit windowâ€™ of approximately 6-8 bases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> in a portion of the Cas9 target site distal from the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). The narrow edit window motivates the use of engineered SpCas9 enzymes with modified or relaxed PAM requirements with increased flexibility to precisely position the deaminase over the edit-of-interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Various types of BEs have shown promise to correct various genetic disorders caused by single nucleotide mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Because <italic>ACTA2</italic> R179H is caused by mutation of a Câ€¢G base pair to Tâ€¢A, ABEs should in principle be applicable as a therapeutic approach to correct the predominant MSMDS-causative mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Recently developed PAM-relaxed SpCas9 variant enzymes enable the targeting of non-canonical PAMs, thereby expanding the number of pathogenic mutations accessible to base editors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Although PAM-relaxed BEs offer simplicity and ease-of-use since a small set of enzymes can be utilized to correct a wide range of disease-causing mutations, their minimal PAM requirement can also increase unwanted off-target editing due to expanded access to genomic sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Instead, target-customized PAM-selective enzymes require optimization and engineering to be effective and safe, rendering them less widely developed or used despite their propensity to minimize unwanted genome-wide off-targets or to limit target-proximal bystander edits (by shifting the edit window of a base editor). For severe genetic diseases without current treatments, concerns about off-target and bystander editing are considerable, but are also balanced by the tremendous unmet need to develop safe and effective therapeutic approaches that can prolong patient life. To capitalize on the advantageous properties of precise base editors, we therefore wondered whether we could engineer a bespoke PAM-specific Cas9 enzyme using the mutant sequence as an engineering substrate, leading to an enzyme tailored to and optimized for the R179H sequence with minimized genome-wide and bystander edits.</p><p id="P7">Here we investigated the feasibility of developing a genetic treatment for MSMDS. Correction of <italic>ACTA2</italic> R179H using wild-type (WT) SpCas9 ABEs was efficient, but unfortunately accompanied by high nonsynonymous and deleterious bystander editing, motivating us to pursue alternate editing approaches. Protein engineering against the R179H mutant allele permitted optimization of a bespoke PAM variant base editor to precisely position the ABE edit window to maximize R179H correction while minimizing bystander editing. Comprehensive evaluation of off-target editing via multiple unbiased methods identified few off-target sites and none in genomic areas of known concern. To assess the <italic>in vivo</italic> effectiveness of ABE-mediated R179H correction, we developed a conditional SMC-specific mouse model of MSMDS that exhibits multiple phenotypes consistent with human symptoms including neurovascular dysfunction, aortic enlargement, intestinal dysmotility, and premature death. Delivery of the customized ABE via dual-adeno associated virus (AAV) vectors with an engineered SMC-specific AAV-PR capsid prolonged survival and rescued a range of phenotypes across the lifespan of MSMDS mice. Our results demonstrate how engineering a mutant-specific customized ABE for the R179H sequence can effectively and precisely correct the mutation <italic>in vivo</italic> while minimizing bystander edits, leading to substantial phenotypic recovery, and thus advancing a potential therapeutic strategy for MSMDS.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Optimization of adenine base editing to correct the <italic>ACTA2</italic> R179H mutation</title><p id="P8">We first established a homozygous HEK 293T cell line bearing the <italic>ACTA2</italic> R179H mutation via prime editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup.

The ABEs were comprised of TadA8.20m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> or TadA8e<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> deaminase domains fused to an engineered SpCas9 PAM variant enzyme SpCas9-VRQR that can target NGA PAMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> (for gRNA A4), an engineered PAM-relaxed enzyme SpG that can target NGN PAMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup> (for gRNAs A4 and A7), or WT SpCas9 (for gRNA A8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Figs. 2a,b</xref>). We observed effective on-target correction of R179H with various ABE and gRNA combinations, including either ABE with WT SpCas9 and gRNA A8 or SpCas9-VRQR and gRNA A4, and weaker editing with SpG and gRNA A4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Analysis of bystander editing at a nearby adenine revealed high levels of A-to-G editing resulting in a nonsynonymous M178V substitution when using ABE8e-WT or ABE8.20m-WT with gRNA A8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1c,d</xref>).

Together, these data demonstrate how the use of SpCas9 PAM variant enzymes can achieve high levels of correction while effectively shifting the ABE edit window to minimize unwanted bystander edits.</p><p id="P9">Next, to achieve enhanced on-target R179H correction we performed R179H target-specific protein engineering of SpCas9-VRQR. We identified potential novel and previously described amino acid substitutions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> in SpCas9 that can augment on-target editing via energetic supplementation with non-specific protein:nucleic acid contacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> (which can presumably improve editing via increased PAM interaction energetics and/or stabilization of enzyme transition states). Introduction of 18 different single amino acid substitutions into the SpCas9-VRQR nuclease led to a set of derivative enzymes that we assayed for on-target editing against the <italic>ACTA2</italic> R179H sequence in our homozygous HEK 293T cell model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Several derivative enzymes led to enhanced on-target editing efficiencies on the <italic>ACTA2</italic> R179H target site compared to SpCas9-VRQR, including enzymes with S55R, A61R, N1317R, T1138K, G1104K, and D1332R substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Characterization of the PAM requirements of these enzymes via a high-throughput PAM determination assay (HD-PAMDA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>) revealed generally comparable PAM preferences between SpCas9-VRQR and most derivative enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Sup. Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that for some enzymes the improved editing efficiencies did not negatively impact PAM selectivity.</p><p id="P10">Given the enhanced on-target editing efficiency that we observed with SpCas9-VRQR nuclease additionally encoding the S55R amino acid substitution (hereafter named enhanced SpCas9-VRQR; eVRQR), we assessed this activity-enhanced enzyme in base editing experiments.

With base editing, mutation-proximal bystander edits and genome-wide off-target edits can occur. However, the biologic implications of these edits are unclear and long-term monitoring of patients will be required to understand potential risks, motivating the development of assays to more carefully understand the impact of off-target edits. Furthermore, the size constraints of the AAV genome necessitate splitting the large base editor coding sequence into two AAV vectors, with the expressed ABE â€˜halvesâ€™ being reconstituted via intein domains within doubly transduced cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>.

Also, sustained expression of the ABE from the AAV episome creates potential for genomic toxicity by increasing risk for unintended off-target editing and may result in an adaptive immune response to the ABE protein.

DNA was eluted in 200 Î¼L of Elution buffer EBA, and the approximate concentrations of gDNA were quantified by Nanodrop.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Quantification of AAV genomes in mouse tissues</title><p id="P48">Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) reactions were performed to quantify the approximate number of AAV genomes in transduced tissues using 20 to 60 ng of gDNA, 250 nM of each primer and 900 nM probe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary Table 4</xref>), and ddPCR supermix for probes (no dUTP) (BioRad) in 20 Î¼L reactions. Droplets were generated using a QX200 Automated Droplet Generator (BioRad). Thermal cycling conditions were: 1 cycle of (95 Â°C for 10 min), 40 cycles of (94 Â°C for 30 sec, 58 Â°C for 1 min), 1 cycle of (98 Â°C for 10 min), hold at 4 Â°C. PCR products were analyzed using a QX200 Droplet Reader (BioRad) and absolute quantification of inserts was determined using QuantaSoft (v1.7.4).</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Ultrasounds</title><p id="P49">Nair hair removal cream was used on all mice the day prior to ultrasounds. All ultrasounds were performed on awake, unsedated mice using the Visualsonics Vevo660 imaging system and a 30 MHz transducer. The aorta was imaged and analysed by MicroDicom software using a standard parasternal long axis view. Dimensions from each animal represent averages of measurements made on still frames in systole of the maximal internal diameter of the aortic valve annulus, aortic sinuses, sinotubular junction, or ascending aorta by a researcher blinded to genotype.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Internal carotid artery measurements</title><p id="P50">To measure the diameter the internal carotid arteries (ICAs), mice were anesthesia with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with black india ink (Higgins, Chartpak, Inc. MA, USA). Brains were collected and photographed. The diameter of the ICAs in both left and right hemispheres was measured using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), and calculated the average of both sides.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Rotarod and Open Field Test</title><p id="P51">Motor coordination was assessed using Ugo Basile Rota-Rod for mice (Model# 47600). Mice were placed on the beam of a rotarod revolving at a 4 RPM. default speed, facing in the opposite orientation to rotation. The speed was gradually accelerated to a maximum of 40 RPM over a 5 minute test session. The latency before falling was measured up to a maximum total time on the rod of 5 min for 3 trials. Experiments were performed over two days: the first day mice were trained for the experimental procedure, and on the second consecutive day the test was performed.</p><p id="P52">The open field task is a sensorimotor test used to determine general activity levels, gross locomotor activity, and exploration habits in mice. Mice were placed at the center of a square, white plexiglass box arena and allowed to freely move for 5 minutes while being recorded by an overhead camera. The footage is then analyzed by activity monitor automated tracking system software for total distance travelled.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Tissue Isolation and Histological Analysis</title><p id="P53">For aortas and neurovascular circulation gross organ images, latex was injected into the left ventricular apex under low pressure until it was visible in the femoral artery. Animals were then fixed in Formalin (10%) for 24 h before transfer to 70% ethanol for dissection, photography, and storage. Other organs were then resected.</p><p id="P54">Mouse aortic SMCs were isolated by standard explant of the ascending section of the aortas from Acta2R179Hfl/+ or Myh11-Cre: Acta2R179Hfl/+ mice. To preserve cell identity, all experiments were carried out at passages 1â€“5. Human and murine SMCs were grown with SMC growth medium from Cell Applications Inc. (catalog 311-500).</p><p id="P55">For histological analysis, organs were removed from the animals or dissected in situ for photography prior to paraffinization and sectioning (7 Î¼M). For DAB antibody labelling, the tissue sections were initially deparaffinized in xylene for two cycles of 6 minutes each, followed by hydration in a series of ethanol washes, including 100% ethanol for 6 minutes, and treatment with 0.5% H2O2 in methanol for 10 minutes. Further hydration was achieved with 90% ethanol for 3 minutes and 70% ethanol for 3 minutes, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times for 3 minutes each. Antigen retrieval was performed either by incubating sections in a water bath with sodium citrate for 30 minutes or with EDTA for 15 minutes, depending on the primary antibody used. After cooling the sections on the benchtop for 20 minutes, they were washed in PBS three times for 3 minutes each. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating sections in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation with the primary antibodies anti-smooth muscle actin (SMA, ab5694, 1:1000; abcam) or anti-myelin basic protein (MBP, ab209328, 1:1000; abcam) diluted in 1% BSA/PBS at 4 Â°C.</p><p id="P56">On the second day, sections were washed in PBS three times for 3 minutes each before being incubated with DAKO Rabbit/Mouse HRP Kit-provided HRP (Mouse-K4001, Rabbit-K4003; Dako) for 30 minutes at room temperature. After another wash with PBS, the signal was developed using the DAKO DAB Kit (K3468; Dako) for 2 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was terminated with water, followed by counterstaining using Hematoxylin (7231; Epredia). Finally, sections underwent three washes with water for dehydration, were mounted with xylene, and cover slipped for examination.</p><p id="P57">For DAB staining visualization, the stained slices were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 800 microscope, which provided high-resolution images necessary for detailed analysis.</p><p id="P58">For the immunolabel intensity calculation, the mean immune labelling intensity for MBP and SMA labeled brain slices was calculated using ImageJ/FIJI software (V.1.54f). The region of interest (ROI) was selected, and the mean pixel intensity within these regions was measured for quantitative comparison of immunolabeling across samples.</p><p id="P59">The extent of cortical myelination was evaluated by measuring the proportion of myelinated cortex in brain slices. The myelinated cortex area and the total cortex area were measured using ImageJ/FIJI. The proportion of myelinated cortex was calculated using the following formula: Proportion of Myelinated Cortex = (Total Cortex Area\Myelinated Cortex Area) Ã— 100%.</p><p id="P60">The tortuosity index of blood vessels in the brain slices was calculated to assess vascular changes. Images were processed using NIHâ€™s ImageJ software. The Free Hand tool in ImageJ was used to outline the perimeter of both the outer and inner membranes of the vessels. The tortuosity index was determined by the ratio of the inner perimeter to the outer perimeter: Tortuosity Index = Outer Perimeter \ Inner Perimeter.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Notes and Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS200053-supplement-Supplementary_Notes_and_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d65aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS200053-supplement-Supplementary_Table_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d65aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS200053-supplement-Supplementary_Table_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d65aAcEdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Table 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS200053-supplement-Supplementary_Table_3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d65aAcEeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Table 4</label><media xlink:href="EMS200053-supplement-Supplementary_Table_4.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d65aAcEfB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Table 5</label><media xlink:href="EMS200053-supplement-Supplementary_Table_5.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d65aAcEgB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplementary Table 6</label><media xlink:href="EMS200053-supplement-Supplementary_Table_6.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d65aAcEhB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Supplementary Table 7</label><media xlink:href="EMS200053-supplement-Supplementary_Table_7.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d65aAcEiB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a Charles A.
