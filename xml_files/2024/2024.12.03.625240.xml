In addition to directly activating the CDK, the cyclin subunit regulates CDK specificity by binding short peptide “docking” motifs in CDK substrates. Here, we measure the relative binding strength of ~100,000 peptides to 11 human cyclins from five cyclin families (D, E, A, B and F). Using a quantitative intracellular binding assay and large-scale tiled peptide screening, we identified a range of non-canonical binders that unveil a broader than anticipated repertoire of cyclin docking motif types. Structural and saturation mutagenesis studies revealed distinct binding modes and sequence features that govern motif recognition, binding strength, and cyclin preference. Docking motifs vary from highly selective to pan-cyclin, thereby fine-tuning the timing of CDK phosphorylation during cell cycle progression. Overall, these findings provide an unprecedented depth of understanding about the rules encoding specificity and affinity within a group of related but distinct protein domains.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>kinase</kwd><kwd>cyclin</kwd><kwd>cyclin-dependent kinases</kwd><kwd>short linear motif</kwd><kwd>SLiMs</kwd><kwd>enzyme docking</kwd><kwd>binding specificity</kwd><kwd>binding affinity</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>post-translational modification</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cell division requires precise orchestration of diverse molecular processes, such as DNA replication, chromosome segregation, the centrosome cycle, transcription and metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Each step is coordinated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that phosphorylate hundreds of proteins in a temporally resolved manner during the cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. The key determinant of these cycles of phosphorylation is the tightly controlled expression, localization, and degradation of cyclins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. In metazoans, four major classes of cyclin-CDK complexes are sequentially activated during the cell cycle, with cyclin D-Cdk4/6 and E-Cdk2 initiating cell cycle entry, cyclin A-Cdk1/2 driving S phase and mitotic entry, and cyclin B-Cdk1 coordinating mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. In G1 phase, CDK activity is minimal due to the expression of CDK inhibitory proteins (e.g., p27) and the low levels of cyclins E, A and B. The accumulation of CDK activity that peaks in mitosis is driven by the expression of cyclins together with inactivation of their inhibitory proteins, and the gradually increasing intrinsic activity of subsequent cyclin-CDK complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Finally, the system is reset by the degradation of cyclins A and B during mitosis, and the subsequent dephosphorylation of CDK substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">Several mechanisms control the phosphorylation of CDK targets. First, CDKs are serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate minimal [ST]P and full [ST]Px[KR] consensus sites, though Cdk1 can also phosphorylate sites lacking the adjacent proline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Second, substrate multisite phosphorylation can be promoted by the CDK-bound Cks1 subunit that binds pre-phosphorylated TP sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Third, cyclin subunits recruit specific proteins by binding to docking motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. In particular, “RxL” docking motifs are recognized by a binding pocket called the hydrophobic patch that is conserved in all major classes of cell cycle cyclins (D, E, A, B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. In CDK substrates, RxL motifs enhance phosphorylation, whereas in CDK inhibitors they block substrate recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Moreover, these interactions can control cyclin localization in human and yeast cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Cyclin F also recognizes RxL motifs but does not bind CDKs, acting instead as a substrate recognition subunit of the SCF (Skp1–Cul1–F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Additionally, cyclin D docks to C-terminal helices in Rb-family proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and cyclin B binds to a helix in Mad1 and a phosphoserine-containing motif in separase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Further diversity of cyclin docking has been characterized in budding yeast, where specific docking motifs have been found for most cyclin types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Over 30 human proteins have been found to recruit cyclins through RxL docking motifs. These motifs generally conform to a strict consensus where an invariant leucine (P0, which we refer to as Φ<sub>0</sub>) is flanked N-terminally by an arginine or lysine residue (P-2) and C-terminally by a phenylalanine or a leucine (at P+1 or P+2, which we refer to as Φ<sub>C</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1A-B</xref>). Co-crystal structures of cyclin A2 with RxL peptides explain these sequence preferences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, revealing that the two consensus hydrophobic residues are buried in a hydrophobic pocket and the N-terminal portion of the peptide makes extensive contacts with the cyclin surface anchored around the consensus basic position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>). Distinct backbone conformations permit the Φ<sub>C</sub> hydrophobic residue to exist at either the P+1 or P+2 position. A handful of atypical motifs have been identified, suggesting that additional RxL-like motifs exist. For example, a peptide from SAMHD1 conforms to the hydrophobic positions but lacks a basic residue at P-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, while a motif in RRM2 that binds Cyclin F features a P0 Ile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>. Moreover, SKP2 contains two atypical motifs, one that binds the RxL-binding surface in a reverse orientation, and one that binds a distinct cyclin surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The cyclin residues contacting the RxL motif exhibit sequence diversity across the human cyclins, particularly in the residues contacting the N-terminal portion of the motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). Despite this, relatively little is known about the tolerated residues in RxL motifs, how the motif sequence context can modulate binding strength, whether different cyclins show any distinct sequence preferences, or what are the targets of specific cyclins. Given the critical role of cyclin-CDKs in cell proliferation and the considerable interest in inhibiting these complexes for therapeutic purposes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, a systematic effort to address these questions is warranted.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we conduct a detailed investigation into human cyclin-binding motifs across five major cyclin families, involving over one million quantitative measurements of cyclin-motif binding strength. Using large-scale peptide binding assays, we performed unbiased screens of human proteins to identify cyclin-binding regions and their cyclin specificity. We subsequently employed saturation mutagenesis to identify their affinity and specificity determinants. Key findings were validated using fluorescence polarization (FP), cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and incell phosphorylation assays. This work contributes unique insights into the rules governing substrate recruitment by human cyclin-CDK, and provides a blueprint for future studies characterizing the thousands of motif-binding domains in the human proteome.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>SIMBA enables identification of cyclin binding peptides</title><p id="P6">We applied Systematic Intracellular Motif Binding Analysis (SIMBA), a quantitative yeast-based peptide binding assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, to investigate human cyclin docking interactions. In yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>), mating and cell cycle are mutually opposing pathways, with yeast Cln2-Cdc28 phosphorylating and inactivating mating pathway proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E</xref>). In SIMBA, this network is rewired such that an exogenous domain-peptide interaction recruits Cln2-Cdc28 to its mating pathway target, a fusion protein called Ste20<sup>Ste5PM</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F</xref>). Consequently, mating signaling and growth arrest are suppressed in proportion to the strength of the exogenous docking interaction. These effects can be assayed by low-throughput assays (involving a transcriptional reporter, pFUS1-lacZ) or high-throughput assays (involving competitive growth)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. To investigate human cyclins (HsCyclins), we fused their cyclin fold domains (disabled for CDK-binding) to Cln2, and inserted their candidate docking motifs into Ste20<sup>Ste5PM</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F</xref>). In low-throughput assays, the fusions to HsCyclins (D1, E1, A2, and B1) did not perturb Cln2 binding to its native LP docking site, but they imparted an ability to recognize a pan-cyclin binding RxL motif from PKN2 derived from Proteomic Peptide-Phage Display (ProP-PD) screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A-B</xref>). Importantly, this recognition was abolished by mutating the human cyclin hydrophobic patch. Furthermore, specificity differences among cyclins were revealed by testing multiple RxL sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1H</xref>). These results established that SIMBA could be used to study human cyclin docking.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Design, screening and benchmarking of a tiled cell cycle protein library</title><p id="P7">To comprehensively characterize the repertoire of human cyclin binding motifs, we designed a high-throughput SIMBA experiment for screening a library of peptide sequences. We selected 808 cell-cycle-related proteins as a pool of potential cyclin binders and represented their intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) as ~90,000 tiled 16-mer peptides that overlap by 14 amino acids to allow motif boundaries to be delineated with 2-residue precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1I</xref>). This tiled library pool, including control peptides (wild-type and mutated RxL and LP motifs, and STOP codon containing peptides), was inserted into the prey component of SIMBA, and 11 human cyclins (D1/2/3, E1/2, A1/2, B1/2/3 and F) were inserted into the bait component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1C</xref>). The peptide library was screened against each cyclin in competitive growth assays. Deep sequencing was performed to monitor changes in the frequency of peptides over time, from which enrichment scores were calculated. Most peptides displayed similar enrichment scores with and without a human cyclin as bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1J</xref>), suggesting no bait-specific suppression of growth arrest and therefore no cyclin binding. The scores were strongly correlated across three replicate experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1D</xref>). Importantly, the control peptides showed four categories of behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1J-L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1E</xref>). First, the variants with the highest scores in all strains were those containing STOP codons, which truncate the Ste20<sup>Ste5PM</sup> protein and thereby eliminate mating signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1J-K</xref>). Second, wild-type LP motif peptides were enriched in all strains expressing Cln2 or HsCyclin-Cln2, confirming that all Cln2 fusions were expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1J-K</xref>). Third, non-functional mutant RxL or LP motifs were not enriched in any of the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1J-L</xref>). Fourth, wild-type RxL control peptides were enriched specifically in strains expressing HsCyclin-Cln2 fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1J</xref>). To focus exclusively on interactions mediated by the human cyclins, in subsequent analyses we corrected the enrichment scores from the HsCyclin strains by subtracting those in the unfused Cln2 strain to obtain SIMBA scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1F, Table S1</xref>). These results demonstrate that SIMBA can be scaled to study large peptide libraries.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Cell cycle protein tiling expands the census and diversity of cyclin binding peptides</title><p id="P8">As expected, cyclin-binding peptides among the ~90,000 peptides in the tiled library were rare, and most library peptides were not enriched in any HsCyclin-Cln2 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). This is illustrated by results from RBL1, which contains three IDRs spanning 361 residues, covered by 159 peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>). While most of these peptides were not enriched in any HsCyclin strain, two regions showed binding, with the dense peptide tiling delineating motif boundaries with 2-residue precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B-C</xref>). The first region contains a characterized RxL motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, covered by five peptides that were enriched in cyclin D1, E1/2, A2, and F strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B-C</xref>). The second region, at the C terminus of RBL1, contains three peptides that were strongly enriched only in cyclin D1/2/3 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2B</xref>) confirming prior findings that this region contains a helical cyclin D-binding motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. This result also demonstrates that the screen can identify peptides for distinct cyclin pockets, as cyclin D-binding helices do not bind to the hydrophobic patch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, combining the high-throughput SIMBA method with the tiled peptide library allows unbiased identification of binding motifs, while simultaneously defining their boundaries and cyclin specificities.</p><p id="P9">The screen identified 75% (21/28) of the published cyclin binding motifs in the tiled library, demonstrating its ability to capture biologically relevant interactions. In addition, 27 previously uncharacterized high-confidence motifs were discovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). The number of detected binding regions varied considerably between cyclins, with the highest observed for cyclins F and A2, and lower numbers for D1, E1, and B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>). Cyclins E1, A2, and F bound many of the published RxL motifs but D1 and B1 did not bind strongly to any. However, these cyclins did bind previously uncharacterized RxL motifs including examples of cyclin D1 binding INSM1, a reported D1 interactor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, and MICAL3, which bound tightly to cyclin B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>, bold motifs). The screen also uncovered several atypical motifs. MASTL, a key mitotic regulator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, recognized cyclin B1 via a partial RxL consensus match that lacks a Leu or Phe at the Φ<sub>C</sub> position (<bold><underline>K</underline></bold>N<bold><underline>L</underline></bold>MCEL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>). Similarly, cyclin A2 bound an <bold><underline>R</underline></bold>N<bold><underline>L</underline></bold>SSEF peptide in GMNC, a DNA replication protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>, and an unconventional RxLxY peptide in SGO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>). Further, cyclin B1 bound two atypical motifs in PKN2: a QxLxF and a TxLxF, the former of which was also detected by ProP-PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A-B</xref>). Interestingly, many of these proteins also contained RxL consensus matches that did not bind any cyclin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2E</xref>, gray motifs). Altogether, these findings expand the census of cyclin docking motifs in the human proteome, including motif types that deviate from the typical RxL consensus, and show that a consensus match does not ensure binding.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>RxL motifs show diverse binding strengths and cyclin preferences</title><p id="P10">To directly compare different RxL motifs, we performed additional SIMBA experiments with a collection of published and newly discovered RxL motifs from human and viral proteins, screened as 13-mer peptides centered on the Φ<sub>0</sub> Leu. These motifs showed diversity in both binding strength and cyclin specificity. The strongest binding peptides were generally from viral proteins, although comparable binding was shown by several human peptides such as those from SCAPER and RBL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>). We identified three major categories of specificity for CDK-binding cyclins. First, <italic>pan-cyclin peptides</italic>, such as those from INSM1 and the viral protein MuHV-1 M97, which bind to members of all four families. Second, <italic>partially selective peptides</italic>, such as CDKN1A (p21) and RBL1 peptides that bound all cyclin types except B, or peptides from ANKRD17 and HPV-11 E1 that exhibited a more restricted preference for cyclins E and A but not D or B. Third, <italic>cyclin-specific peptides</italic>, which show strong preference for particular cyclin types. For example, SCAPER, ORC1, CDT1, and CENPC bound preferentially to cyclin A2, while MASTL bound only B-type cyclins. Thus, RxL motifs exhibit a variety of cyclin specificities. To validate the SIMBA findings, we performed competitive fluorescence polarization (FP) assays to measure peptide binding affinities for purified cyclin-CDK complexes <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1G</xref>). We tested multiple peptides that spanned a broad range of SIMBA scores and found that these <italic>in vivo</italic> scores correlated well with their <italic>in vitro</italic> binding affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2G-H</xref>). These assays also confirmed cyclin preferences, such as cyclin B1’s exclusive ability to bind the MASTL peptide and poor binding to the RBL1 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2H</xref>). Hence, the SIMBA data provide reliable quantification of relative binding strength and specificity, revealing novel insight into cyclin-CDK recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Mutational scanning reveals RxL binding determinants and unexpected binding modes</title><p id="P11">To further understand peptide binding preferences of each cyclin, we conducted a comprehensive mutational interrogation of 51 peptide motifs, including published motifs and previously uncharacterized instances identified either in the SIMBA tiling screen or by ProP-PD. We designed a deep mutational scanning (DMS) analysis that included saturation mutagenesis of 22 peptides and alanine scanning of 29 others, and used SIMBA to screen a library of these mutant variants against 11 human cyclins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3-4</xref>). As a quality check, we compared 48 control peptides present in both the tiled and mutational scanning libraries and observed high correlation between their scores in the different screens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2A</xref>). Pairwise comparisons of cyclins for their binding to the 7,968 distinct variants in the mutational scanning library revealed the strongest correlation between cyclins E1 and E2, followed by A2 and F, and D1 and D2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2B</xref>). Notably, cyclin B3 was more similar to E1/2 than B1/2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Investigation of the impact of alanine mutations across the peptides confirmed the requirement for the three core positions: Arg/Lys at P-2, Leu at Φ<sub>0</sub>, and a second Φ<sub>C</sub> hydrophobic residue at P+1 or P+2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that two peptides with the sequence RxLL, a published motif from PKMYT1 (<bold>R</bold>N<bold>L</bold>LSL<bold>F</bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> and one from BRCA2 found in the tiled library (<bold>R</bold>N<bold>L</bold>LNE<bold>F</bold>), did not depend on the Leu at P+1 and instead required the Phe at P+4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>). Furthermore, we observed the same P+4 requirement in several additional peptides from the tiled library screen, such as those from GMNC, MASTL, and CABLES2, which lacked a Leu or Phe at both P+1 and P+2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Based on these observations, we propose grouping RxL motifs into three types — designated as type 1, type 2, or type 3 — based on whether the required Φ<sub>C</sub> hydrophobic residue is at P+1, P+2, or P+4, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2C</xref>). The averaged results of the DMS data for each type further highlight the strong preferences at the three core positions and confirm that the Φ<sub>C</sub> hydrophobic residue can be provided at P+1, P+2, or P+4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2D, Data S1</xref>). Interestingly, we found no example of a similar preference at P+3, suggesting that type 3 motifs bind with a specific backbone conformation. To investigate this further, we used cryo-EM to determine the structure of cyclin A2-Cdk2 bound to the type 3 peptide from GMNC. Indeed, the cyclin-bound peptide forms a single turn α-helix from P0 to P+4, which allows the Phe at P+4 to engage the same cyclin pocket contacted by the Φ<sub>C</sub> hydrophobic residues in type 1 or 2 peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A-G</xref>). Thus, the three RxL types allow the core position contacts to be provided by three distinct peptide conformations. The RxL type was not a strict determinant of cyclin specificity, because cyclins E1, A2, B1, and F could each bind RxL motifs of all types, although cyclin E1 showed a notable preference for type 1 motifs, and cyclin D1 did not detectably bind any type 3 motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3E</xref>). These findings uncovered a distinct motif category that was previously unrecognized.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>RxL consensus match is a poor determinant of cyclin binding</title><p id="P14">Next, we explored the contribution of the RxL consensus to cyclin binding. The tiled library contained 427 candidate motifs matching the commonly used RxL consensus sequence, ([RK]xLx{0,1}[FL]), including 287 peptides that match a stricter consensus ([^EDWNSG][^D][RK][^D]Lx{0,1}[FL]x{0,3}[EDST]) defined by the ELM resource<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup>. We observed cyclin binding to less than 15% of the peptides with the strict consensus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S3H</xref>), indicating that most peptides matching these consensus sequences are not cyclin binders. To further test how binding depends on the residue identity at each variable consensus position (P2 and Φ<sub>C</sub>), we directly compared all four consensus combinations (RF, RL, KF, KL) in 42 parental peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3F</xref>). Both positions showed clear preferences. At P-2, Arg was preferred over Lys in both type 1 and type 2 motifs and by all cyclins, with the degree of this preference being stronger for cyclins E1 and F than for A2 and B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3F</xref>). At the Φ<sub>C</sub> position, Phe was strongly preferred over Leu by all cyclins. This preference was independent of whether P-2 was Arg or Lys, but it was greater in type 1 motifs compared to type 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3F</xref>). The two positional preferences were additive, such that motifs with favored residues at both positions (RxLF, RxLxF) permitted the strongest binding and the broadest range of cyclin types. Conversely, only a minority of KxLxL motifs were binders (favoring cyclins A2 and F) and KxLL motifs were uniformly poor binders. Thus, variation in core residues alone can modulate the binding strength of RxL motifs.</p><p id="P15">Conversely, peptides with optimal cores (RxLF or RxLxF) still vary in binding strength, and hence core residues alone are not sufficient to determine binding.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Non-core positions play a key role in RxL binding strength and cyclin specificity</title><p id="P16">To obtain an overview of motif preferences for all cyclins, we grouped the DMS data by position for each of the three RxL motif types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A</xref>). This analysis revealed that in addition to the three core positions, the residues at P-4, P-3, and P-1 are also strong binding determinants. Positions C-terminal to the core play a lesser role but show a preference for acidic residues that is most apparent for D and B cyclins. Compared to types 1 and 2, type 3 motifs tolerate fewer amino acids in most of the non-core positions (see numbered boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>).</p><p id="P17">At P-4, we identified strong preferences for nonpolar side chains (Ala, Val, Ile, Cys) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A</xref>). Moreover, in structures of cyclin-peptide complexes, the P-4 residue is usually buried to a similar extent as the P0 Leu (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4B</xref>), supporting a key role for P-4 as a third hydrophobic interaction which we refer to as Φ<sub>N</sub>. The residues favored at P-4 are largely shared by different cyclins, but there are some differences that contribute to cyclin specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4C</xref>). For example, cyclins B1 and B2 tolerate Leu and Ile at P-4 while disfavoring Ala, which is the preferred residue for cyclin D1. Notably, the cyclin B1/B2-favoring RxL from MICAL3 has Leu at P-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>). DMS of this peptide showed that while cyclin B1 prefers hydrophobic residues Leu, Ile and Val at P-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>), binding to cyclins E1, D1 and A2 was strongly improved by mutating the native Leu to many other residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4C</xref>). Therefore, Leu at P-4 may act as a specificity filter, favoring cyclin B binding. Similarly, the cyclin B1 specific RxL motif from MASTL contains an Ile at P-4, and replacing it with Cys was sufficient to allow cyclin A2 to bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4D</xref>). Suboptimal residues in the core positions of the MASTL motif might contribute to the specificity-determining effect of the P-4 residue, because cyclin A2 can tolerate Ile or Leu at P-4 in some other motif contexts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4C</xref>).</p><p id="P18">At P-3, most cyclins prefer Lys, Arg, Val, or Cys, although cyclin D favors small nonpolar residues (Ala, Cys, Ile) and cyclin B1 prefers Val (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>). The contribution of the P-3 residues to cyclin specificity is evident in data from the BRCA2 type 3 motif, where the wild-type peptide with Lys at P-3 binds both cyclin A2 and B1, but mutating P-3 to Ile or Glu increases B1 binding while significantly decreasing A2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4E</xref>). At position P-1 (the ‘x’ of RxL), type 1 and 2 motifs prefer Arg, Lys and Gln, whereas type 3 motifs show a unique preference for Asn, Ser and Cys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>), which might stabilize the adjacent helix by acting as an N-cap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Despite similar preferences at P-1 for most cyclins, this position critically impacts cyclin specificity in several peptide contexts. For example, the SCAPER RxL is among the strongest cyclin A2 binders, but binds other cyclins poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>). Interestingly, this motif gained the ability to bind cyclins D1 and E1 if the Ser at P-1 was mutated to any of several preferred residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4G</xref>). Furthermore, cyclin B3 showed an unusual preference for Thr, Ser and Val at P-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4A, S4E</xref>). Thus, while having strong overlapping preferences, cyclins can differ in their tolerance for suboptimal residues, and these differences can function as specificity determinants.</p><p id="P19">Finally, to verify the impact of non-core positions, we took one peptide of each RxL type and swapped their 4-residue N-terminal flanks with those from 42 different RxL peptides, and observed that these flanks could strongly alter binding strength (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4F</xref>). The results highlight the importance of the P-4 residue, in that cyclin D1 favored flanks with Ala at P-4 whereas cyclin B1 favored those with Val (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4F</xref>). Most N-terminal preferences were shared by all 3 RxL types, although some flanks, such as SSLR for cyclin B1, were optimal only in the type 3 context. In analogous experiments at the C-terminal end, we observed much weaker sequence dependence, as most C-terminal flanks were tolerated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4G</xref>). Taken together, the DMS and flank swapping analyses demonstrate that the non-core positions contribute to binding strength and play a key part in determining the cyclin specificity of the motif.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Core and non-core residues collectively tune RxL motif binding affinity</title><p id="P20">Next, we explored the general features controlling affinity. The mutational scanning data revealed that binding strength can be increased for all 51 peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4H</xref>), indicating that none are maximized. Overall, 51% of the mutations in RxL peptides had little to no effect, while 34% reduced binding to all cyclins (D1, E1, A2, B1 and F) and 15% produced cyclin-specific effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4H</xref>). This analysis also revealed that peptides with weak core determinants had low tolerance to mutation. For instance, a KxLxL peptide from ORC1 binds strongly to cyclin A2 despite having suboptimal residues at two core positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). DMS of this ORC1 peptide revealed limited tolerance to mutations at P-4, P-3, and P-1, in addition to the three core positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4I</xref>). This suggests that the ORC1 peptide tolerates the weak core motif because it has optimal non-core residues. A similar relationship between suboptimal core residues and increased dependence on non-core positions is observed when comparing a wild-type E2F1 motif (RxLxL) to an optimized RxLxF variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4I</xref>). Thus, while non-core residues are less essential than core residues, they can enhance binding strength and compensate for suboptimal cores. This concept was supported by binding determinant modeling using DMS data from each motif type (1, 2, or 3) to generate position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs). These PSSMs allow us to sum the weighted residue preferences at all motif positions and calculate predicted scores for all natural peptides in our libraries, including additional uncharacterized peptides that contain RxL consensus matches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4H</xref>). We observed that, once a threshold was surpassed, there was a strong correlation between predicted and experimental scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4J</xref>). We then scored these peptides using a PSSM generated from only non-core residues, and found that these non-core PSSM scores were markedly stronger for binder peptides than non-binders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4K</xref>). These results help explain why most RxL consensus matches are non-binders and emphasize that cyclin binding strength is a cumulative property encoded by preferences at multiple positions along the peptide motif.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Context-specific positioning of the Φ<sub>N</sub> residue</title><p id="P21">Five outlier peptides had substantially stronger binding than predicted by their PSSM scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4J</xref>, Φ<sub>N</sub>-alt).

DMS of two such motifs (CDC6 and PKMYT1) revealed a strong preference for Pro at P-3 and a greater dependence on P-5 than seen with other RxL motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4L</xref>). Co-crystal structures with E2F1 (<bold><underline>V</underline></bold>K<bold><underline>R</underline></bold>R<bold><underline>L</underline></bold>D<bold><underline>L</underline></bold>) and CDC6 (<bold><underline>L</underline></bold>KG<bold><underline>R</underline></bold>R<bold><underline>L</underline></bold>V<bold><underline>F</underline></bold>) peptides show that the P-4 Val in E2F1 and the P-5 Leu in CDC6 bind the same pocket on cyclin A2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4J</xref>). Thus, distinct binding modes could underlie the unusual N-terminal requirements. We probed the interdependence of preferences at P-5, P-4, and P-3 by DMS of these positions in parent peptides differing by a single residue. This revealed that large hydrophobic residues (Leu, Phe, Tyr) were strongly favored at P-5 when P-3 was Pro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4M</xref>). Testing the preferences at P-4 with or without Pro at P-3 revealed that the Pro residue reduced the usual P-4 preference for small aliphatic residues and instead imposed a weak preference for basic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4M</xref>). At P-3, Pro or Gly were favored when a Phe at P-5 was the sole hydrophobic residue but not when a Cys was available at P-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4M</xref>). Thus, the N-terminal preferences are contingent upon the available Φ<sub>N</sub> residue. The flexible positioning of the Φ<sub>N</sub> residue is comparable to that of the Φ<sub>C</sub> residue, as both allow key pocket interactions to be encoded at multiple sites within the peptide via distinct backbone conformations, which then impose unique constraints on adjacent positions.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Atypical RxL-like motifs lacking P-2 basic residues</title><p id="P22">While most cyclin binding peptides detected in the tiled library contained motifs conforming to the classical RxL consensus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>), several hits were only partial matches. The first category lacks a basic residue at P-2. For example, the cyclin A2-specific peptide from SAMHD1, a cyclin A2-Cdk2 substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup> contains an LF sequence but has a Val at P-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). Despite this, the SAMHD1 peptide bound cyclin A2 with an affinity (2.68 μM Kd) comparable to many typical RxL peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A</xref>). DMS of this SAMHD1 peptide showed that binding to cyclin A2 has an absolute requirement for the LF sequence plus distinct preferences from P-5 to P-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>). The interaction was improved by mutating the P-2 Val to Arg or Lys, which creates an RxL consensus ([RK]QLF), yet for several cyclins binding was improved to a similar or greater degree by mutations at P-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5C</xref>). This suggests that similar atypical RxL-like motifs could also be strong interactors of other cyclins and can be tighter binders than many typical RxL motifs. Interestingly, the preferred residues at P-4 for the SAMHD1 motif are similar to those of typical RxL motifs (i.e., Cys, Ala, and Val), suggesting similar binding topologies, whereas P-5 and P-3 are more restrictive than in typical RxL motifs, perhaps to compensate for the lack of Arg/Lys at P-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Using cryo-EM, we determined that the hydrophobic core (LF) of the SAMHD1 peptide contacts the cyclin A2 hydrophobic patch in a similar manner as consensus RxL motifs, and that the strongly preferred basic residues at P-5 and P-3 bind to acidic pockets distinct from the usual P-2 contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5B-G</xref>). We found a cyclin A2-binding SQLF peptide from CDAN1 via phage display screening that also bound exclusively to cyclin A2 in SIMBA experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5E</xref>). As with SAMHD1, alanine scanning of this CDAN1 peptide showed a key role for a P-3 basic residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5F</xref>). Thus, there are multiple instances of this alternative cyclin binding mode.</p><p id="P23">Several other atypical peptides were discovered that have an LxF motif but lack a basic residue at P-2, such as the QxLxF (VSAVQK<bold>L</bold>D<bold>F</bold>SDTM) and TxLxF (SDSTVTK<bold>L</bold>D<bold>F</bold>DL) peptides from PKN2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1A-B, 2E</xref>). DMS of the PKN2 QxLxF peptide revealed that cyclin B1 binding requires the LxF residues along with strong contributions from P-4 to P-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5G</xref>). As with the SAMHD1 motif, binding of cyclin B1 to the QxLxF motif was improved by replacing P-2 with Arg to create an RxLxF motif, but Cys and Met also strengthened binding to a similar degree. Notably, cyclin E1 did not bind the native QxLxF peptide but it bound strongly to the RxLxF derivative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5H</xref>). Due to higher tolerance for the lack of a basic residue at P-2 by cyclins A2 and B1 than by cyclin E1, the identity of the P-2 residue could function as a specificity filter to discriminate early and late phosphorylation in the cell cycle. We investigated six additional LxF-type peptides identified in SIMBA or phage display screens and found that three of them (from CDC42EP1, DBF4, and DNAH7) bound specifically to cyclin B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5I</xref>). Alanine scanning of these peptides confirmed the essential role of the LxF sequence and revealed the importance of Val at P-3 for binding cyclin B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5J</xref>), which it also prefers in typical RxL motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref>), as well as the role of P-4 Leu in hindering cyclin A2 binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Atypical motifs with alternative residues in the hydrophobic core positions</title><p id="P24">The final category of atypical motifs, as revealed by the DMS results, showed that the core hydrophobic Φ<sub>0</sub> and Φ<sub>C</sub> positions can tolerate atypical residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3D, 4A, S4A</xref>).

Cyclin A2 bound most of the cyclin E1 binding peptides, whereas the converse was not true, exposing a striking asymmetry in their overlap. Many peptides that exclusively bind cyclin A2 are from proteins involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, mitosis and chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7B</xref>).

Pulldown experiments with these reporters confirmed that the docking motif specificities matched those observed in SIMBA experiments: (i) a mutant control motif (AxA) did not bind any cyclins; (ii) the pan-cyclin PKN2-RxL motif bound cyclins E, A and B; (iii) the RBL1 K-3I (Lys at P-3 mutated to Ile) motif bound most strongly to cyclin E; (iv) the ORC1 motif bound exclusively to cyclin A2; and (v) the BRCA2 K-3E (Lys at P-3 mutated to Glu) bound exclusively to cyclin B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7F</xref>).

We used Phos-tag SDS-PAGE to monitor reporter phosphorylation over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S7B</xref>). With the pan-cyclin RxL (PKN2-RxL), reporter phosphorylation increased gradually from 4 to 14 hours after release, whereas the control motif (AxA) caused no change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7I</xref>). The RBL1 K-3I RxL, which binds preferably to cyclin E1 over cyclin A2, also promoted phosphorylation from 4 to 14 hours, but not as strongly as the pan-cyclin RxL. The observation that phosphorylation of the RBL1 K-3I reporter peaks after cyclin E levels decline could be due to higher expression and activity of cyclin A2-containing CDK complexes compared to cyclin E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The reporter with the cyclin A-specific ORC1 RxL showed a more abrupt increase in phosphorylation at the 14-hour time point.

As the largest unbiased and quantitative motif discovery and characterization screen performed to date for a protein family, it revealed insights into motif-binding domains that would not be otherwise accessible. Comprehensive screening of tiled peptides identified several new cyclin docking peptides in human proteins, including important cell cycle regulators such as MASTL, SGO1, and GMNC, showing that undiscovered motifs exist even for well-characterized motif families. Analysis of numerous cyclin-binding peptides revealed a broad diversity of binding strengths, and specificities ranging from a single cyclin to pan cyclin. In some cases, it is possible to speculate about potential physiological benefits of these differences. For example, cyclin-binding peptides from proteins that control DNA replication, such as ORC1, CDC6, and CDT1, show a strong preference for cyclin A2 over cyclin E1/2, potentially preventing premature phosphorylation before S phase. Similarly, the cyclin B1 specificity of the MASTL peptide could help ensure that CDK-antagonizing phosphatases are inactivated only in mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>.

Overall, our findings provide binding characteristics for many cyclin-binding motifs, allowing the development of new hypotheses and raising important research questions about their biological implications for the cell cycle community to explore.</p><p id="P30">Saturation mutagenesis of cyclin docking motifs in distinct peptide contexts provided an unprecedented depth of information into the specificity and affinity determinants for a motif binding pocket. The data demonstrate that numerous RxL binding modes exist with a surprisingly broad range of binding preferences, attributes, conformations, and surface contacts. Key findings include the unequal preferences at core positions, and the significant contribution of non-core positions to binding. The importance of the non-core positions is exemplified by the observation that less than 15% of peptides matching the canonical RxL consensus exhibited detectable cyclin binding. Unexpectedly, atypical binding determinants are common, including a newly-identified type 3 helical conformation and divergent motifs in which non-canonical residues replace the classical consensus at core positions. In most peptide contexts, cyclin specificity is not controlled by any single motif position; instead, subtle variations across the entire peptide collectively contribute to the binding outcome. For all tested peptides, the affinity can be increased by mutations, validating the expectation that motifs are optimized for biological output rather than for maximum binding strength. The diversity of binding determinants that modulate peptide recognition provides evolution with a broad sequence space that can be exploited to fine-tune cyclin binding from weak to strong and from highly selective to universal.</p><p id="P31">The identification of multiple binding peptides that do not conform to the consensus highlights the importance of moving beyond reliance on consensus motifs for defining binding requirements. Nevertheless, peptides matching the RxL consensus are the most frequently observed, prompting the question of why atypical variants are not more prevalent despite comparable binding affinities. Notably, they show stricter constraints at non-core positions, implying that the prevalence of the canonical consensus may be driven by the evolutionary likelihood of each binding mode. Within sequence space, there are numerous solutions for functional binding to a given motif-binding pocket, each with distinct binding attributes and evolvability. If a single binding mode within the relevant affinity range is more likely to evolve, it will dominate and define the consensus. As such, the motif consensus may represent an evolutionary bias rather than a biophysical preference.</p><p id="P32">In conclusion, our findings provide unique insights into the sequence features encoding motif binding, deepen our understanding of how CDK outputs fluctuate during the cell cycle and offer valuable guidance for developing therapeutic strategies targeting RxL motif-binding pockets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. The complex peptide-binding landscape uncovered here is likely to extend to other motif-binding families and our approach provides a blueprint for future studies aiming to establish general rules for motif recognition.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="P33">Although this study provides an extensive survey of the motif-mediated interactome and binding determinants of human cyclins, some relevant interactions might still have remained undetected. First, the screens did not cover the entire proteome but instead were focused on sequences within cell cycle proteins or consensus matches in the rest of the proteome, and therefore we would not have identified atypical motifs outside of the cell cycle proteins. Second, although 75% of previously validated motifs showed binding in this study, the remaining 25% were not distinguishable from background, raising the possibility that weak but functional interactions could fall outside the detection limit of our method. Finally, our approach would not capture motifs that require post-translational modification, motifs encoded by peptides longer than 16 amino acids, or motifs that require cooperative interactions involving other peptide sequences or protein partners.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Resource Availability</title><sec id="S19"><title>Lead Contact</title><p id="P34">Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by Peter Pryciak (<email>peter.pryciak@umassmed.edu</email>) and Norman Davey (<email>norman.davey@icr.ac.uk</email>).</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Materials Availability</title><p id="P35">Please contact the corresponding authors for reagents.

To calculate enrichment scores, custom Python scripts were used for the following data processing. (1) Oligonucleotides with &lt;40 reads at t0 were dropped from further analysis. (2) The frequency of each oligonucleotide within a sample at t0, t20 and t32 was calculated. (3) The log2 fold change of t20 and t32 frequencies from the t0 frequency was calculated. (4) The log2 fold change values were z-normalized within each sample. For mutational scanning library experiments, z-normalization used the mean and standard deviation of the P0 Leu mutwants; for tiled library experiments, z-normalization used the mean and standard deviation of the entire oligonucleotide population. (5) A quadratic regression (specifically, a degree 2 polynomial fit performed using numpy.polyfit) was used to correct for nonlinearity between z-scores in HsCyclin-Cln2 strains versus the unfused Cln2 strain. These corrected values are called enrichment scores. For mutational scanning libraries, this regression was performed using data from mutant RxL and LP peptides, wild-type LP peptides and STOP codon containing variants; for the tiled library, the full data set was used. (6) For each oligonucleotide, the score in the unfused Cln2 strain was subtracted from the HsCyclin-Cln2 strain score to obtain the final SIMBA score. The z-normalization and nonlinearity corrections were performed differently for data from the peptide tiling and mutational scanning experiments because in the tiling library the vast majority of variants are non-binders and thus are comparable between unfused Cln2 and HsCyclin-Cln2 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1J</xref>), whereas the mutational scanning libraries contain a large fraction of HsCyclin binding peptides. Therefore, the z-normalization and nonlinearity correction of the mutational scanning experiment data was performed using the control set variants that are expected to score identically in unfused Cln2 and HsCyclin-Cln2 strains (wild-type LP, mutant LP and mutant RxL peptides, and STOP codon containing variants). As described above, we created two distinct mutational scanning libraries that were tested in independent experiments.
