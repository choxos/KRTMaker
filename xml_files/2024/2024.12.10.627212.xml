Lr14a localized to the plasma membrane and induced CaCC in oocytes, while L362F and G768S exhibited reduced CaCC compared to wild type Lr14a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e, f</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We then asked whether Lr14a induces a calcium signal in wheat. In our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, <italic>Lr14a</italic> expression was very low or undetectable in uninfected plants but increased after infection with the avirulent <italic>P. triticina</italic> isolate 96209, reaching peak expression at 4 days post-infection (dpi), which is not observed after infection with a virulent isolate 95037. Thus, we measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in the <italic>ArinaLrFor (Lr14a</italic> near-isogenic line [NIL]) and two Arina<italic>LrFor</italic>-derived EMS loss-of-function susceptible mutants at 4 dpi with avirulent isolate 96209 using the Non-invasive Micro-test Technology (NMT).

We also analyzed Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux before and after infection. The avirulent isolate 96209-infected line exhibited higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx compared to the mock treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d, e</xref>), while the virulent isolate 95037-infected line showed no significant difference compared with the mock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Fig. 3a, b</xref>). These results suggest that avirulent isolate-induced <italic>Lr14a</italic> expression triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in wheat.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the observed Lr14a-triggered water-soaking-like phenotype might not be classical water-soaking but rather cell death, since <italic>R</italic> genes trigger host cell death to inhibit pathogen growth.</p><p id="P12">To test this, we performed a trypan blue-based staining for dead cells with <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves expressing HA-tagged Lr14a and two loss-of-function mutants, L362F and W680*. The ADR1 was used as positive control. Trypan blue staining revealed that leaves expressing Lr14a underwent cell death in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, whereas the L362F and W680* mutants showed no cell death-inducing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). However, Lr14a-induced cell death was significantly weaker than that caused by ADR1. Additionally, the cell death was only visible on abaxial leaf surface, even 10 days post-infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 4a, b</xref>), leading us to hypothesize that cell death may be restricted to the abaxial epidermis.</p><p id="P13">To test this hypothesis, we peeled the abaxial epidermis of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves three days after infiltration with Lr14a or its mutants, L362F and W680*. We then treated the epidermis with fluorescein diacetate (FDA), which specifically stains living cells. We observed that guard cells in leaves expressing Lr14a underwent cell death, as indicated by the absence of an FDA signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). In contrast, guard cells expressing the L362F and W680* mutants remained viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). FDA-stained epidermal cells were not observed in any of the datasets, likely because guard cells are more metabolically active and exhibit higher esterase activity than other epidermal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. A five-minute incubation with FDA appears sufficient for staining guard cells but may be inadequate for other epidermal cell types. We then isolated protoplasts of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> expressing Lr14a and its mutants and assessed their viability. All leaves contained healthy protoplasts, regardless of whether they expressed Lr14a, L362F, or W680* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We then performed FDA and propidium iodide (PI, stains dead cells) staining on <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> intact leaves. PI primarily stained guard cells of the leaves expressing Lr14a, while no PI signal was detected in those expressing L362F and W680* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>). In contrast, FDA staining revealed that both guard cells and surrounding epidermal cells were stained in leaves expressing L362F or W680*, whereas only the epidermal cells were stained in Lr14a-expressing leaves, with guard cells remaining unstained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). These findings suggest that Lr14a specifically induces guard cell death in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, potentially explaining the Lr14a-triggered water-soaking-like phenotype as a consequence of partial cell death in the guard cells of the abaxial epidermis.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Lr14a induces both stomatal closure and guard cell death in wheat</title><p id="P15">Based on our observations in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> and considering the important role of stomata in <italic>P. triticina</italic> penetration, we investigated Lr14-mediated stomatal behavior in Arina<italic>LrFor</italic> near-isogenic line (NIL) expressing Lr14a. Stomatal apertures were measured at 4 dpi, coinciding with the peak expression of <italic>Lr14a</italic>, with avirulent isolate 96209 and virulent isolates 95037. The abaxial epidermis of infected wheat leaves were peeled, and the stomatal apertures were quantified microscopically. The results showed that the avirulent isolate 96209 induced stomatal closure in wheat, which was significantly stronger than the induction by the virulent isolate 95037 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p><p id="P16">3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining was performed to assess the hypersensitive response (HR) of Arina<italic>LrFor</italic> after infection with avirulent and virulent isolates at 4 dpi. We quantified the percentage of DAB-stained guard cells specifically within stomata where an appressorium had formed. In leaves infected with the avirulent isolate 96209, 58 % of the guard cells were stained by DAB, which was significantly higher compared to 9 % with the virulent isolate 95037 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>).

To investigate this, we analyzed <italic>Lr14a</italic> expression in both epidermal and mesophyll cells of Arina<italic>LrFor</italic> using qRT-PCR after infection with avirulent and virulent <italic>P. triticina</italic> isolates at 4 dpi. The qPCR results showed that the avirulent isolate 96209 predominantly induced <italic>Lr14a</italic> expression in mesophyll cells, but not in epidermal cells. The <italic>Lr14a</italic> expression was low in both avirulent isolate 96209 and virulent isolate 95037 infected epidermis. Infection with the virulent isolate 95037 did not induce <italic>Lr14a</italic> expression in either mesophyll or epidermal cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>).

FDA was used as an indicator of live cells. We observed that cells expressing the reporter <italic>mRFP</italic> were also stained with FDA, indicating that no cell death occurred in either guard cells or other epidermal cells after <italic>Lr14a</italic> expression, suggesting that the Lr14a-triggered guard cell death does not depend on an epidermal expression of <italic>Lr14a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p><p id="P19">The inducible expression profile of <italic>Lr14a</italic>, its structural characteristics, including predicted transmembrane helices, and its ability to induce cell death, are reminiscent of TALE-activated executor resistance genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. To determine whether <italic>Lr14a</italic> expression in mesophyll cells is sufficient to trigger cell death as an executor <italic>R</italic> gene, we conducted a protoplast cell death assay in the wheat cultivar ‘Bobwhite S26’. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was used as a reporter gene co-expressed with the target genes to indicate cell viability. In protoplasts co-transfected with the positive control <italic>Sr50</italic> and <italic>AvrSr50</italic>, a strong reduction of YFP signal was observed, indicating cell death was triggered. In contrast, no reduction in YFP signal was detected in protoplasts transfected with <italic>Lr14a</italic>, with a comparable signal to protoplasts transformed with the empty vector (EV).

Thus, despite the abundant occurrence of leaf rust isolates virulent on <italic>Lr14a</italic>, <italic>Lr14a</italic> contributes to durable adult plant resistance in the field. It is interesting to note that calcium-permeable cation channels encoded by NLRs when combined with the ABCG transporter Lr34 also result in durable, broad-spectrum resistance: Lr34 combined with the NLR Lr13<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> confers durable leaf rust resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, whereas Lr34/Yr18 combined with Yr27 (an allelic variant of Lr13) confers durable stripe rust resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Further biochemical studies are needed to understand the molecular control of this additive, non-race specific, durable resistance involving calcium ion and other substrate fluxes at the plasma membrane. It is tempting to speculate that durable resistance results from a combination of Lr34 ABC transport activity with a calcium-permeable cation channel.</p><p id="P23">In this study, we provide new insights into plant immunity by demonstrating that the race-specific <italic>R</italic> gene <italic>Lr14a</italic> encodes a calcium transporter that specifically triggers guard cell death, potentially preventing pathogen penetration. Although recent studies have shown that NLRs and helper NLRs can act as Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to initiate host cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, none of the previously identified <italic>R</italic> genes with calcium channel activity has been specifically associated with stomatal immunity in wheat. Interestingly, Lr14a triggers only partial guard cell death at a rate of 58% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>), which is consistent with the heterogenous leaf rust infection types observed in Lr14a containing plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. We hypothesize that <italic>P. triticina</italic> can successfully penetrate through stomata at the early stage, releasing effectors into the mesophyll cells that activate Lr14a expression and initiate a resistance signaling pathway. This signaling subsequently induces guard cell death, disrupting later infections. The selective induction of guard cell death likely reflects the specialized recognition mechanisms between the stomata-targeting leaf rust pathogen and wheat. This strategy minimizes cell loss by preventing pathogen invasion without extensive mesophyll cell death, thereby conserving cellular resources.</p><p id="P24">The characteristics of Lr14a, such as its inducible expression following infection by an avirulent isolate, predicted transmembrane helices, and the ability to induce cell death, are reminiscent of transcription activator-like effector (TALE)-activated executor resistance genes. These genes confer resistance to the bacterial pathogens of the genus <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Unlike the typical interaction between an <italic>R</italic> protein and its corresponding effector protein, TALEs bind to the promoter of executor <italic>R</italic> genes, activating their expression and triggering cell death. While this mechanism was initially identified in bacteria-plant interactions, increasing evidence suggests that fungi may also secrete TALE-like effectors that trigger <italic>R</italic> gene expression. <italic>R</italic> gene expression patterns dependent on avirulent pathotypes have been observed in response to other pathogens, including the barley powdery mildew pathogen <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f. sp. <italic>hordei</italic>, the sunflower downy mildew pathogen <italic>Plasmopara halstedii</italic>, and the rice blast pathogen <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Recently, two barley leaf rust resistance genes, <italic>Rph3</italic> and <italic>Rph7</italic>, were cloned, both showing avirulent pathotype induction, suggesting that they could function as executor genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P25">Our results indicate that <italic>Lr14a</italic> may also function as an executor <italic>R</italic> gene. This suggests that <italic>P. triticina</italic> might encode a TALE-like protein that directly activates <italic>Lr14a</italic> expression or indirectly regulates its expression by targeting other transcription factors. TALEs typically contain nuclear localization signals (NLSs) for transfer into the host nucleus, a DNA-binding domain consisting of 15–20 almost identical modules that interact with the host promoter, a transcription factor binding motif domain for interaction with transcription factors, and an activation domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. These features could serve as a guide for identifying AvrLr14a.</p><p id="P26">Our expression data revealed that <italic>Lr14a</italic> was specifically induced by the avirulent isolate in mesophyll cells, while it triggered cell death in guard cells. This suggests that Lr14a-mediated calcium influx activates cell-to-cell communication, transmitting defense signals from mesophyll cells to guard cells where hypersensitive response (HR) is initiated and pathogen invasion prevented. Several studies in C3 plant species have demonstrated that signals from mesophyll cells are necessary to drive stomatal responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. Recent research has shown that various mobile molecules - such as small proteins, peptides, RNAs, metabolites, and second messengers are involved in transmitting extracellular stimuli from sensing cells to target cells (39). For instance, sucrose produced in mesophyll cells reaches the guard cell apoplast via the transpiration stream, where it is imported into guard cells by H<sup>+</sup>/sucrose symporters, regulating stomatal responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Light-regulated transcription factor HY5, located in mesophyll cells, induces the expression of mesophyll-derived peptides, which are secreted into the apoplast and recognized by receptors on stomatal precursors, ultimately controlling stomatal development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>. Auxin similarly regulates stomatal development by repressing mesophyll-derived peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a key second messenger in plant immunity, plays a pivotal role in cell-to-cell signal transduction. The ROS/Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave is considered a major mediator of signal transduction between cells and tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. Several Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, such as glutamate receptor-like channels (GLRs) and the tonoplast-localized TWO-PORE CHANNEL 1 (TPC1), have been reported to mediate long-distance signal transduction and initiate calcium-based plant defense signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Furthermore, prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx can activate metacaspases (MCs), which cleave PROPEPs to release Peps into the apoplast, where they are sensed by neighboring cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that: Lr14a-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling may promote the generation of immune-related signaling molecules, reactive oxygen species (ROS), microRNAs (miRNAs), transcription factors and peptides, delivering them to guard cells to initiate HR. Further studies should focus on identifying the linker signaling molecules associated with Lr14a that may transmit defense signals from mesophyll cells to guard cells.</p><p id="P28">Distinct from the extensive host cell death typically triggered by other <italic>R</italic> genes, the guard cell-specific death induced by Lr14a-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx presents a unique <italic>R</italic> gene function.
