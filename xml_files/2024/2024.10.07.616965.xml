Endocytosis is evolutionary conserved and utilizes similar structural folds. How these structural folds are combined into proteins and protein complexes however differs between eukaryotic kingdoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. The TPLATE complex in plants is an evolutionary ancient protein module that combines several endocytic folds into a single octameric protein complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. Its molecular architecture, lipid-nucleated condensate formation, and its requirement for clathrin cage curvature revealed its function in endocytosis initiation in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Mechanistic understanding of how this complex drives membrane deformation during plant endocytosis is, however, lacking. Here, we used an integrative structural approach to obtain a precise molecular structure of the TPLATE complex. In addition, our approach allowed visualizing the structural flexibility that hallmarks this enigmatic complex. We prove that the intrinsic structural flexibility is required for its functionality and membrane recruitment. The membrane binding interface consists of several domains with differential lipid preferences. Finally, we show that the crescent shape of the structured part of the complex is sufficient for membrane curvature generation. Our mechanistic insight answers the long-standing question of how plants execute endocytosis without cytoskeletal-based force generation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Endocytosis is an essential multi-step process in all eukaryotic cells to internalize lipids, transmembrane proteins and other cargo from the plasma membrane (PM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. While its execution shares common structural domains and even conserved adaptor protein complexes, different kingdoms mechanistically fine-tuned the process to their specific needs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Endocytosis predominantly uses the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) in combination with the scaffolding molecule clathrin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) involves condensate formation, which creates micro-environments that allow successful cargo recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> alongside clathrin recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Next to AP-2, plants require an additional adaptor protein complex called TPLATE complex (TPC) to execute endocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. TPC is evolutionary ancient, belongs to the heterotetrameric adapter complex containing a coat (HTAC-CC) family, and shares its origin with AP-2 and coat protein complex I (COPI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. Besides plants, TPC has so far only been experimentally characterized in the slime mold Dictyostelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. TPC has been lost in animals and yeasts, which explains its late discovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. TPC is an octameric complex with a molecular weight of roughly one megadalton. Several of its subunits contain a considerable percentage of intrinsic disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. It is essential for plant life as single subunit knockouts cause pollen lethality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Two of its subunits, namely AtEH1/Pan1 and AtEH2/Pan1, which both have a disordered content of more than 60 percent, form condensates and recruit both early and late endocytic players, including clathrin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. TPC is recruited to the PM as an octameric complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and features multiple membrane binding domains, as well as cargo recognition domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Initial structural insight into the arrangement of all eight subunits was achieved by integrating protein-protein interaction assays, chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), and computational modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Here, by combining electron microscopy (EM), XL-MS and computational modeling, we provide a comprehensive integrative structure of TPC, which is at par with other HTAC-CC structural models such as the COPI complex or the clathrin-AP-2 complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Our structural model visualizes the functional interplay between structured and disordered parts of TPC, describes the PM-binding interface of the complex and its domains in detail, and elucidates how the structured parts provide the force required to bend the PM.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Determining a TPC structure</title><p id="P3">To obtain the complex, TPC was purified from Arabidopsis PSB-D cell suspension cultures using tandem-affinity purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 1 a &amp; b</xref>). One TPC assembly features a net charge of -133 at physiological pH, which results from 1000 negatively and 867 positively charged residues. Together with the disordered nature of several subunits of the complex, this caused significant air - water interface problems. We could not determine a condition where these problems were mitigated and therefore this did not allow cryo EM-based visualization of the complex. However, negative stain (ns-)EM analysis presented a good particle count and distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 a</xref>). The complex displayed preferred orientations on the EM grid, resulting in a limited number of different 2D classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 1 d &amp; i</xref>).</p><p id="P4">We reconstructed 3D maps from three independent purifications in two different buffer systems. All independently reconstituted maps yielded the same dimensions, the same shape, the same resolution, the same preferred orientation and a correlation of more than 82 % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 1 c</xref>). The final map achieved an approximate resolution of 17Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Extended Data Figure 1 g</xref>). We subsequently took advantage of an integrative approach to achieve a high-resolution structure, taking into account that such an approach enables generating a more complete, accurate and precise model compared to those that are based on a single method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. To generate a structural model of TPC, we combined the map acquired by nsEM with chemical cross-link data as position restraints for the integrative modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 c &amp; f</xref>). The chemical cross-links that we used included data using an MS-cleavable cross-linker, DSSO, as well as previously published BS3 cross-linking data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 f</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. The majority of the DSSO cross-links were consistent with the BS3 dataset. However, some unique DSSO cross-links provided new connections between TPC subunits, particularly between LOLITA and the N-terminal part of TWD40-1 and between the TML μ-homology domain (μHD) and the C-terminal part of AtEH2/Pan1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 f</xref>). Highly reliable structural models of individual subunits and partial sub-complexes generated by AlphaFold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> were used as input for the well-structured parts of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1 d &amp; e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 2 a</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Integrative modeling resulted in a structural model of TPC with a precision ranging from 5 to 50 Å and with an average precision of 31.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Extended Data Figure 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 3</xref>). Including all parts of the complex in the structure-building process allowed us to analyze the precision of different TPC parts at the given resolution and positional restraints, and to identify the regions of low precision, which are likely representing flexible parts of the complex. The highly flexible parts of the complex are represented mainly by the highly disordered AtEH1/Pan1 and AtEH2/Pan1 subunits. In addition, we observed high flexibility for the TML linker region, the μHD, the SH3 domain of TASH3 and the C-terminal all-alpha domain of TWD40-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Extended Data Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, the structural model of the hexameric core of the TPC, consisting of LOLITA, TPLATE, the TASH3 trunk domain, the TML longin domain, the β-propeller domains together with the solenoid domain of the TWD40-1 and TWD40-2 subunits, displayed a high to medium precision, suggesting low flexibility within the complex. Consistently with our previous structural model of TPC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>, the complex has an overall ellipsoidal shape with the TPLATE subunit forming an interaction hub connecting many other TPC subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 g &amp; h</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To generate a model of the TPC molecular structure that was not dependent on the input data, we utilized the AlphaFold3 (AF3) server<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. The token limit only allowed modeling a truncated hexamer containing the TASH3 trunk domain, LOLITA, the TPLATE trunk domain, the TML longin domain, and the β-propeller domains, along with the solenoid domain of the TWD40-1 and TWD40-2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figure 4 a &amp; b</xref>). The resulting AF3 model of the truncated TPC hexamer closely aligns with the integrative model. However, there are clear differences in the position of the TASH3-LOLITA pair between the two models and the position of the TASH3-LOLITA pair in the AF3-generated model violated several cross-link restraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Figure 4 c</xref>). These results are in line with the limitation of artificial intelligence-based protein structure prediction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> and highlight the strength of the integrative modeling approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, it is possible that the AF3 model represents a different conformation of the complex.</p><p id="P7">The structural model that we obtained with the integrative modeling approach subsequently allowed us to compare TPC to other members of the HTAC-CC family.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>TPC is intermediate to HTAC-CC members</title><p id="P8">The heteroheptameric COPI and the heterotetrameric AP-2 complex have both been structurally resolved to the level of their vesicle coats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. ConSurf<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figure 5</xref>) revealed strong conservation of these two complexes throughout evolution, allowing us to compare the available non-plant structural models to the TPC structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The TPC structure corroborates the previous phylogenetic analysis, indicating that COPI and TPC originated from the root of the tree of the HTAC-CC family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. While both TPC and COPI have two subunits arching their core, AP-2 has lost these subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. These arching subunits between TPC and COPI are conserved down to their domain organization. They both have two N-terminal β-propeller domains followed by a large α-solenoid where they interact with each other to close the arch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 a)</xref>. Consistently with the shared evolutionary origin of the HTAC-CC family, the appendage domains of TPLATE, β-COP and AP-2β all interact with β-propeller domains. In case of TPC and COPI, the interacting β-propeller domains are provided by the arching subunits TWD40-1 and α-COP and this interaction is structurally nearly identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 b</xref>). The AP-2β appendage interacts with a β-propeller provided by clathrin heavy chain (CHC), however the mode of action of this interaction is different compared to the other complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 b</xref>). These findings support the closer relation of TPC to COPI than to AP-2. When comparing the core subunits of each complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2 c</xref>), the two large TPC subunits are positioned in an open conformation. However, this open conformation of TPC lies in between the open conformations of COPI and AP-2. COPI requires its μHD for complex polymerization in linkages II and III at the distal end of the vesicle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, while in both AP-2 and TPC this domain is essential for lipid interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. Consistently, the μHD of AP-2 is located close to the vesicle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> and previous data also positions the μHD of TPC at the membrane interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Altogether, our structural findings are, therefore, consistent with the phylogenetic analysis of the HTAC-CC family, while the role of the μHD in the different adaptor protein complexes presents an intriguing functional diversification. Since COPI and AP-2 both feature a clear membrane interacting interface, we next analyzed the TPC-membrane interaction.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Specific domains bind the membrane</title><p id="P9">To analyze the membrane binding capacity of purified TPC <italic>in vitro</italic>, we applied the complex to large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) with various lipid compositions and performed flotation assays. TPC differentially bound to vesicles with negatively charged lipids, and the strongest interaction, resulting in the lowest amount of TPC in the pellet fraction, was observed for phosphatidic acid (PA) containing vesicles. Uncharged lipids did not result in a clear interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 a</xref>). These results were confirmed via LUV tubulation experiments. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 b</xref>). LUVs without TPC did not tubulate under our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Extended Data Figure 6</xref>) and in the presence of TPC LUVs containing uncharged lipids presented nearly no tubulated vesicles. Tubulation of charged LUVs, however, correlated with TPC concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 b</xref>). Coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a proxy lipid bilayer to the plant PM confirmed our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments by showing that TPC clusters anionic phospholipids at the membrane binding interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7</xref>). MD simulations were performed with the hexameric model as the highly disordered AtEH/Pan1 subunits hampered with modeling convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 c</xref>). The hexameric model resided stably on the membrane in 4 out of 5 simulation repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7 a</xref>) with the same interaction mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7 b</xref>) corresponding to the positively charged patches on the TPC surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 c</xref>). The phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) preference of the μHD of TML was described previously by MD simulations using the separated domain, as well as by <italic>in planta</italic> experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Both EH1.1 and EH1.2 domains of the AtEH1/Pan1 subunit have a strong binding capacity for PA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. By including other subunits in MD simulations as part of the complex, we observed that, consistently with the single domain MD simulations, the TML μHD preferred PI4P. Additionally, we found that the N-terminal part of TASH3 also displayed a strong preference for PI4P. In contrast, LOLITA, TWD40-1 and TWD40-2 preferred phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3 c</xref>). The MD simulations using the hexameric complex did not identify a domain with strong interaction with phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7 c &amp; d</xref>), nor a domain with a preference for PA, indicating that the AtEH/Pan1 subunits are responsible for the observed binding to PA in our flotation assays. Next, we focused on the β-propeller domains of the TWD40-1 subunit since they indicated an uncharacterized PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> preference of the TPC.</p><p id="P10">A C-terminal GFP fusion construct of the two N-terminal β-propellers of TWD40-1 was expressed <italic>in planta</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Figure 8 a</xref>).

Interestingly, the AP-2 counterpart of TML, AP-2μ, which positions its μHD close to the membrane, also features a disordered linker connecting the two domains. This linker is considerably smaller in AP-2μ than it is in TML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Extended Data Figure 5</xref>).</p><p id="P13">To address the importance of the linker, we replaced the long linker of TML with the shorter AP-2μ linker and generated the construct TML-AP-2μ.

In GFP-trap MS experiments, all major TPC subunits were significantly enriched by both constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 c</xref>). The LOLITA subunit was underrepresented in the TML-AP2μ-GFP experiments, likely because of its small size that makes it more difficult to detect. The TML-AP-2μ-GFP bait, however, showed weaker interactions with the other complex subunits compared to the control, indicating a destabilization of TPC, similar to what we observed for the WDXM2 isoform of TPLATE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 c</xref>). To visualize TPC formation <italic>in planta</italic>, we introduced TPLATE-mSCARLET into our TML-GFP and TML-AP-2μ-GFP lines. While TML-GFP largely co-localized with TPLATE-mSCARLET, this was not the case for TML-AP-2μ-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 d</xref>) or for the rotated control images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Extended Data Figure 8 e</xref>). The discrete signals in the red and the green channel are likely attributed to either TPC containing endogenous TML or to monomeric TML membrane association, as observed before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 d</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Our combined imaging and proteomics results agree with the formation of an octameric TPC containing TML-AP-2μ-GFP in the cytosol. The flexible linker is not required for membrane recruitment of TML as a single subunit, in agreement with previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. However, it appears essential for stable PM recruitment of TPC. This would explain the reduced co-localization with other subunits at the PM. Unstable membrane recruitment is likely causal to the non-functionality of TML-AP-2μ-GFP. This is in accordance with our integrative model that visualizes the possible space the μHD of TML can occupy because of its long linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Structured domains deform the membrane</title><p id="P16">TPC is recruited to the PM as an octamer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The AtEH/Pan1 subunits remain at the PM when the TPLATE subunit of TPC is destabilized by heat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and this correlates with the formation of flat clathrin lattices instead of curved clathrin coated pits at the PM in unroofed root protoplasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Lipid-nucleated phase-separation at the PM of the AtEH/Pan1 TPC subunits serves as a dynamic recruitment platform for early and late endocytic players including clathrin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The above observations imply that AtEH/Pan1-dependent condensate formation does not suffice for initial membrane deformation. We therefore analyzed the role of the structured TPC domains in membrane deformation.</p><p id="P17">Our MD simulations using the hexamer model showed that, in 3 out of 5 simulation repeats, the TPC hexamer generated membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Extended Data Figure 7 e</xref>). To computationally test whether TPC-mediated induction of membrane curvature can lead to membrane tubulation, we utilized extensive coarse-grained MD simulations with an asymmetric membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. Prolonged membrane binding of a single TPC complex to a complex asymmetric membrane, nor the asymmetric membrane alone never resulted in the formation of a membrane tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Extended Data Figure 9 a-d</xref>). Given that the AtEH/Pan1 subunits have affinity for themselves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> and that TPC has several domains capable of lipid binding independent of the AtEH/Pan1 subunits, we assumed that TPC complexes would arrange themselves circular around a membrane-nucleated condensate formed by the AtEH subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 a-c</xref>). This would be in agreement with the model that positions TPC at the edge of a forming clathrin coated pit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, we placed 3 hexamers of TPC close to each other on a complex asymmetric membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 c</xref>).

Our model for plant CME would therefore position AtEH/Pan1-dependent condensate formation as a nucleation and recruitment module, orchestrating the association of the various players, including AP-2 and clathrin to the endocytic site. The growing pit will likely deplace TPC to the edge of the clathrin-coated pit, similar to the situation in animals with FCHo and EPS15<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>.

The assembled TPC hexamer was fitted into the nsEM map represented as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R105">39</xref></sup> using UCSF ChimeraX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R98">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R99">33</xref></sup>. Other structural parts of TPC were randomly positioned around the GMM representation of the nsEM map. 123 and 126 unique intra- and intermolecular BS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">3</xref></sup> and DSSO cross-links were used to construct the scoring function. In addition to the cross-link datasets, the excluded volume restraints, the sequence connectivity restraints and the GMM map were added to the scoring function. Replica Exchange Gibbs Monte Carlo algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R106">40</xref></sup> was used to sample structures satisfying input restraints. The sampling produced a total of 720,000 models from 24 independent runs. Models were clustered based on cross-linking and GMM agreement, sequence connectivity, excluded volume, and total score. The four-step protocol tested the top-scoring cluster for convergence, exhaustiveness, and precision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R107">41</xref></sup>. The PrISM method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R108">42</xref></sup> was used to analyze the precision of individual regions of the integrative TPC model.

Visually aligned complexes share two subunits arching the core complex. These subunits have been lost in AP-2. TWD40-1 relates to α-COP (both yellow), while TWD40-2 relates to β’-COP (both beige). The subunits are structurally conserved in their domain organization, with two N-terminal β-propellers followed by an α-solenoid that closes the arch.</p><p>b) The appendage domains of TPLATE, β-COP and AP-2β (dark blue) all interact with α-solenoids (orange) and β-propeller domains. In TPC and COPI, the two β-propeller domains (light green and yellow) originate from the arching subunits TWD40-1 and α-COP. This interaction is structurally conserved. In AP-2 the mode of interaction structurally differs and the β-propeller domain (turquoise) belongs to clathrin heavy chain. For COPI the leaf structure (PDB code 5NZR) was used.

Samples following density centrifugation were divided into top fraction (T), middle fraction (M) bottom fraction (B) and pellet (P), frac. = fraction. TPC remains in the pellet fraction (P) in LUVs consisting of uncharged lipids, indicating absence of lipid binding. LUVs containing 20 % of phosphatidic acid (PA) retain TPC in the top fraction (T), while TPC remains detectable in the pellet (P). Similar results were achieved with LUVs containing 12 % phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and 9 % phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>). TPC interacts strongest with LUVs containing PA since the complex is almost exclusively detectable in the top fraction (T). nd = not detectable.</p><p>b) LUV tubulation assay using purified TPC from Arabidopsis suspension cells, visualized by negative stain electron microscopy and quantification of the amount of tubulation observed.
