However, if and how this mark regulates RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) is not known. Here we used customized genome assemblies for rDNA to demonstrate that KMT2A and KMT2F bind to entire rDNA loci. The binding of these enzymes were mirrored by the binding of H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 marks. Using biochemical assays, we demonstrate the interaction of KMT2-specific subunits with RNA Pol I transcriptional machinery. Our findings reveal KMT2F as the primary KMT depositing the H3K4me3 on rDNA. Loss of H3K4me3 adversely affects the epigenetic landscape and promotes heterochromatization of rDNA locus. Mechanistically, we show that KMT2F promotes pre-initiation complex formation of RNA Pol I. Our findings highlights the thus far undiscovered role of H3K4me3 in the transcriptional initiation of rDNA genes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Within the cell, the intricate coordination of cellular growth and proliferation occurs through a precisely regulated series of steps called ribosome biogenesis. Deregulation within this elaborate process is associated with a diverse spectrum of human diseases including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Narla &amp; Ebert, 2010</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Dixon et al., 2007</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Ganapathi et al., 2007</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hannan et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Heiss et al. 1998</xref>). The control of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription plays a central role in the complex pathway of ribosome biogenesis. The initial and crucial regulatory stage in ribosome biogenesis occurs through the transcription of ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) by RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) within the dynamic membrane-less structure called nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Stults et al., 2008</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Hannan et al., 2013</xref>). The average diploid human genome harbours approximately 400 tandemly arranged repeats of rRNA genes, distributed across five acrocentric chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Stults et al., 2008</xref>). Each Mammalian transcription unit (43 kb), consists of a coding region spanning 13.3 kb interspaced by 30 kb intergenic spacer (IGS). The coding region is responsible for encoding the 47S pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA), which undergoes subsequent processing to yield the mature 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNA. The coding unit is flanked by the non-coding regulatory elements, promoter, and a terminator sequence in the IGS. In addition to human rDNA core or 47S promoter, the rDNA promoter contains spacer promoter which is separated by enhancer repeats and harbours essential signal sequences for transcription initiation and termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Zentner et al., 2011</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">I. Grummt, 1982</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Sollner-Webb et al., 1983</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">L. Grummt et al., 1986</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">A. Kuhn &amp;Grummt, 1987</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Labhart and Reeder 1986</xref>). The main rRNA promoter (referred to as 47S promoter from hereon) directs the pre-rRNA synthesis, while the role of spacer promoter is not clear.</p><p id="P5">The activity of RNA polymerase I is intricately regulated through interactions with numerous auxiliary factors. These factors play a crucial role in promoter recognition and contribute significantly to the processes of transcription initiation, elongation, and termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Sharifi &amp; Bierhoff, 2018</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Goodfellow &amp; Zomerdijk, 2013</xref>). One of the primary regulators of rDNA transcription is the upstream binding factor (UBF). It plays an important role in various stages of this process, including pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly, promoter escape, and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Panov et al., 2006</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Stefanovsky et al., 2006</xref>). Additional elements within the RNA polymerase I machinery, such as the Selectivity Factor 1 (SL1) complex and RNA polymerase I-specific transcription initiation factor RRN3, are crucial for facilitating the initiation of RNA polymerase I. The 300 kd SL1 complex, composed of the TATA binding protein (TBP) and four transcription-associated factors (TAFs) TAF1A/TAF<sub>I</sub>48, TAF1B/TAF<sub>I</sub>63, TAF1C/TAF<sub>I</sub>110 and TAF1D/TAF<sub>I</sub>41, serves as the foundation for the creation of a proficient initiator complex on the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Learned et al., 1985</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Eberhard et al., 1993</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Gorski et al., 2007</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Comai et al., 1994</xref>). RRN3, in turn, facilitates the recruitment of RNA Pol I to the promoter and serves as a bridge between RNA Pol I and the SL1 complex anchored at the promoter. Therefore, the SL1-RNA Pol I-RRN3 ternary complex anchors at the promoter bound by UBF, leading to the activation of rDNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Friedrich et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P6">RNA Pol I mediates its transcriptional activity at the rDNA locus by repeatedly engaging on tandem repeats of rDNA. Significantly, not all repeats exhibit transcriptional activity; nearly half of them are maintained in a transcriptionally poised state, primarily through epigenetic mechanisms like histone (H3K9me, H4K20me) or DNA methylations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McStay &amp; Grummt, 2008</xref>). The rDNA that is actively transcribed is typically linked with euchromatin, exhibiting hypomethylation of rDNA and carrying histone modifications commonly associated with gene activation, such as H3K4 methylation and H3K9 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McStay &amp; Grummt, 2008</xref>). Examination of rDNA chromatin structure through genomic analysis has unveiled the existence of H3K4 methylation marks at both rDNA promoters and intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Zentner et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, the specific role played by H3K4 methylation in the activation of rDNA transcription remains unclear. The existence of H3K4 methylation marks specifically at both promoters and intergenic regions of rDNA repeats suggests that the H3K4 lysine methyltransferase (KMT) complex could have a significant role in regulating rDNA transcription. But how this regulation is brought about by the H3K4 KMTs is not known.</p><p id="P7">H3K4 methylation is mediated by the COMPASS/Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL)/lysine methyl transferase 2 (KMT2) family of proteins. The mammalian COMPASS family consists of six members— MLL1/KMT2A, MLL2/KMT2B, MLL3/KMT2C, MLL4/KMT2D, SET1A/KMT2F and, SET1B/KMT2G — each actively engaged in complexes that include four common subunits collectively referred to as WRAD (WDR5, RBBP5, ASH2L, and DPY30), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Shilatifard, 2012</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Ernst &amp; Vakoc, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Sugeedha et al., 2021</xref>). These family members modulate transcription primarily via their Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste, Trithorax (SET) domain, though some members like KMT2A and KMT2B also possess transcriptional activation domain (TAD). Interestingly, KMT2 family members exhibit variations in their methyl transferase activity. KMT2F is the global KMT, mainly responsible for depositing H3K4me3 marks on promoters throughout the genome. KMT2A and KMT2B, on the other hand, demonstrate selective H3K4me3 activity at specific loci, such as Hox loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Li et al., 2022</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">Wu et al., 2008</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Denissov et al., 2014</xref>). Several reports suggest that H3K4 methylation deposited by the members of the COMPASS family plays an important role in facilitating the assembly of the transcription pre-initiation complex and the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) to specific gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wang et al., 2009</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lauberth et al., 2013</xref>). Recent study depleted shared subunits within the COMPASS family to show that the abrupt decrease in H3K4me3 shows no discernible effects on the transcriptional initiation of RNA Pol II; nevertheless, it leads to a widespread decrease in transcriptional output, an increase in RNA Pol II pausing, and a slowdown in elongation, underscoring the crucial role of H3K4 methylation, mediated by the KMT2 family, in modulating RNA Pol II activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">H. Wang et al., 2023</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hu et al., 2023</xref>). While there is increasing evidence supporting the role of H3K4 methylation in regulating RNA Pol II activity, the role of H3K4 methylation in connection with RNA Pol I regulation remains largely unknown.</p><p id="P8">Here, we undertook studies to understand how RNA Pol I transcription is regulated by the H3K4 KMT enzymes. We made use of customized genome assemblies for rDNA to demonstrate that KMT2A and KMT2F bind to entire rDNA loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">George et al., 2023</xref>). The binding of these enzymes correlated closely with the H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 marks. In order to demonstrate direct association, we used biochemical assays to examine the interaction between common subunit, WDR5, as well as KMT2A and KMT2F with the members of RNA Pol I machinery. Our transcriptional assays revealed reduction in rRNA levels upon depletion of KMT2 members. Through mutational analysis, we discovered that KMT2F functions through its SET domain to regulate rDNA transcription. Our knock down studies substantiated that KMT2F is the primary enzyme responsible for regulating the deposition of H3K4me3 on rDNA. Subsequently, we investigated the impact of perturbing the epigenetic landscape of rDNA, and the formation of the RNA Pol I PIC, using ChIP assays. Our findings indicate that methyltransferase activity of KMT2F is requisite for PIC formation, and ensuing transcription by RNA Pol I. Thus, our results reveal H3K4me3 mark as a key determinant in RNA Pol I PIC formation and active transcription from this locus.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>KMT2A and KMT2F bind to the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus</title><p id="P9">Nucleolus is a distinct structure and site of transcription and processing of rRNA. Proteins involved in rRNA transcription are often enriched at the nucleolus. We and others have previously reported that KMT2A localized to the nucleolus in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Karole et al., 2018</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Yano et al., 1997</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Caslini et al., 2000</xref>). We undertook further experiments here to interrogate if KMT2A has a functional role in rRNA transcription. As KMT2F is the global H3K4 KMT, we included it in our analysis here. Using immunofluorescence staining (IFS) we observed that KMT2A and KMT2F co-localized with nucleolar marker protein B23 in U-2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Specific siRNAs directed against KMT2A or KMT2F transcripts reduced nucleolar localization of both proteins confirming specificity of this localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S1A-B</xref>). We further performed IFS on various cell lines including MCF-7, HeLa and non-transformed IMR90-tert, and observed that both proteins localized to the nucleolus in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S1 C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P10">As rDNA are repetitive in nature, they have been left unannotated in most genome assemblies. However, the rDNA repeat is a large locus to be mapped with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) alone. In order to interrogate whether the KMT2 proteins bind to rDNA repeats or not, we performed paired-end chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) for KMT2A and KMT2F. The reads obtained were mapped to custom human genome assembly in which a single unit of rDNA has been added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B-C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">George et al., 2023</xref>). We included the ChIP-seq analyses of RNA Pol I largest subunit, RPA 194 (referred to as RNA Pol I in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and UBF as positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Both RNA Pol I-and UBF-bound reads mapped to the transcribing unit of rDNA as reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Zentner et al., 2011</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Herdman et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that KMT2A and KMT2F exhibited binding to the entire region of rDNA sequence including the RNA Pol I promoter, transcribed unit and the IGS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). KMT2F showed a consistent binding in the RNA Pol I transcribed unit, with distinctive peaks in the IGS whereas KMT2A bound throughout the RNA Pol I transcribed region but displayed higher peaks with continuous binding in the IGS region. To strengthen our confidence in the binding of these proteins to the rDNA locus, we utilized data from other KMT2 family-associated proteins. The WRAD complex plays a critical role in determining the binding specificity of KMT2 family members on chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bochyńska et al., 2018</xref>). For this we took the advantage of ChIP-seq data for WDR5, a common component shared by all KMT2 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>). Upon analyzing the ChIP-seq tracks, we observed significant WDR5 binding in the transcribed unit of the rDNA, along with a distinct peak in the IGS region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Since KMT2F lacks direct DNA-binding domains, it is recruited to chromatin via the WDR82 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lee &amp; Skalnik, 2008</xref>). WDR82, which uniquely binds to the KMT2F complex, was further analyzed using ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Park et al., 2022</xref>) to explore its binding pattern across the entire rDNA locus. We found that WDR82 showed higher enrichment in the transcribed unit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), consistent with KMT2F binding. Thus, our ChIP-seq data reveals subtle differences in binding of KMT2A and KMT2F at the rDNA locus.</p><p id="P11">The above results gave us confidence that the KMT2 complexes bind to rDNA. However, as rDNA genome assemblies are still evolving, we validated our findings by performing ChIP analyses using select primers spanning the entire rDNA unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Primer #1 corresponded to spacer promoter, #3 to the core 47S promoter, # 4-7 to gene body, #8 to termination repeats and #9-18 spanned the IGS as shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). We also used canonical targets as positive control (HoxA9 for KMT2A and Rad18 for KMT2F) and CD4 as negative control. We first performed ChIP with RNA Pol I and UBF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3A-B</xref>). As expected, both proteins showed highly enriched binding on the rDNA promoter and transcribed region. This binding decreased abruptly after the termination signal (primer #8; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3A-B</xref>). The results obtained here gave us confidence in our protocol and indicated that we are able to ChIP for proteins bound to rDNA successfully. We observed that in directed ChIP, KMT2A was significantly enriched at the RNA Pol I promoter and IGS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), whereas KMT2F bound primarily in the region of RNA Pol I promoter, and transcribed unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). In order to asses if the role of these proteins is cell-type specific, we performed ChIP in non-transformed IMR90-tert cells, fibroblasts isolated from normal lung tissue and immortalized using human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT). Similar to our observations made in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D-E</xref>), KMT2A displayed binding primarily at the RNA Pol I promoter and IGS, whereas KMT2F bound throughout the rDNA repeat (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3C-D</xref>). Taken together, our data indicates that KMT2A and KMT2F bind to rDNA repeat locus including the RNA Pol I promoter.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>rDNA locus is enriched for H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 mark</title><p id="P12">To understand if the binding of KMT2 proteins has a functional role on the rDNA locus, we performed similar analyses on previously published paired end ChIP-seq data sets for H3K4me2 and H3K4me3(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Liu et al. 2022</xref>). We observed that H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 marks were present on the RNA Pol I promoter and transcribed region. This binding continued in the IGS region eventually getting confined to distinct peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). When aligned together, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 peaks seemed to correlate more to KMT2F binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). Again, we validated our findings by ChIP analyses and observed consistently high enrichment of these marks on RNA Pol I promoter and IGS region in HEK293 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B-C</xref>). Consistent with the presence of these marks, H3 could be detected in the entire rDNA repeat region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>H3K4 KMT complex interacts with RNA Pol I machinery</title><p id="P13">In order to establish a regulatory role of our KMTs in RNA Pol I mediated transcription, we tested if these complex specifically interacts with RNA Pol I machinery. RNA Pol I holo-complex is composed of 14 subunits, out of which 7 are unique to RNA Pol I (hereafter called RNA Pol I specific subunits; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). These include RPA 194, RPA 116, RPA12, RPA49, RPA34, RPA43 and RPA14 (RPA 14 was discovered in yeast however it is not yet been characterized in mammals; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Viktorovskaya &amp; Schneider, 2015</xref>). The remaining subunits are shared between all RNA polymerases. We tried to express all six RNA Pol I specific subunits as N-terminal Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions in bacteria. However, technical challenges limited us to successful expression of RPA12, RPA43, RPA49, and RPA34. Interestingly, three of these subunits are classified as the peripheral subunits of RNA Pol I and have been implicated in RNA Pol I initiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kuhn et al., 2007</xref>). We tested <italic>in vitro</italic> interactions between bacterially expressed GST-tagged RNA Pol I specific subunits with bacterially expressed WDR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). We used GST-KMT2A SET domain as positive control and GST alone as negative control. We observed that WDR5 specifically interacted with RPA49 and RPA34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). As RPA49 and RPA34 showed consistent interaction with WDR5, we choose these subunits to pull down the SET-domain containing subunits of H3K4 KMT enzymes. Remarkably, GST-RPA49 and GST-RPA34 could pull-down the high molecular weight proteins KMT2A and KMT2F robustly, indicating that our proteins specifically interacted with the RNA Pol I subunits in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">In addition to the RNA Pol I enzyme, rDNA transcription requires UBF, SL1 complex and transcription initiation factor hRRN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">McStay &amp; Grummt, 2008</xref>).

In order to establish that the KMTs interact with transcription-competent RNA Pol I complex, we checked for interaction of TAF 48 and TAF 63 (subunits of SLI complex) and hRRN3, with WDR5. Consistent with our hypothesis, WDR5 interacted with SL1 complex and hRRN3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). We could further prove that KMT2A and KMT2F interacted with various components of RNA Pol I by endogenous immunoprecipitation experiments where we pulled down KMT2A or KMT2F proteins using specific antibodies and verified their interaction with RPA194, UBF and hRRN3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A</xref>).

Therefore, the 5’ETS can be used to detect the transcript level of pre-rRNA by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). We used RNAi to independently knock down KMT2A, KMT2F and WDR5 in U-2OS cells. The transcript levels of KMT2A, KMT2F and WDR5 decreased by more than 60% and we observed a corresponding decrease in the 5’ETS levels in these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4 B-D</xref>) indicating that KMT2A and KMT2F are required for rDNA transcription.</p><p id="P16">To investigate the specificity of the observed reduction of 5’ETS in KMT2A and KMT2F siRNA, we conducted complementation assays where we examined the rRNA transcripts in siRNA-treated cells that were expressing respective recombinant full-length protein.

Our data indicates that some members of the KMT2 family regulate rRNA transcription, and we have shown that KMT2F utilizes its SET domain to regulate rRNA transcripts. Further, it binds on the rDNA and interacts with RNA Pol I. To investigate the role of this protein in detail, we used shRNA mediated knock down for KMT2F as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Malik et al., 2023</xref>). Consistent with the reduced protein levels on the blots, the chromatin binding of KMT2F was drastically reduced on rDNA transcribed by RNA Pol I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6A</xref>).

In order to find out exactly what step of RNA Pol I transcription is affected; we undertook further studies. The human rDNA transcription involves following sequence: rDNA is activated when UBF binds to the RNA Pol I promoter. Then UBF recruits the SL1 complex to form the PIC at the rDNA promoter. Following this, UBF interacts with RNA Pol I through its RPA34 and RPA49 subunits, while SL1 interacts with the transcription factor RRN3. All factors bind to 47S promoter as well as spacer promoter. Once the PIC formation stabilizes RNA Pol I, RRN3 is released from the RNA Pol I complex, and RNA Pol I proceed with transcript elongation to yield 47S pre-rRNA.</p><p id="P23">In KMT2F KD, we observed that the occupancy of RNA Pol I was drastically reduced all across the transcribed region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Similarly, the binding of both SL-1 complex and RRN3 to rDNA promoter was highly reduced when compared to control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B-C</xref>). We observed a 50% decrease in UBF binding on KMT2F KD on the spacer promoter and 47S promoter, which reduced further in the body of the transcribed unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). We have shown that KMT2F deposits H3K4me3 marks to keep the rDNA open for transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Further, we observe that RNA Pol I pre-initiation complex formation is completely abrogated upon loss of KMT2F resulting in reduced rRNA transcription. Taken together, our data suggests that H3K4me3 marks deposited by KMT2F is requisite for successful PIC formation and transcription by RNA Pol I at the rDNA locus.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Recruitment of the KMT2F to the rDNA locus</title><p id="P24">KMT2F lacks the direct DNA binding domains. However, it is indirectly recruited to the chromatin through its association with various proteins. CFP1 acts as the primary targeting component for the KMT2F complex, recruiting it to CpG island promoters, while WDR82, alone or in association with other factors, targets KMT2F to transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Brown et al. 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Lee &amp; Skalnik, 2008</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Franks et al. 2017</xref>). Other recruitment pathways have been described for specific context like cell cycle-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Tyagi et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, KMT2F is engaged in multivalent interactions with the chromatin. As the presence of KMT2F on the RNA Pol I promoter, regulating the PIC formation, bears similarity to KMT2F’s binding to transcription initiation sites of RNA Pol II, we decided to explore this further. We hypothesized that the N terminal RRM (RNA recognition motif) of the KMT2F, which interacts with the WDR82, might be playing a similar role in the recruitment of the KMT2F to the rDNA locus through the WDR82 axis. To test this hypothesis, we cloned the fragment of the RRM spanning 74-172 amino acids in the SFB triple epitope vector, and ectopically expressed it in the cells. In our pull-down experiments with S-protein beads, the RRM showed association with the RNA Pol I, RRN3 and PAF-49 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S7C</xref>). As RRN3 is bound to active RNA Pol I only at the rDNA promoter, our results imply that the KMT2F may be recruited to the rDNA promoter, indirectly through WDR82.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>The catalytic activity of KMT2F is required for a stable PIC at the rDNA promoter</title><p id="P25">We have shown the detailed interaction between the KMT2F complex and various components of the RNA Pol I machinery in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. However, it remains unclear whether the direct physical interaction of KMT2F is responsible for RNA Pol I recruitment to rDNA or if this process depends on the catalytic activity of KMT2F. To investigate this, we conducted affinity pull down studies in cells ectopically expressing full length KMT2F or the catalytic dead mutant of KMT2F having a point mutation in the SET domain (KMT2F N1646A). Our S-protein pull-down assays revealed that KMT2F interacts with of RNA Pol I subunits as well as RRN3, and this interaction is unaffected with SET domain mutant KMT2F (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S7D-E</xref>). Consistent with our results in S7C, these results show that the interaction of the RNA Pol I complex with the KMT2F is independent of its catalytic activity. As PIC formation is lost upon KMT2F knock down, we reasoned that maybe its catalytic activity is required to stabilize the PIC on the rDNA promoter. Indeed, when we performed ChIP of RNA Pol I and UBF, on these cells, in background of KMT2F shRNA, the catalytic dead mutant KMT2F could not sustain PIC formation, unlike the wild type KMT2F. These results indicated that H3K4me3 deposition by KMT2F is crucial for RNA Pol I PIC formation at rDNA promoter. Further, they also indicate that KMT2F recruits and stabilizes RNA Pol I PIC formation at rDNA promoter using its catalytic activity to promote transcription of 47S rRNA.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>KMT2A and KMT2F regulate rRNA transcription synergistically</title><p id="P26">Next, we asked, if KMT2F is able to promote PIC formation at rDNA promoter, what is the requirement of KMT2A in rRNA transcription? To answer this question, we overexpressed KMT2A alone, KMT2F alone or both KMT2Aand KMT2F. We observed that overexpression of KMT2A alone resulted in a modest 2-fold increase in rRNA transcripts, while overexpression of KMT2F alone showed 10-fold increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7G</xref>). Surprisingly, co-expression of both proteins exhibited about 40-fold increase indicating that their activities are synergistic to rRNA transcription.

Our pull-down experiments demonstrated that WDR5 interacted with RNA Pol I subunits as well as with RRN3 and the SL1 complex, factors involved in transcription initiation, as well as with transcription elongation. In support of our findings, WDR5 was identified as a nucleolar protein in human proteome analysis and depletion of WDR5 has been reported to reduced rDNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Feng et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, we show that WDR5 directly interacted with RPA34 and RPA49, peripheral subunits, specific to RNA Pol I. RPA34 and RPA49 form a functional heterodimer at RNA Pol I and have been implicated in RNA Pol I transcription initiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kuhn et al., 2007</xref>). Further, they exhibit functional similarity with the TFIIE and TFIIF modules, which regulate RNA Pol II initiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jeronimo &amp; Robert, 2017</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Tsai et al., 2017</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, it is plausible that KMTs may modulate RNA Pol I transcription through these interactions. Similarly, we explored the interaction of RNA Pol I specific subunits with KMT2A and KMT2F. Our endogenous immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that both the N- and C-subunits of KMT2A, as well as KMT2F, effectively precipitated the catalytic RNA Pol I transcriptional component RPA194, as well as UBF, and RRN3. We further mapped the RNA Pol I-interaction domain to RRM of KMT2F.

The basal transcription factors typically include UBF and the SL1 complex (consisting of TBP and TAFs), which play crucial roles in rDNA transcription. Our comprehensive mapping of RNA Pol I and UBF across the human rDNA locus was consistent with their specific binding patterns across the gene body and within the promoter region reported before. Minimal mapping of RNA Pol I was observed in the IGS region, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Herdman et al., 2017</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Mars et al., 2018</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Zentner et al., 2011</xref>). Earlier research has proposed that epigenetic mechanisms play a role in regulating the transcriptional activity of rRNA genes. Specifically, histone modifications emerge as pivotal elements in mediating the regulation of rDNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">F. Yu et al., 2015</xref>). UBF exhibit a unique pattern of interaction with methylated H3K4, as its binding to rDNA locus is stimulated by H3K4me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, depletion of UBF results in decreased levels of H3K4me3 on the human rDNA promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). These studied prompted the detailed global bioinformatic analysis of the distribution pattern of histone modifications on rDNA locus. The analysis revealed the distribution of six active histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac and H3K36me3) and three repressive histone modifications (H3K9me1, H3K27me3 and H4K20me1) across the rDNA locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">Zentner et al., 2011</xref>). Given the pivotal role of KMT2 enzymes in regulating the distribution of H3K4 methylation marks across the genome, we were encouraged to unravel their direct functional significance on the regulation of rDNA locus. We choose KMT2A and KMT2F to conduct ChIP-seq analysis to delineate their distribution patterns on the rDNA locus. Our findings revealed the enrichment of both enzymes on the rDNA locus, with KMT2A exhibiting a preference for the intergenic region, while KMT2F demonstrated a nearly uniform distribution pattern in the RNA Pol I transcribed region. When we performed ChIP-seq analysis for H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, it corelated more closely with KMT2F (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). To delve deeper into the mechanistic details of how these two proteins regulate the rDNA locus, we tried to generate CRISPR-mediated knockouts of KMT2F. However, as CRISPR-mediated knock outs cells of KMT2F were not viable, we were limited to use shRNA-mediated knockdown of KMT2F. Our observations revealed active regulation of active signatures (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) following the loss of this protein. KMT2F depletion exhibited decrease in H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9ac marks and corresponding increase in H3K9me3 mark on promoter and transcribed unit. Therefore, our results reveal that KMT2F-mediated H3K4me3 deposition not only acts directly by regulating RNA Pol I PIC formation but also indirectly, by shaping the epigenetic landscape of the rDNA.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Drawing comparison between RNA Pol I or RNA Pol II transcription processes and role of KMT2F therein</title><p id="P30">Although the eukaryotic RNA polymerases differ from each other by performing a vast array of different functions, but they share structural similarities, in terms of their catalytic core and in the functional steps of the basic transcription process. For instance, despite having 14 subunits (RNA Pol I) and 12 subunits (RNA Pol II), both RNA polymerase still share 7 common subunits. Further, functional similarities, like those exemplified by the heterodimeric complex of RNA Pol I (RPA49-RPA34) functionally resembling the general transcription factor TFIIE-TFIIF modules of RNA Polymerase II, are observed. Similarly, the transcription factor TFIIB plays an analogous role as played by RNA Pol I associated factor RRN3 in transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Kuhn et.al; 2007</xref>). There are examples of factors which resemble both structurally and functionally in the other processes of the transcription like in the elongation, regulation etc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). We observe many similarities in how KMT2F engages with RNA Pol I comparable to its engagement with RNA Pol II. Although the KMT2F lacks the direct DNA binding domains, but it interacts with WDR82 or CFP1, which targets it to the chromatin through the RNA Pol II or through the CXXC of CFP1. Looking at the broad similarities in the two processes, and our results showing that KMT2F interacts with RNA Pol I components through its RRM domain, we hypothesize a parallel recruitment mechanism for KMT2F to the rDNA locus.</p><p id="P31">KMT2F plays a critical role in the global deposition of H3K4me3 marks, which have been widely observed to support transcriptional activation of RNA Pol II regulated genes. H3K4me3 contributes to the formation of the RNA Pol II PIC at active promoters. The TAF3 subunit of TFIID interacts with H3K4me3 to facilitate the recruitment of the TFIID complex, consisting of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and nearly 14 TBP associated factors (TAFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Lauberth et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, H3K4me3 mark can recruit chromatin remodelers, which maintain an open chromatin state at the gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">H. Wang &amp; Helin, 2024</xref>).

In contrast to the similarities outlined above between the two polymerase processes, these findings present a divergence; as depletion of KMT2F, or mutations in its SET domain, do not affect RNA Pol II recruitment to the chromatin. However, our results reveal that loss of KMT2F catalytic activity disrupts RNA Pol I recruitment to rDNA. Many factors may contribute to these differences. For instance, recycling and transcription re-initiation by RNA Pol I, dependence of PIC factors like UBF on H3K4 methylation, organization and accessibility of rDNA chromatin, may individually or together necessitate the presence of H3K4me3 on rDNA promoter for PIC formation. This suggests a possible co-dependence of RNA Pol I on KMT2F for proper recruitment at the rDNA, highlighting distinct roles that KMTs play in different transcriptional contexts.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Impact of KMT2F-mediated rDNA transcription on disease biology</title><p id="P33">Heterozygous loss-of-function variations in KMT2F have been associated with various pathologies, including childhood speech ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Eising et al., 2019</xref>), early-onset epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R72">X.

Schematic showing the arrangement of RNA Pol I holo complex with its associated proteins. RNA Pol I has 14 subunits, out of which 7 are shared with Pol II and Pol III while rest are unique to Pol I. Unique subunits, shown in colour. RPA190, RPA116 and RPA12 forms the catalytic core of the RNA Pol I whereas RPA34, RPA43 and RPA49 are classified as the peripheral subunits. UBF prepares the rDNA promoter for RNA Pol I docking. This is followed by binding of the SL1 complex, which consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and four transcription-associated factors (TAFs) TAF1A/TAFI48, TAF1B/TAFI63, TAF1C/TAFI110 and TAF1D/TAFI41. hRRN3 identifies and recruits free RNA Pol I to the rRNA gene promoter that is already bound by UBF and SL1 complex.
