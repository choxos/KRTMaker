To help achieve this, many bacteria utilise regulatory pathways that ensure DNA replication initiation only occurs once per cell cycle. When dysregulated, loss of DNA replication control can have severe consequences. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> it has been observed that hyper-initiation of DNA synthesis leads to pleiotropic genome instability and cell death. Therefore, targeting DNA replication initiation proteins to promote hyper-initiation may be an approach to generate novel antimicrobials. However, it is not clear whether DNA replication hyper-initiation generally inhibits bacterial proliferation, and if so, via which pathways. To address this question, we devised genetic systems to artificially induce hyper-initiation in the model organism <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and the pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. In both species, hyper-initiation elicited cellular degeneration culminating in growth inhibition by cell death. During this process in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, temporal analyses revealed the early onset of the DNA damage response, followed by membrane depolarisation and cell lysis. This phenotype could be supressed by removing pathways that repair damaged DNA, suggesting that cell death is a consequence of conflicts between DNA replication and repair. In <italic>S. aureus,</italic> cells quickly accumulated striking morphological changes associated with rapid loss of chromosomal DNA and death via a lysis-independent pathway. Moreover, inducing hyperinitiation in <italic>S. aureus</italic> was observed to decrease bacterial survival during infection of murine macrophages. Taken together, these results suggest that stimulating the initiation of bacterial DNA replication could be an alternative approach to inhibiting bacterial growth, particularly in combination with compounds that inhibit or poison DNA repair, akin to cancer therapies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">A successful cell cycle requires replication and segregation of the genome. In most cells, DNA synthesis begins at specific chromosomal loci called origins and requires accurate coordination with chromosome segregation and cell division to produce viable daughter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Importantly, while replication initiation culminates in loading of ring-shaped helicases enabling double-strand DNA unwinding prior to synthesis, the molecular mechanisms required to achieve helicase loading in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are distinct [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Therefore, the unique and essential characteristics of the bacterial DNA replication initiation pathway make it an attractive target for drug development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p id="P3">In bacteria, chromosome replication generally initiates from a single origin (<italic>oriC</italic>), where the universal prokaryotic initiator protein DnaA binds to sequence specific elements (DnaA-boxes and DnaA-trios) and unwinds the DNA duplex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], followed by recruitment and loading of helicases around single-stranded DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. During this process, DnaA activity is tightly regulated to ensure genome duplication occurs only once per cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Abnormal initiation of genome duplication can result in either replication inhibition or excessive DNA synthesis, both of which can inhibit bacterial proliferation. Intuitively, underinitiation of DNA replication produces cells that lack a copy of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. A more complex situation is observed during hyper-initiation of DNA replication. In the Gramnegative model organism <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cultured aerobically, hyper-initiation causes DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) as a result of the DNA replication machinery (replisome) encountering repair systems acting on the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. However, the lethal phenotype associated with hyper-initiation of DNA replication remains enigmatic, as suppression of cell death did not correlate with a significant decrease in DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. Moreover, it is not yet clear whether hyper-initiation of DNA replication generally inhibits bacterial proliferation, and if so, via which pathways.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we investigated the consequence of DNA replication hyper-initiation in the Gram-positive model organism <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and the pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus.</italic> In both cases hyper-initiation resulted in loss of cell viability, however the lethal phenotypes were not identical. The <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strain displayed cell elongation, DNA damage, membrane depolarisation, and eventually cell lysis. The <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain also displayed altered cell morphology with clear defects in chromosome inheritance, but here loss of cell viability occurred through a lysis-independent mechanism. Interestingly, induction of <italic>S. aureus</italic> hyper-initiation inhibited bacterial growth in a murine macrophage model, highlighting the potential of stimulating DNA replication initiation as an approach to reduce bacterial load during infection.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Reagents and growth conditions</title><p id="P6">Nutrient agar (NA; Oxoid) was used for routine selection and maintenance of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains.

This system exploits a hyperactive variant of DnaA (DnaAG154S) that causes cells to over-initiate DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. To control hyper-initiation, a variant of the regulator ParA (ParA<sup>G12V</sup>) was employed to inhibit DnaA activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. The experimental strain encodes <italic>dnaA<sup>G154S</sup></italic> at the endogenous locus (under the control of its native expression system) and <italic>parA<sup>G12V</sup></italic> at an ectopic locus (under the control of a xylose-inducible promoter). Hereafter, we will refer to this strain (<italic>dnaA<sup>G154S</sup> P<sub>xyl</sub>-parA<sup>G12V</sup></italic>) as <italic>Bs<sup>HI</sup></italic> (for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> hyper-initiation). The <italic>Bs<sup>HI</sup></italic> strain was cultured in the presence of xylose to repress hyper-initiation, followed by growth in the absence of xylose to repress and dilute ParA<sup>G12V</sup>, thereby enabling full activity of the hypermorphic DnaA<sup>G154S</sup> variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Using this system, strains were streaked onto solid growth medium with or without xylose and incubated overnight. While both wild-type and <italic>Bs<sup>HI</sup></italic> strains showed similar growth in the presence of inducer, the <italic>Bs<sup>HI</sup></italic> strain displayed a severe growth defect in the absence of xylose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). To further characterise this phenotype, cell growth in liquid media was followed over time. The results confirmed that the <italic>Bs<sup>HI</sup></italic> strain has a similar growth rate to wild-type in the presence of xylose, whereas <italic>Bs<sup>HI</sup></italic> cells could not reach the same density and appeared to lyse after ~5 hours in the absence of the inducer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P24">The impact of hyper-initiation on cell viability was quantified by growing cells in liquid medium with or without xylose, followed by aliquoting a serial dilution of each sample onto growth medium containing xylose (i.e. to repress hyper-initiation and allow growth of any viable cells).

However, by six and eight hours of growth without xylose, the <italic>Bs<sup>HI</sup></italic> strain displayed a &gt;100-fold decrease in CFU compared to both wild-type and <italic>Bs<sup>HI</sup></italic> cultured in the presence of xylose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Marker frequency analysis (MFA) was used to determine the frequency of DNA replication initiation under these experimental conditions.
