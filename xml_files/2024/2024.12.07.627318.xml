LAL deficiency (LAL-D) results in hepatosplenomegaly with extensive accumulation of CEs and TGs, and can in the most severe cases be a life-threatening condition in early infancy. Using messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for protein replacement is an innovative approach for the treatment of genetic disorders, but is challenged by a safe and efficient mRNA delivery. Here, we generated a combinatorial library of lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) for mRNA delivery and screened it <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo,</italic> which yielded a new formulation with a superior potency than an FDA-approved nanoformulation. This formulation efficiently delivered LAL mRNA and restored LAL activity in liver and spleen, mediating significant reversal of the pathological progression in an aggressive preclinical model of LAL-D. <italic>In vivo,</italic> the new formulation also promoted a more sustained and quantitatively higher LAL expression. In addition, repeated administration regimen mitigated hepatosplenomegaly, and targeted lipidomic analysis revealed strong diminution of CEs and TGs and of toxic lipid species in the liver and spleen. Transcriptomic analysis showed significant attenuation of inflammatory processes, fibrosis and several pathological pathways associated to LAL-D. These findings provide strong evidence that the intracellular production of LAL via mRNA-LNP is a very promising approach for the chronic treatment of LAL-D and support the clinical translation of mRNA therapy to overcome the challenges associated with traditional enzyme replacement therapies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency (LAL-D) combines rare autosomal recessive genetic disorders caused by the complete absence or insufficient LAL activity in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Mutations in the lipase A (<italic>LIPA</italic>) gene lead to impaired hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters (CEs) and triglycerides (TGs) in the lysosomes, provoking lipid accumulation in affected organs such as the liver and spleen, which in turn result in the development of severe pathological manifestations known as Wolman disease (WD) and CE storage disease (CESD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). WD is a devastating condition that manifests already in infants and is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, progressive liver failure, cachexia, and steatorrhea. These symptoms collectively impair the patients’ ability to thrive and result in mortality within the first 6 months of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). In contrast, residual LAL activity of 1-12% in CESD patients results in a less severe form and a later onset, with patients reaching adulthood but exhibiting accelerated atherosclerosis, high risk of cardiac diseases, liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The liver of LAL-D patients is characterized by marked microvesicular steatosis in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, elevated fibrosis deposits and cirrhosis as the disease progresses, making the liver the primary target organ for the treatment strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Multiple therapeutic strategies for the treatment of LAL-D have been investigated, with approaches varying depending on the severity of the disease. However, the majority of the clinical outcomes reported poorly favorable outcomes. Statins have been tested for late-onset LAL-D to reduce endogenous cholesterol production and cumulative cholesterol burden, though their efficacy and tolerability in clinical trials have been limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a human LAL enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) (Sebelipase alfa, Kanuma®). However, certain cases reported the development of anti-drug antibodies, particularly in patients with early-onset disease, requiring the adjustment of the dosage regimen or dose escalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). In addition, liver transplantation and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation have been used as a treatment option, mostly with poor outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Therefore, the pursuit of more efficient and better-tolerated therapies represents a crucial avenue to achieve optimal treatment of LAL-D patients and innovative gene- and cell-based therapies may be a viable approach.</p><p id="P4">Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) therapies have emerged as a promising approach for treating protein deficiencies. However, their development has been impeded by the challenge of achieving effective and safe <italic>in vivo</italic> delivery systems, for which lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) offer the ideal solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). LNPs are generally generated with a four-component lipid system building a vast chemical space to optimize the formulation and promote most favorable biodistribution and mRNA-induced protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Here, we assessed the potential of mRNA-LNP therapy to reverse the pathological process of LAL-D in a highly relevant preclinical model. We first generated an <italic>in vitro</italic> LAL-deficient model to screen a combinatorial library of mRNA-LNP formulations and select formulations with the highest ability to promote mRNA-induced LAL restoration. <italic>In vivo</italic> evaluation yielded a formulation that demonstrated effective mRNA delivery and protein expression in a LAL-deficient (LAL<sup>−/−</sup>) mouse model. Importantly, given the chronic nature of the condition, lipidomic analysis and RNA sequencing showed that long-term administration of the formulation could reduce the accumulation of lipids in the liver and the spleen, and mitigates the inflammatory processes and fibrosis in the liver.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Development of siRNA-mediated LAL knockdown model for <italic>in vitro</italic> screening of mRNA-LNPs library</title><p id="P5">Short interfering RNA (siRNA) technology was utilized to mediate a knockdown (KD) of LAL at the mRNA and protein level in an immortalized hepatocyte cell line (HepG2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). As the 3’UTR is specific to the endogenous <italic>LIPA</italic> mRNA and not to the exogenous mRNA sequence encapsulated in the LNPs, two siRNA sequences targeting this region were designed and tested. To thoroughly characterize KD efficiency, <italic>LIPA</italic> mRNA levels were assessed by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), LAL enzymatic activity was measured with a modified fluorescence assay using the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate (4-MUO), and protein levels were visualized by immunoblotting. Given the transient nature of the siRNA-mediated KD, a kinetic evaluation was performed to evaluate its persistence over time. KD of 92% and 93% at the mRNA levels was achieved three days post-administration with siLIPA1 and siLIPA2, respectively, compared to the control non-targeting siRNA (siCtl), and remained between 75% and 90% during the assessed period of fifteen days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similarly, a drastic decrease in LAL activity between 81% and 85% persisted with no difference between both siRNA sequences. Additionally, the absence of LAL protein expression by immunoblotting confirmed the robust and stable protein KD induced by siLIPA1 and siLIPA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Although cell counts of HepG2 cells treated with siLIPA1 and siLIPA2 showed reduced proliferation three days post-transfection, no differences between the three conditions were observed at subsequent time points, demonstrating that cell viability was maintained despite potent <italic>LIPA</italic> KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Since LAL is responsible for neutral lipid degradation in the lysosome, we investigated intracellular lipid accumulation. Nile red staining revealed a more intense signal in siRNA-treated cells than in those treated with siCtl three days post-transfection, indicative of a LAL-deficient phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1E and 1F</xref>). Although there were no statistical differences between siLIPA1 and siLIPA2 in the KD-induced lipid accumulation, siLIPA2 exhibited a stronger KD at the mRNA level, and thus was selected for the following experiments. Overall, the generated siRNA-mediated <italic>LIPA</italic> KD led to a marked reduction in <italic>LIPA</italic> mRNA expression and LAL protein expression and activity, with viable HepG2 cells suitable for <italic>in vitro</italic> screening of mRNA-LNPs.</p><p id="P7">Next, we designed the <italic>LIPA</italic> mRNA sequence to be encapsulated into LNPs based on the human <italic>LIPA (</italic>h<italic>LIPA)</italic> sequence (NCBI, NM001127605.3) and added a C-terminal FLAG-tag to distinguish exogenous from endogenous <italic>LIPA</italic> in subsequent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). A rescue experiment was conducted with lipofectamine-based h<italic>LIPA</italic> mRNA-lipoplexes and the restoration of h<italic>LIPA</italic> mRNA and LAL activity was assessed over time. A primer pair specific to the FLAG-tag sequence allowed the evaluation of the intracellular delivery of exogenous h<italic>LIPA</italic> mRNA in HepG2, which peaked at 8 hours post-transfection, followed by a pronounced decline after 24 hours with a substantial amount of <italic>hLIPA</italic> mRNA remaining after 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). Interestingly, recovery of LAL activity showed a different profile, with a peak at 16 hours post-transfection, followed by a decrease with no activity measured after 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>), which was corroborated by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>) and confirmed the effective rescue of LAL in the KD model.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Identification of hit formulations by <italic>in vitro</italic> screening of mRNA-LNPs library</title><p id="P8">LNPs are composed of four lipid components, namely the ionizable lipid, the helper lipid (phospholipid), cholesterol and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). To build the library, we selected distinct lipids with established mRNA delivery potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Dlin-MC3-DMA is the ionizable lipid of the siRNA-based approved drug Onpattro® and has been extensively used for siRNA, mRNA, and plasmid DNA delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). The ionizable lipid 5A2-SC8 has been described for efficient delivery of siRNA and mRNA in preclinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). While MC3 is commercially available, 5A2-SC8 was synthesized and characterized as a dendrimer-based ionizable lipid after purification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2-S4</xref>). Phospholipids have been selected based on their variation in the headgroup composition and degree of aliphatic chain saturation, since these features have been proven to impact the efficacy of nucleic acid delivery of the formulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>). We included 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) as phospholipids with unsaturated aliphatic chain and distinct headgroups. 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) present in Onpattro®, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and hydrogenated soy L-α-phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) are all choline-based phospholipids with various alkyl chain length. By combining different lipids and varying their molar ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), a library including 53 mRNA-LNPs was constructed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Reproducible and standardized production of mRNA-LNPs was achieved by a customized microfluidic system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>), enabling precise monitoring of the pressure and flow rate in a linear correlation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2, Figure S5</xref>). To optimize the mixing output, the flow rate was gradually increased to produce particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of 100 ± 10 nm and a polydispersity index (PDI) of ≤ 0.2, demonstrating the homogeneity of the particle population and high encapsulation efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). Previous middle and high throughput screenings of LNP libraries typically did not include physicochemical properties of LNPs, but rather conducted directly the screening process with little knowledge of the individual size and encapsulation levels of the LNPs. Therefore, we sought to characterize the physicochemical properties of the LNP library by size, encapsulation efficiency, and charge to identify potential differences associated with the choice of lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2D, 2E, 2F</xref>). No significant trend in the physicochemical properties was observed, which may be attributed to the highly standardized mixing procedure. Based on the appropriate size (≤ 100 nm) and optimal encapsulation efficiency (≥85%), we selected a set of 14 formulations for <italic>in vitro</italic> screening. Prior to this, a dose-response study performed with the standard formulation F01 (based on Onpattro<sup>®</sup>) defined the optimal dosage for the screening process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S7</xref>). At a dose of ≥1.0 μg of <italic>hLIPA</italic> mRNA, mRNA-induced LAL expression and activity was decreased, suggesting that maximal delivery was attained, as evidenced by immunoblots. Since a strong restoration of LAL activity was already achieved at a dosage of 0.5 μg <italic>hLIPA</italic> mRNA, this dose was chosen for subsequent <italic>in vitro</italic> screening experiments. Kinetic evaluation of intracellular delivery of <italic>hLIPA</italic> mRNA showed an increase, reaching a plateau 24 hours post-transfection, while the mRNA amount in the medium inversely decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>). Consequently, we performed the <italic>in vitro</italic> screening with 0.5 μg and harvested the cells 24 hours post-transfection.</p><p id="P10">The <italic>in vitro</italic> screening of the selected 14 formulations revealed that the LNP composition in ionizable lipids and phospholipids considerably impacted the potency of the LNPs in restoring LAL activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Notably, a dramatic decrease of the enzymatic activity was observed in the 5A2-SC8-based formulations comprising DMPC (F45) and HSPC (F50, F53), compared to DSPC (F27). Similarly, DLin-MC3-DMA-based LNPs tend to profit from the phospholipid DSPC at a molar ratio of 10. From this screening, a formulation (F23) containing the helper lipid DPPC displayed significant superiority compared to the standard Onpattro® formulation (displayed as F01). In contrast, DPPC had a negative effect when associated with the ionizable lipid 5A2-SC8 (F41), demonstrating that an ideal phospholipid combination depends on the ionizable lipid and its molar ratio. In general, LNPs containing the ionizable lipid DLin-MC3-DMA demonstrated superior performance, with five formulations being able to restore 50% of the basal activity (F01, F12, F20, F23, and F46) compared to two formulations containing 5A2-SC8 (F27 and F30).</p><p id="P11">Next, we evaluated the kinetics of mRNA delivery by qPCR and the extent of mRNA-induced recovery of LAL activity after a single transfection with the control F01 and five formulations displaying high, middle, and low levels of LAL restoration. mRNA delivery was comparable between the formulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H</xref>), but F23 demonstrated a superior and more sustained mRNA-induced LAL activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2I</xref>). Formulations containing 5A2-SC8 as an ionizable lipid were comparable to MC3-based LNPs, but showed a delayed peak in protein expression. Most strikingly, F50, which failed to induce substantial protein expression 24 hours post-transfection, showed a pronounced LAL restoration with a peak at 32 hours and a more sustained expression profile over time, resulting in an increased and higher area under the curve (AUC) than F30 and F46, but not F27 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S3</xref>). Any observed differences were not biased by potential cytotoxicity of the formulations, as cell viability was unaltered by all tested LNPs at 0.5 μg mRNA (&lt; 100 μg/mL lipids) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S9</xref>). Based on the <italic>in vitro</italic> screening results, four formulations (F01, F23, F27, and F50) with the highest recovery of LAL activity and AUC in the KD model were selected for <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><italic>In vivo</italic> evaluation in healthy mice identified a novel formulation with favorable biodistribution and high mRNA-induced LAL activity</title><p id="P12">Having selected the most promising formulations <italic>in vitro</italic>, we next assessed their biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, <italic>hLIPA</italic> mRNA delivery, and LAL protein expression in healthy mice. The biodistribution study of fluorescently labeled LNPs showed favorable accumulation in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the spleen for all formulations, since these organs are the primary filtration sites of LNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Although previous studies have shown the distribution of 5A2-SC8 in splenic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>), we observed that LNPs with the ionizable lipid 5A2-SC8 exhibited a more pronounced accumulation in the spleen than MC3-based LNPs. RT-qPCR analysis of FLAG-tagged h<italic>LIPA</italic> mRNA revealed a pronounced accumulation in the liver and spleen, with higher levels being delivered by F27 and F50 in the latter and almost no exogenous h<italic>LIPA</italic> mRNA delivered to the lungs, corroborating the biodistribution profile obtained with fluorescently labeled LNPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S10</xref>). The pharmacokinetic analysis of the formulations showed comparable profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters, with F23 having the largest AUC compared to all other formulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We then examined the ability of the formulations to deliver h<italic>LIPA</italic> mRNA to the liver and the spleen and to promote LAL activity following a single-dose administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). Because commonly used fluorescence or radiolabeling methods do not allow quantitative assessment of mRNA in an organ, we quantified the amount of encapsulated h<italic>LIPA</italic> mRNA delivered to the tissues at the different time points by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S12</xref>), as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). Two hours post-administration, 14 ± 2.3% of the total mRNA administered in F01 was found in the liver, with a gradual decrease to &lt; 0.003 ± 0.0001% at 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Similar to the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, all formulations had comparable capacity to deliver h<italic>LIPA</italic> mRNA to the liver. In contrast, the <italic>hLIPA</italic> mRNA-induced LAL activity by F23, demonstrated again superior activity in liver tissue compared to all other formulations at all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3E</xref>). In the spleen, the remaining fraction of the dose at 2-hours post-administration was ~ 10- to 20-fold lower, indicating that the majority of the administered mRNA is filtered in the hepatic tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). h<italic>LIPA</italic> mRNA-induced LAL activity in the spleen was higher for the formulations F27 and F50 compared to F01 at 8- and 24-hours post-administration, however, the AUC was not significantly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S4</xref>). Overall, F23 yielded the highest LAL activity in the liver with a 2.4-fold increase in the hepatic AUC compared to all formulations, along with comparable AUC in the spleen, which established F23 as the best lead in the library.</p><p id="P14">Next, we pursued to understand the underlying mechanism of F23 superiority, focusing on the endosomal escape, which is thought to drive the efficacy of LNPs to promote mRNA-induced protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). To this end, we established a cell-based fluorescent model previously described, expressing galectin-8 fused with a green fluorescent protein (Gal8-GFP) to monitor the endosomal escape of LNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Live confocal imaging enabled the visualization of the Gal8-GFP signal, indicative of successful endosomal escape, Cy5-labeled mRNA to track the intracellular delivery, and Hoechst to visualize cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>). By tracking only the Cy5 channel, we validated similar internalization profiles between F23 and F01, and any differences in the Gal8-GFP signal can be attributed solely to endosomal escape of the LNPs and not to the variation in delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>). Up to 8 hours post-transfection, endosomal escape was comparable between both formulations. After that, the Gal8-GFP profiles diverged, with a stronger signal present in the cells treated with F23 compared to F01, suggesting a higher capability of F23 to escape the endosome and more efficiently deliver mRNA into the cytoplasm.</p><p id="P15">Hepatocytes, resident liver macrophages (Kupffer cells), and other liver cell subtypes are largely involved in the development of hepatic steatosis, lipid metabolism, and inflammation and thus play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of LAL-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). Using Cy5-labeled <italic>hLIPA</italic> mRNA and flow cytometry, we determined the percentage of transfection of F23 in various liver cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S13</xref>). Endothelial cells exhibited the highest transfection efficiency (85%), followed by hepatocytes (76%) and Kupffer cells (44%), indicating that F23 was able to transfect the hepatic cell types crucial for a successful treatment of LAL-D.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>F23 formulation promotes superior mRNA-induced LAL restoration in LAL<sup>−/−</sup> mice and mitigates hepatosplenomegaly</title><p id="P16">Having selected F23 as the best-performing formulation, we next evaluated its capacity to deliver <italic>hLIPA</italic> mRNA and to restore LAL activity in in LAL knockout (LAL<sup>−/−</sup>) mice, a preclinical model of LAL-D. In general, LAL<sup>−/−</sup> mice display biochemical and histopathological features of WD but resemble the CESD phenotype with a median life span of one year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). LAL-D manifests already during fetal development with massive neutral lipid accumulation in the liver and spleen.

While no significant difference in the mRNA delivery to the spleen was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>), the recovery of the LAL activity in the spleen was surpassing that in the liver, reaching almost 20% of WT levels 48 hours post-administration for the F23 formulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>).

LAL<sup>−/−</sup>+Blank showed marked hepatosplenomegaly with an average of 2.8-fold increase in liver and 2.3-fold in spleen weight compared to the WT+Blank-treated mice. F23 treatment markedly reduced these increases by 25-35% and 30-47% for the liver and spleen, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4J and 4K</xref>). It is worth mentioning that fortuitous initiation of the F23-treatment of a single male mouse (ID 0629) at 9 weeks of age failed to show improvement, indicating that early initiation of mRNA-based treatment is of paramount importance for positive outcome. Interestingly, a sex-based analysis between the groups revealed that F23 treatment of female LAL<sup>−/−</sup> mice led to an almost complete normalization of the spleen and a more pronounced decrease in liver weights than in males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S15</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>F23 formulation reduces accumulation of neutral lipids in LAL / mice</title><p id="P18">Tissue morphology and neutral lipid accumulation in the liver and spleen were visualized by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and Oil Red O (ORO) staining, respectively.

Interestingly, PLs and FFAs did not exhibit a noticeable increase despite the long-term injections of LNPs, indicating that the PLs contained in the LNP formulations did not affect the overall lipid load and were safely mobilized and metabolized by the cells. The most enriched CE species in the liver included oleic acid (C18:1n9), linoleic acid (C18:2n6), palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1n7), and α-linolenic acid (C18:3n3), which were all significantly diminished by F23 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5H</xref>). The most abundant TG species C18:1n9, C18:2n6, and C16:0 were also significantly reduced by F23. Comparison of the spleen and liver volcano plot analyses revealed that the average of log<sub>2</sub> fold change value in the spleen was higher for both CEs and TGs, showing again the stronger effect of F23 in the splenic tissue with seven CE species and six TG species which were strongly reduced in the spleen following F23 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5I</xref>). Akin to the liver, C18:1n9, C16:0, and C18:2n6 were the lipid species with the highest accumulation in the spleen and were all significantly reduced by F23 administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5J</xref>).

Of note, the score plot segregated mouse (0629) with later-onset treatment within the untreated cluster.

Interestingly, the main altered pathways that emerged from the analysis were not primarily related to CE or TG metabolism, but rather to the immune system and inflammation, highlighting the important role of LAL in various pathological metabolic pathways. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S20</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>) of down-regulated gene sets (enriched in WT+Blank) identified bile and fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid ß-oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation, which were all partially restored by F23 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). Enrichment analysis of up-regulated gene sets (enriched in LAL<sup>−/−</sup>+Blank) included immune system, inflammatory response, collagen formation and fibrosis, cholesterol homeostasis, and AA metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). F23 treatment of LAL<sup>−/−</sup> mice led to a reduction in these gene sets, notably in the fibrosis pathway, for which the enrichment yielded the highest score. Sirius red staining confirmed reduced pericellular and periportal fibrosis (Metavir F2-equivalent), which was limited to the perivenular area with mild deposition surrounding the clusters (Metavir F1-equivalent) in liver sections of LAL<sup>−/−</sup> mice following F23 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>). Pale red staining, indicative of hepatocyte collapse/necrosis, was more prominent in the LAL<sup>−/−</sup>+Blank than in the F23-treated LAL<sup>−/−</sup> mice.

Over the past decades, several approaches have been clinically tested for the treatment of LAL-D, including reduction of the systemic cholesterol burden with statins and transplantation of liver or HSCs, and the most recent, ERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>).

In a recent study, a <italic>hLIPA-</italic> expressing adeno-associated virus (AAV) treatment was able to restore LAL activity in LAL<sup>−/−</sup> mice. However, gene expression gradually decreased over time, thus requiring re-administration that remains a challenge in AAV-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Here, we described the development of an mRNA-based therapeutic approach to mediate intracellular production and restoration of LAL activity. Since LAL-D is a chronic condition with continuous and substantial accumulation of substrates within lysosomes, safe and efficient delivery of h<italic>LIPA</italic> mRNA to the target organ is of paramount importance to achieve sufficient enzymatic LAL activity and mitigate the pathological progression. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> screening of our mRNA-LNP library identified F23 as novel formulation with superior recovery of LAL activity than the FDA-approved control formulation (F01), highlighting the importance of LNP optimization. While numerous studies focused on the modification of the ionizable lipids in LNPs, our screening data showed that largely underexplored alterations of the molar ratio and PL composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>) significantly impact potency of the formulation to induce LAL activity, but not the efficacy of mRNA delivery to the cells. Furthermore, the discrepancy found between mRNA delivery and mRNA-induced LAL activity suggests a lack of direct correlation between these two processes, underlining endosomal escape as the key element that defines efficient protein expression, as indicated by the Gal8-GFP experiments. Previous studies using recombinant human LAL produced in different expression systems emphasize crucial involvement of mannose-phosphate receptors in lysosomal protein internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>). A sufficient expression of the receptors at the cell surface is thus indispensable for efficient enzyme internalization, which may limit the efficacy of ERT approaches. In contrast, F23 is able to transfect the main hepatic cell types independently of the mannose-phosphate receptor expression on the cell surface, but mainly through endocytotic internalization of entire mRNA-LNP particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). This illustrates an additional advantage of mRNA-LNPs that may expand its therapeutic potential beyond the limitations of ERT.</p><p id="P26">Long-term administration of F23 significantly reduced hepatosplenomegaly in LAL<sup>−/−</sup> mice, but similar to previous ERT-based studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), failed to induce improvement in body weight gain. These data suggest that the overall body weight is likely associated with extra-hepatic consequences of LAL-D pathology and a systemic dysregulation of energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>) that requires further studies. Comparable to ERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), a more pronounced weight reduction was observed for the spleen, despite a 12-fold lower mRNA delivery compared to the liver. Considering that impaired lysosomal lipid catabolism in LAL-D leads to a massive substrate deposition mostly in the liver, unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum stress described in other fatty liver diseases and/or inefficient lysosomal acidification may prevent more favorable hepatic outcomes compared to the less affected spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). Splenocytes may process mRNA more effectively to produce LAL, ultimately recovering faster from the pathological progression of LAL-D. Timely intervention is critical for therapeutic efficacy due to the early onset and rapid progression of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), as also evidenced by the lack of effect in the current study in the single LAL<sup>−/−</sup> mouse with late treatment initiation.</p><p id="P27">Whereas previous studies of ERT and AAV gene-based treatments in LAL<sup>−/−</sup> mice generally described the overall reduction of total cholesterol and TG burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>), we presented for the first time lipidome analysis of liver and spleen from LAL<sup>−/−</sup> mice and their changes induced by mRNA-LNP intervention. We observed the greatest hepatic lipid accumulation in the CE fraction of LAL<sup>−/−</sup> livers with a drastic 150-fold increase, whereas TGs were elevated only 2-fold. These changes are in accordance with TG and total cholesterol concentrations in the liver of 4-week-old LAL<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) as well as adult fed and fasted LAL<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>), emphasizing the crucial role of LAL particularly in CE metabolism. CEs and TGs were largely enriched with saturated (C18:0, C16:0) and unsaturated (C18:2n6, C18:1n9, C16:1n7) FAs, all of which have been previously associated with pro-apoptotic properties and involvement in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). The significant reduction in accumulation of these lipotoxic lipids by F23 administration and the concomitant decline in n-6 unsaturated FA and AA concentrations suggests a pronounced hepatoprotective effect promoted by regaining LAL activity.</p><p id="P28">At the transcript level, F23 improved several hepatic pathways by alleviating LAL-D-associated pathological changes in gene expression profiles. The restored expression of genes involved in ß-oxidation suggests that the hepatic cells regained the ability to metabolize the FAs generated by LAL-mediated lipid hydrolysis. Consistent with these findings, the moderate but significant increase of PLs and FAs in the liver indicates that FAs are indeed mobilized by LAL, but concomitant rescue of FA ß-oxidation limits the accumulation of its lipotoxic by-products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). These lipidomic and transcriptomic profiles have shown that LAL and its hydrolytic products are key regulators of numerous pathways and homeostatic processes and that their reactivation by mRNA-LNPs represents a promising possibility for future therapeutic avenues.</p><p id="P29">Some limitations of our study, however, need to be mentioned. First, LAL<sup>−/−</sup> mice are a genetic model of WD and a pathological model of CESD, so unlike WD patients, they do not suffer from early lethality. Second, due to the degradation of transfectants by phagocytes, a more comprehensive evaluation of the dosage, dosing interval, and duration of treatment needs to be performed, as these factors strongly affect the efficacy of gene therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>). Third, the lack of body weight gain after administration of mRNA-LNPs and other treatment modalities, including ERT and AAV-based approaches, highlights the great need for a better understanding of the systemic, intestinal, or other extrahepatic mechanisms that drive this pathologic trait of LAL<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>).</p><p id="P30">In summary, our study showed that the development and optimization of mRNA-LNP from a combinatorial library yielded a formulation capable of safely and efficiently delivering mRNA encoding LAL to partially restore its function <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in target organs.
