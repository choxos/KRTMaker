However, several questions on the mechanistic links between shape and function remain unanswered. Here, we developed an efficient protocol to generate pure populations of morphologically distinct human astrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>, which we used for a systematic analysis of shape-function relationships. We performed a structural, molecular, and functional characterization of these populations and highlighted how their distinct morphologies mirror distinct functional and transcriptional patterns at the population level. We were also able to both correlate gene expression profiles of these morphologically distinct astrocyte subtypes with <italic>in vivo</italic> astrocytes in the human brain, and to validate our findings with primary isolated murine astrocytes in vitro. Moreover, we show that the observed morphological differences are correlated with changes in key cytoskeletal proteins, which offers a potential link to the observed functional differences. Finally, we demonstrated that different morphological subtypes of astrocytes have distinct reactivity responses to a common stimulus. This study offers a glimpse into the shape-function dynamics of human astrocytes, highlighting potential mechanistic links between cytoskeletal usage and astrocyte function, while also providing tools and datasets that will be useful for further studies into human glial biology in health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>astrocytes</kwd><kwd>glial cell biology</kwd><kwd>cellular shape</kwd><kwd><italic>in vitro</italic> modelling</kwd><kwd>iPSCs</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Every cell is configured to acquire an optimal shape which is tailored to its specific function and tasks within an organism or tissue.

This link between shape and function is a fundamental aspect of cellular biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>, and has profound implications in our understanding of pathological mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Moreover, this is a dynamic relationship, as morphology can change not only across cell types, but also over space and time; different subtypes of the same cell populations can vary widely depending on their regional specification, like neurons and muscle cells, and their shape can change significantly in response to different stimuli and conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup> have a highly ramified morphology, that changes across each regional and functional subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. These glial cells play a crucial role in the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, and their diversity of form allows them to perform a plethora of key functions: tiling the brain and spinal cord in vast astrocytic networks, contacting other cell types, sensing and responding to their local microenvironment, and even acting as master regulators of metabolism for the brain and spinal cord<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. The complexity of astrocyte morphology dynamically responds to injury, inflammation, and various neurological disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. The observed correlations between altered astrocyte shape and pathological processes and the mechanisms underlying astrocyte shape changes in neurodegenerative disorders remain poorly understood.</p><p id="P5">Recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation and screening <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, and organoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> have provided a plethora of ways to more accurately model human astrocytes in health and disease. These improvements have been critical for understanding the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. However, lots of unanswered questions remain on how astrocyte morphology is determined, as <italic>in vitro</italic> astrocytes often lack the distinctive complexity of their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, and in some protocols the cultures present high morphological variability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Some of these limitations are partly due to the low efficiency of astrocyte differentiation protocols, which often use undefined factors (e.g. serum), or mixes of cytokines and growth factors with diverging effects (e.g. epidermal growth factor [EGF], fibroblastic growth factor-2 [FGF2], bone morphogenic [BMP4], ciliary neurotrophic factor [CNTF]).</p><p id="P6">In response to these challenges, we developed a highly efficient, chemically defined protocol to generate pure populations of functional astrocytes from human iPSC cultures, in a reliable and scalable manner. Our approach uses a minimal set of cytokines, optimised to generate distinct morphological subtypes of astrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. This system allowed us to obtain pure populations of human astrocytes with distinct morphologies, which we characterised at the population, cellular, and subcellular level, demonstrating that morphology correlates with subtle differences in functionality, as well as distinct transcriptional profiles.</p><p id="P7">These insights will be key to both enhance our understanding of mechanisms underlying astrocyte functionality and better model disease <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>BMP4 and CNTF based differentiation produces human astrocytes with distinct morphologies</title><p id="P8">To investigate the links between morphology and function in human astrocytes we first sought to establish a reproducible protocol that would generate astrocytes with distinct morphologies in a controlled fashion, starting from common glial progenitors.</p><p id="P9">We adapted a previously developed protocol to derive progenitor cells committed to the astrocytic fate (astrocyte progenitor cells, APCs) starting from iPSC populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). These APCs are derived in completely defined conditions and can be propagated as homogeneous monolayers for several passages in a combination of FGF2 and EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), offering an ideal system for large scale studies. These astrocyte progenitors express <italic>NES</italic> (Nestin) and <italic>NF1A</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), and importantly, once expanded, can be differentiated into high purity (&gt;95%) astrocytes that retain important astrocyte functions (e.g. glutamate uptake, ability to support synaptogenesis). These and have already been employed to assess different disease phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, demonstrating that they can mimic several aspects of astrocyte biology. Using this system, we initially aimed to test whether exposing the same population of iPSC-derived APCs to known astrogenic factors might produce morphologically distinct terminally differentiated astrocytes. Based on previous evidence from both <italic>ex vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> and mouse in vitro models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>, we selected BMP4 and CNTF as potential “polarizing” factors for astrocyte morphology.</p><p id="P10">We adapted the established protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> to include a differentiation with medium supplemented with either BMP4 or CNTF for two weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that both protocols produce non-proliferative (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>) cells that are immunoreactive for key astrocytic markers, such as Aldh1l1 and S100β<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, the resultant populations of astrocytes have distinct morphologies which are homogeneous within each population. Specifically, BMP4-differentiated astrocytes display larger and more spread-out cell bodies with a rounder shape compared to CNTF-differentiated astrocytes, which are characterized by small cell bodies with long thin processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To better quantify these morphological differences and define the timescale of development of astrocyte morphology, we performed high content live imaging of astrocyte progenitors sparsely transfected with GFP under the <italic>EEF1A1</italic> promoter at different timepoints (Days 0, 1, 7, 14, and 21) during the differentiation process. We compared astrocytes differentiated with BMP4, CNTF, both cytokines together, or base medium devoid of any cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). To assess the morphological heterogeneity across these conditions in an unbiased manner, we established a computational pipeline for semi-automated single-cell profiling based on discrete morphological features over the time-course of terminal differentiation. We first applied singular value decomposition (SVD) to the matrix of single-cell measurements (52 measurements across 5,376 cells) to identify major orthogonal temporal dynamics of morphological changes associated with terminal differentiation of astrocytes exposed to different cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Our analysis reveals that the first 20 components capture 90% of the variance in the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>). Using linear mixed modelling, we found significant associations between principal component (PC) 1 (41% of variance), PC2 (6.4% of variance), and PC5 (4% of variance) with the different cytokine combinations over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Notably, our results indicate that exposure to BMP4, irrespective of CNTF treatment, leads to diverging differentiation trajectories. In contrast, astrocytes cultured with CNTF or basal medium show similar progressive changes over time, with the exception of a notable difference observed at day 21. Further analysis of the morphological parameters most contributing and correlating with PC1, PC2, and PC5 revealed that measurements describing rounder and more extended morphologies (e.g., median radius and extent) most positively contribute to PC1, whereas measurements such as cell perimeter and compactness, which describe more complex, ramified morphologies, most contribute negatively to PC1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref>). This indicates that the terminal differentiation of astrocytes in the absence of BMP4 leads to a progressive reduction in roundness and extent, along with a progressive increase in ramification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p id="P12">To evaluate the difference in morphology between BMP4 and CNTF, we selected median radius and perimeter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure 1G and S1D</xref>) which show opposite direction of change. The cells treated with BMP4 or with the combination of both cytokines show a gradual increase in median radius over three weeks of differentiation, but no change in perimeter – suggesting an overall simplification of morphology with time. Conversely, CNTF and basal medium astrocytes show an increase in their perimeter as they differentiate but no appreciable in median radius – suggesting a switch to a more complex cell morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Overall, this demonstrates that BMP4 and CNTF specifically influence human astrocyte morphology <italic>in vitro</italic> producing homogeneous populations with opposing cell shapes. In addition, we show that the effect of BMP4 can overpower that of CNTF suggesting it is a stronger morphogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1D</xref>), while addition of CNTF maintains a base non-divergent morphological differentiation as astrocytes supplemented with CNTF mimic those grown in basal differentiation medium alone, with the exception of slight differences in cell body shape (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E-F</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We next sought to investigate whether the distinct morphological phenotypes obtained with BMP4 and CNTF are the result of the commitment to a specific developmental program, and therefore stable once acquired, or plastic and changing based on a constant supply of cytokines.</p><p id="P15">We therefore performed medium switch experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), in which we first swapped 2-week differentiated astrocytes to the opposite cytokine regimen for an additional week of differentiation, to test whether this would alter their final morphology to resemble that of the opposite subtype. We found that cytokine switching did not correlate with a switch of morphologies between the two subtypes, with BMP4 astrocytes showing no significant alteration in any of the shape descriptors we evaluated. While CNTF astrocytes showed minimal changes in median radius and compactness compared to their non-switched counterpart, this did not alter the overall architecture of the cells, nor induce them to adopt the same morphology as BMP4 astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results suggest that astrocytes in our model commit to a specific morphology by two weeks of differentiation, albeit with the potential of morphological malleability at earlier timepoints through exposure to different cytokines.</p><p id="P16">To test this hypothesis, we repeated the medium-switching experiment after one week of differentiation. BMP4 astrocytes switched to CNTF medium showed no significant differences from non-switched BMP4 controls, while CNTF astrocytes switched to BMP4 exhibited increased extent and reduced compactness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Qualitatively, it seems that Qualitative assessment suggests that these differences primarily result from to the reduced process length observed in comparison to non-switched CNTF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). These alterations impact overall perimeter and associated descriptors without altering the global architecture, defined by a smaller cell body and elongated, thin processes.</p><p id="P17">These experiments indicate that the contrasting morphologies of BMP4 and CNTF astrocytes, characterised by opposing extent and perimeter (i.e. high extent/low perimeter for BMP4 and low extent/high perimeter for CNTF), are largely committed established after 1-week of differentiation. While minor adjustments can be made, each subtype broadly maintains its morphology irrespective of culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Notably, BMP4 appears to exert a dominant effect, consistent with observations from astrocytes differentiating in the presence of both cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>BMP4 and CNTF astrocytes show distinct homeostatic capabilities</title><p id="P18">We next sought to determine whether the distinct morphologies of CNTF and BMP4 astrocytes also translate into distinct functional properties.</p><p id="P19">Calcium signalling via intercellular calcium waves (ICWs) is key in regulating astrocytic network-level communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>, as well as modulating interactions with neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. As ICWs rely on calcium microdomains within astrocytic processes for propagation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that the difference in morphology between BMP4 and CNTF astrocytes may also correlated with different calcium wave dynamics. To test this, we stimulated BMP4 and CNTF astrocyte populations with adenosine triphosphate (ATP; 5mM) and used Fluo-4AM calcium dye to visualize the calcium signalling response over a period of 160 seconds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3A</xref>). CNTF astrocytes responded more swiftly to ATP administration compared to BMP4, during imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating different kinetics associated with the two subtypes, which we confirmed by peak analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Following ATP stimulation, CNTF astrocytes exhibited a significantly shorter time to peak, whereas BMP4 astrocytes displayed significantly higher and broader peak responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). This indicates that, while BMP4 astrocytes are slower in responding, they show a higher and sustained concentration of calcium within the cell during the spiking activity. Interestingly, this difference in ICW kinetics does appears independent of Connexin-43 protein levels, which are comparable between the two astrocyte populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3B</xref>). However, one possible explanation that we cannot exclude is that CNTF astrocytes might simply respond faster to the bath application of ATP, independently of connexin-based propagation.</p><p id="P20">Glutamate reuptake is another key homeostatic function of astrocytes and is considered a hallmark for the characterization of differentiated astrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>. To test whether our two astrocyte subtypes differed in their glutamate reuptake ability, we employed a fluorometric glutamate uptake assay that measures the depletion of glutamate from the culture medium over time, starting from a known concentration (100 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). We used a selective glutamate transport inhibitor L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (PDC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> as a negative control. We observed that, while both BMP4 and CNTF astrocytes are capable of glutamate uptake, the rate is twice as high for CNTF astrocytes than for astrocytes differentiated with BMP4 (c.a. 33 μM/hr and 15μM/hr, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). This difference also corresponds to differences in protein levels of the glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1), which are significantly higher in CNTF astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>BMP and CNTF differentiated astrocyte morphologies are not altered by neuron contact</title><p id="P21">Astrocytes have a bidirectional relationship with neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is known to influence the morphology, homeostasis, and function of both cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. For this reason, we investigated the morphologies and functional properties of both BMP4 and CNTF astrocytes when co-cultured with neurons. First, we wanted to test whether their morphology would be altered by the presence of neurons, using our established imaging pipeline with GFP<sup>+</sup> BMP4 and CNTF astrocytes. When co-cultured with neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, CNTF and BMP4 astrocytes displayed subtle morphological differences (not reflected in previously defined parameters) but retained their distinct base cell shapes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Importantly, co-culture with neurons significantly upregulated excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) levels in both BMP- and CNTF-differentiated astrocytes compared to monoculture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3D</xref>), suggesting that both these distinct subtypes can respond productively to neurons.</p><p id="P22">Astrocytes also have a key role in promoting neuronal synapse formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. We therefore tested whether BMP4 and CNTF astrocytes differ in their ability to stimulate synaptogenesis when co-cultured with neurons. To do this we differentiated cortical neuron progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, either alone or in the presence of BMP4 or CNTF differentiated astrocytes. To assess the co-localization of synapses, we stained for re- and post-synaptic proteins synaptophysin (SYN) and post-synaptic density-95 (PSD95), along with MAP2 to demarcate dendrites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3E</xref>), and quantified the number of SYN+/PSD95+ puncta per 100μm<sup>2</sup> of MAP2 dendrites.

Our analysis revealed minimal differences between 2- and 3-weeks differentiated astrocytes, for both BMP4 and CNTF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4</xref>). Therefore, we focused our analysis on 3-week differentiated astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) highlighted that both astrocytes subtypes are transcriptionally distinct from progenitors and from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), with 2162 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BMP4 and CNTF astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>).

We developed and employed an unbiased image analysis pipeline to perform a morphological analysis of the salient features that define each subtype, which would also be adaptable in the future for a wider study on different cytokine combinations. Importantly, we show that the morphology acquired is not dependent on medium exposure after initial commitment and cannot be easily switched from one subtype to the other. Moreover, we show that the difference in astrocyte shape correlates with distinct functional profiles and – importantly – is attributable to the reliance of the two subtypes on different elements of the cytoskeleton to acquire and retain their shape.</p><p id="P58">Our results indicate that the distinct organization and usage of the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton not only directly underlies the morphological difference, but also provides a mechanistic link between the structural and functional profiles of astrocytes. For example, we show that CNTF astrocytes have faster and more frequent calcium waves, which travel through their intricate arborised long processes; this would also imply the need for a more structured way of meeting metabolic demands within those processes, which matches our results showing that mitochondria in CNTF astrocytes are more delocalised and actively transported in the processes. In turn, this also correlates with the reliance of CNTF astrocytes on a stable microtubule cytoskeleton, and the upregulation of microtubule related stabilisers and transporters. Correspondingly, for BMP4 astrocytes, we find the morphological data (i.e. multiple dynamic short processes) correlates with the cytoskeleton analysis (i.e. reliance on actin filaments more than microtubules), which is consistent with both the expression profile and – importantly – the cellular function (e.g. migratory behavior in response to reactivity).</p><p id="P59">One important aspect of this study that further highlights the need to consider shape-function links in the context of <italic>in vitro</italic> modelling of astrocytes, is the striking difference in the reactivity profile of the two astrocyte subtypes.

Both subtypes also changed their morphology, with CNTF acquiring a more ramified morphology with bigger cell bodies, while reactive BMP4 astrocytes featured a polarised, palisading morphology. It is interesting to note that genes coding for matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) enzymes appear among the most differentially expressed in both transitions from progenitors to differentiated cells (for example <italic>MMP3</italic> for BMP4, <italic>MMP8</italic> for CNTF), as well as in the transition between untreated and treated CNTF astrocytes (<italic>MMP3</italic>), potentially pointing towards an important role of ECM remodelling in driving this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p id="P60">The most striking feature we observed was the opposite behavior these reactive astrocytes have in response to injury, with the reactivity response of BMP- and CNTF-differentiated astrocytes to the well-defined TIC neurotoxicity-inducing cytokines being markedly different.</p><p id="P61">While our results highlight the links between shape, function and reactivity in human astrocyte, our <italic>in vitro</italic> model is by its nature reductionist and more simplified compared to the <italic>in vivo</italic> setting.

CNTF-treated astrocytes were enriched for pathways associated with cilium and microtubule movement. BMP4-treated astrocytes were interestingly enriched for ECM regulation, a known function of astrocytes (reviewed in Wiese et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74">74</xref></sup>). Taken together, our investigation of rodent astrocytes revealed commonalities in BMP4 and CNTF signaling, further validating our human astrocyte <italic>in vitro</italic> model and the differential effect that CNTF and BMP4 have on astrocytes. It is also important to note that other combinations of cytokines have been shown to have different degrees of potency in driving astrogliogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>, however, to our knowledge there are no systematic reports on their effect on astrocyte morphology.</p><p id="P64">Another important caveat of our approach is that most of our experiments are performed in 2D and on ECM-coated tissue culture plastic, therefore our cells lack the tri-dimensional structure they would have <italic>in vivo</italic>, and they adhere to a substrate with a much higher stiffness than the physiological range. Future studies should address these limitations and test if and how the observed phenotypes translate in a 3D environment.</p><p id="P65">In conclusion, we report an important step in demonstrating the key links between shape and function in astrocyte cultures, and how including cell shape dynamics within <italic>in vitro</italic> modelling approaches for astrocytes could be highly beneficial to better recapitulate human astrocyte biology in health and disease. We show that different morphogens drive transcriptomic, morphological, and functional differences in human astrocytes, and provide evidence that they respond differently to the same reactivity inducing factors – a long-standing question in the field of astrocyte biology. Moving forward, it will be compelling to discern what other astrocyte differentiation factors may alter astrocyte morphologies and importantly impact how these subtypes of cells function and respond to stimuli in the human adult brain.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods" specific-use="web-onlu9"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P66">All cells were kept in humidified atmosphere at 37°C with 5% CO2.

We next quantified the association between individual left singular vectors and culture conditions using linear mixed modelling, accounting for the idiosyncratic differences that may arise from the different cell lines and experiments using R and lme4 37. As fixed effects, we entered the culture condition variable into the model. As random effects, we had intercepts for either cell lines and experiments. Visual inspection of residual plots did not reveal any obvious deviations from homoscedasticity or normality. P-values were obtained by likelihood ratio tests of the full model with the effect in question against the model without the effect in question. We iteratively fitted a linear mixed model to the each left singular vectors.</p><p id="P132">To visualize the right singular vectors, we plotted the average singular vectors per group on the vertical axis as a function of the time corresponding to each sample on the horizontal axis and coloring all samples corresponding to culture conditions. Next, we identified morphological features whose profiles correlated (Pearson correlation between individual morphological measurements profile and right singular vectors) and contributed (projection of each individual morphological measurements profile onto right singular vectors) most strongly (either positively or negatively) with the profile of the singular vectors. In order to identify representative measurements for each singular vector, features were ranked according to both projection and correlation scores. The highest (most positive scores in both projection and correlation) and lowest (most negative scores in both correlation and projection) motifs were selected for each singular vector using K-mean clustering.</p></sec><sec id="S39"><title>Statistical analysis and plotting</title><p id="P133">For every experiment, Gaussian distribution of the data was tested using Shapiro-Wilks or Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, and parametric or non-parametric statistical test used in accordance.</p><p id="P134">Statistical tests are specified in figure legends but, briefly, unpaired T-test was used for comparison between two groups with normal distribution, while Mann-Whitney U-test was used in case of non-normal distribution.

Astrocyte progenitors are generated and propagated as previously described (Serio et al, 2013) and then terminally differentiated for two weeks in the presence of BMP4 or CNTF. B) Representative images of astrocyte progenitors stained for NESTIN, NF1A and nuclei (DAPI) and brightfield pictures showing sparse and confluent progenitor cultures. Scale bar: 100 μm. C) Representative images of differentiated BMP4 and CNTF astrocytes stained for astrocytic markers GFAP, ALDH1L1 and S100β. Scale bar: 100 μm. D) Pipeline for the analysis of astrocyte morphological characteristics. Astrocyte progenitor cells (APCs) are sparsely transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the EEF1A1 promoter, differentiated with BMP4, CNTF, base media or a combination of cytokines and then imaged live over differentiation. The images acquired are pre-processed, followed by object segmentation using pixel classification. Morphometric analysis is then performed on these objects to obtain key morphometric parameters. Scale bar: 50 μm. E) Principal component analysis of astrocyte morphological variations. The principal components cluster with unsupervised hierarchal clustering according to cytokine groups. F) Representation of the top 3 principal components (PC1, PC2, PC5) which explain over 50% of the variance and fluctuate over the days of differentiation for the different cytokine groups. Data represents averages of wells from 1 control line in 1 experimental block, with 7 technical replicates (n=7 wells).
