However, whether tempo is responsible for these differences in magnitude, and how, remains to be determined. Here, we used brain organoids to investigate this and observed that human axon tracts spend more time growing and extend farther compared to those of mice, independent of their tissue environment. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis pointed to a subset of calcium-permeable ion channels expressed throughout neuron development, including during axon tract outgrowth. Calcium imaging during early neuron development consistently revealed a reduced calcium influx in human neurons compared to mouse neurons. Stimulating calcium influx and increasing cAMP levels resulted in premature halting of axon tract outgrowth and shorter axon tracts, mimicking the mouse phenotype, while abrogating calcium influx led to an even longer phase of axon tract outgrowth and longer axon tracts in humans. Thus, evolutionary differences in calcium regulation set the tempo of neuronal development, by extending the time window to foster the more elaborated human neuron morphology.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>developmental tempo</kwd><kwd>brain development</kwd><kwd>neuronal maturation</kwd><kwd>human evolution</kwd><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>neuron morphology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The most striking features that characterize the human brain relate to differences in magnitude. The human brain is larger than that of other primates and rodents, is composed of increased cell numbers, and displays increased neuron size and connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. These differences in magnitude correlate with differences in the tempo of brain development, with the later stages of cortical neuron morphogenesis being especially protracted in humans, extending up to 5 or even 25 years depending on the brain region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. During this developmental time window, neurons establish the distinct structures that underpin neuronal connectivity, including axons, dendrites and synapses. Each of these neuronal domains has expanded by several orders of magnitude in humans, with axon tracts and white matter showing an even greater increase compared to synapse numbers and dendritic arbors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. This disproportionate increase of axon tracts is due to axons needing to extend farther in a larger brain and, similar to dendrites, the need to expand to accommodate the increase in synapse number per neuron. Thus, a consistent correlation between developmental tempo and evolutionary expansion is observed across species, with the tempo of neuronal morphogenesis being particularly divergent in humans. This has led to the hypothesis that the more elaborate structure of the human brain is due to a slowing of tempo, or bradychrony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. However, a direct link between tempo and morphological complexity is still lacking.</p><p id="P3">The developmental tempo of the human brain compared with that of mice seems to follow a different and even more protracted evolutionary pattern compared with the rest of the body, which is only ∼2-fold slower in humans than mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, pointing to distinct underlying mechanisms. With the advancements of human neural <italic>in vitro</italic> models, mechanisms driving the tempo of neurodevelopment are starting to be explored. This has revealed that timing is cell-intrinsic, as species-specific developmental tempo is maintained when transplanting human neurons into rodent brains, or in neuron co-cultures from different species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. Recent studies have pointed to a role for mitochondria metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and epigenetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, as perturbing these processes can accelerate the timing of acquisition of features of mature neurons, including dendritic arborization, synapse number, and electrophysiological activity. However, altering tempo in this manner did not result in differences in phenotype that align with the evolutionary pattern, namely decreased neuronal complexity with faster development. Thus, a mechanistic explanation for both the evolutionarily slowed tempo of human neuron morphogenesis and its increased morphological complexity has not yet been described.</p><p id="P4">Investigating a causal relationship between the elaboration of neuron structures and the duration of the process during which it is established is challenging in human models. Precisely because of the extended time of human brain development it is difficult to capture the end point when neuronal development is complete and structural complexity can be assessed. Axon tract development is a process of neuron morphogenesis completed during embryogenesis, making it a more accessible process to study, and the expansion of axon tracts are also a perfect example of the evolutionary elaboration of neuronal structures. However, whilst other maturation hallmarks are easier to read out using typical models such as 2D cultures, it is considerably more challenging to analyse axon length using such cultures. Here, we used modified human and mouse brain organoid slice cultures that are capable of forming self-organised axon tracts, and combined these with tailored micropatterned devices to mechanistically explore the link between developmental tempo and evolutionary axon tract morphology. Using these methods, we found that human organoids consistently exhibited a lower calcium influx, which was largely mediated by L-Type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), than mice at stage-matched timepoints. Increasing the L-Type VGCC-mediated calcium influx or cAMP levels in human neurons mimicked the mouse phenotype, leading to a shortening of the axonogenesis time window as well as shortened axon tracts. The opposite effect was observed upon blocking L-Type VGCC-mediated calcium influx, resulting in axon tracts that grew for a longer time and extended beyond their normal length. Thus, this work has uncovered a calcium-mediated mechanism that drives species-specific developmental tempo by tuning the duration of a development stage, thereby demonstrating a causal relationship between tempo and evolutionary neuronal morphology.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Human organoid axon tracts take longer to establish and grow longer than mouse</title><p id="P5">Tempo could refer to various potential biological rates. To enable a more elaborate final product, we hypothesised that the relevant difference in tempo would be one that affects the duration of transient developmental states during which neuronal structures form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a</xref>). For the purposes of axon tract length, the relevant state would be axon tract outgrowth. Therefore, to investigate evolutionary differences in axon tract outgrowth and the eventual morphology of axon tracts, we used human and mouse brain organoid slice cultures generated using an unguided method, as these most closely resemble <italic>in vivo</italic>-like tempo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Fig 1a</xref>), while guided protocols often unfold at a several times faster pace<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. In order to generate comparable organoids of the proper cerebral cortical identity, human and mouse brain organoids were generated using an identical method, with the timing of media changes during pluripotency exit and neural induction tailored to match the species-specific differentiation, as described before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Over the course of their development, the organoids exhibited a gradual size divergence, culminating in a substantial enlargement in human organoids, reminiscent of <italic>in vivo</italic> differences in human and mouse brain sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To study axon tract development, which occurs at relatively later stages of neurodevelopment, we generated long-term air-liquid interface cerebral organoid (ALI-CO) cultures, which we have previously shown to successfully recapitulate various stages of neuronal development with improved neuronal survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. For cross-species analysis of axon tract development, we sought to identify a stage-matched timepoint corresponding to the onset of axon development, which was then selected as the day for organoid slicing in each species. Axon development begins when neurons undergo a symmetry break, transitioning from an unpolarized to a polarized state, which involves the accelerated outgrowth of a single neurite that will become the axon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. We identified this transition using a sparse viral labelling approach enabling assessing individual morphologies of the different neuronal polarity states in organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Fig 1b</xref>). Similar to <italic>in vivo</italic>, neuron development in these brain organoids is asynchronous. Thus, we aimed to identify the timepoint where mouse and human exhibited similar numbers of polarized and unpolarized neurons. We observed that in human organoids sliced at day 55, about half of the neurons were still unpolarized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Fig 1c</xref>). The equivalent level was found for mouse sliced at day 8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Fig 1c</xref>). Thus, we successfully stage-matched mouse and human organoids to allow accurate comparison of developmental tempo and morphological outcome.</p><p id="P7">At the start of neuron development, human and mouse neurons initially displayed similar morphologies, including comparable neurite lengths and soma areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Figs 1d-h</xref>). In both human and mouse neurons, axon lengths were increased compared to other neurite lengths, with dendrites retaining similar lengths as unpolarised neurites, consistent with the notion that dendrite development occurs at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1d</xref>). Moreover, similar to previous reports, human and mouse neurons showed a subtle trend toward a decreased soma area upon establishing neuronal polarity or in timepoints corresponding with the onset of neuronal polarity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Figs 1d,e</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">Once neuronal polarity was established, and the ALI-COs were allowed to reach a more mature stage, both human and mouse organoids developed self-organised long-range axon tracts projecting to local and distant regions within the ALI-CO, as described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1e</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Notably, at these late stages, human axon tracts extended farther than those of mice, mirroring the <italic>in vivo</italic> differences in axon tract length.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Species-specific differences in axon tract length correlate with timing and are cell-intrinsic</title><p id="P9">In the brain, distinct axon trajectories are established through interactions with the tissue environment, such as stiffness, chemoattractants, and chemorepellents, that influence growth cone turning events and outgrowth rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Across species with different brain sizes, homologous axon trajectories can be identified and follow similar paths with the main difference being their length. Such a difference could be due to differences in developmental tempo of the axon growth stage as well as species-specific factors in the tissue environment. To test these possibilities, we transplanted dissociated mouse neurons onto human and mouse ALI-COs, and observed that they still exhibited similar axon lengths, whereas dissociated human neurons on human ALI-COs developed longer axon trajectories, suggesting that evolutionary differences in axon tract length are intrinsic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1f</xref>).</p><p id="P10">The fact that human organoids grew longer axon tracts over a more extended time period suggested that the difference in length may relate directly to developmental tempo. To assess this, and to enable detailed investigations of axon tract outgrowth, we sought to establish a method to examine isolated outgrowing axon tracts from each species in a similar and controlled environment. We engineered micropatterned devices from molds generated using photolithography, with chambers for brain organoid slices connected to a 5 mm long channel, to capture outgrowing axon tracts and allow for their unrestricted growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Figs 2a-c</xref>). Within a few days after placing a human brain organoid in one of the chambers, individual axons started to grow out into the channel and continued to extend in subsequent weeks whilst forming large self-organised tracts, similar to those observed in ALI-COs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1g</xref>). The tract was almost completely composed of axons with a few neurons migrating into the tract once axons started to bundle, some of these integrating with axons in the tract, similar to the interstitial white matter neurons <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, whilst others underwent apoptosis, akin to programmed cell death of misoriented neurons during brain development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Figs 2d,e</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We observed a similar axon tract outgrowth pattern of mouse brain organoids in micropatterned devices, but with the important difference that axon tracts from mouse organoids did not extend as far compared to human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1g</xref>). Moreover, by examining axon tract development over time, we observed that the longer axon tracts of human organoids were not due to increased axon outgrowth rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1h,i</xref>). In fact, initial axon outgrowth rates were faster in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1i</xref>), similar to the trend that we observed when comparing young polarised neurons in human and mouse ALI-COs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Fig 1f</xref>). However, the parameter that consistently correlated with species-specific differences in axon tract length was the time window of the axon tract outgrowth stage, with axon tract growth halting after about 3 days in mouse compared to about 5 weeks in human.</p><p id="P12">These findings indicate that, during the axon tract outgrowth phase, axons follow a cell-intrinsic program where they are committed to extending for a predetermined time window, and during which they are not yet receptive to environmental interactions that may direct synapse formation. This also explains how, in ALI-COs as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>, axons initially pass by neurons of similar identities as of those they eventually target. To further test this, we examined the effect of axon outgrowth when it is presented with a target tissue whilst still in the axon extension stage. Using similar micropatterned devices, but with shorter channels, we placed a human brain organoid slice expressing mCherry in one chamber, and a non-fluorescently labelled human brain organoid in the other chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1j</xref>). Indeed, after ∼12 days in culture, corresponding with the axon tract outgrowth stage in human organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1j</xref>), human axons had reached the target tissue, but this did not result in axon outgrowth halting. Instead, axons grew over the target tissue and continued to do so in subsequent days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1j</xref>). This was also observed when using mouse spinal cord explant as target tissue, which we have previously shown to be functionally innervated by outgrowing axon tracts from human brain organoid slices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, with axons from human brain organoids labelled with Marcks-GFP extending over the mouse spinal cord tissue whilst in their axon elongation stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Fig 2f</xref>). These findings, together with extensive previous work on axon pathfinding, suggest multiple layers of control in establishing axon tract length: a species-specific time window of the axon elongation stage, which underlies interspecies differences in axon tract length, combined with the well-described interactions with environmental factors that underlie different directionalities and lengths of axon tracts within the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Moreover, these data indicate that developmental tempo, irrespective of species-specific tissue environment, tissue size and target tissue interactions, consistently correlates with species-specific differences in axon tract length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1k</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Transcriptome profiling points to calcium-permeable ion channels</title><p id="P13">To identify a molecular mechanism that could underlie changes in species-specific tempo and axon tract length, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of 13 human and 8 mouse timepoints, capturing timepoints identified to reflect the dynamic onset of axon formation through to stages beyond axon halting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Figs 3a,b</xref>). Both human and mouse brain organoids displayed forebrain identities, exhibiting a wide range of neural cell types and complexity, as expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Cluster analysis revealed the presence of clusters representing different stages of cortical neurogenesis in both human and mouse samples, as indicated by the presence of markers of neural progenitors and neurons across different maturation stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>). Additionally, we identified clusters with other forebrain identities, including choroid plexus in human samples, retinal progenitors, retinal photoreceptors, and retinal pigment epithelium cell clusters in mouse samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>). The human dataset also exhibited a small cluster that lacked clear differential gene expression and was generally positive for markers of all cell identities. The cells in this small cluster all originated from only two out of 48 samples, which exhibited a profoundly lower cell count compared to all other samples, suggesting ambient RNA from debris.</p><p id="P14">We also identified a cluster representing mitotic radial glia, as well as a gliogenesis cluster in the mouse samples, which, as expected, mostly originated from more mature samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Fig 3b</xref>). Specifically, in this cluster, we observed the presence of various glia progenitors, including gliogenic radial glia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and glia subtypes, including oligodendrocytes and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2a</xref>).</p><p id="P15">In addition to different cell types, we could also distinguish a clear progression of neuronal maturation, with expression of genes encoding for axon outgrowth and axon initial segment proteins during the transition from neural progenitors to neurons, followed by an increase of synaptic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2b,d</xref>). In a small subset of the most mature neurons in both the human and mouse datasets, which were exclusively present at the latest timepoints, we could already detect the mature synapse marker Grin2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2b,d</xref>), indicating a full coverage of the neuronal maturation stages in our datasets. The distinct developmental RNA expression profiles of various neuronal maturation genes were confirmed to correlate with their corresponding protein expression patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Figs 3c,d</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To identify relevant regulators of stage transitions that may be involved in differences in the tempo and length of axons, we looked for genes that had a dynamic expression profile corresponding with the early and subsequent maturation stages of neuron development. When analysing the developmental expression profiles of these neuronal maturation genes in human and mouse datasets, we observed that a subset of genes related to neural activity and synapses were expressed during early stages, with an expression profile that was similar to axon outgrowth and axon initial segment genes instead of other synaptic and neural activity genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2d,e</xref>). Similar developmental expression dynamics of these genes were observed when analysing RNA sequencing data from the human prefrontal cortex <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2f</xref>). The identity of these genes appeared biased toward synaptic cell adhesion molecules, which are known to play important roles in axon guidance prior to synapse formation, as well as synaptic neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2g</xref>). Notably, among the ion channels, they included relatively more ion channels that become permeable to calcium upon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2h</xref>). The expression profile of these calcium channels, combined with the well-established role of calcium in many processes of neuronal morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>, led us to investigate whether calcium dynamics might underlie the evolutionary diversification of neuronal morphologies.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Species-specific differences in calcium dynamics at stage-matched timepoints</title><p id="P17">To examine calcium dynamics in axon tracts during neuronal development, we used the GCaMP7f reporter to investigate species-specific differences in neural activity modes present across developmental stages. This includes spontaneous calcium transients that gradually transition to synchronous bursts, before the shift to asynchronous networks that starts as synaptic structures begin to increase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Fig 4a</xref>). In both human and mouse organoids, we observed spontaneous calcium transients during early neuron development stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary videos 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">2</xref>), with the appearance of synchronous calcium bursts increasing over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary videos 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">4</xref>). The transition from spontaneous to synchronous activity occurred around day 76 in human organoids and day 17 in mouse organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3e,f</xref>), which also corresponded with the onset of gliogenesis in each species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Figs 4b-d</xref>), providing a carefully stage-matched timepoint for subsequent analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3g</xref>). To identify the timepoints reflecting the start of asynchronous networks, we assessed the number of synapses over time, as measured by co-localisation of pre- and postsynaptic puncta (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Figs 4e,f,i</xref>), which gives a more reliable read-out compared to analysing individual puncta (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Figs 4g,h,j,k</xref>). Similar to <italic>in vivo</italic>, a few synapses were already present during early stages, but only began to significantly increase at day 146 in human ALI-COs and day 29 in mouse ALI-COs, thus indeed considerably later than the onset of synchronous burst activities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Fig 4a</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We then performed a cross-species analysis of calcium dynamics at matched timepoints during spontaneous activity, corresponding with day 69 in human and day 15 in mouse, and synchronous activity, occurring at day 82 in human and day 19 in mouse. At both stages and neural activity modes, we observed a consistently lower amplitude, but not frequency, in human compared to mouse axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3h-j, l-n</xref>). Calcium transient durations were also shorter in human during spontaneous activity, with no differences during synchronous burst activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3k,o</xref>). We also compared proximal, mid and distal regions of axon tracts and observed very similar parameters along the length of axons, suggesting a consistent species-specific difference irrespective of location on the axon tract (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Fig4l-q</xref>). The identified species-specific differences in calcium dynamics thus displays a quantitative difference at matched developmental stages.

To address this, we aimed to identify the calcium channel(s) responsible for mediating the relevant calcium dynamics during these neuronal development stages. Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed an early onset of expression of calcium channels that localize to plasma membranes in both human and mouse neurons. Additionally, the observed calcium dynamics—characterized by spikes typically resulting from extracellular calcium influx through plasma membrane-localized channels rather than release from intracellular calcium stores that typically lead to calcium waves —suggests these calcium channels could be responsible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Moreover, the long duration of the observed calcium transients, lasting several seconds, pointed to calcium channels with a slow inactivation rate, which is typical for the L-Type VGCCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>, one of the channel types we found to have an early onset expression profile in our scRNA-seq. We therefore tested the effects of treatment with an L-Type VGCC antagonist, which blocked nearly all calcium dynamics in early stages corresponding with spontaneous activity, as well as during later stages corresponding with synchronous activity, and could be recovered upon washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Fig 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplementary videos 5</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10">10</xref>). Instead, treatment with an L-type VGCC agonist led to decreased frequencies with no difference in event duration or number of axons firing and, most notably, a profound increase in calcium amplitudes, similar to those observed in mouse organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4a-e</xref>).</p><p id="P20">We then examined the effect of these perturbations on human axon length, to test whether increasing, to mimic mouse dynamics, or decreasing calcium dynamics could influence tract length. We observed that potentiation of calcium amplitude did not affect axon outgrowth rates, with similar axon lengths observed after 7 days, but similar to mouse led to a shorter axonogenesis time window, resulting in shorter axon tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4f-h</xref>). On the other hand, blocking L-type VGCC-mediated calcium influxes resulted in a longer axon outgrowth time window leading to an increase in axon tract length, beyond the unperturbed human axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f,g</xref>).</p><p id="P21">In mature neurons, the relatively long-lasting calcium influxes mediated by L-type VGCCs typically lead to modulatory responses, aligning with our findings of long-term effects on the duration of axon tract developmental rather than on axon tract outgrowth rates. An important pathway for these modulatory responses involves the downstream increase of cAMP upon L-Type VGCC-mediated calcium influxes, with cAMP in turn also regulating L-Type VGCC activity, which has been linked to numerous neuronal developmental and plasticity processes, typically involving gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. We therefore tested whether cAMP similarly impacted axon tract growth length and timing. When treating brain organoids undergoing axon tract development with cAMP, we observed shorter axon tracts and a shorter axon tract outgrowth duration, with no changes in axon tract outgrowth rates whilst in their elongation stage, thus phenocopying the effects observed with an increased calcium influx and mimicking the mouse phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4e,i,j</xref>). Together these data show that human axons, compared to those of mice, exhibit decreased calcium influxes, which underlie an extended time window of the axon tract outgrowth stage leading to an increase in axon tract length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4k</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">We demonstrate a causal link between species-specific developmental tempo and structural neuronal complexity, specifically axon length, pointing to tempo modulation as an evolutionary mechanism allowing neurons with distinct species-specific complexities to develop. Assessing neuron development tempo usually involves comparing hallmarks of neuronal maturation at similar timepoints after inducing perturbations. Using this approach, tempo mechanisms have been identified that demonstrate an increase in dendritic length and synapse number upon acceleration of tempo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, thereby deviating from the evolutionary pattern of slow tempo linked with increased neuron complexity. It is unknown, and an interesting direction for future research, if these mechanisms would be consistent with evolutionary neuron complexities if developmental endpoints were measured, or if these instead describe molecular mechanisms for neurite outgrowth and synapse formation rates that may also exhibit differences in timing but are not the basis of evolutionary differences in complexity.</p><p id="P23">Here we assessed the link between the duration of a developmental stage, axon tract outgrowth, and the evolutionary morphological outcome, axon tract length. Focusing on this stage enabled the assessment of the complete developmental process within a realistic timeframe of weeks/months instead of years. To address this, we made use of modified human and mouse brain organoid slice cultures that are capable of forming self-organised axon tracts, and combined these with tailored micropatterned devices. Notably, in rare instances, axons did not form tract bundles, thus reflecting 2D-like neuron cultures, which coincided with a delay or absence of the onset of synchronous activity, as well as an increase in axon degeneration. This observation, along with emerging evidence of distinct axon outgrowth behaviours in 3D versus 2D environments, underscores the importance of studying axon development within more physiologically relevant axon bundles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. Thus, the methodologies described here allowed for the investigation of axon tract development within a more physiological environment than 2D cultures and, by using unguided protocols to generate brain organoids, resembling <italic>in vivo</italic>-like developmental timing. These methods were used to mechanistically explore the link between developmental tempo and evolutionary neuronal complexity.</p><p id="P24">We identified the intracellular tuning of calcium and cAMP levels as a mechanism to set developmental tempo, with species-specific differences in calcium levels not only unfolding at a different pace but also being quantitatively different at matched stages. Because of the ubiquitous processes acting downstream of calcium and cAMP, regulating these intracellular levels may serve as an effective means for evolution where small changes lead to substantial, and coordinated effects. Given the well-described role of calcium and cAMP dynamics on gene expression, particularly in the context of synaptic plasticity in mature neurons, it would be interesting to direct future research towards investigating how calcium in this context may influence relevant genetic developmental programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Spontaneous calcium transients have also been described to mediate cytoskeletal remodelling, thereby controlling transient processes such as axon turning and growth cone pausing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. These could similarly be involved in evolutionary differences, but may be more relevant for differences in actual growth rates, such as the faster initial outgrowth rate seen in mouse, rather than the differences in the duration of the stage. The long-term nature of the observed effects, together with the relatively long duration of calcium transients lasting several seconds, which typically have more modulatory roles involving changes in gene expression and epigenetic remodelling, instead point to a potential cumulative effect of increased calcium and cAMP levels in setting the pace of the transition of neurodevelopmental processes.</p><p id="P25">The scRNA-seq data pointed to a pattern of calcium channels expressed throughout neuron development, suggesting a potential role of calcium levels in regulating tempo of not only axonogenesis, but also other neuron developmental processes. Consistent with this, calcium activity has been found to be involved in many processes of neuron development and plasticity, with perturbations of calcium dynamics affecting neurogenesis, axon pathfinding as well as regeneration, synapse formation and synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. In the context of axonogenesis, whilst calcium dynamics have not yet been linked to evolutionary timing, perturbations have similarly been found to affect axon outgrowth, with increased neuronal activity or calcium dynamics leading to shorter and mistargeted axons, consistent with these findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>. Moverover, impairments in calcium dynamics have been linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including epilepsy, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>. Notably, Timothy syndrome is specifically associated with gain-of-function mutations in L-Type VGCCs resulting in increased calcium influx, and this dysregulation is linked to cognitive impairments and, intriguingly, microcephaly—smaller brain size—which aligns with our observations of shorter axons upon L-Type VGCC activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>. Thus, the widespread role of calcium activity throughout neuronal development, together with these findings on its influence on developmental tempo, hint at a broader regulatory function of calcium dynamics in coordinating the tempo of these processes.</p><p id="P26">Evolutionary mechanisms ultimately stem from genetic differences. It would be interesting to direct future research at identifying the genetic changes responsible for species-specific differences in calcium dynamics. The reported species-specific differences in L-type VGCC-mediated calcium amplitudes may reflect variations in receptor levels at the plasma membrane, suggesting that genetic changes could affect expression levels, receptor targeting to plasma membranes or their turnover. As we observed a common signature of calcium-permeable ion channels with an early expression onset, an interesting avenue would be to explore the effect on tempo of other channels, such as NMDA receptors that were recently identified to exhibit calcium-mediated roles in synapse and dendrite formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. Finally, as is common in evolution, a calcium and cAMP-mediated mechanism of timing is likely not a new innovation of the human lineage, and indeed, oscillatory cAMP signalling was recently described to act as a developmental timer in the amoeba species <italic>D.

Live-imaging of calcium dynamics was conducted on an inverted Nikon X1 Spinning Disk inverted microscope, containing a 60x/1.2NA Water lens, sCMOS cameras (95% QE), and a heated and gas-controlled incubation chamber. ALI-COs were kept at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and timelapses were acquired at a 1Hz imaging speed and single plane. Image processing and analysis was performed in Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Quantifications neuronal polarity, 3D neurite lengths and soma areas</title><p id="P39">Neurons were categorised as polarised when one of the neurites, the future axon, was at least two-fold longer than the second longest neurite.

Axon tract lengths were manually traced, using the surface of the organoid where the tract extends from as start and the most distal part of the tract as end.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><title>Quantifications of proportion of spontaneous and synchronous calcium activity and stage-matching</title><p id="P41">Timelapses with 133.62×133.62μm image size and 5 min durations were acquired from axon tract regions in micropatterned devices. If at least two axons showed a clear synchronous firing pattern during the acquisition, it was classified as synchronous calcium activity, otherwise as spontaneous calcium transients. Synchronous firing events first appeared on day 69 for human organoids and day 15 for mouse, during which the majority of the calcium activity events remained as non-synchronous spontaneous transients. At these matched timepoints, timelapses that did not exhibit any synchronous events were subjected to cross-species analysis of spontaneous calcium transients. Cross-species analysis of synchronous burst activity was conducted on day 82 in human and day 19 in mouse, marking the first timepoints at which the majority of calcium activity events exhibited synchrony. At these stages, robust burst activity was observed throughout the entire tract, whereas earlier timepoints showed that synchronous activity occasionally involved the coordinated firing of individual axons within the tract.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>Calcium activity quantifications</title><p id="P42">Regions of interest were manually delineated for each image. For spontaneous calcium activity measurements, all axons exhibiting calcium activity in each acquired 5 min timelapses were traced and analysed. For synchronous calcium burst activity, three axons were traced per timelapse, and their read-outs were averaged and treated as a single data point. The corresponding temporal signal for each ROI was subsequently analyzed using a custom-developed ImageJ macro (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MRC-LMB-Light-Microscopy-Facility/imagej-macro-calcium-imaging">https://github.com/MRC-LMB-Light-Microscopy-Facility/imagej-macro-calcium-imaging</ext-link>; DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14562107">10.5281/zenodo.14562107</ext-link>). Briefly, the temporal signal was derived by calculating the mean pixel intensity within each ROI at each time point. To mitigate noise, the raw signal underwent sequential temporal filtering, employing a median filter followed by a minimum filter. Putative events were identified by detecting local maxima in the ratio exceeding a pre-defined threshold. Onset and offset times for each event were defined by contiguous temporal segments exceeding this threshold and containing a single local maximum. The spatiotemporal characteristics of each identified event, specifically its location and maximum amplitude, were recorded and subsequently aggregated for each ROI in order to compute mean amplitude and frequency. The ΔF/F traces were obtained using a sliding window of 21 frames. Calcium signals above a 0.045 threshold were identified as transients and their mean amplitudes, event frequencies and event durations were analysed.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Glia cell proportion quantifications</title><p id="P43">Images with a 66.10×66.10×1.5 μm volume of brain organoid cryosections immunostained for DAPI and GFAP were acquired, with regions selected using the DAPI channel to ensure blinded analysis.

ALI-COs were collected using a cut p1000 tip, transferred to a 15 ml tube pre-coated with BSA and washed once with PBS. Accumax solution (Merck, A7089), 1 ml for human and 200 μl for mouse, was added to the ALI-COs, tissues were gently resuspended 3-5x using a p1000 tip to break it up in smaller pieces, followed by a 15 min incubation at 37°C on a shaker (57 RPM, 25 cm orbit), with gentle mixing after every 5 min. The enzymatic activity was stopped by adding 1:10 Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Merck #F2442), the cell suspension was gently resuspended another 3-5x and placed on ice to further halt enzymatic reactions. The cell solution was filtered through a 70 μm strainer, centrifuged (300 <italic>g</italic>, 10 min, 4°C) and resuspended in cell prefixation buffer (Parse Biosciences). Sample fixation and library preparation were performed following the Evercode v3 Parse Biosciences protocol. Mouse and human samples were combined and demultiplexed during subsequent bioinformatic analysis. For species demultiplexing, raw reads were aligned to a combined Human (GRCh38) and Mouse reference (GRCm39) using Split Pipeline v1.0.3 provided by Parse Biosciences. Mapping rates for transcripts to each species reference genome were calculated for each cell based on the obtained counts matrix. Species were demultiplexed by comparing the mapping rates and assigned as the species of the higher mapping rate genome. Further, the cell barcodes of human and mouse assigned cells were extracted and used to subset counts matrices obtained by aligning the raw reads to human and mouse genomes separately. These counts matrices were treated separately through the following analysis steps. For quality control and normalisation, cells with high mitochondrial UMI fractions were excluded as that is a known indication of cell stress. Next, the filtered count matrix was passed to ‘basicP2proc’ for filtering based on minimum cells expressing a gene (10) and minimum transcript number per cell (1000), variance normalisation, and dimensionality reduction by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on top 2000 most highly variable genes yielding 30 principal components. Cell doublets were identified using scDblFinder from DropletUtils. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) were obtained based on these for better data visualisation. Assessment of batch effects led us to apply the Harmony integration method on the PCAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref></sup>. The new UMAP representation was calculated on batch-integrated PCs to visualise the transcriptional landscape. Then, cells were pre-clustered based on K-Nearest Neighbour graph using pagoda2 function ‘getKnnClusters’. Initial cluster annotations were performed manually based on the localisation of known marker expressions.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P46">Statistical details are included in corresponding figure legends. <italic>P</italic>-values are annotated as follows: ns P &gt; 0.05, *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and ****<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001.
