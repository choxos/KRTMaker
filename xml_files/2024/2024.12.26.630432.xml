The global spread of heartworms is believed to have occurred alongside the dispersal of domesticated dogs. To test this theory, we analysed the genomes of 127 specimens collected from mammalian carnivore hosts across four continents. Here we show distinct genetic differences between heartworms from different continents, indicating a more ancient dispersal in canid hosts than previously recognised. Using admixture analyses, we find an Asian origin for Australian heartworms, consistent with the arrival of dingoes thousands of years ago. Finally, the genetic relatedness between European and Central American heartworms suggests that modern dispersal, likely associated with human colonisation of the Americas by Europeans, occurred with domesticated dogs. This work sheds light on the population dynamics and deep evolutionary history of a globally widespread parasite of veterinary significance.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The canine heartworm, <italic>Dirofilaria immitis</italic>, is a parasitic nematode that infects a broad range of mammalian carnivores (order Carnivora) across tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions worldwide <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. Mosquitoes transmit larval stages of heartworms, which develop after infection and reside in their host’s heart and pulmonary arteries as adults <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. These adult worms can cause lesions, vascular damage, pulmonary hypertension, and right-sided congestive heart failure, potentially leading to the death of their host <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. This is of particular concern in domestic dogs, where the onset of disease can be prevented through the rigorous and lifelong application of parasiticides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. Such treatment regimes have led to the emergence of drug resistance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup> that, while currently only well described in the USA, threatens heartworm control globally if it were to spread. Heartworms are predicted to increase in prevalence and expand into new regions due to climate change, pet travel, and habitat alterations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, defining the origins, distribution, and capacity for transmission will have important implications for implementing effective heartworm surveillance and control.</p><p id="P4">Current views on the evolutionary origins and subsequent radiation of heartworms worldwide are anthropocentric in nature. Heartworms are believed to have originated in Europe <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup> or Asia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> and spread globally over the past 200–400 years via human-mediated dog movements. Accordingly, heartworms are presumed to form a single homogeneous global population. While some studies have supported this hypothesis by demonstrating low diversity and limited population structure amongst heartworms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, these studies had limited sampling, both in terms of numbers of sequences and geographic representation. The currently accepted view of a recent global dispersal also overlooks the deep co-evolutionary history that many parasites have shared with their hosts and the environments in which they reside. The broad host range of heartworm potentially indicates a long co-evolutionary history with mammalian carnivores, especially canids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>, a group that dates back approximately 40 Mya <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, predating humans (~2.8 Mya) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup> and the domestication of modern dogs (14–40 kya) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Given also that mosquito vectors, which are essential for heartworm transmission, have existed since the early Triassic (217 Mya) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, it is possible that heartworms radiated long before human involvement. We propose that heartworms offer a compelling case for assessing the degree to which anthropogenic activities have influenced parasite distribution.</p><p id="P5">Analyses of genomic data have significant potential to identify the historical origins of heartworms and infer their global dispersal routes, as demonstrated for other helminths <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Sequencing adult heartworms is recommended for obtaining high-quality data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>; however, obtaining adults from the heart requires invasive surgery or post-mortem, which are often not feasible. Such sampling is especially difficult in parts of Asia and Africa, where cultural perceptions of dogs as unclean or carriers of disease can restrict sampling opportunities. In light of these challenges, here we present the most extensive population genomics study of heartworms to date. Using whole genome sequencing of 127 adult worms obtained from nine countries on four continents, we analyse the diversity, genetic structure, and population demographics of modern heartworms to infer their historical origins and dispersal.</p><p id="P6">Our population genomic analyses of heartworm parasites reveal a global diversity that has been shaped by both ancient and recent biogeographic events. We observed strong continental population structure, likely influenced by the distribution of ancestral canid hosts throughout time. We detected genetic admixture between Asian and Australian heartworms, which coincided with the arrival of dingoes in Australia. We also provide evidence of recent human-driven dispersal, potentially linked to the movement of domesticated dogs from Europe to Central America during colonisation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S3"><title>Genomic diversity of heartworms from multiple continents, countries, and hosts</title><p id="P7">We analysed whole-genome sequencing data from 127 adult heartworms (<italic>Dirofilaria</italic> <italic>immitis</italic>) sampled from nine countries in five regions: Australia, North America (USA), Central America (Costa Rica, Panama), Europe (Greece, Italy, Romania), and Asia (Malaysia, Thailand) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Samples were primarily collected from domestic dogs (<italic>n</italic> = 115), but we also sampled cats (<italic>n</italic> = 4), foxes (<italic>n</italic> = 4), a ferret (<italic>n</italic> = 1), a golden jackal (<italic>n</italic> = 1), a leopard (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and a wildcat (<italic>n</italic> = 1). Overall, we obtained an average coverage per sample of 75.47× for the nuclear genome, 13,119.80× for the mitochondrial genome, and 1,047.09× for the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> endosymbiont genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">4</xref>). Variant calling, joint genotyping, and filtering of heartworm samples revealed 264,558 nuclear single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (3.3 SNPs per kb), 32 mitochondrial SNPs (2.3 SNPs per kb), and 280 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> SNPs (0.3 SNPs per kb). The SNP frequencies in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes are comparable, whereas the frequency in the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genome is considerably lower. These frequency data are comparable to those of other <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected filarial worms, such as <italic>Onchocerca volvulus</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup> and <italic>Wuchereria bancrofti</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Nuclear variants reveal distinct continental partitioning of heartworms</title><p id="P8">Analyses of the heartworm cohort’s genetic diversity revealed distinct groups of samples based on broad geographical regions. Principal component analysis (PCA) using 196,550 high-quality autosomal SNPs revealed four clusters of samples corresponding to the continents from which the samples were collected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>; PC1 variance: 12.6%, PC2 variance: 10.69%). The third and fourth PCs showed a similar pattern of geographical clustering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>; PC3 variance: 5.76%, PC4 variance: 4.39%); however, although the signal was comparatively weaker, the European and Central American samples formed separate clusters. Similar findings were observed in a previous study of 31 heartworm samples from Australia, Italy, and the USA, where samples from each country formed distinct clusters <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. Independent PCAs of SNPs from each chromosome found the same continental clustering pattern across all chromosomes, including the sex-linked X chromosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">f</xref>), suggesting that this is a genome-wide rather than region-specific observation. The distinct geographical partitioning in our nuclear data was not supported by the mitochondrial (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>) or <italic>Wolbachia</italic> data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 7b</xref>), likely due to the limited number of variant sites within each dataset.</p><p id="P9">Analyses of genome-wide nucleotide diversity (Pi) further demonstrated differences between heartworm populations across continents. Pi differed significantly between all populations (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), with the exception of Europe and Central America (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The highest Pi was observed in the USA (Pi[mean] = 7.39×10<sup>-4</sup>), while the lowest was in Asia (Pi[mean] = 2.89×10<sup>-4</sup>). The genetic diversity of our USA samples aligned closely with that of a previous <italic>D. immitis</italic> study (Pi[mean] = 7.36×10<sup>-4</sup>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. However, our Australian samples (Pi[mean] = 5.61×10<sup>-4</sup>) exhibited higher genetic diversity than those reported previously (Pi[mean] = 3.9×10<sup>-5</sup>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, likely due to the larger and geographically broader sampling here. Overall, the nucleotide diversity of our <italic>D. immitis</italic> samples is comparable to that of the filarial worm <italic>W. bancrofti</italic> (Pi[mean] = 2.4×10<sup>-4</sup>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup> but lower than that of <italic>O. volvulus</italic> (Pi[mean] = 4.0×10<sup>-3</sup>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. Each <italic>D. immitis</italic> population exhibited different rates of linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay and baseline LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>), with Asia and the USA showing the highest and lowest LD, respectively. Estimates of admixture provided further support for continental partitioning in heartworms. To infer the ancestry proportions of samples, we used NGSadmix with a range of <italic>K</italic> clusters (<italic>K</italic> = 2–10; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). At <italic>K</italic> = 6, Australian samples showed the most diverse admixture patterns with strong evidence of shared ancestry with Asia, whereas USA, Europe, and Central America were largely distinct with some evidence of shared ancestry in a minority of European and Central American samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). The strong population structure in the nuclear genome of heartworms suggests that spatial spread has been restricted during the species’ history, resulting in distinct genetic profiles on each continent.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Inference of transmission between diverse heartworm hosts</title><p id="P10">Heartworms are obligate, vector-borne parasites whose successful establishment in a new environment depends on three key requirements. The first requirement is the presence of a suitable definitive host in which heartworms can develop, establish in the pulmonary arteries and the heart, and sexually reproduce to generate microfilariae, which circulate in the host’s bloodstream. The second requirement is a suitable mosquito vector that can ingest the microfilariae and support their development until they reach their infective larval stages. The final requirement relates to the conditions needed for larval development within the mosquito, which is both temperature- and time-dependent. Assuming a 30-day life expectancy and ingestion of heartworm microfilariae on Day 1, mosquitoes would require a minimum mean daily temperature of 19.3°C throughout the entire month for the larvae to develop into their infective stages and become transmissible to the next host <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Warmer climates would accelerate this developmental stage inside the mosquito vector. This complex interplay between host, vector, and climate has enabled heartworms to infect both domestic and wild animals on almost every continent of the world.</p><p id="P11">Although most heartworm samples in this study were obtained from dogs, the analysis of heartworm genomes from foxes, cats, a golden jackal, a ferret, and a leopard allowed us to evaluate genetic variation among different host species. We found that geography rather than the host species explained variation in the global heartworm population, evidenced by samples from cat and ferret nested within samples from dogs in the USA, fox and dogs in both Australian and Italian groups, and dogs and jackal, wildcat and leopard from Europe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Analyses of nucleotide diversity (Pi), absolute nucleotide divergence (<italic>D</italic><sub>XY</sub>), and genetic differentiation (<italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub>) provided additional insights on the variation within and between different host species.

In contrast, the samples from the golden jackal, leopard, and wildcat had the lowest diversity (Pi[mean] 1.10–1.89×10<sup>-4</sup>) and were the least divergent from each other compared with all other host pairs. However, only a single heartworm was sampled from each of these hosts, and the variation observed in the jackal, leopard, and wildcat samples may be confounded as they all originated from Romania. <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values between host pairs were generally low, with foxes showing the highest genetic differentiation from other hosts, except for the domestic dog (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 9b</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest an absence of obvious host-specificity and that transmission is likely between domestic animals and wildlife. However, further geographic sampling from non-dog hosts is needed to exclude the possibility of host-specific adaptation.</p><p id="P12">We next questioned which host may have harboured and dispersed heartworms before the emergence of modern dogs. We hypothesised that longer co-evolution between parasites and hosts would result in the latter being able to carry higher parasite loads. Felids (e.g. domestic cats, wild cats, snow leopards), procyonids (e.g. raccoon dogs), mustelids (e.g. European badger, ferrets), pinnipeds (e.g. harbour seal, brown fur seal), and ursids (e.g. brown bear, black bear) have been described as being infected with heartworms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>); however, they typically carry fewer adult worms and fail to support the parasite’s entire life cycle, and so they are not considered primary reservoirs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). In contrast, wild canids are commonly microfilaremic and have high worm burdens. Wolves and coyotes have worm burdens similar to dogs, while jackals and foxes have significantly lower burdens than dogs (Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons; Dog vs Jackal: <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05, Dog vs Fox: <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). These findings imply that canids, particularly ancestral wolves or coyotes, were most likely the primary hosts for heartworm during ancient times <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Coevolution of canids and heartworms: distinguishing modern from ancient origins and dispersal</title><p id="P13">Previous work had proposed that canids originated in North America ~40 Mya when the continent was completely isolated <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, whereas mosquitoes originated much earlier in the Triassic (~217 Mya) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA suggest that heartworms diverged from their closest relatives in the genus <italic>Onchocerca</italic> ~25 Mya during the Oligocene <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>, i.e., when canids and mosquito vectors were already well-established. Together, this timeline supports a long co-evolutionary history between heartworms and ancient canids.</p><p id="P14">The formation of the Bering Land Bridge and the Isthmus of Panama during the Miocene and Pliocene facilitated the first migrations of canids into Eurasia (~7 Mya) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> and South America (3.5–3.9 Mya) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, respectively. Throughout history, fluctuations in sea level have repeatedly exposed and submerged the Bering Land Bridge. Fossil records and genomic data provide robust evidence that these periods of exposure allowed ancient canids to form contiguous populations across the Northern Hemisphere. Examples include Pleistocene wolves, which were highly connected across North America and Eurasia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup>, <italic>Xenocyon lycaonoides,</italic> a large canid distributed across North America and Eurasia in the mid Pleistocene <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> and <italic>Eucyon,</italic> a jackal-sized canid distributed across North America, Eurasia, and Africa in the late Miocene <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. The existence of these interconnected ancient canid populations suggests that heartworms may have formed a highly connected population with their hosts at that time.</p><p id="P15">The current hypothesis for the distribution of heartworms around the world is that it has been largely influenced by human movement in contemporary times. Alternative hypotheses suggest that heartworms spread with humans during or shortly after dog domestication (~14–40 kya), or that they spread with wild canids before domestication. To further explore the demographic history of heartworms, we inferred their effective population (Ne) size histories using SMC++ over the last 1 million years. Given the domestication hypothesis, we broadly characterise the population demographics into three periods: post-domestication (&lt;14 kya), domestication (14-40 kya), and pre-domestication (&gt;40 kya). Contemporary estimates of Ne after domestication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>) were consistent with current levels of genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>) in each population, with USA and Australian populations showing the highest Ne and Pi, and Asia the lowest. Differences between populations in demographic analysis broadly support the <italic>D</italic><sub>XY</sub> and <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>), which indicate the greatest differentiation and, therefore, infer population splits from Asia, which diverged from the populations of Europe, the USA, and Central America. Considering the variation in population demographic curves &gt;40 kya (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>), we propose that there were substantial differences in some populations that were evolving independently before dog domestication <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. Given that modern global human movement would drive populations to be more similar, the exacerbation of differences in Ne post-domestication would further suggest that these differences in populations existed before domestication.</p><p id="P16">If heartworms were once one population, when did they diverge, and why? Our estimates of Ne do not extend earlier than 1 million years ago. However, between 1 million and ~50,000 years ago, significant climatic events correlate with changes in the heartworm population demographics. For example, we observe a substantial increase in Ne of all populations roughly aligning with the last interglacial period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>), when Earth experienced a climate as warm or even warmer than today (116–130 kya) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. Such an environment could have been suitable for the development and transmission of heartworms via mosquito vectors. Following the warm climates of the last interglacial period, the Earth began to cool. By Marine Isotope Stage 4 (58–72 kya), large continental ice sheets had formed across North America, Beringia, and northern Eurasia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. These ice sheets separated ancient canid populations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>, potentially fragmenting the associated ancient heartworm population. This time period was associated with a fall in Ne, particularly in the USA samples, but for all populations, a considerable decrease was observed immediately before or during dog domestication, which occurred shortly afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). This fragmentation would have reduced gene flow for extended periods, explaining the continental grouping of samples in our study. Further insights might be obtained by exploring the presence of heartworm DNA in the remains of ancient canids; if successfully extracted, these ancient worm DNA sequences may fill in the temporal and geographic gaps needed to understand heartworm divergence in more detail. Similarly, further sampling in unstudied regions, including South America and Africa, and finer sampling within Asia, would enhance our understanding of heartworms’ evolutionary history.</p><p id="P17">Considering global warming and cooling cycles, the fragmentation of canid and heartworm populations would have occurred multiple times. We found evidence of secondary admixture between heartworms from Asia and the USA after the initial population divergence, evident from both the admixture analyses and gene flow between populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>; delta m = 3.4; all tree migration edges are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). <italic>D</italic>-statistics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b,c</xref>) provided further support for excessive allele sharing between the USA and Asia relative to that between the USA and other regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). This admixture may reflect multiple waves of dispersal with canids across the Bering Land Bridge in the Late Pleistocene during periods of ice sheet contraction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> between 11–30 kya and 60–70 kya. Our population demographic data provide some support for this hypothesis, at least during 11–30 kya, when USA and Asian populations experienced a close overlap in Ne before undergoing rapid and distinct divergence thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The origin and spread of heartworms in Australia</title><p id="P18">Heartworms are endemic in Australia, but the mechanisms and timing of their arrival in the country have remained an enigma. Consistent with the modern human dispersal hypothesis, one means of introduction could have been after European colonisation that began ~235 years ago. However, considering our genetic evidence of older, canid-mediated dispersal, a more likely scenario is that heartworms were brought to Australia via dingos. The dingo, an ancient lineage from Asia, was the only canid present on the Australian continent until European settlement. Recent morphometric analysis indicates an East Asian origin of dingoes via Melanesia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>, whereas genetic studies suggest that dingoes likely came from Island Southeast Asia and were brought to Australia by humans between 5 and 12 kya<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">Multiple lines of evidence support the introduction of heartworms into Australia via Asia. Both admixture and TreeMix analyses highlighted the close relationship, evidenced by partial or complete admixture profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>) and mutual monophyly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) between Asian samples and samples collected along the East Coast of Australia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Calculations of <italic>D</italic><sub>XY</sub> showed that AUS-ASIA (<italic>D</italic><sub>XY</sub>[mean] = 5.13×10<sup>-4</sup>) was the second least divergent pair (after EUR-CENAM, which indicates a much more recent dispersal pattern; see below), suggesting that Australian worms are more closely related to those in Asia than elsewhere (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 10a</xref>). <italic>D</italic>-statistics solidified this relationship by showing excessive allele sharing between the two continents relative to that between Australia and other regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). These findings suggest an Asian origin of Australian heartworms, likely transported with a dingo host, rather than through introduction by European colonisation. Finally, samples from Australia and Asia exhibit very similar population demographic trajectories of Ne until 10–20 kya, which begin to diverge in the post-domestication period, consistent with the timing of the arrival of dingos rather than importation with European colonisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3c</xref>). We note that our sampling of Asian heartworms was from Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia, which are geographically distinct from Indonesia, from which dogs would have entered Australia from approximately 5 to 12 kya, potentially explaining the small discrepancy in the estimated time of divergence. Sampling across a broader geographic region, particularly throughout the Indonesian archipelago and Melanesia, could bridge the gap between our Australian and Asian samples and provide further granularity of the Asia–Australia divergence, potentially coinciding more closely with the timeline of dingo arrival.</p><p id="P20">Considering the extensive sampling along the north–south transect of eastern Australia, we sought to identify factors that might explain the current genetic diversity. Australian heartworms were the second most genetically diverse population globally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Within Australia, diversity was highest in Lockhart River (Pi[mean] = 8.12×10<sup>-4</sup>) and lowest in Rockhampton (Pi[mean] = 2.15×10<sup>-4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Heartworms from the northern state of Queensland were highly admixed, with two unique sources of ancestry not found on any other continent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). Interestingly, ten of 16 heartworms from Sydney, the southernmost site, had a single fixed ancestry that was detected in Queensland samples. Another four Sydney heartworms had a different fixed ancestry identical to that found in Asia, potentially reflecting modern movement, though the exact cause remains unclear. Previously, it was believed that heartworm cases in temperate Sydney and broader New South Wales were primarily caused by infected pets or mosquitoes travelling down from tropical and subtropical Queensland <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup>, where climates are more favourable to heartworm transmission. However, our nuclear PCA showed a large cluster of samples primarily from Queensland, alongside two distinct clusters from Sydney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). This suggests that Sydney heartworms may not necessarily originate from Queensland, as previously believed. Further investigations are required to determine whether there are local endemic populations of heartworms in Sydney. Differences in <italic>D</italic><sub>XY</sub> and <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> between Australian heartworm subpopulations were subtle, showing no clear relationship between genetic and geographical distance as might be expected for a vector-borne parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e, f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Modern heartworm dispersal between Europe and Central America</title><p id="P21">Our genomic analysis revealed a close genetic relationship between worms in Europe and Central America. This finding was most evident in our PCA of nuclear SNPs, where samples from Greece, Italy, and Romania clustered with those from Costa Rica and Panama (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In addition, estimates of <italic>D</italic><sub>XY</sub> revealed that EUR-CENAM (<italic>D</italic><sub>XY</sub>[mean] = 4.95×10<sup>-4</sup>) was the least divergent compared with other populations. Admixture analysis using NGSadmix further supported this trend as the European and Central American samples shared high levels of ancestry at lower <italic>K</italic> values (<italic>K</italic> = 2, 3, and 5; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). Although increasing <italic>K</italic> helped to differentiate worms from these two continents, low levels of admixture were still present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). These findings were corroborated using <italic>D</italic>-statistics which provided strong evidence of excessive allele sharing between heartworms from Central America and Europe relative to that between Central America and other regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). These findings support a modern migration event between European and Central American heartworms which took place after dog domestication.</p><p id="P22">One plausible modern migration event between Europe and Central America was the transatlantic transportation of domestic animals, including dogs, during the European colonisation of the Americas, which began in the late 15th century. Animals introduced to the Americas during the Age of Discovery were primarily livestock species, including cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, horses, and mules. However, dogs such as greyhounds and mastiffs were also introduced for hunting, guarding, protection, shepherding, and battle purposes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. The introduction of European dogs into the Americas is perhaps best documented from Columbus’ voyages, with historical records indicating the presence of at least 20 dogs on board during the second voyage to Hispaniola <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore, infected dogs from Europe may have transported local strains of this parasite to the Americas. Alternatively, the shared ancestry between European and Central American heartworms could result from the more recent migration of humans and their pets. Although there is some variation in Ne between EUR and CENAM over deeper evolutionary timescales, there is considerable overlap; moreover, there is a striking divergence in Ne between populations around 500 years ago (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3d</xref>), consistent with our hypothesis that there is a recent connection between these two populations over the past few centuries that have since diverged.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p id="P23">Our transcontinental genome-wide analysis of heartworm parasites has revealed a much deeper origin and dispersal history than previously understood, allowing us to propose new hypotheses on the evolutionary history of heartworms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Rather than being solely driven by human-mediated dispersal of dogs over the past few hundred years, we found that ancestral canid hosts played a pivotal role in the evolution and dissemination of heartworms around the world. Heartworms have evolved to exploit a unique niche in the heart and bloodstream of canids, an environment that has likely remained unchanged over millions of years between hosts. In the absence of niche competition, heartworms could be a relic of the past, which, until recently, had little need for further adaptation.</p><p id="P24">Anthropogenic influence is, however, likely to shape heartworm diversity more rapidly than ever before. For example, extensive drug treatment is already associated with resistance, particularly in the USA; climate change is expected to shift populations of parasites and their vectors into higher latitudes; and increasing global connectivity of people and their pets will all influence the distribution and adaptation of heartworms. Therefore, understanding the global genomic landscape of these parasites, as demonstrated here, is vital for developing effective surveillance and control strategies in the future. Our data indicate that such surveillance and control strategies should account for geographical variation between parasite populations and be aware of transmission within and between populations to maximise sustainable parasite control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Sample collection</title><p id="P25">A total of 120 individual adult <italic>Dirofilaria immitis</italic> were obtained from Australia (<italic>n</italic> = 43), the USA (<italic>n</italic> = 37), Panama (<italic>n</italic> = 14), Greece (<italic>n</italic> = 12), Thailand (<italic>n</italic> = 6), Italy (<italic>n</italic> = 3), Romania (<italic>n</italic> = 3), Costa Rica (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and Malaysia (<italic>n</italic> = 1).

NGSadmix (-minMaf 0.02 -misTol 0.9) was performed using multiple combinations of different clusters (<italic>K</italic> = 2 to 10) and seeds (1 to 5).

To generate the input data, VCFtools was used to filter the cohort SNV VCF file (--max-missing 1), retaining only autosomal data and the same samples as in the previous variant-calling filtration step. The variants were pruned for linkage disequilibrium (10 kb windows, shifting by 10 kb, LD threshold 0.1), and the VCF file was converted to the appropriate format using custom scripts (‘ldPruning.sh’ and ‘vcf2treemix.sh’) obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/speciationgenomics/scripts">https://github.com/speciationgenomics/scripts</ext-link>. TreeMix was run across a range of migration edges (0 to 5) and seeds (0 to 10), with <italic>D. ursi</italic> included as an outgroup.

Additional tools required for file conversion were VCFtools and PLINK (version 1.90b6.18 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>). qpDstat was used to perform <italic>D</italic>-statistic testing for all population pairs relative to the other populations (PopX), with <italic>D. ursi</italic> as the outgroup taxa. <italic>Z</italic>-scores with an absolute value &gt;3 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Population demography</title><p id="P39">We estimated the population size history of <italic>D. immitis</italic> using SMC++<sup>71</sup> (version 1.15.4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref></sup>). Samples from dog hosts in the filtered autosomal VCF were grouped by continent (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Asia, Australia, Central America, Europe, and USA) and analysed separately before being plotted together. First, a mask of the genome was performed to exclude non-variable sites, using <italic>bcftools query</italic> of the VCF to generate a bed file of variable positions and then <italic>bcftools subtract</italic> using a bed file of the genome to identify genomic positions not found in the VCF. Per population, vcftools was used to extract population-specific variants from the autosomal VCF file (--keep &lt;POP&gt;), ensuring no missing sites (--max-missing 1) and no HWE filter applied. Then, the filtered VCF file was converted to the SMC++ input format using <italic>smc++</italic> <italic>vcf2smc</italic> (including --mask missing_sites.bed.gz). <italic>vcf2smc</italic> was run on each chromosome individually (n = 4 autosomes), before a combined model was was fitted using <italic>smc++</italic> <italic>estimate</italic> with a timepoint range of 1 to 1,000,000 and the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> <italic>elegans</italic> mutation rate of 2.7×10<sup>-9</sup> per site per generation as a proxy for the <italic>D. immitis</italic> mutation rate, which is currently unknown. We acknowledge that without a specific <italic>D.</italic> <italic>immitis</italic> mutation rate, there will be some uncertainty in the population demographic models and that Ne at specific times may be over or underestimated; however, very few mutation rates have been determined for nematodes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref></sup>, and previous studies on parasitic worms have used the <italic>C. elegans</italic> rate as a default <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref></sup>. To understand the variance in the model output, we also iteratively ran <italic>smc++ vcf2smc</italic> and <italic>smc++</italic> <italic>estimate,</italic> but excluded one chromosome at a time, which allowed us to generate a confidence interval around the “all chromosome” model. To visualise the models, the <italic>smc++ plot</italic> command (-g -c) was used, with the -g parameter specifying the generation time of the target population. The generation time of <italic>D. immitis</italic> is not precisely known, but is estimated to take up to one year to produce offspring from an established infection. However, infections are rarely found in hosts &lt;1 year old, and the adult worms can live for up to 7 years in the host’s cardiopulmonary system. Furthermore, the development and transmission of this parasite are also highly dependent on local climate and the availability of vectors. To account for potential variability in the generation time of <italic>D. immitis</italic>, we tested multiple generation times (-g 1, 2.5, or 4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>), settling on a midpoint of 2.5 years for major comparisons.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Data 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS202415-supplement-Supplementary_Data_1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d113aAcDbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Data 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS202415-supplement-Supplementary_Data_2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d113aAcDcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS202415-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d113aAcDdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Julie Austin, Iris Cheadle, Constantin Constantinoiu, Carol Esson, Eloise Fenton, Linda Hayes, Tessa Mackie, Yissu Martinez, Sandi McClintock, Ilze Nel, Tony Phillis, Duncan Smith, and Jim Taylor for their generous provision of heartworm specimens for this study.
