Consequently, hyperactivation of PI3K and its downstream effector kinase, Akt, is observed in many human cancers. PH domain leucine-rich repeat-containing protein phosphatases (PHLPP), two paralogous members of the metal-dependent protein phosphatase family, have been reported as negative regulators of Akt signaling and, therefore, tumor suppressors. However, the stoichiometry and identity of the bound metal ion(s), mechanism of action, and enzymatic specificity of these proteins are not known. Seeking to fill these gaps in our understanding of PHLPP biology, we unexpectedly discovered that PHLPP2 has no catalytic activity against the regulatory phosphorylation sites of Akt, nor the generic substrate <italic>para</italic>-nitrophenylphosphate. Instead, we found that PHLPP2 is a pseudophosphatase with a single zinc ion bound in its catalytic center. Furthermore, we found that current cancer genomics data do not support the proposed role of PHLPP1 or PHLPP2 as tumor suppressors. Phylogenetic analyses revealed an ancestral phosphatase that arose more than 1000 Mya, but that lost activity at the base of the metazoan lineage. In summary, our results provide a molecular explanation for the inconclusive results that have hampered research on PHLPP and argue for a new focus on non-catalytic roles of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Cell and organismal growth depend on growth factors that activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) expressed on the surface of cells. RTK activation leads to the recruitment and activation of the small GTPase Ras and the lipid kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which synergistically drive the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) in the plasma membrane into the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>). PIP<sub>3</sub>, in turn, recruits and activates a number of effector proteins, including the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt and its upstream activator phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). PDK1 and Akt control essential aspects of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and metabolism, including glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). The lipid phosphatase and tumor suppressor, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), attenuates PI3K signaling by converting PIP<sub>3</sub> back into PIP<sub>2</sub>. Mutations in Ras and PI3K, as well as loss of PTEN are frequently observed in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Akt itself is also found mutated in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>) and the rare overgrowth disorder, Proteus Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Akt is an AGC kinase, consisting of a PIP<sub>3</sub>-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a kinase domain which bears two regulatory phosphorylation motifs. PDK1 phosphorylates Akt1 at T308 in its activation loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>), while mTORC2 is widely believed to phosphorylate S473 in its hydrophobic motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). A third phosphorylation site in the C-terminal tail, the turn motif, is constitutively phosphorylated and controls Akt stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Phosphorylation of T308 and S473 promote disorder-to-order transitions of their respective motifs, leading to Akt activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P4">PIP<sub>3</sub> turnover by PTEN leads to the dissociation and inactivation of Akt. An important, but poorly understood aspect of Akt inactivation is the dephosphorylation of T308 and S473 by protein phosphatases. T308 is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>), whereas S473 has been reported to be the target of the PH domain leucine-rich repeat-containing protein phosphatases PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). The original identification of PHLPP as an Akt phosphatase was guided by the hypothesis that, since S473 phosphorylation is growth factor or serum-sensitive, such a phosphatase might contain a PH domain. The PH domain would presumably target it to the same membranes where Akt is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). While PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 double knockout mice exhibit only a mild colitis resistance phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>), their proposed repressive effects on Akt signaling have led to their designation as tumor suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which these phosphatases target Akt for dephosphorylation and the structural basis for their specificity are currently unknown.</p><p id="P5">Here, we show that – in contrast to previous reports – PHLPP2 is actually a pseudophosphatase. We show that PHLPP2 has no activity in vitro against either phosphorylated T308 or S473 of Akt1, and that cancer genomics do not support a role for either PHLPP1 or PHLPP2 in cancer, which questions their designation as tumor suppressors in the PI3K/Akt pathway. We corroborate the absence of phosphatase activity by showing that PHLPP evolved from an ancestral phosphatase that lost activity in the metazoan ancestor. In summary, our results refute the notion that PHLPP is an Akt phosphatase, question efforts to pharmacologically target PHLPP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>), and establish a molecular and evolutionary basis for reassessing the biological roles of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 as pseudophosphatases.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>PHLPP2 exhibits no detectable activity against Akt</title><p id="P6">We expressed GST-tagged, full-length human PHLPP2 in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells and purified it to homogeneity by sequential affinity, ion exchange and size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). PHLPP2 was confirmed to be predominantly monomeric by mass photometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>) and the masses of all recombinant PHLPP2 constructs were verified by denaturing mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C-E</xref>). PHLPP2 and all mutants were confirmed to be properly folded by analytical size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1F</xref>) and thermal stability assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1G</xref>). Addition of EDTA to PHLPP2 did not affect its global thermal stability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Akt has been reported as a substrate of both PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> shows the structure of the kinase domain of Akt alongside the sequence motifs of its activation loop and hydrophobic motif. According to reports, PHLPP is specific for the hydrophobic motif (pS473). To test the activity of recombinant PHLPP2 against synthetic Akt phosphopeptides, we monitored phosphate production in a malachite green assay. As a control, we assayed a mutant of PHLPP2 (D1024N) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figures 1E</xref>), designed to abrogate catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Unexpectedly, PHLPP2<sup>D1024N</sup> exhibited comparable activity to wild-type PHLPP2 against the Akt1 activation loop peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). When assayed against both the activation loop and hydrophobic motif peptides, we detected very low, but variable activity from multiple independent preparations of wild-type PHLPP2. This activity, however, was entirely lost upon treatment of each preparation with 12.5 nM okadaic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref>), a highly specific PP2A/PP4/PP6 inhibitor and toxin produced by several species of dinoflagellate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Previous reports that PP2A dephosphorylates T308 of Akt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) are consistent with both the higher activity against the activation loop peptide and inhibition by okadaic acid. As a control, we assayed the activity of recombinant PP2A against both peptides, which exhibited a specific activity 50-fold greater than any of our PHLPP2 preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-F</xref>). Inhibition of all phosphatase activity in our PHLPP2 assays occurred despite PHLPP2 being present in molar excess over okadaic acid in all but one concentration. Finally, PHLPP2 exhibited no activity against either pT308 or pS473 of stoichiometrically phosphorylated full-length Akt1 [prepared according to ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>)] under the assay conditions of the study that reported PHLPP phosphatase activity for the first time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A-C</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Suspecting that recombinant PHLPP2 preparations may be contaminated with one or more phosphatases of the PP2A family, we subjected purified PHLPP2 to peptide fingerprinting mass spectrometry. While PHLPP2 was estimated to be more than 99.9% pure, peptides of all three subunits of <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> PP2A were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). A total of 13 unique peptides corresponding to the PP2A catalytic (C) subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>), A-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>) and B55 (B) regulatory subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>) were measured. With a mass of 157 kDa, the PP2A heterotrimer is very close in mass to PHLPP2 (147 kDa), such that they cannot be separated by size-exclusion chromatography. The identification of PP2A holoenzymes in recombinant PHLPP2 preparations explains the okadaic acid sensitivity of the observed phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C-D</xref>).</p><p id="P9">To assess whether contaminating phosphatase activity may have been the source of literature reports of PHLPP activity, we immunoprecipitated ectopically expressed V5-tagged PHLPP2 from HEK293 cells using V5 nanobody-conjugated magnetic beads and subjected the beads to a series of successive wash steps, while measuring phosphatase activity at each step in the absence and presence of okadaic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>). We observed that all of the measurable phosphatase could be successively washed away and that any residual activity could be inhibited by okadaic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>). In summary, we conclude that high purity preparations of recombinant PHLPP2 as well as PHLPP2 immunoprecipitated from mammalian cells can easily be contaminated with PP2A.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>PHLPP2 is a pseudophosphatase</title><p id="P10">To confirm that the activity detectable in our purified PHLPP2 came from contaminating PP2A, we modified our purification protocol to include the reverse affinity-based removal of PP2A. Produced by the cyanobacterium, <italic>Microcystis aeruginosa,</italic> microcystin-LR is a high-affinity irreversible inhibitor of PP1, PP2A, PP3, PP4 and PP6 phosphatases that forms a covalent bond to PP2A C269 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) and binds to PP2A in the same binding site as okadaic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). Microcystin-LR can be covalently coupled to sepharose beads to create phosphatase inhibitor beads (PIBs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). We confirmed that our PIBs were highly effective in enriching PP2A from PHLPP2-expressing Sf9 cell lysates by peptide fingerprinting mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). As a control we treated an equivalent lysate with 500 nM okadaic acid to inhibit all okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases. Since okadaic acid and microcystin-LR bind to the same pocket, PIBs should not enrich these phosphatases in the okadaic acid-treated control. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed a 1200-, 541- and 65-fold enrichment of the PP2A C, A and B subunits respectively. The three most enriched proteins correspond to the same three contaminating PP2A proteins observed in PHLPP2 preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2E</xref>). Importantly, recombinant PHLPP2 was not observed to be enriched over the control lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To remove contaminating PP2A from PHLPP2, we incubated the purified protein with PIBs following anion exchange chromatography and prior to size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Finally, we evaluated the capacity of PHLPP2 to dephosphorylate <italic>para</italic>-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP). PHLPP2 that had been purified via the scheme shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref> exhibited no activity against pNPP even in the absence of okadaic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). As a positive control, pNPP was robustly dephosphorylated by lambda phosphatase under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). Importantly, since lambda phosphatase depends on manganese ions for its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>), which is also the case for PP2C family phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>), this experiment explicitly rules out that PHLPP2 exhibits activity in the presence of millimolar concentrations of manganese. In summary, we were unable to detect any phosphatase activity associated with purified, PP2A-free PHLPP2.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>PHLPP2 is a zinc-binding protein with altered metal ion stoichiometry</title><p id="P12">Members of the metal-dependent family of protein phosphatases (PPM), exemplified by protein phosphatase Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Mn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent (PPM1A), depend on two or three divalent metal ions in their active site for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).

C799, though predicted to be solvent exposed, exhibited a high MMTS to IAA ratio, indicating that it is protected from alkylation under native conditions.

The presence of PHLPP homologs in distantly related eukaryotes such as amoebozoans and parabasalids, suggests that the PHLPP family emerged early in eukaryotic evolution, presumably following the fusion of an LRR protein with a PP2C family phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-B</xref>). The ancestral gene encoded all residues known to be required for catalytic activity, including coordination of the M1 and M2 metal ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). In the last common ancestor of opisthokonts (e. g., animals and fungi), around 1000 Mya, the ancestral LRR-PP2C gene gained a RA domain and was subsequently duplicated. Shortly thereafter, one copy of the gene gained a PH and a kinase domain giving rise to the PHLPP family, whereas the other paralog gained a class III adenylate cyclase (AC), resulting in the emergence of the Cyr1 family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Retention of PHLPP and Cyr1 in unicellular holozoans (<italic>P</italic> = 4.56×10<sup>-5</sup>, Δ log-likelihood = 114.7, approximately-unbiased (AU) test for monophyly), the closest unicellular relatives of animals, indicates that this duplication was followed by reciprocal loss of Cyr1 in metazoa and PHLPP in fungi. The ancestral Cyr1 was likely a pseudophosphatase given the lack of catalytic residues, but it later acquired a dimerization domain in fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-C</xref>). This contrasts with PHLPP, which only lost its active site in metazoa. Indeed, PHLPP homologs in unicellular holozoans not only encode active site residues but in some cases include a C-terminal kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A-C</xref>). Nonetheless, PHLPP was conserved throughout animal evolution before giving rise to PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 following a duplication event in a common ancestor of vertebrates. To better understand the impact of these evolutionary changes on PHLPP structure, we employed AlphaFold2 to predict the three-dimensional structures of representative proteins from across the LRR-PP2C phylogeny. The LRR-PP2C phosphatase of <italic>Entamoeba</italic> is structurally consistent with each of the evolutionarily descended derivatives, including vertebrate PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 and fungal Cyr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Since RAS binding to the RA domain of Cyr1 is not predicted to induce any conformational change in the RA domain, an allosteric mechanism can, most likely, be ruled out. Class III adenylate cyclases, of which Cyr1 is a member, depend on the homo-, hetero-, or pseudo-dimerization of two cyclase domains for cAMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Farnesylation of RAS is essential for Cyr1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), suggesting that RAS.GTP-dependent recruitment of Cyr1 to the plasma membrane may drive dimerization of the Cyr1 adenylate cyclase domain.

This model therefore reconciles the mode and stoichiometry of binding of CAP to Cyr1.

Like the adenylate cyclase of Cyr1, this kinase domain was appended to the PHLPP C-terminus and may be positionally flexible, as indicated by AlphaFold2 predicted alignment error (PAE) plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). The kinase domain was subsequently lost in the metazoan ancestor, concurrently with the phosphatase active site. The functional implications of this domain remain unclear, but could imply an ancestral connection between PHLPP and AGC kinases. Despite the apparent pseudogenization of PHLPP, surface conservation maps of vertebrate PHLPP indicate two regions of high conservation: one on the surface of the PH domain and one at the interface of the LRR and PP2C domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). Importantly, whilst the RA domain has been retained in vertebrate PHLPP, its binding to RAS has not. In fact, the surface of the RA domain used by Cyr1 to bind RAS exhibits the highest sequence divergence of any region in PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>). The acquisition of a PH domain may have substituted for RAS binding, although in the unicellular holozoan, <italic>Corallichytrium limacisporum</italic>, the PH domain appears to have been lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting a period of functional redundancy.

Although genetic ablation of either or both genes in mice is not lethal and results in no reported predisposition to cancer, an evolutionary pressure of some sort has retained both PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 in vertebrates. Efforts to determine the biological pathways that PHLPP participates in will undoubtedly require a focus on its tissue expression patterns, subcellular localization, and interactome. Many clues almost certainly lie in its evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p id="P35">Recombinant human PHLPP2 and mutants thereof were expressed as N-terminal GST fusion proteins in baculovirus-infected <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (Sf9) cells using a pFastBac Dual vector.

After 1 h incubation at 4°C, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 39,000 g, 30 min, 4°C. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione Sepharose 4B resin for 2 h, 4°C. After washing with lysis buffer, PHLPP2 was cleaved off the beads with TEV protease overnight. The eluate from the beads was then applied to a 1 ml HiTrap Q column (Cytiva) and PHLPP2 was eluted with a linear salt gradient. Fractions containing PHLPP2 were pooled, concentrated to 0.5 ml and applied to a Superdex 200 30/300 column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP. The peak fractions containing PHLPP2 were pooled, concentrated, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C.

After dilution, the samples were sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica chips and immediately transferred into a BAL-TEC MED020 high-vacuum evaporator equipped with electron guns. While rotating, the samples were coated with 0.7 nm platinum at an angle of 4–5°, followed by 10 nm carbon at 90°. The obtained replicas were floated off from the mica chips and picked up on 400 mesh Cu/Pd grids. Grids were inspected in an FEI Morgagni 286D transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV. Electron micrographs were acquired using an 11 megapixel Morada CCD camera from Olympus-SIS.

Statement</title></caption><p>PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 have previously been reported as protein phosphatases that specifically inactivate Akt, a pro-growth and survival kinase hyperactivated in many human cancers. Unexpectedly, we found that purified PHLPP2 has no detectable enzymatic activity in vitro, an observation which can be rationalized by its unusual active site, which has diverged significantly from that of canonical metal-dependent phosphatases. Furthermore, we show that cancer genomics do not support a role for either PHLPP1 or PHLPP2 in cancer. Our findings argue for the exploration of alternative hypotheses regarding the role of PHLPP in Akt signaling and cancer, with a focus on its non-catalytic functions.</p></boxed-text><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>PHLPP2 exhibits no detectable activity against Akt.</title><p>A.
