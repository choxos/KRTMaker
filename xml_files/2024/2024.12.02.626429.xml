Within somatosensory cortex, responses were taken from pial vessels inside the whisker barrel region ([WBR]: “whisker artery” and “whisker vein”), a large vein from the sagittal sinus adjacent to the WBR (draining vein), and meningeal vessels from the dura mater (which do not penetrate cortical tissue).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Results</title><p id="P6">We demonstrate that locomotion evokes an initial decrease in total hemoglobin (HbT) within the draining vein before the increase in HbT within WBR vessels. The locomotion event size influences the magnitude of the HbT increase in the pial vessels of the WBR, but not of the early HbT decrease within the draining veins. Following locomotion onset, an early HbT decrease was also observed in the overlying meningeal vessels, which unlike within the cortex did not go on to exceed baseline HbT levels during the remainder of the locomotion response. We show that locomotion-induced hemodynamic responses are altered in disease in the draining vein and whisker artery, suggesting this could be an important neurodegeneration biomarker.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P7">This initial reduction in HbT within the draining and meningeal veins potentially serves as a ‘space saving’ mechanism, allowing for large increases in cortical HbT associated with locomotion.

A continuous supply of blood is controlled by neurons communicating with cells of the neurovascular unit, ultimately resulting in the dilation of blood vessels across active regions of the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. This relationship between neural activity and a subsequent increase in blood flow is known as neurovascular coupling (NVC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. Over recent years, knowledge about the pathways controlling this important mechanism has increased exponentially<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. However, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the functional role of NVC across the vascular tree, which is essential for targeting pathological mechanisms along the vascular network associated with the impact of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. The brain itself is a fluid filled volume, enclosed within a hard case (the skull)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, and large intracranial pressure (ICP) changes can be ultimately devastating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. However, it is largely unknown how space is created within the brain to allow blood flow increases to meet metabolic demands.</p><p id="P9">Over the past decade, NVC research has transitioned from using acutely anesthetized preparations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> to performing studies in awake, behaving animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. While awake imaging studies avoid the potential confounds caused by anaesthetics, these studies have their own confounds associated with behavior, including the impact of locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, an array of behaviors can be tracked<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, and this monitoring has allowed the field to gain a more in-depth understanding of how behaviors such as locomotion may impact NVC. For example, locomotion has been shown to induce large increases in blood flow in pial arteries and veins at its onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>, and long-lasting constrictions in dural vessels, which lie superficial to the brain surface in the outermost layer of the meninges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. It is thought that dural vessels likely constrict during locomotion to accommodate the locomotion-associated increased volume of arteries and veins within the brain, although it could be a myogenic response to increased blood pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Prior work has also explored an alternative explanation of how ‘space’ is created in the brain during such large increases in cerebral blood volume (CBV), with Krieger et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> suggesting that CBV changes may be aided via the exchange of water from capillaries into neighboring tissue. However, it is worth noting that this idea is based upon modeled data and experimental support is lacking.</p><p id="P10">Despite the dynamic regulation of blood volume across the vascular tree, many vascular studies have focused on the smaller diameter cerebral blood vessels and capillaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, and there has not yet been a systematic investigation into the effects on the large midline pial veins that drain into the sagittal sinus (referred to as draining veins)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. These draining veins are distinct from the cortical pial veins (e.g. here we also record from cortical “whisker” veins in the whisker barrel region of somatosensory cortex (S1)), which are part of a connected network across the cerebral microvascular bed. The anatomy of the vessels within the cerebral microvascular bed has been well characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>, and distinct and interconnected segments have been defined (pial arterioles, penetrating arterioles, precapillary sphincters, transitional capillaries, mid-capillaries, post-capillaries and venules). Although generally assumed to be passive, remote bystanders of the vasculature, the large surface cerebral veins potentially play an important role in NVC. Early work which advocated for a passive role for veins indicated that they acted as ‘balloons’, responding only to pressure changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></sup>, and more recent investigations have shown weak alpha-smooth muscle actin labeling in large cortical venules, indicating limited contractile potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>. However, there is some evidence that veins could in fact play a more ‘active’ role. For example, Driver et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> reported the observation of pulsatility within small cerebral veins, and veins are thought to play a role in the exchange of nutrients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>, the regulation of immune cell infiltration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, and clearance pathways, with research suggesting that solutes empty along the venous circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">To better understand how locomotion impacts hemodynamic responses across the vasculature, and whether this response is impacted by disease, we studied HbT changes (reflective of CBV) in arteries and veins from the cortical surface (within the whisker barrel region of S1), as well as veins from the sagittal sinus (draining veins) and dura mater (meningeal veins) in wild-type, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), atherosclerosis, and mixed-model (AD/atherosclerosis) mice using 2D-optical imaging spectroscopy. Initially, we collapsed the dataset across the disease groups to focus specifically on the phenomenon of the draining vein, which to our knowledge has not previously been investigated in-depth. In response to locomotion we showed an initial fast decrease in HbT in the large branches of the surface draining veins, that preceded the large increase in HbT across all vascular compartments driven by the pial arteries (“whisker artery” and “whisker vein” from inside the whisker barrel region in S1). We found that this fast draining vein HbT decrease was robust, as it was not modulated by the size of the corresponding locomotion event. We subsequently expanded our investigation of the impact of locomotion on surface vasculature to include the meningeal vessels from within the dura mater. Whilst an initial decrease in HbT was observed in both the draining and meningeal veins, interestingly, the subsequent recovery period was different between vessel types as the HbT changes did not exceed baseline levels in the meningeal vessels, but eventually showed an increase above baseline within the draining vein, likely due to the propagation of hemodynamic responses across the cortical vascular network. When we then investigated the impact of disease on the draining vein and pial vessel (whisker artery and whisker vein) responses, we showed a larger HbT increase in the artery region from the activated whisker barrel in the atherosclerosis mice versus the AD mice, and a larger HbT decrease in the draining vein in the mixed model (AD/atherosclerosis) group compared to the AD mice. Therefore, the initial draining vein response represents a previously unreported, fast, remote neurovascular signal that may be important in the overall regulation of NVC, especially to large bilateral increases in brain metabolism, which may be indicative of venous dilatory capacity and thus may be important to study in the context of neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec id="S7" sec-type="methods"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><label>2.1</label><title>Animals</title><p id="P12">118 imaging sessions taken from 40 male and female mice aged between 9-12m were included in the study. Four groups of mice were used: the APP/PS1 (B6.C3-Tg (APPswe, PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/ Mmjax #34829)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> Alzheimer’s model, wild-type (WT) littermates, an atherosclerosis model (male only): WT-littermates injected with rAAV8-mPCSK9-D377Y (6 × 10<sup>12</sup> virus molecules/ml) (Vector Core, Chapel Hill, NC) at 11 weeks of age (i/v or i/p + a western diet from 12 weeks (21% fat, 0.15% cholesterol, 0.03% cholate, 0.296% sodium; #829100, Special Diet Services UK)), and a mixed disease group (male only): APP/PS1 mice injected with rAAV8-mPCSK9-D377Y (6 × 10<sup>12</sup> virus molecules/ml) (Vector Core, Chapel Hill, NC) at 11 weeks of age (i/v or i/p + a western diet from 12 weeks). Prior to surgery mice were housed in groups where possible, and were singly housed if there was no available littermate. After surgery all mice were individually housed to ensure the whiskers and head-plate with thinned skull remained intact for imaging. Food and water were available ad-libitum (western diet was restricted to 5g per day) and mice were housed on a 12hr dark/light cycle (lights on 06:00-18:00). All experiments were carried out during the ‘lights-on’ hours. All procedures were approved by the UK Home Office and in agreement with the guidelines and scientific regulations of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 with additional approval received from the University of Sheffield licensing committee and ethical review board. The following study is reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines. The experimenter was blinded to genotype (where possible) during experiments, and blinded during analysis. No a priori sample size calculations were conducted.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><label>2.2</label><title>Surgery</title><p id="P13">Animals were anesthetized with ketamine (50mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.65mg/kg) (s/c) with isoflurane used to maintain surgical plane of anesthesia (0.5-0.8% in 100% oxygen). Carprofen (10mg/kg) was administered prior to a scalpel being used to remove hair from the head. Animals were positioned in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments) and eyes protected with Viscotears (Novartis). Body temperature was monitored and maintained at 37 degrees C with the use of a rectal thermometer and a homeothermic blanket (Harvard Apparatus). Iodine and bupivacaine (50-100mcL at 0.025%) was applied prior to revealing the skull. Suture lines were covered with cyanoacrylate glue and a dental scraper was used to score the contralateral side of the skull, to increase headplate stability. A dental drill was used to thin the bone over the right somatosensory cortex (∼4mm<sup>2</sup>). The skull was thinned until the pial vasculature was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). Cyanoacrylate glue was spread across the thinned region. A metal headplate was attached using dental cement (Superbond C &amp; B; Sun Medical). Atipamezole (2mg/kg in 0.3ml warm sterile saline s/c) was given at the end of the procedure to reverse the effects of medetomidine. Following surgery, mice were placed in an incubator (29 degrees C) and monitored. Post-surgery, mice were housed individually and given at least one week to recover prior to habituation and imaging. Mice were closely monitored for weight loss and signs of pain for 3 days post-surgery and given carprofen (10mg/kg) in jelly for at least 1-day post-surgery.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><label>2.3</label><title>2-Dimensional Optical Imaging Spectroscopy (2D-OIS) in Awake Mice</title><p id="P14">One week after surgery mice were habituated to the awake imaging set up via increasing exposure to the experimenter and experimental apparatus (see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Mice were briefly anesthetized with isoflurane (3-4%) to get them onto the awake imaging apparatus. All mice underwent between 1 and 4 2D-optical imaging spectroscopy (2D-OIS) sessions lasting approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour, which included the collection of 750 second spontaneous experiments where mice were head-fixed on top of a spherical treadmill with an optical motion sensor attached so that the impact of locomotion on hemodynamic responses could be assessed.</p><p id="P15">Widefield imaging was used to investigate blood volume changes across the surface vasculature (in somatosensory cortex and overlying dura matter). 2D-OIS uses light to assess changes in oxygenated (HbO), deoxygenated (HbR) and total hemoglobin (HbT) in the surface vessels of the cortex. To measure cortical hemodynamics, four different wavelengths of light (494 ± 20 nm, 560 ± 5 nm, 575 ± 14 nm and 595 ± 5 nm) were shone on to the thinned window, using a Lambda DG-4 high-speed galvanometer (Sutter Instrument Company, USA). A Dalsa 1M60 CCD camera was used to capture remitted light at 184 × 184 pixels, at a 32 Hz frame rate, this provided a resolution of ∼ 75 µm.</p><p id="P16">2D-OIS can also be used to create 2D spatial maps of micromolar changes in HbO, HbR and HbT, revealing the vasculature of the cortex. This is achieved by using the path length scale algorithm (PLSA) to complete a spectral analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. The PLSA works by using the modified Beer Lambert Law, with a path-length correction factor, as well as predicted absorption value of HbT, HbO and HbR. The relative concentration estimates were acquired from baseline values, where the concentration of hemoglobin within tissue was estimated as 100 µM, and tissue saturation of oxygen estimated at 80% in the whisker region, 90% in the whisker artery (art), 70% in the whisker vein (wv), 80% in the parenchyma, 70% in the draining vein (dv) and 70% in the meningeal vein (mn).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><label>2.4</label><title>Regions of Interest (ROI) from 2D spatial maps</title><p id="P17">Custom, in-house MATLAB scripts were used to create ROIs from 2D spatial maps generated using 2D-OIS. A whisker region was generated by selecting the region of the cortex with the largest change in HbT to a 5Hz 2s whisker stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> directed towards the left side whiskers (due to the thinned window being on the right side of the skull) in experiments conducted prior to the spontaneous locomotion recordings. This allowed for identification of the whisker barrel region within the somatosensory cortex. The code assessed pixels as being ‘active’ if their value was &gt;1.5 STD across the whole of the spatial map. Therefore, the whisker ROI represented the area of the cortex with the largest HbT response to a 2s whisker stimulation. A ‘whisker artery’ (a pial artery inside the already defined whisker region) and ‘whisker vein’ (a pial vein inside the already defined whisker region) were then manually selected from inside the whisker ROI based on the identification of vessels from their morphology. The above was completed for each imaging session, with care taken to select the same whisker artery and vein across days for each individual mouse. In order to generate the draining vein ROI, the spatial images taken during a representative locomotion event were loaded into our in-house software within MATLAB, and the draining vein ROI manually selected based on a principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the pixels showing the greatest changes during locomotion. The draining vein was a large cerebral vein, protruding from the midline which was outside of the ‘whisker region’. The meningeal vessels were chosen from a subset of the experiments, again using PCA analysis, which often revealed the vessel in the same PCA as the draining vein in the midline of the cranial window.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><label>2.5</label><title>Data Analysis</title><p id="P18">For the spontaneous recording taken during each imaging session, a continuous trace was generated for the locomotion data, and hemodynamic (HbO, HbR, HbT) responses across the whisker artery, whisker vein, and draining vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b-c</xref>). For each recording spatial maps were generated (see representative example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>), where the PCA analysis revealed distinct responses in the draining veins (emerging from the sagittal sinus on the left side of the image), and the whisker barrel region (indicated by the red pixels) following locomotion onset. Where visible, a continuous hemodynamic trace was also extracted for the meningeal vein (57 sessions from 21 mice). A timed trigger point was generated for both the locomotion (recorded using optical motion sensor spherical treadmill) and hemodynamic (recorded using 2D-OIS equipment) traces in order to temporally align the corresponding traces. The locomotion trace was plotted in arbitrary units which displayed stationary periods as zeros, and movements as increasingly larger integers relating to the speed of the treadmill. Locomotion events (n=2343 total) were manually detected from the continuous time series plots, and the onset of each locomotion event marked and indexed using an in-house MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI). Both locomotion and hemodynamic traces were cut around the 5s preceding and 20s following the onset of the locomotion event. All locomotion and hemodynamic traces were normalized to their own baseline period using the following equation:

For hemodynamic data, responses were then converted to a % change from baseline by multiplying by 100.</p><p id="P20">For each detected locomotion event and corresponding hemodynamic trace, the corresponding animal ID, imaging session ID, vessel type (whisker artery, whisker vein, draining vein, meningeal vein), and disease group label were extracted to allow for between group comparisons. A custom-built in-house MATLAB function was used to extract the time series metrics across groups (e.g. vessel types, locomotion conditions, or disease model) including the area under the curve, maximum peak, time to maximum peak, minima, and time to minima – which were assessed for the 0-5s after locomotion onset. The area under the curve was calculated using the ‘trapz’ function in MATLAB, and the maximum peak or minima by detecting the largest positive or negative value and calculating the average for the 0.25 seconds either side of this value (to reduce the impact of ‘noise spikes’). The time to peak was the time taken (in seconds) to reach this maximum (or minimum) value. As larger peak values would impact this timing calculation (as differences in timing could just reflect larger maximum peak or minima values), a normalized speed metric was calculated by dividing the size of the peak (maximum or minima (absolute values taken to avoid confounds of integers below zero), % HbT change) by the time to reach this value (seconds), meaning a larger positive value reflects a larger HbT value being divided by a smaller time value.

This observation occurred prior to increases in HbT within the pial artery and vein in the whisker barrel region and, unlike these HbT increases, was not impacted by the magnitude of the locomotion event. Given the rapid nature of this HbT decrease, which precedes the eventual HbT influx induced by locomotion, we propose it as the “B of the Bang” for neurovascular coupling (a phrase coined by British sprinter Linford Christie, when he emphasized he does not start his races merely at the “bang” of the pistol)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>. The HbT decrease observed in the draining vein was also different to that seen in meningeal vessels (as previously reported by Gao et al., 2016<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>), as the meningeal vessels did not show the subsequent increase in HbT above baseline levels associated with the impact of locomotion. We also assessed whether this initial decrease in HbT within the draining vein was affected by pathological conditions, observing that disease group and vessel type interacted for both the HbT maximum peak and minima, as AD mice showed a smaller HbT increase in the whisker artery versus atherosclerosis mice, and a smaller HbT minima in the draining vein versus the mixed AD/atherosclerosis mice.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><label>4.2</label><title>Comparison to previous studies</title><p id="P30">Whilst other groups investigating the impact of locomotion on pial and dural vessels have reported the dural constriction at the onset of locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>, until now no other studies have reported the fast, initial HbT decrease in the large draining veins of the sagittal sinus. Previous work investigating the locomotion-induced meningeal constriction showed that the response in these vessels was related to changes in intracranial pressure, and was distinct from pial vessel responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. In a follow-up study from the same group, a widefield imaging approach (similar to 2D-OIS) was used to assess the longitudinal effects of locomotion and respiration on cerebral oxygenation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>. Whilst the authors do not report an initial decrease in blood volume in the draining veins at the onset of locomotion, representative spatial images shown in their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2f</xref> indicate the draining vein (bottom of image) having a response very similar to those observed in our study.</p><p id="P31">Additionally, Zhang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup> developed a new method of fast kilohertz two-photon imaging in awake mice. As part of their methodological approach they investigated the diameter of the large pial veins close to the sagittal sinus (i.e. the draining veins). They reported sharp constrictions in vein diameter in the awake animal at multiple time points but did not correlate this with behaviors such as locomotion. Taken together, these results suggest that, in response to locomotion, prior to a large increase in bilateral perfusion, large pial draining veins reduce their size. Further research using bilateral cranial windows and simultaneous measurements of neuronal activity, potentially using GCAMP imaging technologies will help understand this response further with respect to brain metabolism.</p><p id="P32">Studying the large draining and meningeal veins has important implications for enhancing understanding of the brain’s glymphatic waste drainage system, as it is postulated that waste may be cleared along the venous circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup> to the downstream lymphatic network (associated with the large sagittal vessels exiting to the meninges)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup>. Although this clearance process is not fully understood and controversies surrounding the existing mechanisms still exist, the oscillation of blood vessel diameter is thought to be important, as an interruption of vascular oscillations results in reduced clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>, and may lead to an increase in Aβ accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Hence investigations of the dilation capacity and blood volume responses across the relevant vascular segments may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms relevant for glymphatic drainage in aging and neurodegeneration. In this study we show an effect of disease in the draining vein locomotion-induced haemodynamic response, as mixing atherosclerosis and AD resulted in a larger HbT decrease versus in the AD only model, which could have important implications for the impact of co-morbid disease mechanisms on glymphatic drainage systems.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><label>4.3</label><title>Limitations</title><p id="P33">Whilst we hypothesized that the early decrease in HbT within the large draining veins of the brain potentially occurred due to making more ‘space’ within the brain for the subsequent large increases in HbT induced by spontaneous locomotion, as we did not measure intracranial pressure during these experiments we cannot make any causal inferences about pressure changes within the brain when these early responses occur. However, Gao and colleagues (2016)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> did conduct extensive experiments assessing ICP changes in awake, behaving mice. They reported that ICP increases were observed during locomotion, these occurred rapidly and returned to baseline values once locomotion ceased. They further reported that when fitting the data to a linear convolution model the ICP increases occurred just prior to locomotion. Therefore, it could be suggested that the decrease in HbT within the large draining veins may be explained by increases in ICP compressing these large veins to make space for the subsequent large increase in HbT that follows locomotion. As we used 2D-Optical imaging spectroscopy, we were unable to explicitly measure whether there was a constriction across all the draining veins recorded (due to limited spatial resolution). Therefore, it would be informative to investigate the above findings using 2-photon microscopy, and in future follow-up studies we plan to explicitly measure vessel dynamics and investigate absolute blood flow changes within these vessels.</p><p id="P34">We also had no measure of neural activity within the study, meaning we could not capture brain metabolism changes in response to locomotion comprehensively. It would be beneficial to establish how neural activity is affected by spontaneous locomotion and the relationship this may have with the draining vein. Other studies have investigated how neural activity is impacted by spontaneous locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. However, it would be especially interesting to focus on neuronal responses close to the draining vein. For instance, future work to conduct similar experiments using GCaMP mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref></sup> in order to investigate neural activity and hemodynamics concurrently in awake mice may give a deeper insight on neural activity corresponding to hemodynamic responses within the draining veins of the brain.</p><p id="P35">Furthermore, beyond just locomotion, it has been suggested that it is important to track the range of behaviors of the awake mouse such as arousal state, fidgeting, whisking, pupil diameter, or breathing rate, which have all been implicated as important modulators of cerebral hemodynamic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>, and in the case of breathing rate may impact oxygenation status independently of underlying neural activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P36">It has also been suggested that very early vascular responses may represent artifacts, potentially as a result of the startle response of the animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. The animals used in this study underwent extensive habituation to the experimental set-up prior to recording, and the spontaneous locomotion trials were created from individual walking events during a trial in which there were no whisker stimulations. It would be odd to suggest that the animal walking would cause itself to startle. Locomotion is not a reflex response and in order for the mouse to move, the animal has to initiate this response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>, therefore making it very unlikely that these findings are the effects of the startle response.</p></sec><sec id="S23" sec-type="conclusions"><label>4.4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P37">Our paper demonstrates the importance of monitoring locomotion during awake hemodynamic imaging, as we have shown that spontaneous locomotion onset impacts hemodynamic responses differentially across the vascular network. Understanding where and how different vascular functions are supported across the vascular tree is vital to understanding how the different sections may be impacted, or targeted, during disease or aging. We suggest that this HbT decrease observed in the draining veins may be an important ‘space-saving’ mechanism involved in NVC and may allow for the large increase in HbT that follows locomotion, and that this mechanism is enhanced in mixed model atherosclerosis/AD mice (compared to AD only). This finding relating to an increased HbT decrease in the draining vein of the mixed disease model could be particularly relevant for the impact of disease on glymphatic clearance pathways. Further studies are warranted using 2-photon microscopy to confirm whether the early reduction in HbT within the draining vein is the result of a constriction of large draining veins at the onset of locomotion. This research shows that large cerebral veins may be important components of the neurovascular unit, rather than passive bi-standers or balloons waiting to be inflated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary data</label><media xlink:href="EMS201650-supplement-Supplementary_data.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d26aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Rachel Sandy at the University of Sheffield for her technical expertise with IV injections as well as the entire BSU team for their husbandry expertise.

The whisker barrel region is indicated by the red ROI. The purple ROI indicates the artery, the green ROI the vein, and the pink ROI the parenchyma selected from within the whisker barrel region, the dark blue ROI represents the draining vein adjacent to the whisker barrels, and the teal ROI the meningeal vessel from the overlying dura mater. <bold>C.</bold> Example continuous time series traces for locomotion (black, top) and HbT from the whisker artery (purple, bottom) and draining vein (blue, bottom) from one single 750s recording (first 500s visualized). The green dots on the locomotion plot represent the detected locomotion events. <bold>D.</bold> Spatial map generated from this representative imaging session for trial-average changes in concentration (uM) of total hemoglobin (HbT) in response to locomotion (from 1s before to 5s after onset). The scale bar represents the uM change for activated pixels, with a decrease in HbT shown in blue and an increase in red. The draining vein is observed on the left side of the images, with the rapid decrease in HbT (blue) seen in this vessel from 1s, whereas the whisker barrel arterial network is highlighted in red as HbT increases in these vessels from 2s onwards. <bold>E.</bold> In our illustrative example, the image of the thinned cranial window from one single wavelength captured under 2D-OIS was averaged for the 2s following detected locomotion events. The white borders along the edges of the draining and meningeal veins indicate vasoconstriction. <bold>F.</bold> A profile of the vessel diameter was also taken for the 2s following the onset of locomotion across the yellow line indicated in the left image, with the draining vein having darker pixels compared to the surrounding tissue. The change in the number of dark pixels representing the size of the draining vein is visualized as number of pixels (center) or a percentage change from the baseline size (right), indicating the draining vein is constricting following locomotion onset.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="EMS201650-f001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Spontaneous locomotion induces a fast, remote decrease in the large cerebral draining vein that precedes the regional HbT influx.</title><p><bold>A.</bold> 2343 individual locomotion events were detected across 118 imaging sessions taken from 40 mice.

Two-group unpaired comparisons were conducted using Mann-Whitney tests, and linear relationships were estimated using a linear regression (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Statistics Report Table SR5-6</xref>).

There were no significant differences in locomotion between genotypes (Vessel type p=1.00, Genotype p=0.33, Vessel type * Genotype p=1.00; assessed using area under the curve from individual locomotion events), so all locomotion events were included in subsequent analyses. Corresponding HbT traces were visualized across genotypes for the <bold>B.</bold> artery, <bold>C.</bold> whisker vein, and <bold>D.</bold> draining vein. Again, significant differences in the size of the HbT <bold>E.</bold> maximum and <bold>F.</bold> minimas were found across vessel types, with the artery showing the largest increase in HbT and draining vein the largest decrease. There was no significant impact of disease on the size (or timing) of these responses, however there was an interaction between vessel type and genotype as APP/PS1 (AD) mice showed a smaller maximum peak in the artery (AD artery (M: 6.21, SD: 4.17) – ATH artery (M: 8.03, SD: 5.02), p=0.02), and smaller minima in the draining vein (AD dv (M: -2.48, SD: 2.03) – MIX dv (M: -3.74, SD: 5.10), p=0.01) HbT responses.
