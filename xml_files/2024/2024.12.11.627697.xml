It consists of β-D-mannuronate (M) and its C5 epimer α-L-guluronate (G), linked <italic>via</italic> 1,4-glycosidic bonds, forming homopolyuronate M (polyM) and G (polyG) blocks as well as mixed polyMG blocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. This structurally intricate biopolymer has ecological, biomedical, and biotechnological interest due to its uronate composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, conferring extraordinary gelation, thickening, and stabilizing abilities. Hundreds of biotechnological applications of alginate are known, ranging from welding rod coating, food industry to drug delivery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The wide presence of alginate in marine environments underlines its ecological importance.</p><p id="P3">Alginate lyases (ALs) depolymerize alginate into alginate oligosaccharides (AOSs) and monosaccharides, which bacteria can assimilate through central metabolic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>, also benefiting their animal and human hosts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Understanding the molecular mechanisms and substrate specificity of ALs forming AOSs of defined degrees of polymerization (DP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup> is pivotal for deciphering the intricacies of alginate metabolism and expanding the potential of the polymer within biotechnological applications.</p><p id="P4">Based on their amino acid sequence, ALs are currently classified into 15 polysaccharide lyase (PL) families in the carbohydrate-active enzyme database, CAZy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cazy.org">www.cazy.org</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. ALs specifically cleave M-M, G-G, M-G, or G-M linkages or combinations thereof<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). More than 10,000 sequences encoding PLs are annotated as prospective ALs, but evidence for enzyme activity exists for less than 200 candidates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. Bridging the gap between sequence-based annotation and experimentally verified specificity is necessary for understanding ALs in marine carbon recycling and tailored production of AOSs.</p><p id="P5">The decomposition of alginate by ALs is suggested to occur through a β-elimination mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, creating an unsaturated non-reducing end 4-deoxy-L-<italic>erythro</italic>-4-hexenopyranuronate at subsite +1 (denoted by Δ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. In this mechanism, a catalytic base (usually a negatively charged tyrosine or a deprotonated histidine) abstracts the H5 proton from the sugar moiety at subsite +1, leading to an unsaturated bond between C4 and C5. The reaction is assisted by proton transfer from a general acid to the glycosidic oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b and c</xref>). This two-proton transfer process can take place from the same side (<italic>syn</italic>) or opposing sides (<italic>anti</italic>) of the polymer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In <italic>syn</italic>, the general base abstracts the H5 proton from the uronate moiety at subsite +1 on the same side as the glycosidic oxygen, while in <italic>anti</italic>, they are on the opposite sides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. In the <italic>syn</italic> reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), a single residue or two can act as both the general base and acid when M-M and G-M linkages are cleaved because the C5 proton and the departing oxygen are in <italic>syn</italic> relative to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>), as recently described for two PL7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. In contrast, M-G and G-G linkages have the C5 and O4 atoms on opposite sides, thus the <italic>anti-</italic>mechanism is operative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The order of reactive events (proton transfers and glycosidic bond cleavage), and the detailed molecular mechanism remains unknown for ALs acting on M-G and G-G links.</p><p id="P6">ALs can be <italic>endo-</italic>lytic, cleaving alginate chains internally to produce AOS products mixtures of varying DP, or <italic>exo-</italic>lytic, cleaving consistently from the end of the alginate chain, producing monomers (including Δ), or shorter AOSs, such as dimers. ALs may act in either a processive or non-processive manner, which for CAZymes, in general, has previously been linked to fold architecture and the shape of the active site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">Alginate is produced in nature as pure polyM by alginate synthase, and individual M units are converted to G, catalyzed by mannuronate C5 epimerases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. As in the lyase-catalyzed β-elimination, the epimerization reaction starts with H5 abstraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. However, instead of cleaving the glycosidic linkage, epimerases change the chirality of the C5 carbon atom of M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>).

Subsequently, H243 abstracts the H5 proton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>1), and the C5 atom acquires a negative charge, which delocalizes over C4. This causes the C5-C4 bond to shrink (forming a partial double bond) and the glycosidic bond to elongate. At the TS, the glycosidic bond is broken and a double bond between C4 and C5 begins to form. Subsequently, residue Y298 serves as the catalytic acid, donating its proton to the new reducing end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>2), leading to the formation of the reaction products G and Δ-GG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3cP</xref>).
