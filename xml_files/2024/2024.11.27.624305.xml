The hPep-based nanoparticles enable highly efficient and biocompatible delivery of Cre recombinase, Cas9, base-, and prime editors.

Compared to earlier technologies like Transcription activator-like effector nuclease and zinc finger nucleases, CRISPR offers simple targeting and modification of cellular DNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. However, the relatively large Cas9 protein and guide RNA (gRNA) present significant challenges for intracellular delivery, particularly when using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) as delivery vectors. With their limited packaging capacity, AAVs often require the Cas9 coding sequence to be split into two vectors, complicating the delivery process. Additionally, viral delivery can result in prolonged Cas9 expression, raising concerns about on- and off-target genotoxicity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Non-viral delivery methods, particularly lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mediated Cas9 mRNA and gRNA delivery, have gained traction as an alternative. While LNPs offer promising solutions, delivering the gene-modifying enzyme as mRNA necessitates translation within the cell, and hence, such approaches heavily rely on maximizing gRNA stability to avoid its degradation during Cas9 synthesis. Moreover, mRNA delivery often leads to high levels of protein expression, potentially increasing off-target activity and immunogenicity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Cas9-gRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex delivery confers significant advantages in gene editing due to its transient bioavailability, which minimizes off-target effects, eliminates the risk of genomic integration, and mitigates immune responses against the bacterially derived Cas9 protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Despite these benefits, delivering Cas9 and its derivatives as RNP poses unique challenges. Unlike nucleic acids, Cas9 RNP lacks consistent charge and hydrophobicity, making it sensitive to denaturing buffers and complicating its effective delivery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Thus, there is a pressing need for alternative methods to achieve efficient intracellular delivery of Cas9 RNP and its derivatives. Current strategies fall into two broad categories: physical and nanoparticle-based approaches. Physical methods, including microinjection, electroporation, and membrane deformation techniques, are highly effective but face limitations such as the need for specialized equipment, difficulty in scaling, and limited applicability for in vivo applications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P7">A promising alternative involves the use of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). These peptides can either be covalently attached to Cas9 or mixed to form nanoparticles with the Cas9 RNP, mainly by charge-based electrostatic interactions. While direct conjugation of CPPs with Cas9 creates a self-deliverable complex, this approach often requires large quantities of RNP due to inefficient intracellular delivery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref></sup>. The non-covalent strategy typically relies on charge interactions between the RNP and CPPs, leading to nanoparticle formation. This approach has proven efficient for cellular transfection and delivering various cargo types, such as RNPs and homology-directed repair (HDR) templates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">However, CPPs often suffer from poor serum stability, underscoring the critical need for scalable, serum-compatible delivery methods for Cas9 and its larger derivatives. Such systems are essential for gene-editing in cells and tissues, including iPSCs and skeletal muscle, where non-viral delivery remains a significant hurdle. iPSCs offer vast therapeutic and research potential, while more than 40 different monogenic disorders affect skeletal muscle, leading to progressive degeneration and atrophy—conditions for which effective treatments are still lacking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Skeletal muscle contains a tissue-specific population of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) that play a critical role in muscle regeneration, making them ideal candidates for cell replacement therapies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. In the case of autologous applications within muscular dystrophy, the disease-causing genetic defect needs to be repaired before transplanting the cells back into the patient. Efficient and safe non-viral ex vivo delivery of genome editing tools is an essential first step toward achieving this goal.</p><p id="P9">In this study, we characterized and optimized a family of CPPs, known as hPep, that have previously been used for the delivery of nucleic acids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. Here, we focused on adapting the hPep platform for efficient RNP-based delivery of Cas9 and its derivatives. During particle formation, enhanced delivery efficiency was achieved by incorporating silica as a core to the nanoparticle. This allowed for highly efficient delivery across cell types at low doses and delivery of more challenging cargos, such as prime editor and corresponding pegRNAs. hPep nanoparticles demonstrated virtually unaltered activity in serum conditions, irrespective of protein cargo. Furthermore, hPep enabled base editor delivery to primary cells such as MuSCs and iPSCs while preserving myogenic and pluripotency markers, respectively. The ability of hPep to efficiently deliver diverse cargos across various cell types represents a significant advancement towards a simple synthetic system. Importantly, this system can be easily prepared in minutes on a benchtop, stored as lyophilized powder, and applied using standard laboratory techniques.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell-penetrating peptides</title><p id="P10">All peptides were procured from Pepscan Presto (Lelystad, The Netherlands) with a purity exceeding 90%.

In summary, these data show that the hPep3-mediated transfection is exceptionally rapid and that adverse cellular effects can be negated by changing the media.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Expanding hPep3– mediated delivery to base editors and prime editors</title><p id="P55">Recently developed Cas9 derivatives have demonstrated significant therapeutic potential, enabling the treatment of previously untreatable mutations. One such derivative is the base editor ABE8e <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Therefore, we next wanted to assess if hPep3 is compatible with its intracellular delivery of ABEs. hPep3 and ABE8e RNP were complexed and introduced to HEK293T cells containing an integrated reporter cassette, designated HEK293T-ABE-GFP, where GFP expression is activated upon the conversion of a stop codon into a glutamine codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Increasing doses of ABE8e-hPep3 particles, formulated at varying MR, were administered to HEK293T-ABE-GFP cells, resulting in editing rates of approximately 90% even at the low dose of 1 nM RNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). These high editing rates were corroborated in B16F10 and N2A cells harboring the same reporter system, which demonstrated &gt;90% editing efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>).</p><p id="P56">Next, ABE8e was employed to induce mis-splicing of the pre-mRNA encoding the endogenous surface protein Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M) by mutating a splice donor site causing a protein knockout (KO), as previously reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. Dose titration experiments were conducted using hPep3 and RNAiMAX to deliver the B2M-targeted ABE8e. Both modalities exhibited potent KO of B2M, with ABE8e-hPep3 achieving over 93% silencing, performing significantly better than RNAiMAX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The same delivery method was applied to iPSCs, resulting in B2M KO rates of up to 78% and 30% in hPep3-ABE8e and RNAiMAX treated cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). RNAiMAX was tested at lower doses due to associated cellular cytotoxicity, where the highest edited group, 4 nM ON (overnight), resulted in a 7-fold reduction in viable cells compared to the NT control. In contrast, the 6 nM ABE8e-hPep3 dose exhibited similar cell numbers and viability as the NT control three days post-treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b &amp; c</xref>). To further validate hPep as an iPSC delivery agent, cells were treated with a high dose of ABE8e:hPep3 (10 nM) for 6 h and stained for SSEA-4 (pluripotency marker) after 3 days. The cells maintained a high level of expression of the SSEA-4 marker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5c</xref>).</p><p id="P57">Another Cas9-derivate are prime editors, which hold tremendous therapeutic potential and enable precise gene manipulation such as the removal, insertion, or modification of tens of base pairs—capabilities beyond those of Cas9 and base editors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. However, prime editors are among the largest Cas9 derivatives and lack efficient synthetic delivery systems. To address this, hPep3 was investigated as a delivery system for the PE2 variant. PE2 RNP complexes were formulated with hPep3 similarly to the ABE8e and delivered to SL3 HEK293T cells harboring a reporter cassette. This reporter system activates GFP expression upon successful prime editing by converting a stop codon into a glutamic acid codon, thereby inducing GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). A dose-dependent increase in GFP-expressing cells in treated wells was observed, reaching up to 70% at the highest RNP dose and PE2:CPP molar ratio.</p><p id="P58">To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest editing achieved in iPSCs and the first instance of prime editor RNP delivery using a synthetic RNP delivery system.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Colloidal silica enables protein absorption and is vital for high-efficiency RNP delivery</title><p id="P59">The fact that PVA-PEG addition in hPep formulations significantly improved editing efficiencies across all tested proteins, including the cationic Cre and large prime editors, prompted us to examine the role of the PVA-PEG additive. During the manufacturing process of PVA-PEG, colloidal anhydrous silica particles are added to aid in spray-drying of the PVA-PEG. Silica is known for its ability to adsorb proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids and has been used in various transfection methods, although none involving CPPs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref></sup>. Further investigation was warranted, given the presence of silica in the PVA-PEG and its potential role in enhancing the potency of hPep-formulated nanoparticles.</p><p id="P60">A gel electrophoresis showed that the Cas9 protein did not migrate into the gel when PVA-PEG was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). At the same time, a hexametaphosphate challenge indicated a weak interaction between the RNP and silica (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). Silica was next isolated from the PVA-PEG solution by centrifugation and imaged using scanning electron microscopy, revealing particles in the sub-50 nm range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). When silica-depleted PVA-PEG supernatant was used as a formulation buffer, a marked decrease in transfection efficiency was observed compared to non-depleted PVA-PEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy confirmed the presence of silica in the pellet and none in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5e</xref>).</p><p id="P61">To further explore this effect, Atto550-tagged gRNA was complexed with Cas9 RNP and added to buffers with or without PVA-PEG or hPep3. After centrifugation, Atto550-RNP localized in the pellet fraction in a silica concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d</xref>). When hPep3 was added, 100% of the Atto550 signal was localized in the pellet, indicating complete encapsulation of the Cas9 RNP.</p><p id="P62">Next, the centrifugation-isolated silica was tested by adding it to DMEM, DMEM/PEG8K, and DMEM/PVA-PEG<sub>Pure</sub> (PVA-PEG without silica) in increasing amounts, along with a fixed amount of RNP:hPep3. Optimal delivery was observed at silica concentrations matching those found in the PVA-PEG buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5e</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5f</xref>), with PVA-PEG contributing to the effect but to a lesser extent than silica. The envisioned mechanism involves protein adherence to silica, with the CPP binding to silica and RNPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>).</p><p id="P63">Commercial 22 nm silica beads were subsequently used with Cas9 RNP in DMEM or DMEM/PVA-PEG<sub>Pure</sub> to corroborate the silica effect found in PVA-PEG. Maximum editing was achieved when silica concentrations matched those of the PVA-PEG buffer, with results comparable to those of the PVA-PEG containing silica (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5g</xref>).</p><p id="P64">In conclusion, adding silica is vital for high-efficiency delivery using the hPep system in this configuration. Furthermore, the combination of silica and hPep3 resulted in a 100% encapsulation rate of Cas9 RNP. Lastly, while the silica used in this work was added to the PVA-PEG by the manufacturer, thus potentially reducing reproducibility, our work also shows that it can be replaced by colloidal 22 nm silica.</p></sec><sec id="S28"><title>Pep3 enables highly efficient and well-tolerated ABE8-mediated base editing of primary human muscle stem cells</title><p id="P65">In light of the encouraging base editing results achieved in reporter cells and iPSCs, hPep3-mediated base editing was next assessed in therapeutically relevant primary human MuSC. MuSC holds great potential in cell replacement therapies for muscle wasting disorders but has been traditionally considered difficult to transfect. The <italic>NCAM1</italic> gene encodes for neural cell adhesion molecule 1, a membrane protein ubiquitously expressed in human MuSC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref></sup>. We previously showed that the knock-out of <italic>NCAM1</italic> has no negative impact on MuSC fitness ex vivo. Therefore, this gene serves as a universal endogenous reporter locus to assess the efficiency of gene editing interventions in MuSC from any donor. We hence targeted a splice donor site in <italic>NCAM1</italic> exon 7 using ABE8e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup>. Increasing doses of <italic>NCAM1</italic>-targeting ABE8e:hPep3 nanoparticles were applied to MuSCs derived from three different donors with a 6-hour incubation. This resulted in ∼90% A&gt;G conversion at the highest doses 3 days after the treatment, with minimal indel formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). Extending the incubation time to 16 hours further improved editing efficiency, particularly at lower doses, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6c</xref>). The treatment caused a moderate reduction in cell growth during the first three days post-treatment, independent of the editing status. However, the proliferation rate normalized after 3-5 days, remaining comparable to untreated cells throughout the remainder of the observation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). No significant differences were detected in the expression of key markers such as PAX7 (MuSC marker), Desmin (pan-myogenic marker), or Ki-67 (proliferation marker) between treated and untreated MuSCs at any ABE8:hPep3 dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e &amp; g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>).</p><p id="P66">Treated MuSCs were next induced to fuse into multinucleated myotubes to assess their myogenic potential, mimicking in vivo muscle fiber differentiation. The treated cells retained their ability to form multinucleated myotubes and express the differentiation marker Myosin Heavy Chain (MyHC), showing no adverse effects of the ABE8e treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f &amp; h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). Lastly, moderate editing efficiencies at lower ABE8e doses were significantly enhanced after a second round of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p id="P67">These findings demonstrate high editing rates and negligible side effects in these hard-to-transfect cells, suggesting the potential for clinical applications in treating degenerative muscle diseases. This highlights the broad therapeutic implications of the novel CPP formulations developed here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S29" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P68">Gene editing as a cure for genetic diseases relies on the efficient delivery of relevant effector molecules, such as Cas9-RNPs, which depends on the level of cargo protection, internalization, and endosomal release. This study optimized the hPep family of cell-penetrating peptides to deliver Cas9 RNP and its derivatives. A key finding in this study is that these peptides can successfully deliver a diverse range of challenging protein cargos, including Cre recombinase and prime editors. Despite its overall cationic charge, Cre recombinase, typically deemed unsuitable for delivery via cationic CPPs, was successfully delivered at editing rates approaching 100%. This underscores the cargo-agnostic potential of this delivery system. Prime editors pose a significant challenge due to their considerable size and the highly exposed pegRNA, yet successful, efficient delivery using hPep3 was achieved.</p><p id="P69">The high editing rates observed in this study can be partially attributed to the introduction of PVA-PEG in the formulation. This additive significantly enhanced editing efficiency by approximately two orders of magnitude compared to the HBG-formulated RNP. During the PVA-PEG production process, silica particles are added to aid the spray-drying process. Silica is known for its ability to adsorb various molecules, including Cas9 RNP, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>. This led us to the hypothesis that both the protein and peptide components adhere to the silica surface, with the peptides further interacting with the anionic gRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5f</xref>). Our hypothesis is reinforced by the successful delivery of Cre, indicating that factors beyond electrostatic interactions between the cargo and the CPP are involved, namely that of silica in the PVA-PEG formulation. The use of silica as a core for protein and CPP adsorption is particularly significant, as it alters the dynamics and behavior of the resulting nanoparticles. While the application of silica in conjunction with Cas9 RNP is not entirely novel, its combination with CPPs has not been explored previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup>. Incorporating silica to facilitate protein and peptide adsorption could enable previously incompatible cargo and peptide combinations since CPP-mediated non-covalent protein delivery typically relies on the previously mentioned electrostatic interaction between cargo and CPP.</p><p id="P70">Prime editing, alongside similar techniques like click editing, is heralded as the future of gene editing due to its capacity to make substantial modifications without inducing double-stranded breaks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>. However, one of the significant challenges associated with prime editing is its substantial size, ≈242 kDa, which is approximately 80 kDa larger than SpCas9, and its highly exposed pegRNA. Consequently, delivering large protein-RNA complexes, such as prime editors in RNP form, poses substantial difficulties, particularly without employing physical methods such as electroporation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Currently, only two examples of nanoparticle-based delivery of prime editors exist. The first, conducted by the Mikkelsen lab, utilized lentivirus-derived nanoparticles to achieve around 6% editing in HEK293T cells using PEmax, an optimized variant of PE2 utilized in this study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref></sup>. The second example, published recently by the Lui lab, reported approximately 60% editing using engineered virus-like particles (VLPs) after significantly engineering the prime editor and pegRNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref></sup>. Excitingly, hPep3 demonstrated remarkable efficacy, achieving PE2-mediated editing rates approaching 70%. This performance significantly outstrips the approximately 20% editing efficiency achieved through nucleofection of PE2 mRNA in the same cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). However, it is important to note that different pegRNA targets and specific DNA edits can exhibit varying propensities for successful editing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P71">Additionally, recently published click editors, which operate in a manner similar to prime editing, utilize ssDNA as a template that interacts with a DNA polymerase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref></sup>. While it remains premature to predict which method will dominate the gene-editing landscape in the future, it is apparent that cell-derived nanoparticles, such as VLPs, are unlikely to facilitate the efficient delivery of click editors. This is primarily due to the absence of ssDNA in the cytoplasm, rendering it unavailable for incorporation into gene-editing vectors. Therefore, delivering click editors will likely require a fully synthetic approach akin to the methodology described in this article.</p><p id="P72">While the prime editing presented herein demonstrates significant potential, it is not the only RNP of interest explored in this study. Base editors, such as ABEs and CBEs (cytosine base editors), can correct specific nucleotide substitutions and knock out various genes by disrupting their splice sites. These two widely used base editors can potentially correct approximately 25% of human pathogenic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with the ongoing development of new base editors likely to expand this range further <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup>. Thus, it is exciting that ABE8e is so efficiently delivered, with nearly 100% editing efficiency observed both in a reporter target and B2M targeted KO experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a &amp; b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). The KO of B2M is relevant for allogenic non-HLA matched donations of cells to patients, such as in allogenic CAR-T treatments, where the disruption of B2M is one of the proposed initial steps for developing off-the-shelf allogenic CAR-T products <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>. This study also shows the capacity of hPep to deliver Cas9 RNP along with DNA templates, achieving efficient HDR editing in cells with editing levels exceeding 40% without the addition of HDR-enhancing agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p><p id="P73">The editing of iPSCs is of great interest because of their ability to differentiate into any cell type and thus presents tremendous applications to the field for both research and therapeutic applications. However, current transfection methods lack efficient delivery and negatively impact cellular viability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref></sup>. Furthermore, no efficient synthetic methods exist for RNP gene editor delivery into iPSCs. In contrast, hPep3-mediated delivery achieves high editing levels (77%) at 6 nM ABE8e while maintaining cellular viability and pluripotency phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5b &amp; c</xref>). This is not the first example of nanoparticle RNP delivery to iPSCs, but to the best of our knowledge, it is the most efficient nanoparticle RNP delivery and the first example of synthetic nanoparticle base editor delivery to iPSCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P74">Finally, the hPep technology demonstrates significant promise for delivering gene editors to primary human MuSCs, proving compatible with downstream applications that require high editing efficiencies while minimizing cytotoxicity. Notably, up to 90% editing was achieved while not adversely affecting the myogenic properties of the cells. The MuSC proliferation rate returned to normal within approximately three days, indicating that MuSCs are well-suited for therapeutic interventions using the hPep system. Comparable high editing efficiencies in human MuSCs have also been reported with mRNA-mediated delivery of ABE and Cas9 via nucleofection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. However, unlike nucleofection, CPP-mediated delivery is not constrained by cell number requirements, facilitating earlier application and reducing the need for extensive cell passaging and expansion before gene repair. These findings offer promise for developing future MuSC-based gene editing therapies for currently untreatable diseases. A promising direction for such future research would involve repairing mutations in patient-derived MuSCs through hPep3-mediated delivery of various CRISPR enzymes, including prime editors. Additionally, our findings pave the way for novel therapeutic applications in the context of in vivo genome editing of skeletal muscle, an area where progress with non-viral delivery methods for CRISPR tools has been limited <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P75">Together, these findings demonstrate significant potential for the efficient delivery of various protein cargos, which can be applied to a wide range of cell lines and primary cells. The reagents used are low-cost to produce and straightforward to handle, requiring no specialized equipment. Further research is essential to translate the combination of silica, hPep peptides, and gene editors into ex vivo and in vivo therapeutic applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS201686-supplement-Supplemental_figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d176aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S30"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Si.S. is an inventor on a technology for primary human muscle stem cell isolation and manufacturing (IP: (DE10 2014 216872), 2015 PCT (WO 2016/030371), granted in EU and US).
