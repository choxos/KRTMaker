We previously identified a pathogenic gain-of-toxic function mechanism underlying peripheral neuropathy (PN) caused by heterozygous mutations in the <italic>GARS1</italic> gene, encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS). Specifically, PN-mutant GlyRS variants sequester tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>, which depletes the cellular tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> pool, leading to insufficient glycyl-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> available to the ribosome and consequently ribosome stalling at glycine codons. Given that GlyRS functions as a homodimer, a subset of PN-GlyRS mutations might alternatively cause peripheral neuropathy through a dominant negative loss-of-function mechanism. To explore this possibility, we here generated three novel PN-GlyRS <italic>Drosophila</italic> models expressing human PN-GlyRS (hGlyRS) variants that do not alter the overall GlyRS protein charge (S211F and H418R) or the single reported PN-GlyRS variant that renders the GlyRS protein charge more negative (K456Q). High-level expression of hGlyRS-K456Q did not induce peripheral neuropathy and the K456Q variant does not affect aminoacylation activity, suggesting that K456Q is not a pathogenic mutation. Expression of hGlyRS-S211F or hGlyRS-H418R in <italic>Drosophila</italic> did induce peripheral neuropathy and <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis defects. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that these phenotypes were attributable to tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration rather than a dominant negative mechanism. Our data identify tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration as a unifying pathogenic mechanism underlying PN-GlyRS. Thus, elevating tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> levels may constitute a therapeutic approach for all PN-GlyRS patients, irrespective of their disease-causing mutation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Dominantly inherited mutations in eight distinct cytosolic <underline>a</underline>mino<underline>a</underline>cyl-t<underline>R</underline>NA <underline>s</underline>ynthetase (aaRS) genes give rise to Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) peripheral neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). AaRSs are the enzymes that covalently link amino acids to the 3’ end of their cognate tRNA, a reaction referred to as aminoacylation, representing the essential first step of protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Heterozygous mutations in <italic>GARS1</italic>, the gene encoding <underline>gly</underline>cyl-t<underline>R</underline>NA <underline>s</underline>ynthetase (GlyRS), give rise to an axonal form of CMT, type 2D (CMT2D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). CMT is characterized by selective degeneration of peripheral motor and sensory axons, leading to progressive muscle weakness and wasting, steppage gait, sensory dysfunction, and often foot deformities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). In addition to CMT2D, heterozygous <italic>GARS1</italic> mutations have been linked to related peripheral neuropathies characterized by selective motor axonal degeneration and lacking sensory involvement, including distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V (dHMN-V) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>) and infantile spinal muscular atrophy (iSMA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Here, we refer to these <italic>GARS1</italic>-associated <underline>p</underline>eripheral <underline>n</underline>europathies as PN-GlyRS.</p><p id="P3">We have previously shown that six CMT-causing mutations in GlyRS or <underline>tyr</underline>osyl-t<underline>R</underline>NA <underline>s</underline>ynthetase (TyrRS) all inhibit protein synthesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> motor and sensory neurons, uncovering the inhibition of global protein synthesis as a unifying pathogenic mechanism underlying CMT-aaRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Consistent with this notion, inhibition of protein synthesis was observed in motor neurons of two PN-GlyRS mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). More recently, we identified the detailed molecular mechanism underlying PN-GlyRS: PN-GlyRS variants are still able to bind tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> but fail to release it or only release at a very slow pace. This sequestration of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> by PN-GlyRS variants depletes the cellular pool of free tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> available for aminoacylation by the wild type (WT) GlyRS protein in heterozygous PN-GlyRS patients. This results in insufficient production and supply of aminoacylated glycyl-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> to the ribosome, which triggers ribosome stalling at glycine codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). Ribosome stalling in turn induces the integrated stress response (ISR) through activation of the eIF2α kinase GCN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>), which in PN-GlyRS and CMT-TyrRS mouse models occurs selectively in motor and sensory neurons, the affected cell types in CMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Consistent with this mechanism, transgenic overexpression of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> replenishes the cellular tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> pool and rescues defective protein synthesis, prevents ISR activation, and rescues peripheral neuropathy phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse PN-GlyRS models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Here, we sought to evaluate whether all PN-GlyRS mutations cause disease through tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration, what can be classified as a gain-of-toxic-function mechanism, or alternatively, whether some PN-GlyRS mutations cause disease through partial loss of aminoacylation activity. Indeed, similar to tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration, a substantial reduction of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> aminoacylation activity may also lead to insufficient cellular levels of aminoacylated glycyl-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> and consequently ribosome stalling at glycine codons and GCN2-mediated ISR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, although the primary molecular defect would be different, namely tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration versus reduced aminoacylation activity, the downstream molecular pathway that triggers peripheral neuropathy (ribosome stalling and ISR activation) would be the same. Nevertheless, from a therapeutic perspective, the question whether some of the PN-associated GlyRS mutations may act through partial loss of aminoacylation activity is of key importance. Indeed, for tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration, elevating cellular tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> levels would constitute the optimal therapeutic approach, whereas for mutations resulting in partial loss of GlyRS aminoacylation activity, increasing the level of WT GlyRS protein would be the appropriate therapeutic strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Human and mouse genetic evidence provide strong arguments against haplo-insufficiency as the mechanism underlying PN-GlyRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). However, because GlyRS functions as a homodimer, in heterozygous PN-GlyRS patients ~25% of GlyRS dimers will be WT homodimers, ~25% mutant homodimers, and ~50% WT-mutant heterodimers, assuming an equal <italic>GARS1</italic> allelic expression and unaffected GlyRS dimerization. For PN-GlyRS mutations that result in a full loss of aminoacylation activity, this raises the possibility that a dominant negative mechanism may lead to an overall reduction of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> aminoacylation activity by 75%, because only WT homodimers would be able to aminoacylate tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that a subset of PN-GlyRS mutations may induce peripheral neuropathy through a dominant negative effect on tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> aminoacylation. The plausibility of a dominant negative mechanism underlying some PN-GlyRS mutations is suggested by our finding that knock-down of endogenous <italic>Drosophila</italic> GlyRS (dGlyRS) in motor or sensory neurons is sufficient to induce peripheral neuropathy-related phenotypes. Furthermore, genetic experiments using three previously characterized PN-GlyRS <italic>Drosophila</italic> models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>) reveal that for two mutations that result in severely reduced or complete loss of aminoacylation activity (G240R and G526R), a dominant negative effect on aminoacylation activity might contribute to peripheral neuropathy, in addition to tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration.</p><p id="P7">However, newly generated <italic>Drosophila</italic> PN-GlyRS models with <italic>a priori</italic> lower likelihood to sequester tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> strongly argue for tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration as a unifying mechanism underlying PN-GlyRS, and against a dominant negative mechanism. Indeed, expression of two PN-GlyRS variants that do not alter overall GlyRS protein charge (S211F and H418R) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> induced peripheral neuropathy phenotypes and inhibited global protein synthesis, highly reminiscent of our previously characterized PN-GlyRS models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Using <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic experiments and biochemical assays, we show that tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration by these newly characterized hGlyRS variants triggers peripheral neuropathy phenotypes. Finally, even high-level expression of the only reported PN-GlyRS variant that removes a positive charge from the GlyRS protein (K456Q) does not induce peripheral neuropathy phenotypes, and hGlyRS-K456Q display WT-like aminoacylation activity, suggesting that K456Q may not be a pathogenic mutation. Together, our results indicate that tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration is a unifying pathogenic mechanism underlying PN-GlyRS. This implies that elevating tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> levels may constitute a therapeutic approach for all PN-GlyRS patients, irrespective of their specific mutation.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics</title><p id="P8">Flies were housed in a temperature-controlled incubator with 12:12 h on/off light cycle at 25 °C. <italic>OK371-GAL4</italic> (Bl 26160), <italic>ppk-GAL4</italic> (Bl 32079), <italic>actin5C-GAL4</italic> (Bl 4414), and <italic>Sca-GAL4</italic> (Bl 6479) were obtained from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (Bloomington, IN, USA).

The posterolateral quadrant of the imaged da neuron was chosen for quantification of dendritic coverage, as least imaging artifacts and interference of denticle bands were encountered in this area. For quantification within the posterolateral quadrant, a sector of 200 μm to the lateral and 280 μm to the posterior was defined, equaling 56,000 μm<sup>2</sup> divided into 560 squares of 8 x 8 pixels each.

To evaluate the efficiency of the dGlyRS-RNAi lines, we expressed the dGlyRS-RNAi transgenes ubiquitously (<italic>actin5C-GAL4</italic>), and quantified dGlyRS transcript levels in third instar larvae by quantitative real-time PCR. The two dGlyRS-RNAi lines reduced dGlyRS transcript levels by ~69% and ~65%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Due to the lack of a dGlyRS antibody, it was not possible to determine the corresponding endogenous dGlyRS protein levels. Nevertheless, the reduction in dGlyRS transcript levels may be representative for a dominant negative scenario, in which the aminoacylation-active dGlyRS pool is reduced by up to 75%.</p><p id="P28">We next evaluated the effect of dGlyRS knock-down in motor neurons (<italic>OK371-GAL4</italic>), because motor neurons are the affected cell type in all <italic>GARS1</italic>-associated peripheral neuropathies. <italic>In vivo</italic> cell-type-specific FUNCAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>) revealed a marked inhibition of nascent protein synthesis in motor neurons by ~52% and ~56% for the two independent dGlyRS-RNAi lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). These data suggest that dGlyRS knock-down substantially inhibits tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> aminoacylation, leading to depletion of cellular glycyl-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> levels and consequently inhibiting protein synthesis. To determine whether dGlyRS knock-down in motor neurons can trigger peripheral neuropathy-like phenotypes, we evaluated motor performance of 7-day-old adult flies using an automated negative geotaxis assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>).

While we previously showed that each of these three hGlyRS variants sequester tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), we sought to explore whether a dominant negative effect may constitute an additional pathogenic mechanism. This is particularly relevant for the G240R and G526R mutations, which severely reduce tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> aminoacylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>).

In case of a dominant negative scenario, increasing WT dGlyRS protein levels should increase the fraction and number of WT dGlyRS dimers and therefore would be expected to rescue the PN-GlyRS phenotypes. We therefore evaluated the effect of transgenic dGlyRS overexpression on inhibition of protein synthesis and peripheral neuropathy phenotypes in our PN-GlyRS <italic>Drosophila</italic> models. Ubiquitous (<italic>actin5C-GAL</italic>) expression of the dGlyRS transgene in third instar larvae resulted in a 12-fold increase in dGlyRS mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), confirming robust transgene expression.

Similarly, the adult motor performance defect induced by hGlyRS-E71G expression in motor neurons was not altered by simultaneous dGlyRS overexpression, while adult motor deficits induced by hGlyRS-G240R and hGlyRS-G526R expression were partially rescued by dGlyRS co-overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P30">Next, we investigated third instar larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) phenotypes induced by expression of hGlyRS-G240R and hGlyRS-G526R in motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). Expression of hGlyRS-G240R or hGlyRS-G526R in motor neurons frequently resulted in denervation of larval muscle 24, and this denervation phenotype was mitigated by simultaneous dGlyRS overexpression. This effect reached statistical significance for hGlyRS-G240R but not for hGlyRS-G526R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, the neuromuscular synapse length on larval muscle 8 was significantly reduced by expression of hGlyRS-G240R and hGlyRS-G526R in motor neurons.

Finally, selective expression of each of the three hGlyRS mutants in class IV multidendritic sensory neurons significantly reduced their dendritic coverage. Simultaneous dGlyRS overexpression did not rescue this sensory neuron morphology defect. Rather, for the E71G and G526R mutants, dGlyRS co-overexpression slightly but significantly enhanced the sensory neuron morphology defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the hGlyRS-E71G variant does not act through a dominant negative mechanism.

Coincidentally, each of the three GlyRS mutations that we previously modelled in <italic>Drosophila</italic> increase the net positive charge to the protein (E71G, G240R, G526R).

We therefore reasoned that if some PN-GlyRS mutations would act through a dominant negative mechanism, mutations that do not alter the net GlyRS charge or even increase the net negative charge are the most likely candidates. Hence, we generated three novel PN-GlyRS <italic>Drosophila</italic> models.

Furthermore, expression of one or two copies of hGlyRS-K456Q transgenes in motor neurons did not induce adult motor performance deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, even high-level expression of hGlyRS-K456Q in class IV multidendritic sensory neurons did not induce dendritic morphology defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Finally, THRONCAT revealed that the reduced protein synthesis following hGlyRS-S211F or hGlyRS-H418R expression in motor neurons is significantly rescued by tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that also for hGlyRS-S211F and hGlyRS-H418R mutations, tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration is the underlying pathogenic mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Biochemical evidence for tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration by hGlyRS S211F and H418R variants</title><p id="P37">To complement our <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic data, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments to evaluate tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration by hGlyRS S211F and H418R variants. We purified recombinant hGlyRS-WT, hGlyRS-S211F, and hGlyRS-H418R proteins and evaluated the effect of the mutations on hGlyRS dimer formation by size exclusion chromatography. Whereas hGlyRS-WT migrated predominantly as a dimer (dimer:monomer (D:M) ratio 9.1 : 0.9), hGlyRS-S211F partitioned predominantly as monomer (D:M ratio 3.8 : 6.2). For hGlyRS-H418R, the dimer was the predominant form but to a much lower fraction than hGlyRS-WT (D:M ratio 7.0 : 3.0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). We next used the hGlyRS dimer fraction to determine the association (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub>) and release (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub>) kinetic constants for tRNA<sup>Gly-GCC</sup> to hGlyRS-WT, hGlyRS-S211F and hGlyRS-H418R. Both hGlyRS-S211F and hGlyRS-H418R variants were able to bind tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>, albeit with a reduced affinity (~3-fold and ~5-fold fold lower <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> values than WT, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Importantly, these variants displayed markedly slower tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> release kinetics (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>off</italic></sub>), with more than 90% of traces showing no tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> release within the experimental time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). These data are consistent with tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration by hGlyRS-S211F and hGlyRS-H418R variants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S28" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P38">For many genetic diseases, multiple disease-causing mutations in the same gene have been identified, often distributed throughout the coding region and spread across diverse functional domains. For the vast majority of these diseases, it is unclear whether all mutations cause disease through the same molecular mechanism. Here, we addressed this question for peripheral neuropathy associated with mutations in <italic>GARS1</italic>, encoding GlyRS. Previously, we provided genetic and biochemical evidence for seven PN-GlyRS mutations, that sequestration of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> and consequent depletion of the cellular tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> pool is the underlying molecular mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). The insufficient availability of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> substrate for aminoacylation by WT GlyRS, derived from the WT <italic>GARS1</italic> allele in heterozygous patients, leads to insufficient glycyl-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> to be used by the translating ribosome. This in turn triggers ribosome stalling at glycine codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) and activation of the ISR through the eIF2α kinase GCN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). This mechanism also provides an explanation for the protein synthesis defect observed in PN-GlyRS <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P39">Here, we evaluated whether all known PN-GlyRS variants cause disease through tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration, or alternatively, whether a subset of these mutations may trigger peripheral neuropathy through a dominant negative effect on GlyRS aminoacylation activity. Indeed, because GlyRS functions as a homodimer with a single tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> interacting with both GlyRS monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>), a GlyRS dimer consisting of one WT and one mutant monomer may fail to aminoacylate tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>, provided that the mutation results in loss of aminoacylation activity but does not inhibit dimerization with WT GlyRS. In such a dominant negative scenario, the aminoacylation-active GlyRS population, which consists of WT GlyRS homodimers, may be reduced by 75%. In turn, 75% reduction of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> aminoacylation capacity may substantially lower the levels of glycyl-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> available for translation, thus potentially triggering peripheral neuropathy. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> PN-GlyRS models, a dominant negative mechanism would require dimerization between endogenous dGlyRS and transgenic hGlyRS, which we previously demonstrated to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). The plausibility of a dominant-negative mechanism underlying PN-GlyRS was suggested by our finding that reducing endogenous dGlyRS levels by transgenic RNAi-mediated knock-down is sufficient to induce peripheral neuropathy phenotypes and to substantially inhibit <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P40">To evaluate a possible dominant negative mechanism and because all PN-GlyRS mutations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse models generated thus far increase the net positive charge of the GlyRS protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), we decided to generate three novel <italic>Drosophila</italic> PN-GlyRS models for two mutations that do not alter GlyRS protein charge (S211F and H418R)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), and the single GlyRS mutation described that reduces positive charge (K456Q)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). The S211F and H418R mutations were previously reported to result in severely reduced tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> aminoacylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), whereas the effect of the K456Q mutation on aminoacylation activity has not been reported. Very similar to our previously reported <italic>Drosophila</italic> PN-GlyRS models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), expression of hGlyRS-S211F or hGlyRS-H418R in motor and sensory neurons induced peripheral neuropathy phenotypes and substantially inhibited <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis in motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This phenotypic similarity supports the notion of a similar underlying pathogenic mechanism.</p><p id="P41">To evaluate whether either a dominant negative mechanism or tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration may underlie PN-GlyRS caused by S211F and H418R mutations, we studied the effect of transgenic overexpression of WT dGlyRS or tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>, respectively. For both hGlyRS-S211F and hGlyRS-H418R variants, dGlyRS overexpression did not rescue peripheral neuropathy or inhibition of protein synthesis, providing a strong argument against a dominant negative mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This result is consistent with the finding that transgenic overexpression of WT hGlyRS did not rescue peripheral neuropathy phenotypes in two PN-GlyRS mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). In contrast, tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> overexpression dosage-dependently rescued both peripheral neuropathy phenotypes and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), providing genetic evidence for depletion of the cellular tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> pool due to tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration as the underlying pathogenic mechanism. In addition, we provide biochemical evidence of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration by hGlyRS-S211F and hGlyRS-H418R variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, addition of positive charge is not required for a PN-GlyRS mutation to induce tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration. This is consistent with our previous finding that the hGlyRS-L129P and hGlyRS-E279D mutations, which do not alter protein charge, clearly induce tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration in biochemical experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P42">For our previously characterized PN-GlyRS <italic>Drosophila</italic> models (E71G, G240R, G526R mutations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>), we had shown that tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> overexpression at least partially rescues peripheral neuropathy phenotypes and the protein synthesis defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P43">Here, we evaluated the effect of dGlyRS overexpression on these phenotypes. For hGlyRS-E71G, dGlyRS overexpression did not rescue peripheral neuropathy or protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), arguing against a dominant negative mechanism. Given that the E71G mutation does not significantly affect tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> aminoacylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) or GlyRS dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), this result could be expected. In contrast, G240R and G526R severely reduce aminoacylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>), which may hint to a dominant negative mechanism. Interestingly, dGlyRS overexpression partially rescued peripheral neuropathy and protein synthesis defects induced by the G240R and G526R variants. A possible explanation for this result is that in addition to tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration, these two GlyRS variants also induce a dominant negative effect, which may, at least in part, contribute to the insufficient glycyl-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> production and supply to the ribosome. An alternative explanation for this observation is that WT and mutant GlyRS species may compete for binding to the limited cellular tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> pool. In this scenario, a substantial increase in dGlyRS levels may increase the tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> fraction interacting with and aminoacylated by WT dGlyRS, thus increasing glycyl-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> levels available to the translating ribosome. Consistent with this hypothesis, the fact that the G240R mutation was reported to substantially reduce hGlyRS dimerization capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>) argues against a dominant negative mechanism. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in transfected cells previously suggested that hGlyRS-G526R may retain or even strengthen GlyRS dimerization capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>), but size-exclusion chromatography revealed that recombinant hGlyRS-G526R protein predominantly occurs as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>).</p><p id="P44">Although our data show a clear correlation between the degree to which PN-GlyRS variants inhibit global protein synthesis and the severity of peripheral neuropathy phenotypes, this correlation is not perfect. Furthermore, while tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> overexpression substantially rescues peripheral neuropathy phenotypes of all PN-GlyRS <italic>Drosophila</italic> models, the rescue is not complete. These observations may be explained by the fact that the UAS-hGlyRS transgenes allow expression of both the cytosolic and the mitochondrial hGlyRS isoforms, depending on the translation start site used. Because in higher eukaryotes, mitochondrial tRNAs are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and mitochondria typically do not import nuclear encoded tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>), mitochondrial translation defects and toxicity induced by PN-GlyRS variants are likely not rescued by tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> overexpression. Moreover, additional pathogenic mechanisms, such as axonal transport defects induced by decreased α-tubulin acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>), may not be fully rescued by tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> overexpression. In spite of the possible contribution of mitochondrial toxicity induced by PN-GlyRS variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), the cytosolic toxicity induced by tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration is likely a critical contributor to peripheral neuropathy phenotypes, because (i) in PN-GlyRS mouse models, transgenic tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> overexpression fully rescues peripheral neuropathy phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), and (ii) all of the seven other PN-associated aaRS genes exclusively encode the cytosolic aaRS, with the corresponding mitochondrial aaRSs being encoded by different genes.</p><p id="P45">Size-exclusion chromatography revealed that GlyRS-S211F predominantly occurs as a monomer, similar to some other PN-GlyRS variants (e.g. L129P, C157R, G240R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). We previously reported that PN-GlyRS monomers are able to bind and sequester tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), which we anticipate may also be the case for GlyRS-S211F. Consistent with this notion, peripheral neuropathy phenotypes induced by GlyRS S211F, C157R and G240R variants in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse models are rescued by transgenic tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> overexpression.</p><p id="P46">In sharp contrast to hGlyRS-S211F and hGlyRS-H418R, expression of hGlyRS-K456Q induced neither peripheral neuropathy phenotypes, nor inhibition of protein synthesis. Although the K456Q variant was previously classified as likely pathogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>), according to the most recent American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), this variant would be classified as a variant of uncertain significance. Our data in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) indicate that this hGlyRS variant may not be pathogenic. Because the K456Q variant is the only one of the 35 reported PN-GlyRS variants that eliminates a positive charge from the GlyRS protein, our data further suggest that mutations that render the overall GlyRS charge more negative than the WT protein may not be compatible with PN-GlyRS pathogenicity in heterozygous patients. In contrast, 4 of the 7 <italic>GARS1</italic> mutations reported in compound heterozygous patients with biallelic <italic>GARS1</italic> mutations remove a positive charge from the GlyRS protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>).

The systemic mitochondrial disease features suggest that mitochondrial mRNA translation may be predominantly affected, leading to mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>).</p><p id="P47">Overall, our data indicate that it is highly likely that all PN-GlyRS mutations trigger peripheral neuropathy through a common tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> sequestration mechanism.
