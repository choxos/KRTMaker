As a nascent technique, replication of its effects on brain function is important. Of particular interest is offline 5Hz repetitive TUS (5Hz-rTUS), originally reported by Zeng and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] to elicit lasting corticospinal excitability increases, with large effect sizes.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Material and method</title><p id="P2">Here, we conducted a pre-registered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/p5n4q">https://osf.io/p5n4q</ext-link>) replication of this protocol that benefitted from three additional features: double-blind application of TUS, neuronavigation for consistent TMS positioning, and acoustic simulations to assess M1 target exposure to TUS. Changes in resting motor thresholds (rMT), motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) in response to TUS (5Hz-rTUS vs. sham) were measured in the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles, with unbiased selection of participants.

As a nascent approach for neuromodulation, replication of the effects of TUS is a critical ingredient in progressing toward a mature technology with clinical utility. One example illustrating this is the recent discovery that the inhibitory effects of TUS on corticospinal excitability can be confounded by auditory inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. In response, auditory masking and ramped pulsing have rapidly become standard in the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]</p><p id="P6">Here we focus on 5Hz-rTUS (also referred to as theta-burst TUS; tbTUS), an offline TUS protocol that has been reported to elicit strong facilitation of corticospinal excitability (CSE), with large effects sizes, that outlasted sonication by up to 30 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The same research group has subsequently replicated these excitatory effects in both healthy and clinical populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]</p><p id="P7">However, the opposite neuromodulatory effects of 5Hz-rTUS were recently reported by an independent research group, instead showing inhibition (not excitation) of CSE lasting up to 30 minutes following sonication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. In contrast with targeting M1 based on the TMS-hotspot location and only at a fixed depth of ~30mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], Bao and colleagues personalised TUS application with acoustic simulations to ensure precise targeting within M1 in each participant. The inhibitory effects were observed when sonicating either the lip of precentral gyrus or deeper sections of M1. Simulations also provided individual estimates of the acoustic intensity in the brain, as opposed to using measurements in free-water which cannot account for individual variance in absorption and refraction of ultrasound through the skull [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Given the contrasting outcomes of 5Hz-rTUS reported by separate research groups, and a dearth of independent replication, at this early stage of offline human TUS application it is essential to obtain better estimates of the likely effect sizes of 5Hz-rTUS and factors that may influence these. This necessity is further underscored by the intended application of these protocols in clinical populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p id="P8">In the present study, we therefore conducted an independent replication of the methodology initially reported by Zeng and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. We specifically focussed on replicating the effect of 5Hz-rTUS on CSE, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF). We employed the same targeting procedures, stimulation protocol, and outcome measures as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. However, to guard against biases and additional sources of variance, we incorporated double-blinding, neuronavigation of TMS, more repetitions per condition, quantification of MEPs from adjacent hand muscles, post-hoc acoustic simulations of TUS, and pre-registered the study.</p><p id="P9">We did not observe a significant effect of 5Hz-rTUS on CSE or intracortical excitability.

While imaging sequence details varied for this reason, all images were acquired with 1mm isotropic resolution, covering the whole head. Note that for the simulation conducted in this study, we focus on the location of the acoustic focus, not the actual intensity values, which will not have been systematically influenced by small idiosyncrasies in the MRI sequences across individuals.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Transcranial magnetic stimulation</title><p id="P14">TMS was delivered with a Magstim 2002 Monophasic stimulator (single-pulse) and a Magstim Bistim<sup>2</sup> system consisting of two 200<sup>2</sup> monophasic stimulators (paired-pulse) connected to a D70 alpha F8 coil with an internal diameter of 70mm (Magstim Co. Ltd, Whitland, Wales). Participants were seated in a comfortable chair with their hands resting on a pillow on their lap. The TMS coil was placed over the left primary motor cortex (M1), tangentially to the scalp, with the handle of the coil pointing backwards at a 45-degree to the midline to induce an approximate posterior-anterior current. The TMS-hotspot was defined as the area of the scalp where the largest and most stable MEPs were observed in the right first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Apart from the setup in the original work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], neuronavigation was used to ensure precise and consistent placement of TMS both before and after 5Hz-rTUS/sham (Brainsight, Rogue Research, USA). We additionally recorded MEPs from adjacent abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles, to capture any potential effects of the ultrasound beam on other intrinsic hand muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Our TMS procedures followed the original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Briefly, after identifying the TMS hand motor hotspot, we determined the baseline rMT and the stimulator intensity (SI) required to elicit a ~1mV MEP (SI<sub>1mV</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. This baseline SI<sub>1mV</sub> was the intensity for all subsequent single-pulse MEP blocks to assess changes in CSE. For the paired-pulse TMS block capturing intracortical excitability, the intensity of the conditioning stimulus was set to 80% rMT for SICI (2 ms ISI) and ICF (10 ms ISI), and the test stimulus was set to the SI1mV measured in the beginning of the same block. Paired-pulse trials were administered in pseudorandomized order. In contrast to Zeng and co-workers’ work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], we acquired 25 trials for each measurement – originally 20 and 10 trials for each single- and paired-pulse metric, respectively – using an ISI of 5 seconds and a 10% jitter. All TMS measures were acquired at baseline, T5, T30 and T60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Each TMS block lasted approximately nine minutes.</p><p id="P16">Surface electromyography (EMG) signals were simultaneously recorded for target FDI, APB and ADM with pairs of surface electrodes in a belly-tendon montage (WhiteSensor 40713, AmbuR, Denmark; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Signals were amplified with a gain of 1000, bandpass filtered (5 Hz - 3000 Hz) by a Digitimer D360 amplifier (Digitimer Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, Hers, UK), and digitised at 5000 Hz by a Power 1401 data acquisition interface and Signal software version 7.01 (Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd., Cambridge, UK).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Transcranial ultrasound stimulation</title><p id="P17">Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) was delivered using the NeuroFUS system (manufacturer: Sonic Concepts Inc., Bothell, WA, USA; supplier/support: Brainbox Ltd., Cardiff, UK) via a four-element 500 kHz annular array piezoelectric transducer with a 64 mm radius of curvature and aperture diameter (CTX-500-025, Sonic Concepts Inc., Bothell, WA, USA). A four-channel radiofrequency amplifier (Transducer Power Output system; TPO) powered the transducer via a four-channel electrical impedance matching network utilising a rectangular pulse shape. The transducer was coupled with a 10 mm gel pad (Aquaflex, Parker, Laboratories, NJ, USA). Ultrasound gel (Aquasonic 100, Parker Laboratories, NJ, USA) was centrifuged to remove visible bubbles and applied between the gel pad and the transducer. We defined our sonication depth as 33 mm in accordance with the acoustic field peak reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. To reach 33 mm, the sonication depth on the TPO was set at 43.5 mm to account for the additional distance added by ultrasound gel (0.5mm) and gel pad (10mm). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref> show the comparison of the acoustic intensities and profiles between Zeng et al.

The spatial-peak-pulse average intensity in free water (I<sub>SPPA</sub>) was set to 10 W/cm<sup>2</sup> (Table S1), similar to the original work. Applying an estimated 75% skull attenuation relative to free-water measurements, our estimated transcranial I<sub>SPPA</sub> (2.5W/cm<sup>2</sup>) was consistent with the original study (2.26W/cm<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Our actual estimated transcranial I<sub>SPPA</sub> based on acoustic simulations was 1.20W/cm<sup>2</sup> ± 0.43.</p><p id="P19">The TUS transducer location was determined by the TMS-hotspot, as previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The contours of the TMS coil were marked on the scalp using a chinagraph pencil and the centre of the TMS coil was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We additionally recorded the TUS transducer location using neuronavigation for post hoc acoustic simulations. We also added a double-blind procedure, where both experimenter and participant were blind to which TUS condition (5Hz-rTUS vs sham) was administered, to minimise potential experimenter bias. To enable effective double-blinding, an independent researcher randomly assigned the TUS condition order across participants, using a MATLAB script. TUS parameters were automatically input into the TPO based on the defined participant and session number. Hair preparation with centrifuged ultrasound gel was initially performed after threshold and hotspot estimation, and finalised after the baseline TMS block to minimise preparation time between baseline TMS and TUS application. During both 5Hz-rTUS and sham, Gaussian white noise was played through bone-conductive headphones (Sportz3, AfterShokz, New York, USA) to maximise blinding of each condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Participants selected the maximum volume for the white noise that they found acceptable.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Data preprocessing and analysis</title><p id="P20">Raw EMG data were exported from Signal (version 7.01; Cambridge Electronic Design, UK) to MATLAB (version 9.7.0; R2019b). Peak-to-peak MEP amplitudes for each muscle (FDI, APB, ADM) were calculated using a custom script. Data and code to reproduce the results are provided here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/S5AG6">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/S5AG6</ext-link>. Within each block, trials identified as significant outliers using Grubbs’ test (1.61%) and trials with pre-contraction (1.78%) were excluded. Precontraction was defined as the root mean square (RMS) of EMG activity in the 100ms prior to TMS exceeding the block’s average by two standard deviations. All trials with an RMS exceeding a liberal threshold of 0.045 were manually inspected (n = 10427/36000; 29%). Trials where noise in the EMG signal prevented sufficient quantification of MEP amplitude were excluded (0.55% across all muscles, 0% for FDI specifically).</p><p id="P21">Paired t-tests were conducted to assess baseline differences between 5Hz-rTUS and sham for rMT, SI<sub>1mV</sub>, MEP amplitude, SICI, and ICF.

Statistical significance was set at a two-tailed α=0.05 and computed with t-tests using the Satterthwaite approximation of degrees of freedom. Given the right-skewed nature of MEP amplitudes, trial-level square root corrected MEP amplitudes were used for LMMs. The time course of MEP amplitudes, SICI, and ICF was tested separately with models including TUS Condition (5Hz-rTUS/sham) and Timepoint (Baseline/T5/T30/T60) as factors. TUS-induced changes in corticospinal excitability were further tested for MEP amplitudes expressed as a ratio to the baseline mean (i.e. baseline corrected), with TUS Condition (5Hz-rTUS/sham) and Timepoint (T5/T30/T60) as factors.</p><p id="P23">In addition to LMMs, the previously implemented statistical procedures of the original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] were replicated using two-way rm-ANOVA on raw data without square root correction, with factors TUS Condition (5Hz-rTUS/sham) and Timepoint (Baseline/T5/T30/T60; see Supplementary Results).</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Acoustic Simulations</title><p id="P24">To determine the actual anatomical location targeted by TUS, we conducted simulations of acoustic wave propagation for each individual, using k-Plan software, a user interface for the pseudospectral time-domain solver k-Wave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. To generate compatible skull images, a toolbox with pre-trained deep learning convolutional neural networks was used to convert T1-weighted MRI scans to pseudo-CT images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Next, the four-element CTX500 transducer location was imported from the neuronavigation TUS trajectory captured during the real 5Hz-rTUS session (exported as 3D coordinates in Brainsight coordinate space). The simulation was run using six grid points per wavelength for a single pulse duration to obtain the steady-state pressure field.</p><p id="P25">Using a custom MATLAB script, the k-Plan pressure field and grid settings were extracted using k-plan-matlab-tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ucl-bug/k-plan-matlab-tools">https://github.com/ucl-bug/k-plan-matlab-tools</ext-link>). We resampled the simulation grid to have the same spacing as the anatomical scans (i.e., T1w and pseudo-CT). Pulse average intensity was calculated from the simulated acoustic pressure amplitude p, using the plane wave approximation I= p^2/2ρc, were the density ρ was 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup> and the sound speed c was 1500 m/s.</p><p id="P26">We were primarily interested in determining the intersection between the acoustic focus and the anatomical location of the M1 hand area within the vicinity of the precentral gyrus. For this, we first segmented structural MRI scans into different tissue types, using SPM12 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/</ext-link>). Grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid masks were merged to generate a binary brain mask per subject. In native space, we identified the omega formation in the pre-central gyrus at a depth of ~30mm, and the lip of the precentral gyrus at a depth of ~18mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. We extracted the location and value of the I<sub>SPPA</sub> for each individual and calculated the Euclidean distance between the I<sub>SPPA</sub> location and these two anatomical landmarks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref>). We defined the acoustic focus as the volume where the intensity values are equal to or higher than half of the intensity maximum in the brain, equivalent to the full-width half-maximum intensity. Table S2 reports the simulation of free water sonication and thermal simulation results, in line with recent reporting guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].

The binary acoustic focus maps in standard space were summed and overlaid on a standard brain with MRIcroGL. To quantify targeting accuracy through spatial overlap between the acoustic focus and the target, we required a volumetric definition of the M1 target. Therefore, we first delineated M1 with a 15 mm radius spherical region of interest (ROI) that covered both the lip of the precentral gyrus and the omega formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). This ROI was chosen because stimulation of both these areas, and likely intermediate regions as well, can elicit effects of TUS on CSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. We then calculated the percentage of the acoustic focus that fell within the ROI, as well as the peak ultrasound intensity within the ROI.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S14" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P28">None of the participants reported discomfort or adverse effects following participation.

Along each 3D axis, we performed one-sample t-tests and found a significant anteromedial shift of the foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>; anterior: t(14)=2.86, p=0.013; medial: t(14)=7.36, p=3.548). The degree of anterior shift (10.5±14.2 mm) and the distribution of Euclidean distances correspond with the well-known anterior shift of the TMS motor hotspot relative to the anatomical hand motor area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. We furthermore observed a significant inferior shift relative to the lip of the gyrus, which has a scalp-to-cortex distance of ~15 mm (t(14)=14.17, p=1.079). However, there was no inferior shift relative to the targeted omega formation at a depth of ~30 mm (t(14)=1.63, p=0.126; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E,F</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that TMS motor hotspot-based targeting method for rTUS introduces considerable dispersion around the intended target M1 location. While such misalignment between the hotspot scalp location and underlying anatomy is known, it quantifies the degree of bias and variability in directing sonication reliably to the same brain target with this procedure.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Lack of excitatory offline 5Hz-rTUS effects when anatomical targeting is accurate</title><p id="P37">5Hz-rTUS might have been effective in participants in whom sonication was reliably directed to the presumed anatomical target region. We therefore identified those participants where the acoustic focus overlapped with the M1 ROI by &gt;20%. However, in none of the 5 participants meeting this criterion did we observe an excitatory effect of 5Hz-rTUS on single-pulse MEP amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4G</xref>). Given the previously reported effect sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>], one may expect these participants to show an excitatory effect; this was not observed here. Finally, it is conceivable that there is a systematic relationship between the targeting accuracy and the sonication effect.

Replication is an essential process for scientific rigour and has been earmarked by the International Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation Safety and Standards (ITRUSST) as crucial for accelerating TUS toward an effective neuromodulation approach. There is indeed growing attention to the rigorous experimental control required to demonstrate replicability in the field of focused ultrasound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. This need is further highlighted by examples from the fields of electrical and magnetic stimulation, where initial reports of novel stimulation protocols have often been followed by more nuanced appraisals of their efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>].</p><p id="P39">In the present study, we sought to replicate recently published neuromodulatory effects of offline 5Hz-rTUS directed to M1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>].

Here we initially assessed our results using linear mixed models, which have greater statistical power than rm-ANOVAs. However, our null results were the same when employing the statistical procedures as in the original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. Additional qualitative assessment of individual data indicated that in only 2 out of 15 participants of the current study were the observed MEP changes consistent with the originally reported effects at T5 and T30. These results suggest the effects of 5Hz-rTUS protocol across different cohorts are likely more nuanced and less robust than originally appreciated.</p><p id="P41">This conclusion aligns with a recent replication from another group showing the opposite, i.e., inhibitory rather than excitatory effects lasting approximately 30 minutes after offline 5Hz-rTUS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. How the same TUS protocol directed to the same neural structure with the same overall approach can lead to completely opposite neuromodulatory effects is currently unclear. One major difference was that Bao and colleagues (2024) targeted TUS based on structural landmarks with <italic>a priori</italic> simulations at two focal depths - the lip/crown of the pre-central gyrus and one targeting the deeper, omega-shaped formation of the pre-central gyrus. Inhibitory effects of 5Hz-rTUS were observed at both stimulation depths.</p><p id="P42">While one cannot rule out that relatively subtle differences in applied sonication intensity between the two studies explain the opposite effects on excitability, a complete reversal of the neuromodulatory effects with such subtle intensity variation raises concerns about the clinical utility of such protocols, and certainly provides a mandate for further independent replication. Moreover, other neuromodulatory protocols used in both animal work and human research, including the 5Hz-rTUS protocol, have typically required intensities that were at least ~300% higher (&gt;30 W/cm<sup>2</sup>; 5Hz-rTUS: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. Regardless of the mechanistic explanation for how 5Hz-rTUS at very low intensities might elicit such strong neuromodulatory effects, our findings here and those by Bao and colleagues (20024) suggest that across different cohorts, the effects of low-intensity 5Hz-rTUS are more variable and potentially even orthogonal to the ones initially reported.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Variability in targeting with TMS motor hotspot-based transducer placement</title><p id="P43">One factor that will determine the effects of TUS is the precision and consistency of its targeting. To target the primary motor cortex in combined TUS-TMS experiments, the TMS motor hotspot is commonly used as a heuristic to determine the TUS transducer location on the scalp that sonicates M1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. However, this method poses obvious risks of poor target exposure to TUS.</p><p id="P44">First, when using TMS over M1, the location of the largest electrical fields and neural activation thresholds depend on several factors, including cortical folding, tissue type, and induced current direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Furthermore, cortical areas closer to the lateral surface will always experience stronger electrical fields than deeper parts, due to the rapid decay of the induced electric field with increasing distance from the TMS coil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Therefore, the direct axial projection from the geometrical centre of the TMS coil (marked on the scalp), which is often used to determine the scalp position of the TUS transducer, is unlikely to be a reliable marker of either a specific neural structure, or the anatomical site of effective stimulation with TMS. Considering that the width of the sonication beam is considerably smaller than the spatial specificity of TMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>], even small deviations of the TUS transducer in the axial plane will lead to mis-targeting. Compared to TMS, where an altogether much larger region of the brain is targeted, this will increase the probability of directing sonication to different cortical targets across individuals.</p><p id="P45">Indeed, our post-hoc acoustic simulations demonstrate such inter-individual variability in the location of the acoustic focus relative to M1, where only 5/15 of participants showed a substantial degree of overlap between sonication and the M1 target. Scalp-based transducer placement can thus introduce inter-individual variation in the specific targeted pre- or postcentral elements. Such variation aligns with the known complexity of mapping the TMS-hotspot on the scalp to a specific anatomical target, e.g., a specific section of the omega-shaped hand knob [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, the only study that used personalised targeting to eliminate this variability reported inhibitory effects of 5Hz-rTUS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Neuronavigation and double-blinding may explain failure to replicate</title><p id="P46">While differences in transducer model may come to mind as a possible explanation for the different findings, we would argue that the collapse from neuromodulatory effects in 14/15 participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] to non-significance cannot be explained solely by a difference in transducers. The axial intensity profiles between our four-element transducer and the two-element transducer used previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] are similar, apart from a near-field peak at 12 mm for the original two-element transducer that is too superficial to reach the brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). If the neuromodulatory effects of 5Hz-rTUS were indeed entirely dependent on these very small variations in the pressure fields, it would require extraordinary precision in targeting the same neural structures consistently in every subject. This seems unlikely.</p><p id="P47">The key differences between the original work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] and the present study were the inclusion of TMS neuronavigation and double-blinding. Using only markings on the scalp, precise TMS repositioning is challenging, particularly in terms of orientation. Without neuronavigation, slight trial-by-trial shifts in TMS position can bias MEP amplitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. Further, the approach is prone to circular reasoning if the MEPs, the dependent variable, are themselves used to determine repositioning of the TMS coil. In combination with unblinded researchers, the lack of neuronavigation and double-blinding risks introduction of unconscious confirmation bias. The changes to the original work we introduced minimise such bias. It would seem prudent to suggest that inclusion of neuronavigation for TMS positioning and TUS targeting, and double-blinding should become standard ingredients of future TUS-TMS investigations.</p><p id="P48">Novel approaches to neuromodulation require realistic assessment of their efficacy, to develop methodological standards, direct further development, and ultimately help accelerate clinical use. A key component for this is independent replication. Our replication results here reappraise the effect sizes of excitatory neuromodulation of 5Hz-rTMS to M1 previously reported, but also suggest avenues toward consistent and reproducible evaluation of novel TUS protocols.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><media xlink:href="EMS201310-supplement-Supplementary_Materials.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d6aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Paul Hammond for their help and assistance.</p><sec id="S25"><title>Funding</title><p>
