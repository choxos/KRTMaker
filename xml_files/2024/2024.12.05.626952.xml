Here, we examined early signalling responses to single and combined BRAF and MAPK inhibition in a BRAFV600E, drug-sensitive melanoma cell line and a drug-resistant ARID1A-knockout (KO) derivative. ARID1A, frequently mutated in melanoma, is associated with resistance and immune evasion. Using an innovative systems biology approach that integrates transcriptomics, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and functional kinomics through matrix factorization and network analysis, we identified key signalling alterations and resistance mechanisms.</p><p id="P3">We found that ARID1A-KO cells exhibited transcriptional rewiring, sustaining MAPK1/3 and JNK activity post-treatment, bypassing feedback sensitivity observed in parental cells. This rewiring suppressed PRKD1 activation, increased JUN activity—a central resistance network node—and disrupted PKC dynamics through elevated basal RTKs (e.g., EGFR, ROS1) and Ephrin receptor activity post-treatment. ARID1A mutations also reduced HLA-related protein expression and enriched extracellular matrix components, potentially limiting immune infiltration and reducing immunotherapy efficacy. Our graph-theoretical multi-omics approach uncovered novel resistance-associated signalling pathways, identifying PRKD1, JUN, and NCK1 as critical nodes. While receptor activation redundancies complicate single-target therapies, they also present opportunities for combination strategies.</p><p id="P4">This study highlights ARID1A’s role in reshaping signalling and immune interactions, offering new insights into melanoma resistance mechanisms. By identifying actionable targets, including JUN and immune pathways, we provide a foundation for developing integrated therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance in BRAF/MAPK inhibitor-treated melanoma.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer arising from melanocytes. It is largely driven by aberrant cellular signalling processes, specifically in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, with nearly 40-50% of all melanomas harbouring mutations in the central MAPK pathway kinase BRAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). The second most common mutation accounting for approximately 30% of all melanomas is in neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), an upstream kinase regulator of the MAPK pathway. Mutated BRAF, which in 80% of all BRAF mutations is BRAFV600E, is constitutively active and phosphorylates MEK proteins (MEK1 and MEK2), which in turn activate the downstream MAP kinases and aberrant cell proliferation. Melanoma cells harbouring mutated BRAF typically exhibit a dependency on the BRAF protein and the components of the MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). BRAF inhibitors alone produce highly effective outcomes initially; however, these effects are short-lived, as resistance mechanisms frequently emerge, leading to the reactivation of the MAPK pathway and the development of adverse cutaneous effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Combination therapies were developed to counter this by also inhibiting MEK, which led to longer progression-free survival (PFS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Pharmacological inhibitors designed to target the mutated BRAF, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib, in combination with MEK inhibitors, particularly trametinib, have become standard treatments in clinical settings for melanoma, specifically for patients with activating BRAF mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Despite their effectiveness, the response duration to these treatments are still short-lived, and resistance develops in the majority of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Studies suggest that around 50% of patients treated with BRAF or MEK inhibitors experience disease relapse and progression within 6 to 7 months of initiating treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Resistance to BRAF inhibitors in around 80% of the cases involves genetic and epigenetic changes, leading to the reactivation of the MAPK pathway through the 're-wiring' of cellular signalling processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). Other mechanisms include reactivation of PI3K-mTOR pathway through inactivation of PTEN phosphatase or via stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment that secrete growth factors to activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of both PI3K and MAPK pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Additionally, it has also been shown that cells can develop resistance without acquiring new mutations but rather by temporary and reversible adaptations to selective pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>). Studies have described the existence of persister cells, i.e., cells that continue to grow in culture for a long time even if the oncogenic BRAF is inhibited in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). How adaptive changes in cells relate to acquired resistance is still not fully understood, with some studies suggesting that cells that have undergone adaptive resistance might have low accuracy of DNA replication and low efficacy of DNA damage responses compared to drug-naïve cells leading to the accumulation of resistance mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). A clear understanding of both how intracellular signalling is immediately rewired upon perturbation and how more stable resistance is achieved over the long term is necessary to design future therapies that are more efficacious and longer lasting.</p><p id="P7">As an alternative to targeted therapy, immunotherapy approaches alleviate the inhibition of the immune system by blocking inhibitory receptors allowing immune cells to eliminate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). In melanoma, inhibitory checkpoint blockers, particularly anti-programmed cell-death protein 1 (PD-1) and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), have demonstrated durable responses in a subset of patients. While these responses tend to be more enduring, the overall response rate to immunotherapy is relatively modest, estimated at 40-50% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Consequently, current recommendations advocate for the use of both targeted therapies and immunotherapies as the first-line treatment for metastatic melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Targeted therapy in melanoma is based on the dependency of the cells on the mutated pathway. These include hotspot mutations in genes such as <italic>BRAF</italic>, <italic>NRAS</italic>, <italic>KIT</italic>, <italic>GNAQ</italic> and others. However, there is one frequently mutated gene in melanoma; the one encoding the AT-Rich Interaction Domain 1A (ARID1A) protein, which stands out as it is mutated without a distinct hotspot, which tends to be a pattern for tumour suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). ARID1A is a key component of the switching/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) complex. This complex is known for its pivotal role in chromatin remodelling and influencing tumour epigenetics. Approximately 11.5% of melanoma patients exhibit mutations in the <italic>ARID1A</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>). Mutations in ARID1A are associated with elevated programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, a heightened tumour mutational burden (TMB), decreased infiltration of immune cells into the tumour microenvironment (TME), and compromised mismatch repair (MMR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Notably, a number of genome-wide loss-of-function CRISPR screens have also identified <italic>ARID1A</italic> as a critical factor in conferring resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibitors like vemurafenib, and selumetinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). Despite these significant findings, the clinical significance of ARID1A mutations, particularly in the context of melanoma, remains ambiguous. As ARID1A has been implicated not only in resistance to targeted therapies for melanoma but also for modulating the therapeutic responses to immune checkpoint blockade, its study lends to better understanding of interplay between these mechanisms in developing resistance.</p><p id="P9">Here, we present an integrative multi-omics study to compare the response of drug sensitive ARID1A WT (wild-type) vs resistant ARID1A KO (knockout) melanoma cell lines to both single and combination drug perturbation. We devised a computational strategy that combined data integration using multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>)), with a network propagation-based method, phuEGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), to extract the predominantly affected signalling networks post-short-term treatment of both resistant and sensitive melanoma cell lines with BRAF inhibitors alone or in combination. This allowed us to interpret the data in a unified framework providing new insights into the signalling processes activated in response to single/combination drug treatment of both sensitive and resistant melanoma cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Multi-omics data integration identifies molecular signatures associated with drug response and ARID1A KO</title><p id="P10">ARID1A has been previously identified as a hit in genome-wide screens that have been carried out to identify candidates that confer resistance to MAPK inhibitor (selumetinib) or BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>). We performed two additional genome-wide screens using A375 cells to identify genes required for resistance of these cells to another MAPK inhibitor (trametinib) and identified ARID1A in both replicates together with other genes that are often required for drug resistance in BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cells (e.g., <italic>NF1/2</italic>, <italic>KIRREL</italic>, <italic>MED12</italic>, <italic>TAF5/6L</italic>) suggesting that ARID1A plays a role in resistance to melanoma cells with BRAFV600E mutation in response to MAPK or BRAF inhibitor drugs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S1</xref>). We then used sgRNAs to target <italic>ARID1A</italic> and <italic>MED12</italic>, a previously characterised gene responsible for drug resistance to vemurafenib and treated the cells with trametinib for 6 hours. After this time point, we measured the level of phosphorylation of pMEK and pERK using a Luminex assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>) and noted an increase in both pERK and pMEK phosphorylation in both mutants compared to ‘empty’ sgRNA transduced cell lines. Unlike in the ‘empty’ transduced cell line, the level of pERK in both mutants remained unchanged when the cells were treated with trametinib suggesting that these cells were non-responsive to MAPK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To study the differences between signalling responses and gene regulation to single and combination drug treatment in sensitive versus resistant ARID1A-knockout (KO) cell lines, we acquired an early passage parental A375 cell line and a matched ARID1A KO line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1A and B</xref>). This cell line exhibited increased resistance to both vemurafenib and trametinib treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>). To comprehensively characterise the signalling network rewiring underpinning the resistance of ARID1A KO to BRAF/MEK inhibition, we collected multi-omics data from parental and ARID1A KO cells in the presence or absence of drugs. Specifically, we collected mass spectrometry-based proteomics, phosphoproteomics as well as transcriptomics data upon no treatment or treatment with either trametinib, or vemurafenib, or both drugs for 6 hours (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). We used 6 hours as a time point, as this provided a single steady-state measurement post-treatment of drugs and our pilot measurement of phosphosites on 17-plex luminex assay showed that the effect of MAPK inhibitor on suppression of phosphorylation of key signalling proteins was intact at this time point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1D</xref>).</p><p id="P12">From the mass spectrometry we quantified 8,139 proteins and 3,207 phosphosites after integration of our different experimental runs (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">S3</xref>). Using RNAseq we quantified the transcription of 14,376 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Table S4</xref>). All datasets were reproducible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A-C</xref>). Among the 715 proteins, 372 phosphopeptides and 7,557 genes that were (significantly) differentially abundant (FDR adjusted p value &lt; 0.01) between WT vs ARID1A KO experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Tables S2</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">4</xref>), only 13 were common to all datasets demonstrating the orthogonal nature of the different omics layers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3B</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We next used multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>)) to identify latent factors that explain the variation of all modes of data in a prior knowledge-agnostic manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Our analysis revealed 3 factors describing the adaptive response to drug treatments (Factors 1 and 2) and the sustained resistance response illustrating the effect of the loss of ARID1A (Factor 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). The low-dimensional representation of the data illustrated that the differences between the isolated drug treatments (vemurafenib and trametinib) were marginal at the level of the omics data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Table S5</xref>) compared to the drug combination treatment.</p><p id="P14">Variance decomposition showed that the drug associated factors explain the majority of variance in both protein and phosphosite, and mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Factor 2 (describing the differences that characterise combination therapy), explains no variance in the transcriptome (0%), but the majority of the variation is found in the phosphoproteomic data (32.5%) and to a lesser extent the proteomic data (28.5%). Factor 3 (which is associated with the ARID1A KO) appears to describe variance in the transcriptome (12.7%) and proteome (4.3%) and to a much lesser extent the phosphoproteome (0.5%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p id="P15">To understand the functional implications on the signalling processes represented by the factors identified above, we sought to place the identified genes within the context of their functional environment, i.e., their interaction networks. To this end, we adapted phuEGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), a network propagation-based method, to extract active signatures from phosphoproteomic datasets (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref>), for use with the factor loadings taken from MOFA. PhuEGO combines network propagation with ego network decomposition allowing the identification of small networks that comprise the most functionally and topologically similar nodes to the input ones. This allowed us to generate minimal networks from the factor-specific loadings covering the proteins driving the differences between drug responses and the ARID1A KO, as a function of phosphoproteomic, transcriptomic and proteomic weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This was performed on upregulated and downregulated and then merged to produce 3 networks (<bold>Data S1</bold>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Drug-agnostic changes associated with treatment involve negative feedback of RTKs and MAPK</title><p id="P16">As mentioned above, the changes observed in factor 1 refer to those agnostics to the specific treatment, i.e., regardless of whether BRAF, MEK1/2 or both were inhibited. The most central nodes of the network included several receptors, kinases and transcription factors, with EGF, FYN, IGF1R, TEK, MAPK1 and MAPK3 followed by PRKD1, JUN, PTK2 and INSR being characteristic examples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5A</xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis of the factor 1-associated network finds pathways related to ‘Melanoma’ and various terms related to MAPK signalling, including the term ‘DUSP regulation of MAPK pathway’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B and C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">In agreement with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), we observed the decrease in abundance of the known negative feedback regulators of MAPK (DUSP1/2/4), shown to interact with MAPK3 (ERK1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B</xref>). In both SPRY1/2/4 and SPRED1/2, we detected a decrease in both RNA abundance and protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">S4</xref>). The decrease of these negative regulators of RTK and MAPK signalling seems able to relieve downstream inhibition, leading to increased growth factor signalling and ameliorating the effect of MAPK inhibition by vemurafenib or trametinib.</p><p id="P18">As protein/transcriptome abundance does not correlate well with kinase activity and we only found a few phosphosites modulated, we also collected functional kinomics data using the PamChip technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>), which provides an estimate of multiplex kinase activities in a cell lysate over an array of immobilized target-peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7">Table S6</xref>). The magnitude of changes in the activity of kinases, in this dataset, correlates strongly with the centrality of the kinases within our network, with MAPK1 and PRKD1 being the most central kinases quantified in our network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5D</xref>). Among them, we found a strong reduction in the MAP kinase activities upon drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>), even though this was not mirrored by changes in their respective abundance. We also found several other activated kinases, including PRKD1, FYN and IGFR1, which were shown to be central in our network, as well as ABL2, FLT1 and FGFR2. EGFR presented only a very small increase in activity, which contrasts with its reduction in both transcriptomic and proteomics abundance. Taken together, these results indicate rewiring of RTK-driven signalling following drug perturbation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Combination therapy invokes phosphorylation patterns associated with DNA damage repair</title><p id="P19">Factor 2 illustrates changes that are associated with response to drug combination treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>) and are mostly derived from the phosphoproteomics data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Drug combination treatments targeting both BRAF and MEK are currently the standard of care for patients with metastatic and non-resectable melanoma, and have shown longer remission of the disease in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Our functional kinomics data indicate that there is practically no difference in the effect on MAP kinases between the combination treatment and single treatment with vemurafenib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2E</xref>). We also did not observe a difference in killing efficiency of combination treatment compared to mono-treatment for this cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1C</xref>).

We also observe terms associated with PI3K/Akt signalling and mTOR signalling (‘PI3K events in ERBB2 signalling’ and ‘mTOR signalling pathway’). In the downregulated network, we see terms consistent with the expected inhibition of MAPK signalling, such as ‘MAPK signalling pathway’. We also pinpoint terms associated with DNA damage repair (‘ATM-mediated phosphorylation of repair proteins’ and ‘Recruitment of repair and signalling proteins to double-strand breaks’), as well as processes associated with the immune system and associated signalling (TNF-alpha, Interferons, Interleukins, Prolactin and Growth hormone; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The basal transcriptional state of cells following ARID1A KO influences response to drug treatment</title><p id="P23">Even though the ARID1A-KO cell line is resistant to MEK/BRAF inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), the general networks associated with drug response appear to be very similar at the transcriptome and proteome levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7A and S7B</xref>). At the multiplex kinase activity level, however, we observe distinct differences, such as MAPK1/3's insensitivity to drug treatment, switching activity of PRKD1 and FYN in response to treatments and overall increase in activity of the Ephrin receptor family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). If both conditions respond to drug treatment using the same molecular machinery (as represented by the ‘omics’), how can there be different responses and non-responsiveness to drug treatment at the signalling level? Looking at the initial state of the ARID1A KO cell lines, we observed differences in the initial abundances of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). These include receptors also increasing in the response to drug therapy, including ROS1 and ITGA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Other receptors are increasing in abundance, including EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>) and CD44, while NGFR and IL6R are decreasing in abundance. Oncogenic transcription factors JUN and MYC are increasing in abundance, and so are their corresponding regulons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7C</xref>), indicating an increase in activity and oncogenesis following ARID1A KO.</p><p id="P24">To explore the relevance of this transcriptional reprogramming and how it can rewire responses to therapy, we simulated cross-talks from ARID1A KO-induced changes in receptors and therapy-induced receptor changes. We combined networks derived from Factor 1 (representing drug-agnostic changes in signalling) and Factor 3 (representing ARID1A KO induced changes in signalling) into a network that describes the interaction between these two processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8A</xref>). The resultant network was significantly enriched for the terms ‘MAPK signalling pathway’, ‘Immune system’, ‘Melanoma’, ‘Focal adhesion’ and ‘FGF signalling pathway’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8B</xref>). To study cross-talks, we performed a Markov Random Walk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) to simulate signal propagation from receptors with increased abundance (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Material and Methods</xref>). This was done separately for those receptors upregulated in ARID1A KO versus receptors increased in combined trametinib and vemurafenib treatment, to identify where the two signals converge, and which proteins are common in both processes. This analysis reveals that the random walk converges on several critical proteins, including the transcription factor JUN, as well as the proteins PRKD1, FYN, PTPN6 and PRKCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p><p id="P25">We also performed the same random-walk analysis on the members of the Ephrin receptor family that were strongly activated after drug treatment in ARID1A KO cells, but not in the parental cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A and E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5C</xref>). This flagged other receptors, as well as the tyrosine kinase adaptor protein NCK1, the phosphatase DUSP18 and the kinases PTK2, FYN and DAPK. Absolute levels of the mRNA and protein reveal that NCK1 is no longer responsive to drug therapy as it was in the parental cell line, whereas the levels of DUSP18 become responsive to drug therapy in ARID1A KO, but not in the parental cell line. Conversely, the extent of the changes of the abundances of the kinases FYN and DAPK1 do not differ much between genetic conditions. However, their baseline abundance is affected in both cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S8C</xref>).</p><p id="P26">By calculating maximum flow through the network from these important receptors to MAPK1/3 and JUN/PRKD1, we can assess the routes via which these proteins can interact with each other within our ‘omics’-derived networks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Materials and Methods</xref>). A schematic ‘circuit’ showing the simplified pathways of these networks is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4F</xref>.

We see an increase in basal levels of JUN and MYC activities following ARID1A KO, consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S7C</xref>). Strikingly, in ARID1A KO, we also observe a significant decrease in the expression of the regulons of RFX5, RFXAP and RFXANK, which form the RFX complex to regulate the transcription of MHC class-II genes and NFYC which is also involved in the regulation of the same genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). In ARID1A KO context, we identify a consistent increase in expression of genes that are repressed by RFX5 (COL1A2) and a significant decrease in expression of those genes that are activated by RFX5 (MHC class-II and CD74) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). While MHC class-II family members, which present antigens to CD4<sup>+</sup> T-helper cells, are typically restricted to professional APCs (antigen-presenting cells), such as dendritic cells and B cells, A375 cells have been shown to express MHC class-II molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). To validate our finding, we tested if the expression of MHC class-II proteins on the surface of ARID1A KO A375 cell lines were altered. Remarkably, we found that the expression of HLA-DQ and HLA-DR was significantly decreased in ARID1A KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Of note, among the upregulated transcription factor (TF) activities in ARID1A cells, we were able to recognize TFs in mediating the regulation of extracellular matrices, with TWISTs and SMADs being characteristic examples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A and B</xref>).</p><p id="P28">Using the TCGA database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cancer.gov/tcga">https://www.cancer.gov/tcga</ext-link>), we explored whether these same patterns could be identified in patient data.

Furthermore, we find a significantly elevated activity of the transcription factor SP7, a protein regulating the expression of collagens and metalloproteins. Studying individual gene expression, we reveal that both ARID1A-affected patients and ARID1A KO cells have increased expression of collagens and laminins, which can contribute to increased ECM stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), as well as a decrease in HLA proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P29">Resistance to MAPK inhibitors poses a major challenge in melanoma treatment, driven by adaptive and acquired mechanisms that enable tumour cells to evade therapy. While prior studies often focus on either adaptive responses or acquired resistance in narrow contexts, we examined early signalling changes after drug treatment and compared them to responses in melanoma cells with acquired resistance. Using <italic>ARID1A</italic>, a resistance-associated gene frequently mutated in melanoma, we explored short-term cellular responses in distinct genetic contexts. ARID1A's role in resistance and immune evasion underscores its therapeutic relevance, making it a compelling focus for this study.</p><p id="P30">In our study, we adopted an integrative approach to uncover network-level insights into how signalling responses change under drug pressure in cells with two distinct genetic states. By analyzing transcriptomics, proteomics, and signalling datasets, we addressed the limitations of single-metric approaches. Transcriptomics data offers broader coverage, while proteomics and phosphoproteomics are more affected by technical and biological noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>). To integrate these datasets effectively, we combined integrative matrix factorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>) with a network-centric method that we had previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>), enabling robust interpretation of complex data. This approach highlighted differences in signalling pathways influenced by drug treatment and genetic alterations.</p><p id="P31">We focused our study on early cellular responses to drug treatment, selecting the 6-hour time point as it maintains the pathway inhibition intact and allows the observation of critical cellular changes, such as reduction in the abundance of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) and other MAPK cascade negative regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>). This loss in phosphatases increases cell signalling activity by impairing signal termination from RTKs. We confirmed this feedback sensitivity by observing downregulation of <italic>DUSP</italic>, <italic>SPRY</italic> and <italic>SPRED</italic> genes within 6 hours of drug treatment, alongside heightened RTK (EGFR, IGFR, FGFR) kinase activity, despite minimal changes in their gene or protein expression levels.</p><p id="P32">We used our functional kinomics dataset as an independent and orthogonal way to validate signalling pathways inferred from our multi-omics integration approach. We found that the key nodes in our factor 1-derived network were also the ones whose activity changed the most (mainly for serine/threonine kinases), with a notable decrease in MAPK1/3 activity (the drug target). One striking change both at gene expression level and kinase activity level was that for PRKD1. PRKD1 is a member of the PKD serine/threonine kinase family that can be activated downstream of RTKs and, also, in response to increase in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). It has been long known to be a suppressor of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent JNK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>) by directly complexing with JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Upon PKD phosphorylation by PKC, it complexes with JNK and inhibits its ability to phosphorylate c-Jun at a critical serine-63 position. PRKD1 is frequently mutated and highly expressed in melanoma relative to other cancers, with pro-proliferative or anti-proliferative effects being dependent on context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). We noted an increase in both expression and activity of PRKD1 upon treatment with drugs. This was consistent with decrease in JNK phosphorylation indicating decreased JNK/c-Jun axis activity. In mutant-BRAF melanoma, the JNK/c-Jun signalling pathway is associated with apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>) and pathway activity increases in cells that are quiescent and resistant to apoptosis.</p><p id="P33">Combination therapy is used in clinics targeting two separate entities in the dependent MAPK pathway and has been shown to provide longer efficacy. A paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in BRAF non-mutant cells when BRAF alone is targeted has been described before, which further justifies targeting both BRAF and downstream MAPK components (MAP2K1/2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). At a signalling level, we detected small but specific changes in the phosphorylation of proteins related to DNA repair pathways, such as RIF1, and to EMT, such as SIRT1 and LEO1, although we could not account for these changes to phenotypic variation, as in our experimental design with BRAF-mutant melanoma, we did not observe a significant difference in killing rates with mono or combination therapies. Given our observations, more research is needed to establish whether such changes have indeed a role in promoting EMT and affecting immunogenicity of melanoma cells upon combination treatment.</p><p id="P34">We noted that ARID1A KO and parental cells showed similar mRNA and protein expression responses to drug treatment, including intact feedback mechanisms like DUSP downregulation. However, signalling outcomes differed: ARID1A KO cells maintained MAPK1/3 and JNK activity, indicating resistance to MAPK pathway inhibition. In parental A375 cells, PRKD1 was activated by drug treatment, while in ARID1A KO cells, its activation was suppressed, likely due to transcriptional rewiring. We propose that this relieved JNK inhibition, leading to increased JUN activity, a key node in the resistant network. JUN upregulation is a common response in BRAF inhibitor-treated melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), and dual targeting of JUN and BRAF has shown synergy in overcoming resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>).</p><p id="P35">In our multi-omics network analysis, we identified two different types of signalling behaviour at the receptor level in ARID1A KO cells, which could contribute to this inability to respond to MAPK pathway inhibition. This included differences at a basal expression level of RTKs (EGFR, ROS1) but also at a signalling effect, post drug perturbation level, specifically driven by Ephrin receptors. Studies have demonstrated that elevated expression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as EGFR, can overwhelm the mechanisms responsible for receptor endocytosis and degradation. As a result, the receptor remains chronically active rather than exhibiting transient activation in the presence of a ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Recent work using mechanistic modelling shows that when oncogenic BRAF is fully inhibited, MAPK pathways can be turned on in a RAS dependent manner, which, in turn, is stimulated by receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>). We propose that the basal increase in RTKs (EGFR, ROS1) in ARID1A KO cells and the increased activity from Ephrin receptors post drug treatment could monopolise cellular signalling, leading to changes in PKC dynamics and attenuate PRKD1 response upon treatment with MAPK inhibitors, which leads to higher baseline JUN activity. This is consistent with our observation that subunits of PKC (PRKCB and PRKCZ) themselves are already at a higher phosphorylation status in the ARID1A KO cell line.</p><p id="P36">How mutations in ARID1A influence tumour-immune interactions has been a field of study for multiple cancer types. Previous studies have shown that ARID1A mutations disrupt interferon (IFN) signalling, which diminishes cytotoxic T-cell infiltration, leading to compromised effectiveness of immunotherapy models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). Notably, our analysis of ARID1A-targeted cells and patients with ARID1A mutations revealed significant deficiencies in the basal expression of HLA-related proteins, which are regulated by IFN signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). Apart from loss in MHC class II expression, we also observed enrichment of ECM component expression in these mutant cells. Intriguingly, the same classes of proteins (collagens, laminins, MMPs) have been previously reported to be differentially upregulated in anti-PD1 treatment resistant MC-38 cell lines in mice compared to their treatment-sensitive counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>), suggesting that this basal signature of ARID1A could reduce the efficacy of T cell infiltration and yield immunotherapy less efficacious.</p><p id="P37">Like previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>), we observe the key importance of receptors in rewiring downstream signalling towards resistance. However, in our data, we detect no evidence that ARID1A perturbs any of the negative feedback mechanisms by Gerosa <italic>et al.</italic> (<italic>2020</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>). However, in our system-level characterisation, we see widespread increases in multiple receptors, including EGFR, ROS1, FGFR1 and ITGA4. This suggests a mechanistic redundancy that makes selecting a single ‘silver-bullet’ protein to target infeasible as cellular signalling has multiple routes to restore lost signalling. We used network-centric methods to propagate from these receptors within our network, to reveal new proteins with uncharacterised associations to MAPK resistance, including FYN, PRKD1 and NCK1. NCK1 is an adaptor protein closely associated with Ephrin signalling (through which it was flagged in this analysis). We find that its abundance is distinctly affected by drug response in the parental A375 cell lines, versus ARID1A KO cells. In WT A375 cells, its (<italic>NCK1</italic>) gene abundance drastically drops following drug treatment, whereas when ARID1A is knocked out, it remains unresponsive. In non-oncogenic contexts, NCK1 is a known activator of both JUN (through JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>)) and MAPK (through RAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>)). In this data, we find both these families of kinases to be unresponsive upon ARID1A KO, suggesting a functional interaction between these two events consistent with prior literature.</p><p id="P38">In this study, we used innovative graph-theoretical techniques to integrate multi-omics data using networks. Prior research has arrived on a similar method, showing the utility and potential of using MOFA to construct networks from integrated multi-omics datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>). By combining factor analysis with diffusion-based network construction, our study uniquely incorporates phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics and protein abundance data to derive unbiased, multi-omics networks that reveal perturbed pathways in melanoma drug resistance. Unlike methods relying solely on annotated pathways, this approach allows the data to drive the discovery process, while still enabling functional annotation through enrichment analysis. Additionally, the inclusion of kinomics activity data validates the identified network nodes by linking them to the most perturbed kinases following drug treatment. Our methodology captures the orthogonal effects of drug treatments and genetic rewiring, while uncovering shared protein-protein interactions that describe the interplay between the two processes, offering a robust framework for extracting biologically relevant insights from noisy datasets and prioritising hypotheses for further investigation.</p><p id="P39">In summary, this study provides a comprehensive systems-level analysis of the early cellular responses to MAPK pathway inhibition in melanoma, revealing distinct adaptive and resistance mechanisms. By leveraging innovative graph-theoretical and multi-omics integration techniques, we demonstrated that ARID1A-mediated transcriptional rewiring significantly alters the cellular signalling landscape, driving resistance to MAPK inhibitors. Our findings highlight key differences between parental and ARID1A KO melanoma cells, particularly in signalling pathways involving PRKD1, JUN and receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., EGFR, ROS1). These differences underpin the enhanced resistance observed in ARID1A KO cells. Additionally, the integration of functional kinomics with multi-omics datasets enabled the identification of critical nodes within drug-resistant signalling networks. Notably, we observed a mechanistic redundancy in receptor activation that complicates single-target therapies but presents opportunities for combination strategies targeting JUN or immune pathways. These insights advance our understanding of melanoma resistance mechanisms and lay the groundwork for more effective therapeutic interventions, including the potential integration of immunotherapies tailored to specific genetic and signalling contexts.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P40">Parental and <italic>ARID1A</italic>-targeted A375 lines were grown in DMEM-F12 (Gibco, Cat.

A typical PTK PamChip® microarray contains 196 immobilized peptides, while a STK PamChip® microarray contains 140 peptides covalently attached to a porous material. Peptides harbor phosphorylation sites derived from literature or computational predictions that are associated with one or more upstream kinases. Phosphorylation is detected by (phospho-)specific primary antibodies and the signal is quantified by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. Detection is performed in multiple cycles at different exposure times and is monitored by a CCD camera. Protein lysates were prepared from untreated and drug-treated A375 melanoma cell lines of both genotypes, using M-PER mammalian extraction buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), containing Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail and Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail EDTA-free (1:100 each; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and quantified by the Bradford assay. A total of 5 μg and 1 μg of protein lysates per array from each biological sample were used to profile tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase activity, respectively, according to PamGene’s standard protocols. Image analysis, peptide quality control (QC), signal quantitation, data normalization and visualization, as well as upstream kinase prediction were performed using Bionavigator v.6.3 software (PamGene, 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Three independent biological replicates were used for each condition (parental (wild-type, WT), ARID1A KO, untreated or drug-treated A375 melanoma cells).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Transcriptomics data generation</title><p id="P48">Cells were seeded at 0.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well density in 6-well plates and left overnight.

We took raw peptide abundances and protein abundances from Proteome Explorer, and we normalised both by sample loading normalisation.

Latent factor weights were extracted for each omics view (i.e., phosphoproteomics, proteomics and mRNA expression) using the get-weights function from the MOFA2 package. For each protein, the phosphosite with the highest absolute weight was selected and then the results of each condition were aggregated across each view, so we had a protein-level weight. We extracted proteins exhibiting the most extreme weights for each factor by selecting the top or bottom 5% quantiles. Using these proteins as seeds, we ran phuEGO with parameters Fisher-threshold = 0.1, Fisher-background = intact, Random-walk damping = 0.95, RWR-threshold = 0.01 and KDE-cutoff = [0.5].

We used the union of graphs for Factor 1 (showing drug agnostic responses) and Factor 3 (showing ARID1A KO-induced responses) to visualise the interaction between these two processes. For both ARID1A KO and combination drug treatments, we extract receptor LFC (log-fold change) data and split them into upregulated and downregulated receptors. We processed LFC datasets from differential expression analysis by filtering receptors (as defined by Omnipath) that are significantly affected (adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01). Receptors were identified using the OmnipathR package. These LFCs are normalised by dividing each element by the sum of the vector (to prepare for random walks). We then perform a random walk on a graph with a given starting vector of probabilities derived from the LFCs above. The random walk is corrected for hubs and used to compute a stationary distribution that indicates the relative importance of a node for each condition.</p><p id="P63">To study the effect of increases in Ephrin receptor activation on our network, we take the union network prior to PageRank/PCSF pre-processing and perform random walk with restart on the receptor kinase activity, determined by the functional kinomics, target-peptide, phospho-tyrosine data.

We filtered this data to retain kinases that had statistically significant changes in activity (e.g., higher than a threshold of ±1 median kinase activity). Starting from an initial set of deregulated receptors (normalised from the previous step), we performed random walks over the network to estimate the stationary distribution of each node.
