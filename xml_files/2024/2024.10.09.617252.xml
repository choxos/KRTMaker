To address these challenges, we present an optimized pipeline for <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> transformation and simplified a protocol to obtain stable transgenic lines of the model liverwort <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic>, paving the way for efficient high-throughput experiments for plant synthetic biology and other applications. Our protocol involves freeze-thaw <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> transformation method in 6-well plates that can be adapted to robotic automation. Using the Opentrons open-source platform, we implemented a semi-automated protocol showing similar efficiency compared to manual manipulation. Additionally, we have streamlined and simplified the process of stable transformation and selection of <italic>M. polymorpha</italic>, reducing cost, time, and manual labour without compromising transformation efficiency. The addition of sucrose in the selection media significantly enhances the production of gemmae, accelerating the generation of isogenic plants. We believe these protocols have the potential to facilitate high-throughput screenings in diverse plant species and represent a significant step towards the full automation of plant transformation pipelines. This approach allows testing ~100 constructs per month, using conventional plant tissue culture facilities.

To achieve these goals, hundreds of genetic parts need to be tested in a high-throughput and cost-effective manner to build comprehensive atlases or toolsets. However, working with plants for genetic engineering presents significant challenges compared to model organisms like bacteria or yeast. While heterologous or cell-free systems can be convenient for high-throughput experimentation, many biological approaches require working <italic>in planta</italic>. Current high-throughput plant transformation strategies involve infiltration of vegetative tissues with <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> (<italic>Agrobacterium</italic> for short), particle bombardment, or osmotic-based methods in protoplasts. Among them, agroinfiltration of <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves is popular, but transient systems are also applicable to leaf discs and other model plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). However, transient transformation has limitations for studying genetics in a developmental or physiological context and scalability needs expensive special equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Reed et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, generating stable and isogenic transgenic plants is time-consuming due to long generation times and the need for expensive plant growth facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ayub and Soto, 2023</xref>).</p><p id="P3">To speed-up design-build-test-learn cycles for plant biotechnology, automation and optimization of different steps of plant transformation are necessary. Although <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-based transformation methods are widely used for plant transformation, protocols for the transformation of the bacteria are often overlooked in optimization efforts and no automated protocols are available. The most commonly used protocol, electroporation, yields high transformation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Wise et al., 2006</xref>) but is challenging to scale up and can be expensive due to the use of 25-well and 96-well electroporation plate systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Buchser et al., 2006</xref>). This limits the feasibility of transforming arrayed libraries for large scale screens. Other alternatives, such as chemical transformation, triparental mating, and freeze-thaw methods, are generally cheaper, but less effective than electroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Wise et al., 2006</xref>). Among them, the freeze-thaw method is generally simpler, allows transformation in bulk, and more cost-effective than other methods and has potential for scale-up. However, a high-throughput <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated plant transformation has not been implemented yet.</p><p id="P4">The liverwort <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> (<italic>Marchantia</italic> for short) has emerged as a valuable model organism for evo-devo studies and synthetic biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Sauret-Gueto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bowman et al., 2022</xref>). It features a relatively small (280 Mbp) and well characterised genome, a growing community of researchers and well-established genetic engineering tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Ishizaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Frangedakis et al., 2021</xref>). The haploid nature of the vegetative body of <italic>Marchantia</italic>, extraordinary regenerative ability, and short vegetative life cycle enable the quick generation of stable transgenic lines, compared to obtaining homozygous transgenic lines in flowering plant model systems such as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> or <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>.</p><p id="P5"><italic>Marchantia</italic> nuclear transformation can be achieved using particle bombardment or <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-based methods, with the latter being the easiest and most efficient method so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chiyoda et al., 2008</xref>). Various tissues of <italic>Marchantia</italic>, such as gemmae, adult thalli or spores, can serve as starting materials for plant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ishizaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kubota et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Tsuboyama and Kodama, 2018</xref>). Sporelings offer an extraordinary tissue for transformation, as a single sporangium can yield 600-1000 independent transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ishizaki et al., 2008</xref>). While some efforts were made to simplify <italic>Marchantia</italic> transformation with reasonable efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Tsuboyama and Kodama, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Sauret-Gueto et al., 2020</xref>), there has been limited comparison of these protocols.</p><p id="P6">Considering the need for improved plant transformation methods to enable high-throughput approaches, we optimized and miniaturized a protocol for <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> transformation based on the classic freeze-thaw method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hofgen and Willmitzer, 1988</xref>). Additionally, several steps of the process were automated using the open-source platform Opentrons OT-2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opentrons.com">https://opentrons.com</ext-link>), allowing up to 96 transformations per batch. The resulting bacterial strains can be then used for either plant transient or stable transformation, depending on the application. Furthermore, we compared different methods for <italic>Marchantia</italic> sporeling transformation and proposed a simplified and miniaturized protocol using 6-well plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Sauret-Gueto et al., 2020</xref>) with optimized selection and rapid generation of propagules. This end-to-end pipeline significantly simplified the process, reducing hands-on work and costs, as well as facilitating scale up without significantly comprising transformation efficiency. The total time required, starting from a genetic construct to obtain a stable transgenic plant ready for downstream analysis, has been reduced to only 4 weeks. We successfully applied this pipeline to test the expression patterns of fluorescent reporters for a collection of over ~360 promoters, representing approximately 80% of transcription factors in the <italic>Marchantia</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Romani et al., 2023</xref>). With this approach, it is feasible to test about one hundred constructs per month using conventional plant tissue culture facilities in a cost-effective manner. For both methods, we provide detailed step-by-step protocols and instructional videos to illustrate the process.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Transformation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens</title><p id="P7">To accelerate the transformation of <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic>, we optimized and miniaturized a freeze-thaw transformation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hofgen and Willmitzer, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Weigel and Glazebrook, 2006</xref>). Compared to most existing approaches for the preparation of electrocompetent cells, this method is simpler, cheaper, less laborious and more suitable for large scale experiments. Competent cells were generated by simply growing cells in LB media overnight, concentrating them through centrifugation (see Supplemental Document 1) and finally aliquoting 50 μL in 200 μL tube strips (PCR tubes) or in 96-well plates. These stocks can be stored in a -70/80 °C ultra freezer for several months.</p><p id="P8">For transformation, 2 μL of miniprep DNA (~200 ng) of the desired plasmid was added to the ice-thawed competent cells and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for ~10 seconds. The cells were then transferred to a thermal cycler programmed to deliver a heat shock of 5 minutes at 37ºC, followed by 60 minutes at 28 °C for recovery. The transformed cells (50 μL) were then directly plated on 6-well plates containing LB agar with antibiotics for selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A,E</xref>). A gentle circular movement was sufficient to spread the cells across the well, eliminating the need for a sterile spatula or glass beads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplemental Video 1</xref>). The plates were then incubated at 28 °C. Colonies were visible after 2 days, but we recommend growing them for up to 3 days to obtain large colonies.</p><p id="P9">Compared to previous applications, our method significantly reduced the bacterial cell volume (from 2-0.25 mL to 50 μL per reaction), DNA amount (from 1-5 μg to 200 ng), and simplified and shortened various steps (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Document 1</xref> for details). Instead of using a water bath and a shaking incubator for the heath-shock at 37 °C and subsequent incubation at 28 °C, we found that a thermocycler performed both steps without compromising efficiency. Additionally, the use of 6-well plates proved to be cost-effective, convenient for storage, and amenable to automation of subsequent steps. The transformation efficiency of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> was determined to be an average of 8 × 10<sup>3</sup> colony forming units (CFU)/μg DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>) for a 7.2 kb plasmid, without false positives 4 days after plating (100% colonies showing GFP+). This efficiency aligns with previous estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Wise et al., 2006</xref>). Although it is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than electroporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), it is only about 1 order of magnitude lower than that of chemically competent <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://goldbio.com/product/14849/gv3101-agrobacterium-chemically-competent-cells">https://goldbio.com/product/14849/gv3101-agrobacterium-chemically-competent-cells</ext-link>). This level of efficiency is sufficient for routine experiments, as it allows the generation of several hundred colonies per plate using as little as 30-35 ng of DNA, and further miniaturization is feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>). We used <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> GV3101 strain for most tests, as it is the most efficient for <italic>Marchantia</italic> transformation and widely used for agroinfiltration in <italic>N. benthamiana leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Li, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Tsuboyama and Kodama, 2018</xref></italic>). As different strains can be used for various plant transformation pipelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>), we tested it with three more strains: LBA4404 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Ooms et al., 1982</xref>), EHA105 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Hood et al., 1993</xref>), and AGL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Lazo et al., 1991</xref>). While LBA4404 showed similar efficiency compared to GV3101, EHA105 exhibited one order of magnitude lower efficiency, and we did not obtain colonies using AGL-1. We recommend testing the efficiency before implementing high-throughput pipelines in alternative strains.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Automation of Agrobacterium transformation</title><p id="P10">Adaptation of the freeze-thaw protocol made the process suitable for automation, and offered several advantages, including significant reductions in cost and time. In order to implement automation at low cost, we adapted the workflows for use on the <italic>Opentrons</italic> liquid handling robots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). These devices have been designed to lower the entry cost for bench-top robotic handling of liquids and maintain versatility. We initially designed four protocols using the Protocol Designer tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://designer.opentrons.com/">https://designer.opentrons.com/</ext-link>): a stock preparation aliquoting protocol, two transformation protocols for 24 and 96 samples, and a plating protocol for 96 samples (Supplemental File 1-4).</p><p id="P11">Unlike previous methods for bacterial transformation using the OT2 where plating was done with droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Storch et al., 2020</xref>), we employed the same 6-well plate configuration used for the manual freeze-thaw method. This setting reduced the risk of cross-contamination and was useful for downstream plant transformation pipelines. In the transformation protocols, we utilized the Opentrons Gen-1 Thermocycler module (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opentrons.com/products/modules/thermocycler/">https://opentrons.com/products/modules/thermocycler/</ext-link>) for the heat-shock step, while manually snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Nonetheless, any thermocycler external to the Opentrons can be used.</p><p id="P12">Workflows were designed to handle up to 24 transformations in one run, including plating, or up to 96 with the plating step carried out as a separate protocol. Still, workflows created using the Protocol Designer tool lack flexibility and need to be adjusted to plastic labware, sample number, and volume desired. Therefore, we implemented the protocols in Jupyter Notebooks, which can be more flexibly edited and provide a useful medium to have both protocol instructions and execution commands in the same file. For this, three protocols were developed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6">Supplementary File 5-7</xref>) capable of executing the same functions after tailored input of the relevant parameters.</p><p id="P13">To assess the risk of cross-contamination between different plasmids during operation, we conducted a test using a 96-well plate containing alternate wells with plasmids expressing sfGFP or lacZ under constitutive bacterial promoters and observed the fluorescence. After 3 days at 28 °C, no contamination or cross-contamination was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Additionally, the efficiency of transformations carried out using the OT2 robot exhibited similar results compared to manual manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Generation of Marchantia sporelings</title><p id="P14">The transformed bacteria obtained from the previous step can be used for further applications in <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-based plant transformation protocols. For stable plant transformation, we optimized a protocol for <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> sporeling transformation. Sporeling transformation has been successfully applied to several accessions, such as the Tak-1/2 and Cam-1/2. Cam-1/2 is very efficient for generating spores in laboratory conditions and has been used for synthetic biology applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Sauret-Gueto et al., 2020</xref>). Dried spores can be stored at -80 °C for years or at 4 °C for several months to years. Although spores could be produced and collected in axenic conditions, surface sterilization was used to prevent occasional fungal or bacterial contamination. Spores were sterilized by brief treatment with Milton Mini sterilization tablets (Sauret-Güeto et al. 2020)..</p><p id="P15">Previous protocols involved pre-culturing spores in either liquid media supplemented with sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ishizaki et al., 2008</xref>), solid media supplemented with sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Tsuboyama and Kodama, 2014</xref>) or without sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Sauret-Gueto et al., 2020</xref>). To compare both methods, we tested germination rates using various media. We found that sporelings germinated at similar rates in solid or liquid 0.5x Gamborg’s B5 without any supplement, but the germination rate was lower when supplements and sucrose were added to the liquid media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Sucrose and supplements are essential during co-culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kubota et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Tsuboyama and Kodama, 2014</xref>), thus it is convenient to separate the spore pre-culture media from the co-culture media as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Sauret-Gueto et al., 2020</xref>) to optimize germination while minimise contamination risk associated with sucrose. This is also helps preventing clumping of spores, which was often observed in sporeling liquid culture.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Transformation of Marchantia</title><p id="P16">Spores germinated in solid media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>) and then collected and transferred to co-culture media (with supplements and acetosyringone). We simplified and miniaturised this step by growing spores in solid 0.5x Gamborg B5 media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2A</xref>) and using 1-2 sporangiophores for up to 24 transformations (about 10 sporangia). For this purpose, we used 4 mL co-cultures media in 6-well plates as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Sauret-Gueto et al. (2020)</xref>, which provided a degree of miniaturization compared to the protocols of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ishizaki et al. (2008)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p id="P17">In previous protocols, the next step involved the pre-culture of transformed <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> strains prior to co-culture with plant material. Typically, bacteria were grown in LB liquid media for two days, followed by centrifugation, and then another growth step in 0.5x Gamborg’s B5 media with sucrose, vitamins, and acetosyringone for 6 hours before co-culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ishizaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Sauret-Gueto et al., 2020</xref>) or for 2 days on solid media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Tsuboyama and Kodama, 2018</xref>). To simplify this part of the protocol, we tested whether <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> could be directly inoculated into a spore culture in liquid media. We found that “scooping” a colony from the <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> selection plate using a sterile toothpick, or pipette tip, straight into the co-culture worked as well as pre-culturing (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplemental Video 2</xref>), reducing notably hands-on work and time and the number of steps. We recommend growing the <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> on plates for 3 days, as colonies were easier to collect. The use of 6-well plates for <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> and co-culture also significantly helped with the manual handling of the experimental materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p id="P18">The co-culture was then carried out for 2 days as optimized before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ishizaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Sauret-Gueto et al., 2020</xref>). After co-culturing, sporelings were collected using a 70 μm cell sterile strainer, washed, and then plated on 60 mm petri dishes. The use of small 60 mm petri dishes significantly reduces the footprint in growth chambers. The petri dishes contained selective antibiotics and cefotaxime to eliminate growth of any remaining <italic>Agrobacteria</italic> during the selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). The sporelings were spread on the plate with a gentle circular movement (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Supplemental Video 3</xref>).</p><p id="P19">We observed an average transformation efficiency of about ~600 transgenic plants per sporangium used among different batches with the <italic>Marchantia Cam-1/2</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2G</xref>). This is comparable to the efficiency described for the Tak-1/2 strain in previous protocols under optimal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ishizaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Ishizaki et al., 2015</xref>). We also observed that the Tak-1/2 strain work as well in our protocol. Overall, this demonstrates that the simplification steps made in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Sauret-Gueto <italic>et al</italic>. (2020)</xref> and here did not have a significant negative impact on plant transformation efficiency.</p><p id="P20">For lower throughput experiments or laboratories without a supply of sporangia, a similar set-up in 6-well plates and direct inoculation of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> could be used to transform thallus fragments, adapting the protocol from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kubota et al. (2013)</xref>, at the likely expense of a lower efficiency of transformation.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Optimized selection of transgenic lines</title><p id="P21">After co-cultivation and 10 days of growth, the sporelings grew large enough to be transferred to a second selection plate. This second selection step is indispensable to prevent crowding of spores, to accelerate plant growth, and to eliminate false positives. We recommend transferring 6-7 independent lines to 90 mm petri dishes to screen for genetic variability between different T-DNA insertions and avoid overcrowding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Following this optimized pipeline, one could routinely transform 24 transgenic lines per week, allowing testing of up to a hundred different constructs per month with overlapping pipelines. The total footprint for two consecutive batches of transformation was less than 0.6 m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), significantly reducing the cost of energy and space required in growth cabinets compared to flowering plant models.</p><p id="P22">The gemma of <italic>Marchantia</italic> is an extraordinary tissue for plant biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Romani et al., 2023</xref>). Gemmae are clonal propagules that are produced in cups, and form part of a short vegetative life cycle. They can be directly used for the visualization of fluorescent reporters or other assays, providing information about the entire organism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, obtaining gemma cups can sometimes be a bottleneck for systematic pipelines, particularly in the Cam-1/2 <italic>Marchantia</italic> background. It has been shown that supplementation with sucrose can boost the production of gemmae cups (Terui, 1981). To address this, we tested different concentrations of sucrose to boost gemma cup production from sporelings after the first selection. We found that supplementation with 0.5% or 1% sucrose (w/v) significantly increased cup production after 10 days of selection. By day 15 of the second selection, most replicates had cups in all independent lines when supplemented with sucrose, while unmodified 0.5x Gamborg’s B5 showed no cups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). As there was no significant difference between 0.5% and 1% sucrose supplementation, we adopted 0.5% as the standard for our experiments due to its negligible effect on other aspects of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P23">Elements of this streamlined pipeline could be implemented not only in novel model systems like <italic>Marchantia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>) but also in more established and rapid pipelines like agroinfiltration in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>).

We introduced simplified steps for freeze-thaw transformation of <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>, sample handling, and <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> transformation to facilitate cost-effective and scalable high-throughput experiments without the need for specialized lab equipment. Thanks to this pipeline, a single worker can maintain an output of up to a hundred independent <italic>Marchantia</italic> plants transformed per month and we have successfully employed this for the screening of an arrayed library of about ~360 transcription factor promoters (Romani et al., 2024). Further, we successfully adapted our simplified <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> transformation protocol to a semi-automated open source robotic platform, Opentrons OT2, aiding the development of yet higher-throughput plant transformation methods. Moreover, different versions of the protocols were created using the Protocol Designer tool and via Python code with custom Jupyter Notebooks. This makes the protocols open to scientists with different levels of programming expertise. These automated protocols have the potential to significantly reduce costs, human error, and experimental preparation time, benefitting both small laboratories and specialized biofoundries.</p><p id="P25">While automated protocols for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> transformations in cloning already exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Storch et al., 2020</xref>), there is a lack of similar methods for <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>. This protocol is a much-needed resource for the plant bioscience community, especially in the field of plant synthetic biology. By using the open-source Opentrons platform, we ensure that automation is accessible to a broader range of researchers without requiring additional specialised equipment. This can be coupled with high-throughput design and assembly of genetic constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bryant et al., 2023</xref>) to make a more comprehensive pipeline. Further advances in automation and instruments could lead to fully automated protocols. We support the existing protocols with in-depth tutorials for the entire workflow in OT2 robots, reflecting our commitment to accessibility and future development.</p><p id="P26">Additionally, we have simplified and optimised <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> transformation and the selection of transgenic lines, utilizing this extraordinary model plant for high-throughput experiments. <italic>Marchantia</italic> has also been demonstrated as suitable for transient transformation using <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Iwakawa et al., 2021</xref>) or particle bombardment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Konno et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Westermann et al., 2020</xref>), allowing for testing of subcellular localization, <italic>in vivo</italic> sgRNAs for CRISPR/Cas9 testing, or protein-protein interactions.</p><p id="P27">Our pipeline highlights the scalability of <italic>Marchantia</italic> stable transformation and the feasibility of obtaining stable isogenic transgenic lines in a cost-effective manner and within a relatively short timeframe. The bottleneck in this pipeline is no longer in generating stable transgenic lines, but rather in testing them. This demands simple read-outs, such as examining expression patterns in the gemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Romani et al., 2023</xref>). Both <italic>Marchantia</italic> and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> are extraordinary chassis for bioproduction and metabolic engineering and can be optimized and engineered for different applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Golubova et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Tansley et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Tse et al., 2024</xref>).
