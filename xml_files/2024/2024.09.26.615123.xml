Overall genomes in aging normal esophagus remain genome stable apart from LOH at driver loci.</p><p id="P15">The most striking observation was the disruption of <italic>NOTCH1</italic> across most of the tissue by middle age. We speculated that this may alter the selection of mutations that occur in the subsequent decades of life. To test this, we first compared the number of non-synonymous mutants in samples which were predominantly <italic>NOTCH1</italic> mutant (<italic>NOTCH1</italic>High), i.e. the summed VAF for all <italic>NOTCH1</italic> mutant clones exceeded 0.4 (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Methods</xref>) with the remaining <italic>NOTCH1</italic>Low samples. In both 0.5 mm<sup>2</sup> and 2 mm<sup>2</sup> <italic>NOTCH1</italic>High samples, selection of mutant <italic>NOTCH2</italic> was increased and selection of mutant <italic>TP53</italic> mutants decreased compared with the corresponding <italic>NOTCH1</italic>Low samples, while other positively selected mutants were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a-b</xref>). Furthermore, the VAF of <italic>NOTCH2</italic> mutations was increased in 2 mm<sup>2</sup> <italic>NOTCH1</italic>High samples across all age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). <italic>TP53</italic> mutant clones had a smaller VAF in <italic>NOTCH1</italic>High samples in donors aged over 70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref>). These results suggests that selection may be altered following <italic>NOTCH1</italic> mutation.</p><p id="P16">To challenge this hypothesis, we turned to a mouse model.

The sequencing depth of exon1 of <italic>Notch1</italic>, which is deleted by <italic>Cre</italic> recombination, was used to check for recombination in each sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Extended Data Fig. 3a</xref>).

The APOBEC mutational signature, prominent in over 90% of ESCC, was not detected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. The absence of multiple ESCC genome changes in normal esophagus, together with the dominance of the anti-oncogenic mutant <italic>NOTCH1</italic> seems consistent with the comparatively low incidence of ESCC in the UK.</p><p id="P20">What is the significance of increased <italic>NOTCH2</italic> selection in <italic>NOTCH1</italic> mutant epithelium? The proportion of epithelium carrying nonsynonymous <italic>NOTCH2</italic> mutants in human esophagus reaches 5.7% in 70–79-year-olds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>). However, <italic>NOTCH2</italic> mutations are found in only 2.8% of ESCC (38/1345, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic">https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic</ext-link>). The similar prevalence of mutants in normal tissue and cancer argues against <italic>NOTCH2</italic> mutants having a major role in promoting transformation and is consistent with the proposition that mutant <italic>NOTCH1</italic> protects against transformation.</p><p id="P21">The observation of decreased selection of mutant <italic>TP53</italic> and lower VAF of mutant <italic>TP53</italic> clones in <italic>NOTCH1</italic>High samples above the age of 70 is intriguing. By age 70 the tissue is saturated with mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>), so in <italic>NOTCH1</italic>High samples <italic>TP53</italic> mutant clones are likely to compete for space with <italic>NOTCH1</italic> mutants. The competitive fitness of <italic>TP53</italic> mutants is less than mutant <italic>NOTCH1</italic> as evidenced by their ability to colonize normal esophagus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2 c,d</xref>). Furthermore, in transgenic mouse esophagus, it appears that mutagen induced <italic>Notch1</italic> mutants may restrict the expansion of <italic>p53</italic> mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>.
