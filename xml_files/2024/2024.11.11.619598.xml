Here, we assayed 284 mostly poorly characterized, putative human TFs using selective microfluidics-based ligand enrichment followed by sequencing (SMiLE-seq), revealing 72 new DNA binding motifs. To investigate whether some of the 158 TFs for which we did not find motifs preferably bind epigenetically modified DNA (i.e. methylated CG dinucleotides), we developed methylation-sensitive SMiLE-seq (meSMiLE-seq). This microfluidic assay simultaneously probes the affinity of a protein to methylated and unmethylated DNA, augmenting the capabilities of the original method to infer methylation-aware binding sites. We assayed 114 TFs with meSMiLE-seq and identified DNA-binding models for 48 proteins, including the known methylation-sensitive binding modes for POU5F1 and RFX5. For 11 TFs, binding to methylated DNA was preferred or resulted in the discovery of alternative, methylation-dependent motifs (e.g. PRDM13), while aversion towards methylated sequences was found for 13 TFs (e.g. USF3). Finally, we uncovered a potential role for ZHX2 as a putative binder of Z-DNA, a left-handed helical DNA structure which is adopted more frequently upon CpG methylation. Altogether, our study significantly expands the human TF codebook by identifying DNA binding motifs for 98 TFs, while providing a versatile platform to quantitatively assay the impact of DNA modifications on TF binding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Transcription factors (TFs) are critical for gene regulation by binding their cognate binding sites (TFBS) to modulate target gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>. The interaction between TFs and DNA tends to be mediated through DNA binding domains (DBDs) that recognize distinct DNA patterns (also called ‘DNA motifs’). Despite their crucial role in gene regulation, the TFBS for approximately 400 out of around 1,600 putative human TFs remain poorly characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. The largest and most diverse TF family is the Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub> zinc finger proteins (C2H2 ZNFs), which constitute the majority of uncharacterized TFs. A human ZNF contains on average 11 individual zinc finger domains (ZFDs), most of which are thought to be capable of binding DNA. However, not all ZFDs necessarily make DNA contacts, which complicates the inference of binding properties, resulting in nearly one third of all ~750 predicted ZNFs still lacking clearly defined binding motifs. Additionally, recent studies have provided evidence that DNA binding is not exclusively mediated by structured DBDs and that intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) can also alter a TF’s sequence specificity and even affinity to DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. Given the difficulty in structurally modeling such IDRs, this also renders the <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of DNA binding motifs challenging despite major recent computational advances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The experimental identification of protein-DNA interactions therefore remains an important outstanding challenge, as it continues to be seen as the gold standard to derive DNA binding motifs.</p><p id="P3">Another convoluting factor for defining TF binding models is the epigenetic state of DNA, specifically the methylation of CG dinucleotides, which can drastically alter the binding affinity of TFs to their respective binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>. For instance, TF families including bHLH and bZIP TFs are frequently repelled by CG methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>, while MBDs or C/EBP have an increased affinity for methylated CGs in a specific sequence context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. Various <italic>in vitro</italic> methods based on protein binding microarrays (PBMs) and systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) have been developed to define the effect of DNA modification on TF binding in high-throughput, and have revealed that CG methylation can differentially modulate binding affinities even for TFs in the same TF family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>. These methods enable profiling TF interactions with methylated DNA, but they also retain the disadvantages of the original techniques, such as the limited combinatorial space in PBM and the surplus enrichment of the strongest binding sites in SELEX. While information about methylation specificity can to some extent also be imputed from genomic assays such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), these approaches typically lack resolution (fragment sizes generally span hundreds of base pairs) and require an indirect link between TF-associated peaks with in-depth whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) from the matched cell types, as the methylation status of pulled-down, TF-bound sequences is often not available. Additionally, ChIP-seq-derived binding motifs might be cell type- or co-factor-specific and do not necessarily reflect a TF’s ability to directly bind or evade epigenetically modified DNA.</p><p id="P4">To assign binding motifs for the remaining, uncharacterized human TFs, the Codebook and GRECO-BIT initiatives joined in a collaborative attempt to determine the DNA binding sites for the remaining putative DNA-binding TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. In this effort, a total of 394 TFs including positive controls were assayed using five orthogonal experimental DNA binding assays. The latter included ChIP-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>, genomic and classical high-throughput SELEX ((G)HT-SELEX)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, and PBMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. A fifth method is presented here: selective microfluidics-based ligand enrichment followed by sequencing (SMiLE-seq), which is a high-throughput microfluidic technique for examining TF-DNA interactions that relies on the mechanically induced trapping of molecular interactions (MITOMI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup> concept. This comprehensive experimental strategy aimed to leverage the strengths of each of the five methods while mitigating their respective limitations, such as validating the primary motif of a TF from the often noisy but genomic binding sites acquired by ChIP-seq with the high information content motifs from HT-SELEX. Additionally, the obtained data were analyzed with multiple motif discovery tools and conservatively hand-curated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. The resulting motifs were then benchmarked<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> to identify the most robust binding models.</p><p id="P5">Here, we report the SMiLE-seq-based findings of the Codebook/GRECO-BIT collaboration, having assayed 284 putative TFs and derived binding models for 98 TFs. To address the hypothesis that some of the TFs for which no DNA binding motifs were recovered may in fact bind epigenetically modified DNA instead, we developed methylation-sensitive SMiLE-seq (‘meSMiLE-seq’), an assay to simultaneously probe a TF’s affinity to unmethylated and methylated DNA. By screening 114 putative TFs using meSMiLE-seq, we identified DNA motifs that include information about (me)CG affinity for 48 TFs. In addition, we derived motifs for several TFs that exclusively associate with methylated DNA, rationalizing why they remained orphan in the canonical DNA binding assays that were employed within the Codebook Consortium. Finally, we provide evidence that certain methylation-sensitive TFs are directed to distinct binding sites in the genome in a CG methylation-dependent manner, thus validating our <italic>in vitro</italic> observations.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>SMiLE-seq identifies binding motifs of 98 putative human TFs</title><p id="P6">We aimed to define the DNA binding specificities of 284 putative, uncharacterized TFs (selected through manual curation and including 3 positive controls, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table 1</xref> and<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>) using SMiLE-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In this assay, DNA libraries are added to <italic>in vitro</italic> translated TF-GFP fusion proteins and transferred into a microfluidic device, where binding events between the TF and DNA are captured after a single enrichment step. Subjecting the TF-bound fraction to high-throughput sequencing of eluted DNA fragments then allows for computational <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 1a-b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. Compared to alternative approaches such as HT-SELEX, SMiLE-seq has the advantage of capturing both strong and weak interactions without compromising the sampling space such as in PBMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. However, given the single round of enrichment, SMiLE-seq is sensitive to potentially skewed nucleotide distributions in the input libraries given that binding enrichment is restricted to one round (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 2a</xref>). Additionally, while SMiLE-seq allows capturing low-affinity binding sites, the obtained data tend to be noisier than after multiple rounds of enrichment (as is done in HT-SELEX), which typically results in motifs with lower information content.</p><p id="P7">To mitigate the effects of potential sequence biases in the input DNA libraries on <italic>de novo</italic> motif discovery, we used a one-sided Fisher’s exact test to select sequencing reads containing statistically enriched <italic>k</italic>-mers within the SMiLE-seq data of the 284 assayed TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>).

The same data yielded only 64 approved binding models (22.5%) when analyzed without the <italic>k</italic>-mer enrichment step against the input library and using more conventional motif discovery tools such as Dimont, HOMER, or MEME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. This showcases the benefit of explicitly removing input library sequence composition bias in the data for motif discovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>). In fact, several SMiLE-seq datasets did not yield consistent motifs when analyzed with conventional tools and were thus not approved by the purposefully conservative curation and benchmarking of the Codebook Consortium. However, our analytical strategy linked 17 of these datasets to seemingly valid binding motifs, including novel models for 9 TFs that are uniquely reported in this manuscript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">2</xref>). These datasets either exhibited high replicate concordance (e.g. ZNF385B, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 2b</xref>), or reproduced binding models generated by orthogonal experimental methods. For example, the approach extracted a similar motif for ZNF878 from SMiLE-seq data as was inferred from HT-SELEX data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1c</xref>), whereas straightforward processing of the same SMiLE-seq data by conventional tools failed to derive this exact motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 2f</xref>). Importantly, even for some approved datasets, combining pre-filtering of reads based on <italic>k</italic>-mer enrichment with the ProBound Suite allowed the identification of the TF’s full-length binding site while the same datasets only yielded truncated models when analyzed with other tools, such as for ZNF648 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 2g</xref> and<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>). In total, our SMiLE-seq analyses and linked analytical strategy yielded binding motifs for 50 TFs with an additional 48 derived using our methyl-sensitive SMiLE-seq method, including an overlap of 22 TFs between both approaches as detailed below. The overall 98 proteins comprise 14 different TF families, with the largest being C2H2 ZNFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 2h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Development and implementation of methylation-sensitive SMiLE-seq</title><p id="P9">Despite extensive profiling attempts in our collaborative Codebook efforts, 158 putative TFs could still not be linked to binding motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.

To concurrently infer DNA binding motifs and the methylation preference of TFs, we extended SMiLE-seq to allow for a methylation-aware motif discovery (a novel workflow that we will refer to as ‘meSMiLE-seq’). Specifically, we redesigned the bait DNA libraries to expose a TF to ‘naked’ and modified DNA simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>). Each DNA library thereby contains two unique molecular barcodes that provide information about the position on the microfluidic chip (BC) and its modification status (mBC). Libraries that carry a methylation barcode are enzymatically methylated prior to the experiment (methylated library, mLib) before being combined in equimolar amounts with the corresponding, unmodified counterpart (unmethylated library, uLib) and added to <italic>in vitro</italic> translated TF-GFP fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>). Near-complete methylation of CG dinucleotides within mLib was confirmed using digestion with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme BstBI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 3a-b</xref>).

This rigorous control removed the need to prefilter sequencing reads as was required for classical SMiLE-seq data. Since most conventional motif discovery tools were not developed to report DNA modifications, conveying position-specific information about DNA methylation using a position frequency matrix (PFM) inferred with classical tools is challenging. To overcome this issue, we used the ProBound Suite to present the predicted DNA binding motifs from the meSMiLE-seq workflow as position-specific affinity matrices (PSAM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P10">As a proof of concept for meSMiLE-seq, we profiled the TF POU5F1 (also known as OCT4), since it has previously been shown to bind to both methylated and unmethylated DNA motifs that direct its genomic location, making it a valuable positive control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>.

The methylation-independent sequence ‘ATGCAAA’ was equally frequent in uLib and mLib, while ‘G(meCG)CATA’ was much more prevalent in mLib compared to any unmethylated sequence including ‘GCGCATA’ in uLib, showcasing the protein’s strong preference only for the methylated version of the motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>). Given meSMiLE-seq’s ‘one-pot reaction’ approach, we thereby note that our data permits a more precise estimation of actual binding preferences, as uLib and mLib are in direct competition for the TF.

First, we compared the meSMiLE-seq PSAMs to orthogonal data where TF specificity/affinity towards methylated DNA was not considered and we excluded the extended, methylation-specific alphabet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>). meSMiLE-seq motifs showed high concordance with binding models predicted by orthogonal <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> methods, achieving an average Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.899 across all TFs (based on values in aligned probability matrices) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8">Table 5</xref> and<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>). We observed that TFs with longer motifs, such as PRDM10 or ZNF793, do not display strong similarity towards other TFs, even within their respective TF families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3a</xref>). This was especially noticeable for C2H2 ZNF proteins, consistent with the expected uniqueness of their binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.

Importantly, while most of the first-ranked (i.e. most significant reported by HOMER) ChIP-seq-inferred motifs resembled meSMiLE-seq-derived models (as indicated by the digit next to the PFMs), this was not the case for ZBTB46 (second-ranked), ZNF133 (second- and third-ranked), and ZNF445 (seventh ranked) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3b</xref>), illustrating the value of orthogonally validating ChIP-derived binding sites using <italic>in vitro</italic> assays.

Additionally, some TFs from this group enriched more than one consensus sequence such as PRDM13, which binds methylation-independently to ‘GCAGGTGG’ and to methylated ‘G(meCG)GGTGG’, displaying a behavior similar to that of POU5F1. In contrast, ‘methyl minus’ TFs (n=13) had a reduced affinity to methylated DNA (e.g. USF3).

The lack of CG dinucleotides in the ‘no CG’ motif ‘GCAGGTGG’ led to the analysis of CG methylation across entire peaks containing this motif. Here, ~45% of CGs were methylated at less than 10%, while ~25% showed methylation levels above 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a-b</xref>). In contrast, more than 38% of occurrences of PRDM13’s ‘methyl plus’ motif ‘GCGGGTGG’ within ChIP-seq peaks were found to be highly methylated (&gt; 90%) in HEK293 cells. This observation is particularly striking given that CG methylation levels across entire peaks containing the ‘methyl plus’ motif are predominantly unmethylated, with ~64% showing less than 10% methylation and only ~14% exceeding the 90% methylation threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Methods</xref>).

The analyses revealed that methylated binding sites are mostly depleted around active transcription start sites (Tss) (except ZNF716 and ZNF18) while being enriched in most cases in bivalent/poised regulatory elements (TssBiv and EnhBiv) and actively transcribed genes (Tx and TxWk).

Annotation of the genomic regions using gene ontology analysis of nearby genes (&lt; 3 kb distance of the TFBS) also showed that different DNA motifs may direct TFs to distinct classes of genes and may thus contribute to the differential regulation of cellular function.

One of the defining features of SMiLE-seq as a platform to profile TF-DNA interactions is the single round of DNA enrichment, as best demonstrated in meSMiLE-seq. This is because the simultaneous exposure of multiple DNA species to a TF, coupled with the single step of entrapment of bound molecules during MITOMI allows capturing the actual, potentially subtle binding preferences of TFs to modified or unmodified DNA. The lack of multiple amplification steps preserves the methylation status of the DNA and ensures the identification of TFBS over a wide range of affinities. We demonstrated that meSMiLE-seq-derived motifs correlate highly with the binding models generated by orthogonal datasets, when we excluded information about methylation specificity in the form of an extended alphabet. Since most TF-DNA interaction assays do not include modified DNA by default, there may be interest in the field to probe already characterized TFs for methylation affinity. Here, meSMiLE-seq offers a clear advantage for being a scalable competition assay that captures binding events in equilibrium conditions, as exposure to unmethylated libraries serves as an internal positive control for assessment of experimental success if a TF’s unmethylated binding site is already known. In this regard, a valuable future goal may be to expand meSMiLE-seq to include further DNA modifications which have not yet been studied to the same extent as CG methylation on potentially impacting TF-DNA interactions such as 5’-hydroxymethylation of cytosine (5hmC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref></sup> or N6’-methylation of adenosine (N6mA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">The Codebook/GRECO-BIT initiative successfully identified DNA binding sites for 236 of 394 predicted human TFs. However, for 158 TFs, motif discovery did not yield reproducible motifs, suggesting a possible misclassification of proteins as TFs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, or a need for specific interaction partners, such as heterodimers, which were not considered within the Codebook/GRECO-BIT collaboration or in this study. Our analysis yielded 73 high-quality binding motifs from 284 TFs using SMiLE-seq, with an initial success rate of ~26% with our analysis approach or ~23% using non-customized motif discovery pipelines. The lower-than-expected yield was likely due to technical challenges, including a single round of DNA enrichment and bias in nucleotide distribution, which complicated motif discovery. By changing the DNA libraries and ensuring uniform nucleotide distributions in meSMiLE-seq, the success rate nearly doubled (~42%). The improvement was achieved despite the additional experimental complexity by exposing the TFs to both methylated and unmethylated DNA, although part of this increase may be influenced by using a subset of TFs in meSMiLE-seq that was suspected to bind DNA. Nonetheless, this highlights the importance of customized analysis pipelines for overcoming background noise and extracting accurate TFBS, indicating that further optimization could significantly enhance future discoveries.</p><p id="P24">Many of our meSMiLE-seq-derived motifs could be found in TF-associated ChIP-seq peaks in HEK293/T cells. Pairing the data with WGBS revealed that the predictions for most ‘methyl minus’ TFs were correct, as motif occurrences for these TFs were predominantly not methylated in cells. Importantly, this analysis also showed that several ‘methyl plus’ TFs bound methylated genomic regions, not only indicating that binding models acquired by <italic>in vitro</italic> methods such as meSMiLE-seq can be translated into a cellular context, but also that these TFs are likely involved in different regulatory pathways depending on the methylation status of their motifs. For example, gene ontology enrichment analysis for ZNF18 showed that its ‘methyl plus’ binding sites were significantly associated with ‘Pathways in cancer’. This finding aligns well with DNA methylation-mediated transcriptional dysregulation, considering that aberrant DNA methylation patterns are frequent in malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref></sup>. The discrepancy that most ‘little effect’ and some ‘methyl plus’ TFs appeared to mostly bind unmethylated DNA in HEK293/T cells may be due to the inaccessibility of those motifs in a cell type-specific chromatin landscape since CG methylation is frequently associated with the formation of heterochromatin and gene silencing. TFs that do not possess ‘pioneering’ capability, i.e. the ability to bind condensed chromatin and/or initiate chromatin remodeling, may therefore have their TFBS occluded by nucleosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref></sup>. Another constraining factor might be competition for methylated binding sites between these TFs and other TFs with high methylated DNA affinities such as MBDs, as suggested by previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup>. In this case, binding to methylated motifs may be restricted to specific loci and cell types.</p><p id="P25">Lastly, our study identified ZHX2 as a potential Z-DNA binding protein, as it consistently enriched methylated purine-pyrimidine repeats. The stabilization of poly(CG) sequences in the Z-form by multivalent salts and cytosine methylation suggests that Z-DNA may be randomly adopted in meSMiLE-seq experiments where TFs are incubated with DNA for an extended time. While non-canonical DNA conformations like Z-DNA are already well known to impact gene regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref></sup>, recent computational advancements have renewed interest in predicting genomic regions that are likely to adopt non-B-DNA structures and linking these structures to various cellular processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref></sup>. However, validating protein binding to these structures remains challenging due to their temporal instability under physiological conditions. In this sense, meSMiLE-seq could offer a valuable platform to more systematically study these interactions. For example, incubating proteins with DNA to reach equilibrium and adding reagents to trigger specific DNA transitions would allow the comparison of eluted DNA with and without reagents to identify interactions with specific DNA structures.</p></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S11" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="S12"><title>TF selection and plasmids</title><p id="P26">Transcription factors were provided as EGFP fusion proteins in pF3A WG (Promega) by the Codebook/GRECO-BIT collaboration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>.
