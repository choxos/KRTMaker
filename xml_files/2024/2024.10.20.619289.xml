By leveraging regulatory mechanisms at either transcriptional or translational levels, synthetic responsive systems have been engineered to recognize diverse signals, such as small molecules (e.g., tetracycline) or physical stimuli (e.g., light). However, these approaches have limitations: small-molecule signals often require high concentrations to be effective, and sophisticated engineering is needed to generate responsive effectors. Here, we establish a simple, versatile gene activation system in which short single-stranded DNAs trigger RNA or protein production by complementing defective single-stranded promoters upstream of target genes. We demonstrate selective gene activation with orthogonal promoters, and logic-gate operations with signal pairs. The signaling system operates in compartmentalized nanoliter droplets scaffolded by bilayers. Signal delivery is controlled by selectively disrupting bilayers or applying transmembrane potential to move signals through protein pores, thereby activating genes within the receiver compartments. This work expands the toolset for engineering multifunctional, responsive materials to meet biotechnological and medical needs, enabling gene activation in response to specific cues.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DNA signaling</kwd><kwd>selective gene activation</kwd><kwd>promoter complementation</kwd><kwd>logic gates</kwd><kwd>aqueous-in-oil droplets</kwd><kwd>droplet-interface bilayers</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">In synthetic biology, signaling refers to the transmission of information between biological components to trigger specific processes, such as gene activation. It is a crucial aspect of synthetic biology, enabling engineered biological systems to communicate and respond to their environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> This is particularly important in synthetic cells, which are intricately designed compartmentalized structures typically enclosed by lipid membranes, that can be capable of gene expression.

Translational toehold switches represent an innovative approach in which mRNA forms a secondary structure that blocks ribosome binding until a trigger RNA exposes the ribosome binding site. However, the short shelf life of input RNA remains a key limitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> Similarly, gene silencing using siRNA is another common strategy, though again the instability of siRNAs limits their long-term effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup></p><p id="P4">Light-based systems have shown considerable promise in regulating transcription, but they are still constrained by challenges such as phototoxicity and limited light penetration.

In this work, we introduce strategies for selective gene activation using ssDNA signals to complement single-stranded promoters, referred to here as defective genes. Selective gene activation was achieved by using different promoters or by using oligonucleotide inhibitors to remove undesired signals. Additionally, we demonstrated that DNA signals can be split into shorter fragments to create complex logic gates for gene control. We applied this signaling system in nL-sized aqueous-in-oil droplets where droplets were connected by lipid bilayers and thus signals and defective genes could be separated in different droplets. By breaking the bilayer, such as by lowering the solubility of the lipid through oil-exchange,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> the signals diffused across the droplets, thereby activating the defective genes. Furthermore, we showed that even without disrupting the bilayer, it was possible to control DNA signal entry through protein pores embedded within the lipid bilayer, by manipulating the membrane potential, thereby demonstrating a method for selective signal entry into different droplet compartments, enabling gene activation in response to specific environmental triggers.</p><sec id="S1" sec-type="results | discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="S2"><title>DNA signals complement defective genes for selective transcription activation</title><p id="P7">We designed defective genes that were single-stranded (~30 nt) in the promoter and the 5’ end of the transcribed region. The defective genes were made by annealing two ssDNA of different lengths (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Transcription activation occurred only when the ssDNA signals complemented the promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). To assess the production of RNA, defective genes were designed to code for RNA aptamers that bind and activate the fluorescence of small-molecule dyes. Transcription activation was studied at different signal and defective gene concentrations (both from 0 to 1000 nM), using defective genes coding for the Broccoli RNA aptamer, which activates fluorescence of the molecule DFHBI-1T (chemical structures and full names are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> After 3 h of mixing signals with defective genes, a 35-fold increase in Broccoli fluorescence was observed with as little as 10 nM of a defective gene coding for Broccoli (sequence B1, DNA sequences are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), and 10 nM single-stranded DNA signal (sequence s1) complementary to the defective Broccoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Text 1</xref>). Furthermore, background fluorescence without the defective gene or the signal remained within 2-fold of the fluorescence of a control <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription (IVT) mixture without any DNA. These results demonstrated the clear responsiveness of our system, with minimal background activity when no signal or defective gene was present in the IVT mixture.</p><p id="P8">Similar to small-molecule gene inducers, such as arabinose and IPTG (Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside) that can activate genes with different promoters,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> we sought to determine whether our ssDNA signals could be used for selective gene activation, where different signals would trigger transcription of specific defective genes. To demonstrate this, we engineered genes that encoded different RNA aptamers, which could be distinguished through the binding of different fluorophores (known aptamer-fluorophore pairs reviewed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>). To achieve this, we investigated the ability of the RNA aptamers Broccoli, Mango and Pepper to activate the fluorescence of DFHBI-1T,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup> TO1B,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup> and HBC620<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup> (chemical structures and full names are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>.) in an IVT mixture. We found two sets of orthogonal RNA aptamer-fluorophore pairs: Broccoli/DFHBI-1T and Pepper/HBC620, as well as Mango/TO1B and Pepper/HBC620 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3, A to C</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Using the orthogonal RNA aptamer system, we developed strategies for selective gene activation using ssDNA signals. In the first strategy, distinct defective genes with different single-stranded promoters were selectively activated by signals carrying complementary promoter sequences. For this, we used an IVT mixture (signal and defective gene concentrations of 100 mM) of defective Broccoli with a single-stranded T7 promoter (B1) and defective Pepper with a single-stranded SP6 promoter (P1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4A</xref>). After 3 h, the presence of a Broccoli signal with the complementary T7 promoter sequence (s2) only produced the Broccoli aptamer, while the presence of a Pepper signal with the SP6 promoter sequence (s3) only produced the Pepper aptamer. In the presence of both Broccoli and Pepper signals, both aptamers were produced, whereas without the signals no aptamers were produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Text 2</xref>). We also showed the flexibility of this different promoter strategy, which worked for Mango with a defective T7 promoter and Pepper with a defective SP6 promoter. Those constructs had different single-stranded sequences after the promoter, compared to the defective Broccoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1, E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4B</xref>). Further, we also demonstrated that ssDNA signals can selectively activate genes by using the same RNA polymerase in combination with complementary inhibitors to remove undesired signals when a single promoter is used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Text 3, Figure S10-S13</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Combined use of DNA ligases and RNA polymerases to construct complex logic gates</title><p id="P10">We next investigated whether by using a combination of DNA ligases and RNA polymerases we could construct complex logic gates from our DNA-activatable transcription system. The Broccoli signal (s2) was split into two shorter ssDNA fragments, each carrying part of the promoter sequence. The downstream piece was 5’-phosphorylated, which allowed the fragments to be ligated by DNA ligases. Transcription activation only occurred when both signal fragments were present, equivalent to an AND gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We created four AND gates by splitting the signal after positions -12, -11, -10 and -9 of the transcription start site. Transcription activation was observed in IVT mixtures only when both the upstream signal fragment and the downstream signal fragment were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Transcription activation did not occur when the ligase was not present, or when the downstream signal fragment was not 5’-phosphorylated, showing the necessity of ligation for gene activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We found that the AND gates formed by splitting the signal at -12, -11 and -10 were orthogonal to each other, such that correctly matching pairs of upstream and downstream signal fragments were required for gene activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). The signal fragments were numbered by the position where the signal was split. The upstream signal fragments were denoted by U and the downstream signal fragments were denoted by D. For example, the signal fragment -10U and the downstream signal -12D contained the entire promoter sequence, however, the pair had overlapping sequences (-12 to -11) and could not be ligated. Subsequently, gene activation was not observed. The three signal pairs in combination created an AND-OR-AND-OR-AND gate, where gene activation was triggered by (-12U and -12D) or (-11U and -11D) or (-10U and - 10D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). We constructed a truth table of the logic gates using a total of 26 possible combinations of the 6 signal fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). When there were more than two fragments present simultaneously, as in this case of -10D, -11U, and -11D (condition 18), the non-matching fragment -10D could compete with the matching fragments -11U and -11D for defective gene binding. Although this competition led to a slight reduction in the final fluorescence intensity (~20%), the fluorescence of those samples remained clearly distinguishable from IVT reactions lacking any matching pairs of DNA signal fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). In these experiments, the signal concentrations were 1000 nM, the defective gene concentrations were 100 nM.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>DNA signal triggers functional protein production</title><p id="P12">We next investigated whether our ssDNA signals and complementary defective genes could be used to activate protein production in PURExpress <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription and translation (IVTT) systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Our designed defective genes coding for proteins such as mCherry and mNeonGreen (mNG) were also made by annealing two ssDNA strands of different lengths. The ssDNA strands were made using a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A standard PCR was first used to generate a dsDNA template. A linear PCR reaction then made the ssDNA from the dsDNA template, using a single primer and a thermocycling protocol (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">Methods</xref>). The two ssDNA strands were subsequently annealed to form the defective gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6</xref>). Protein expression was observed in the IVTT mixture with as little as 500 pM of signal (s12) and 5 nM of a defective gene encoding mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), or 50 pM of signal (s12) and 5 nM of a defective gene encoding mNG (G1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p id="P13">In living cells, transcription factors often activate multiple genes simultaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup> We next sought to mimic transcription factors using our constructed defective gene system. For example, our DNA signals could mimic transcription factors by simultaneously activating multiple defective genes sharing the same defective promoter. To demonstrate this, we designed a DNA signal (s12) that could complement both defective mCherry (C1) and defective mNG (G1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). The DNA signal (s12) activated production of mCherry protein in the IVTT mixture in presence of the defective mCherry, activated production of mNG in the presence of the defective mNG, and activated production of both mCherry and mNG in the presence of both defective genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7</xref>). In these experiments, the DNA signal concentration was 100 nM, and the total defective gene concentration was 10 nM.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>DNA signal mediates communication in nL-sized aqueous droplets</title><p id="P14">Finally, we demonstrated the use of our ssDNA signaling system in nL-sized aqueous-in-oil droplet pairs that were connected by a single droplet interface bilayer. The oil composition was a 1:1 (v/v) ratio of hexadecane : silicone oil AR20 that contained 1:1 (w/w) ratio of 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC) : 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) lipid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup> We designed defective genes coding for the protein pore α-hemolysin (αHL), a bacterial toxin that lyses cells by forming pores in the plasma membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> The defective αHL gene (A1) and the fluorescent dye 2-deoxy-2-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]-D-glucose (NBDG) were placed separately in two droplets connected by a droplet interface bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>). The lipid bilayer between the droplets is normally impermeable to NBDG. However, in the presence of an activating DNA signal (s12, 20 nM) in the droplet containing the defective gene (6 nM) and IVTT mixture, αHL was produced overtime and inserted into the lipid bilayer, subsequently allowing NBDG (0.33 mM) to diffuse through the protein pores in the membrane. Dye transfer across the lipid membrane was not observed without the DNA signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3, G to I</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Next, we explored the physical separation of ssDNA signals from their target defective genes using lipid bilayers. In this setup, the ssDNA signals could only access the defective genes when a suitable environmental stimulus is present. For example, we prepared signal and receiver IVT mixture droplets both formed from a hydrogel (1.5% (w/v) ultra-low-gelling-temperature agarose in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio of hexadecane to silicone oil AR20). The signal droplet contained DNA signal (s4, 70 μM) and the receiver droplet contained the defective Mango gene (M1, 100 nM). By breaking the bilayer, achieved by lowering the lipid solubility through oil exchange to an increased volume fraction of silicone oil,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> the signal could diffuse into the receiver compartment and activate Mango aptamer production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Gene activation only occurred in response to bilayer distruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, B to D</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Next, we explored the use of membrane potential to control DNA signal entry through droplet interface bilayers without disrupting the bilayer. Two aqueous droplets were physically separated by a lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4, E and F</xref>); the signal droplet contained 300 μM of fluorescently-labelled DNA signal (s13) and 0.2 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> of αHL monomers, which formed pores on the bilayer. The droplets were in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio of hexadecane : silicone oil AR20, with 10 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> DPhPC lipid in the oil. Although the narrowest diameter of a αHL pore (1.4 nm) is wider than that of ssDNA signal, DNA signal cannot spontaneously translocate through the αHL pores, as the translocation process is entropically unfavourable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup> We therefore generated a membrane potential through Ag/AgCl electrodes inserted into the droplets. After 1.5 h at 120 mV, 10 nM of signal DNA was transported across the bilayer, as indicated by the fluorescence observed in the droplet from the fluorescently labelled signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>). Signal entry was not observed in the absence of a membrane potential over the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4G</xref>). After signal entry into the receiver droplet, the receiver droplet was supplemented with 5 nM of the defective mCherry gene (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S7">methods</xref>), along with IVTT components required for protein production. The receiver droplets produced mCherry protein, which led to a 7-times increase in fluorescence intensity compared to the no signal control, while mCherry protein production was not observed in the receiver droplets without the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Text 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P17">Our work demonstrates the efficient use of ssDNA signals for gene activation by complementing genes with a single-stranded promoters. Key distinctions of our approach include the selectivity, orthogonality, and modular design of the system, as well as proof of concept for its use in aqueous droplets. By using different promoters or by using oligonucleotide inhibitors to remove undesired signals, we achieved orthogonal gene activation, ensuring that specific signals only activated their corresponding genes without cross-reactivity. The ssDNA signalling triggered the production of multiple RNA transcripts (including aptamers) and proteins. Additionally, we demonstrated that the DNA signals can be split into shorter fragments to construct complex logic gates that control gene activation. The modular nature of our system allows for easy adaptation, enabling the interchange of various promoters and signals to regulate different gene circuits. We applied this signaling system in aqueous-in-oil droplets, where the signals and defective genes were separated by a lipid bilayer. By breaking the bilayer, such as by reducing the lipid solubility through oil exchange, the signal could diffuse across the droplets, thereby activating the defective genes. Furthermore, we showed that even without disrupting the bilayer, it was possible to control DNA signal entry through droplet interface bilayers by controlling the membrane potential, thereby demonstrating a method for selective signal entry into different droplets.</p><p id="P18">Previous work has made limited use of oligonucleotide complementation to activate genes in synthetic cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> For example, DNA signals were used to activate genes through non-selective diffusion of the DNA signals into polymersomes containing the defective single-stranded promoters,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup> or by co-encapsulating the DNA signals with the single-stranded promoters in the same synthetic cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup> Our work differentiates itself by addressing selective gene activation using DNA signals, as well as the control of DNA signal movement across lipid bilayers for gene activation, both of which remained unexplored in the earlier studies.</p><p id="P19">The use of ssDNA as a signaling molecule offers several practical advantages over other methods. DNA sequences are highly programmable, and we showed that as few as 50 pM ssDNA signal was sufficient to activate gene expression, in comparison to small-molecules activators such as IPTG and arabinose where typically μM to mM range of signal concentration is required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup> In addition, ssDNA has a low cost and long shelf life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref></sup> Collectively, these features position our system as an efficient alternative to previous gene activation strategies, particularly in terms of control and applicability in synthetic biology systems.</p><p id="P20">Our study also expanded our understanding of T7 and related polymerases, particularly their potential in synthetic biology applications. For example, by investigating the effects of splitting ssDNA signals at various positions to create logic gates, we discovered that the T7 promoter is intolerant of strand breaks on the coding strand between positions -12 and -9 relative to the transcription start site. Using this insight, we successfully developed three orthogonal AND gates. Although we did not test whether strand breaks are tolerated in other regions of the promoter, it is plausible that additional orthogonal AND gates could be engineered by introducing strand breaks at other positions.</p><p id="P21">We showed that the DNA signal and the defective genes could be separated by lipid bilayers in different droplets, and that the defective genes were activated by disrupting the bilayer. While we chose to disrupt the bilayer by changing the oil, lipid bilayers could be made sensitive to other environmental stimuli, including temperature, light, redox states, and enzymes (reviewed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>). In scenarios where preservation of membrane integrity is desired, we also demonstrated the use of membrane potential to deliver ssDNA signal across protein pores embedded in the bilayer. The membrane potential in this work was maintained by electrodes inserted into the droplets, but it could also be generated by light-responsive proton pumps, asymmetric lipids, or by living cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref></sup> The entry of DNA signals into aqueous droplets could be more precisely regulated through site-selective covalent chemistry, ensuring that only signals capable of reacting with the pores can enter specific aqueous droplets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref></sup> Further, aqueous droplets could be transferred from lipid-in-oil environments to aqueous environments, which would enable direct chemical communication (through DNA signaling) between droplets and their aqueous surrounding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup> Looking forward, our work has laid the groundwork for engineering multifunctional droplet networks, where different sets of genes could be specifically activated in response to different DNA signals.

The PCR used DreamTaq Green PCR master mix with primers R1 and R2, following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The dsDNA product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis with Monarch Gel Extraction kit and further purified by Monarch PCR cleanup kit, eluting in nuclease free water.
