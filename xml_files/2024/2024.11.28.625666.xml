However, the mechanisms underpinning the role of DNA methylation in insect development remains elusive. Furthermore, the patterns of methylation in different species can be varied. Here we aim to profile methylation across metamorphosis in the insect DNA methylation model <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> for the first time. We find DNA methylation is at the highest in the embryo, and at the lowest in the larva. We find that the gene expression levels of <italic>NvTet</italic> and <italic>NvDnmt</italic> enzymes compliment the observed methylation patterns. Performing differential methylation analysis we find enriched GO terms for developmentally specific processes and find sites with differential methylation are share homology with developmentally linked transcription factors. Additionally, we identify sites uniquely methylated in each developmental stage, many of which also share homology with developmentally linked transcription factors. In all, we find that methylation is variable in its global methylation levels and site specific methylation throughout <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> development, but find no obvious link with gene expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification where the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine can change the way in which a gene is regulated. In mammalian systems, DNA methylation is dynamic throughout with two waves of epigenetic reprogramming; the first in primordial germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] where somatic DNA methylation patterns are erased passively due to the high proliferation rate of cells, and the second after fertilisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>] with the removal of methylation inherited from the paternal gamete with the exception of those in imprinting control regions. The maintenance methyltransferase <italic>DNMT1</italic>, de novo methyltransferases <italic>DNMT3</italic> and demethylating enzymes <italic>TET</italic> play crucial roles in the demethylation and remethylation during these waves.</p><p id="P3">Over the last decade, the study of insect DNA methylation has grown. In a wide range of insects, DNA methylation has proven to be a crucial driver of development, and in numerous species <italic>Dnmt</italic> knockouts lead to developmental or egg producing arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. In the silk moth <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, DNA methylation has been proposed to recruit MBD2/3 to the 5’ UTR region of genes to aid with Tip60 recruitment, which in turn promotes histone H3K27 acetylation and consequentially alters gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], a mechanism proposed to influence early embryo development. Even in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> where there is considered to be no functional methylation, methylation levels are higher in the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], and promoter methylation of the ecdysone mediating enzyme <italic>DmSpok</italic> may help modulate development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p><p id="P4"><italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> is emerging as one of the main insect models for studying DNA methylation. Studies to date have examined the role of DNA methylation in embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], genomic imprinting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], sex allocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], sex-biased gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], photoperiodic timing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Its benefits as a model include its short lifecycle, its high offspring number, its possession of both <italic>Dnmt1</italic> (three copies) and <italic>Dnmt3</italic> enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], and its relatively small genome which reduces whole genome sequencing costs.</p><p id="P5">As with other insect species, RNAi of <italic>Dnmt1a</italic> in <italic>Nasonia</italic> embryos results in developmental arrest at gastrulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. <italic>NvDnmt1a</italic> knockouts in the study of Arsala <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] found strong reduction in gene body methylation and a corresponding reduction in gene expression. They noted that the number of methylated genes in the embryo was similar to a previous <italic>Nasonia</italic> study in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], suggesting that whilst DNA methylation is important for embryonic viability, it is stable through development. Added to this, a different study found that reciprocal crosses maintained their parental methylation patterns through development into the F1 adult, suggesting methylation patterns remain stable through development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. These two findings, combined with the knowledge that RNAi of <italic>NvDnmt1a</italic> produces lethal effects in the F1 embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] but no observable phenotype through development and adulthood for the injected mother, suggest that methylation is both stable and unimportant in developmental stages following embryogenesis.</p><p id="P6">From other Hymenoptera studies, we know that global methylation levels do fluctuate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], even though different species show different patterns. Consequentially, here we aim to better profile the developmental methylome of the insect DNA methylation species <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic>. We perform differential methylation analysis, and use protein binding prediction tools to help predict the role DNA methylation may have on developmental processes. By performing RNA sequencing, we are able to model the effects of DNA methylation on gene expression to attempt to identify mechanisms in which DNA methylation may regulate gene expression. Finally, we examine the expression profile of genes associated with DNA methylation to make predictions of their role in driving global methylation changes. Combined, we hope these results provide further insight to the function of DNA methylation through insect metamorphosis.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Sample Collection</title><p id="P7">Wasps were of the <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> species from the Leicester strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>].

The practice host was then replaced with a fresh host, and the wasps were given three hours to lay. After three hours, the host was removed from the parental wasps and incubated until the appropriate collection time. This produced 83.3% females (n = 944), similar to previous developmental studies that used a single female (80-95%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].

In these analyses, the majority of GO terms of genes that possessed differentially methylated CpGs were shared across all four comparisons. As a consequence, we only highlight GO terms that had more significant enrichment for each of the pairwise analyses. Some examples of highly enriched terms in all analyses include multicellular organism development, imaginal disc-derived wing morphogenesis, oogenesis, cell differentiation, anatomical structure morphogenesis and axonogenesis. The genomic location of the differential expression for each developmental stage (ie. exon, intron, intragenic) followed a similar pattern to that seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, indicating that differential methylation had no preference for particular genomic location.</p><p id="P23">Most differential CpG methylation occurs between the embryonic and larval stages of development, with 98,602 differentially methylated CpGs; 98,395 hypermethylated in the embryo, 207 in the larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>).

By selecting genomic locations that have two or more differentially methylated sites consecutively we were able to generate a model with better fit (26%, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2C</xref>), but still not a good enough fit to make interpretations. However, a point of interest is that while the model had a pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> of 25.5% if run only for sites with two consecutive differentially methylated CpGs, this improves to a pseudo-R<sup>2</sup> of 46% for sites with three consecutive differentially methylated CpGs.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] we find methylation predominantly in the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>)), particularly in exons towards the 5’ end. As exon number increases, methylation level decreases.</p><p id="P32">We observed the highest methylation levels in the embryonic stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>)). Following the embryonic stage, we observe methylation at its lowest level in the larval stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>)). The difference between these two stages is evidenced in the differential site methylation analyses where most differential methylation occurs between the embryonic and larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>)). This pattern fits with the results of a dot blot assay in a previous silk moth study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>] where methylation levels drop throughout embryogenesis following gastrulation. Methylation levels increase as the larva prepares for the pupal stage of metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Following the prepupal stage the global level of methylation remains relatively stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), with increased local fluctuations in site methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). The patterns observed in this study are similar to those observed in the honey bee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] where methylation is also highest in the embryo, lowest in the embryo, with later developmental stages in between these two states. However, both the honeybee and <italic>Nasonia</italic> results here contrast another Hymenoptera species the Florida carpenter ant <italic>Camponotus floridanus</italic> where the embryonic stage has the fewest methylated sties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>].</p><p id="P33">Between the developmental stages we see hallmarks suggesting that DNA plays a role in many key developmental processes. For example, between the embryo and larval stages of development we find GO terms embryo development, pattern specification process, gliogenesis, and methylation. As the wasp enters the larval stage of development we find CpGs uniquely methylated at this stage that share homology with the binding sites for <italic>Drosophila</italic> buttonhead and the odd-skipped transcription factors, which have both previously been implicated in larval neurodevelopment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>]. In the transition between the larval and prepupal stages we find differentially methylated CpGs in genes with GO term enrichment for R3/R4 cell differentiation, which is fitting for this developmental stage as this is an important step in establishing planar cell polarity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. We also find enrichment of differentially methylated CpGs for sites that share homology with the Drosophila external sensory organ protein Musashi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>] and the larval development protein pangolin. Once the developing wasp enters the prepupal stage, we find that sites only methylated in this stage share sequence homology with the<italic>Drosophila</italic> wing development proteins pointed and grainy head [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Transitioning from the prepupal stage into the pupa we find differentially methylated CpGs located in genes enriched for developmental growth, cell fate commitment and neurotransmitter secretion, as well as motifs which share homology with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> vestigial wing-patterning protein Mothers against dpp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>], the adult sense organ precursor cell regulator Suppressor of Hairless [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>], and the well known patterning transcription factor kruppel. In the final transition as the wasp goes from the pupal stage and ecloses as an adult, we find differentially methylated CpGs located in genes enriched for GO terms including animal organ development, neuron projection development, morphogenesis of an epithelium and neuron fate commitment. We also find motif enrichment of these differentially expressed CpGs that share homology with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurogenesis protein ventral nervous system defective binding site. With our results giving stage specific GO terms and finding enrichment of motif binding for protein binding sites with stage associated proteins, it appears that despite <italic>NvDnmt1a</italic> knockouts only being lethal in the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] methylation continues to play a role in regulating stage specific processes.</p><p id="P34">We also performed RNA sequencing to examine the link between DNA methylation and gene expression. Given that <italic>DNMT</italic>s and <italic>TET</italic> are crucial drivers of mammalian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>] and insect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>] development, we decided to examine how their expression through development compares with the developmental fluctuations in DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). We see <italic>NvTet</italic> has the highest expression in the embryo, which pairs with the biggest drop in methylation between the embryonic and larval stages of development. This posits the question of the importance of <italic>NvTet</italic> in development. As far as we’re aware, there is no literature for <italic>Tet</italic> RNAi for in insects. It would be interesting to see the importance of this enzyme, and see if it’s knockout produces a similar arrest at gastrulation as <italic>NvDnmt1a</italic> does [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], or whether a later developmental arrest between the embryonic and larval stages occurs. Perhaps <italic>NvTet</italic> is not essential for development, and methylation between the embryo and larval stage is lost passively by high cell replication rate. However, the results here suggest a role of <italic>NvTet</italic> in the transition from the embryo to the larva. Given the vital role of DNA methylation in <italic>Nasonia</italic> embryogenesis, it is also worth noting that <italic>NvMbd</italic> and <italic>NvTip60</italic>, the only proven insect methylation effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>], have their highest expression in the embryonic stage of development. A final observation regarding methylation associated genes is that unlike each other methylation associated protein, <italic>NvDnmt3</italic> has increased expression between the embryo and the larval stage. Given the increase in methylation between the larval and prepupal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), this hints at a de novo methyltransferase role for <italic>NvDnmt3</italic> similar to that in mammals, as increased expression may allow targeting of methylation to new genomic sites, for example sites such as pangolin, brachyenteron, and grainy head.</p><p id="P35">Although we observe a positive relationship between gene (and exon) methylation with gene (or exon) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A &amp; B</xref>), this is caveated with the poor model fit. Interestingly, we see genes with medium levels of methylation have a higher average gene expression level in the embryo and larva, whilst lowly methylated genes have higher expression in the latter stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). This may hint at a mechanism where higher gene methylation is crucial for embryo viability (as proven by Arsala <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], but this mechanism of methylation assisting methylation in early development ends following the demethylation event in the larval stage. If true, this could in part be due to the depleting levels of the developmentally implicated <italic>NvTip60</italic> and <italic>NvMbd</italic> enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Finally, when focusing on consecutive differentially methylated genes, we observed better model fit when correlating gene expression with methylation loci with three consecutive differentially methylated CpGs compared to two. Whilst both models had a poor fit, this lends evidence to the finding that an increased number of consecutive CpGs has an effect on gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P36">Here we show the developmental methylome of the insect methylation model <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic> for the first time. We find global fluctuations in DNA methylation levels, with methylation at its highest level in the embryo, and its lowest level in the larva. Global methylation levels remain relatively stable for later developmental stages, but we still see loci differences. We performed differential methylation analysis and found GO terms and transcription factor binding motifs enriched for processes specific for each stage’s transition. We find links between the expression profiles of methylation associated genes and the global methylation, but fail to identify any further discernible links between DNA methylation and gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Information 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS201587-supplement-Supplemental_Information_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d119aAcFbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Information 3</label><media xlink:href="EMS201587-supplement-Supplemental_Information_3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d119aAcFcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplemental Table 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS201587-supplement-Supplemental_Table_2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d119aAcFdB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supporting Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS201587-supplement-Supporting_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d119aAcFeB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S14"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>CT was supported by a BBSRC MIBTP DTP studentships.
