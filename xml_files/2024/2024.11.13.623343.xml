Chromatin bridges, arising from DNA replication stress or catenated chromosomes, can interfere with this process, leading to genomic instability if not properly managed. Here, we uncover that the budding yeast DNA helicase Srs2 and its human homolog PARI delay the timing of abscission events in the presence of chromatin bridges. We demonstrate that Srs2 is essential for delaying abscission in yeast cells with chromatin bridges, and preventing their damage by cytokinesis. In human cells, PARI similarly plays a key role in delaying abscission events, such as midbody severing and actin patch disassembly during cytokinesis, in response to chromatin bridges caused by topoisomerase II inhibition. Our results also show that PARI functions within the Aurora B-mediated abscission checkpoint pathway. These findings reveal an evolutionarily conserved role of the Srs2/PARI DNA helicase in maintaining genomic integrity by modulating abscission timing in response to chromatin bridge formation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The proper coordination between chromosome segregation and cell division (cytokinesis) is critical for maintaining genomic stability and supporting cell proliferation. Chromatin bridges that persist during cytokinesis can arise from various sources, including defects in DNA replication, chromatin condensation, DNA decatenation and by dicentric chromosomes formed by telomere fusion, among other anomalies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Ganem and Pellman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mankouri et al., 2013</xref>). If these chromatin bridges are not adequately resolved, they can either be damaged during cytokinesis or cause cytokinesis failure, both of which have detrimental effects on cell proliferation.</p><p id="P3">Cytokinesis failure can result in binucleation and tetraploidy, conditions that are linked to the promotion of tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Fujiwara et al., 2005</xref>). Notably, a large fraction of human carcinomas are thought to originate from tetraploid cells, in part due to failed cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Zack et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, damage to unsegregated DNA during cytokinesis can lead to aneuploidy, gross chromosome rearrangements and impaired cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Janssen et al., 2011</xref>). At the organismal level, these defects can contribute to severe pathologies such as T-cell lymphoma and microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Woodward et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Martin et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, chromatin bridges serve as both indicators of genomic instability and precursors to cellular transformation. Understanding how cells respond to chromatin bridges of different origins remains a critical question.</p><p id="P4">Given the potentially damaging consequences of chromatin bridges, cells have evolved mechanisms to mitigate their harmful effects. One such mechanism is the “NoCut” checkpoint, which delays the final step of cytokinesis, plasma membrane abscission, in budding yeast cells with chromatin bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Norden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Mendoza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Amaral et al., 2016</xref>). This checkpoint is conserved in animal cells, where it is known as the “abscission checkpoint” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Steigemann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carlton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Agromayor and Martin-Serrano, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Andrade and Echard, 2022</xref>). The NoCut-dependent delay in abscission is thought to protect chromatin bridges from damage and reduce the likelihood of abortive cytokinesis, which can occur if chromosomes obstruct the division site. Consequently, defects in the NoCut pathway in otherwise normal cells can lead to cytokinesis failure, tetraploidy, and genome rearrangements, all of which are hallmarks of cancer and may contribute to tumorigenesis.</p><p id="P5">In both yeast and animal cells, the function of the NoCut checkpoint depends on the association of the kinase Aurora-B with microtubules at the division site (the spindle midzone or intercellular bridge), suggesting that chromatin bridges are detected at this location. Aurora-B regulates the timing of abscission by controlling membrane remodelling events at the division site. In budding yeast, this regulation involves effectors such as Boi2, which influences the evolutionarily conserved exocyst complex that facilitates the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Masgrau et al., 2017</xref>). In human cells, Aurora-B modulates abscission by regulating the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) III, a midbody-associated complex crucial for abscission timing in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carlton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Addi et al., 2018</xref>). While the regulation of abscission timing downstream of Aurora-B is becoming clearer, the mechanisms by which chromatin bridges are sensed upstream of Aurora-B remain largely unknown.</p><p id="P6">Previous findings from our laboratory suggested that the yeast NoCut checkpoint does not merely respond to chromatin bridges, but specifically to bridges associated with DNA replication stress, possibly by detecting specific molecules associated with these bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Amaral et al., 2016</xref>, 2017). A similar phenomenon was also observed in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Petsalaki et al., 2023</xref>). DNA helicases, known for their roles in DNA repair and replication stress resolution, have been implicated in resolving chromatin bridges in human cells, where they prevent bridge breakage and cytokinetic failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Chan et al., 2018</xref>). Given these findings, we hypothesized that yeast helicases such as Srs2 could influence cytokinesis by resolving chromatin bridges during replication stress. Srs2 is a multifunctional helicase involved in DNA repair and homologous recombination regulation, particularly in dismantling Rad51 filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Marini and Krejci, 2010</xref>), and shares functional similarities with human helicases like PARI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Moldovan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Burkovics et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Mochizuki et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we explored the role of Srs2 in abscission and were initially expecting it to resolve chromatin bridges that would delay abscission. Surprisingly, we found that Srs2 has an additional function: it is required for the inhibition of abscission in response to chromatin bridges. This finding suggests that Srs2 plays an active role in the NoCut checkpoint, acting as a mediator of chromatin-based signaling during cytokinesis. Furthermore, we found that the human homolog PARI plays a similar role, delaying key events associated with abscission, including midbody severing and actin patch disassembly. These results suggest a conserved function for Srs2 and PARI in coupling chromatin bridge detection to the abscission machinery, extending our understanding of the molecular basis of NoCut signaling in both yeast and human cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Srs2 promotes the resolution of anaphase chromatin bridges following replication stress</title><p id="P7">The budding yeast DNA helicase Srs2 is known for its role in inhibiting homologous recombination during S-phase and removing Replication Protein A (RPA) from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Pfander et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Marini and Krejci, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dhingra et al., 2021</xref>), but its involvement in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis has not been explored. To investigate whether Srs2 contributes to the coordination of chromosome segregation and abscission, we monitored chromosome segregation and RPA localisation (visualised using histone H2B-mCherry and Rfa2-GFP) by time-lapse imaging in wild-type and Srs2-deficient budding yeast cells. Given the importance of Srs2 in suppressing replication intermediates during replication stress, we also examined chromosome segregation in <italic>srs2</italic>Δ cells exposed to hydroxyurea (HU), which perturbs DNA replication.</p><p id="P8">Treatment with a 3-hour pulse of HU generated late-segregating chromatin bridges in wild-type cells, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Amaral et al., 2016</xref>), and this phenotype was exacerbated in cells lacking <italic>SRS2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A-B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Chromosome segregation was considered complete only when bridges were no longer detectable, while fragmented or discontinuous bridges were still classified as unresolved since stretched DNA could result in weak or absent nucleosome signals. In wild-type cells, 20% of log-phase cells entered anaphase (detected by nuclear elongation) with RPA foci, a percentage that increased to 40% under replication stress induced by HU and was further increased to 60% in the absence of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). In wild type cells, RPA foci were primarily confined to the main nuclear masses; whereas in <italic>srs2</italic>Δ cells, over 20% of anaphase cells showed RPA foci located within chromatin bridges, regardless of prior HU exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A and 1D</xref>). In cells with anaphase RPA foci, regardless of their subcellular location, chromatin bridges persisted longer than in cells without RPA foci, consistent with previous observations in unchallenged wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Ivanova et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). The longest-lived bridges observed in HU-treated <italic>srs2</italic>Δ cells with anaphase RPA foci, indicating a severe delay in bridge resolution in the absence of Srs2. These findings suggest that the increased RPA on mitotic chromatin in <italic>srs2</italic>Δ cells, particularly following replication stress, may result from an accumulation of unresolved RPA-coated DNA intermediates formed during S phase. This could hinder the rapid resolution of chromatin bridges during anaphase.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Srs2 is required for delaying abscission in the presence of chromatin bridges</title><p id="P9">To assess the impact of Srs2 loss in abscission timing, we used time-lapse confocal microscopy to monitor the ingression and resolution of the plasma membrane at the abscission site. For this, we used the fluorescent reporter GFP-CAAX, in which GFP is fused to the membrane-targeting CAAX motif of Ras2. The spindle pole protein Spc42 fused to GFP was used to monitor spindle elongation, which marks the start of anaphase. As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Amaral et al., 2016</xref>), the morphology of membranes labelled with GFP-CAAX allows visualisation of abscission progression: following anaphase onset, the actomyosin ring begins to constrict the bud neck, leading to membrane ingression and eventually separation. The separation of the mother and daughter membranes marks abscission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The relative timing of late mitotic events, including anaphase onset, nuclear division, membrane ingression and abscission, is summarised in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2A</xref>.</p><p id="P10">In unchallenged WT cells, chromatin bridges resolve before membrane ingression, whereas in HU-treated cells, bridges resolve around the time of cytokinesis, coinciding with membrane ingression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). In wild-type cells, the median time from membrane ingression to abscission is 16 min, but this is significantly delayed to 24 min upon HU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref>). This aligns with our previous findings indicating that DNA replication stress delays bridge resolution and abscission through the NoCut checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Amaral et al., 2016</xref>). However, in the presence of HU-induced chromatin bridges, <italic>srs2</italic>Δ cells exhibited accelerated membrane ingression and failed to delay abscission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). These findings indicate that Srs2 is crucial for inhibiting cytokinetic abscission under conditions of DNA replication stress.</p><p id="P11">The DNA double strand break repair protein Mre11 forms nuclear foci indicative of DNA damage. In NoCut-deficient cells with chromatin bridges, Mre11-GFP foci accumulate after cytokinesis, likely due to chromatin bridge breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Amaral et al., 2016</xref>). To determine whether the lack of coordination between chromosome segregation and abscission in Srs2-deficient cells results in DNA damage after cytokinesis, we visualised the formation of DNA damage foci using Mre11-GFP. In normally cycling cells, approximately 14% of wild-type cells exhibit Mre11 foci after nuclear division, with this fraction increasing to 25% in the absence of <italic>SRS2</italic>. To test if increased damage in <italic>srs2</italic>Δ cells is due to replication stress-induced lesions in the main nucleus or to cytokinesis-induced damage of chromatin bridges, abscission was delayed by deletion of the cytokinesis gene <italic>CYK3</italic>, which delays septum formation and subsequent abscission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Amaral et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Onishi et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, the fraction of <italic>srs2</italic>Δ cells with DNA damage was reduced to near wild-type levels in <italic>srs2 cyk3</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, “untreated”). This suggests that premature cytokinesis causes damage to chromatin bridges in Srs2-deficient cells. Following replication stress induced by HU, the fraction of wild-type cells exhibiting Mre11 foci was increased from 24% in wild type to 40% in <italic>srs2</italic>Δ cells; also in this case, delayed abscission in <italic>CYK3</italic>-deficient cells was able to reduce the fraction of cells with Mre11 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, “HU pulse”). These results demonstrate that Srs2 is required to delay cytokinesis and prevent chromatin bridge damage in response to replication stress.</p><p id="P12">Next, we investigated if Srs2 is involved in the abscission delay caused by catenated chromatin bridges by inactivating topoisomerase II using the temperature-sensitive allele <italic>top2-4</italic>. These mutants display chromatin bridges in 100% of anaphases, and delay abscission is a manner dependent on Aurora-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Amaral et al., 2016</xref>). Cells were grown at 25°C and synchronised in G1 with α-factor for 2 hours. G1 arrested cells were then released into pre-heated media at 37°C and placed in a pre-heated chamber at 37°C for imaging. Wild-type and <italic>srs2</italic>Δ cells expressing the GFP-CAAX plasma membrane marker exhibited similar abscission timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Amaral et al. 2016</xref>), inactivation of <italic>top2-4</italic> resulted in significant impairment in membrane resolution, with 92% of cells failing to complete abscission within 60 minutes. Remarkably, this impairment was partially but significantly rescued in cells lacking Srs2, reducing the failure rate from 92% to 41% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). These findings suggest that Srs2 plays a critical role in inhibiting abscission in cells challenged with both HU-induced and catenated chromatin bridges.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Association of Srs2 with PCNA is required for full abscission inhibition</title><p id="P13">Srs2 is recruited to the replication fork during S-phase by SUMOylated PCNA, through its C-terminal SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) and PIP-box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Armstrong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kolesar et al., 2012</xref>). To investigate whether this interaction is essential for the role of Srs2 in NoCut function, we first deleted the SIM of Srs2 and assessed abscission timing. Interestingly, deletion of the SIM alone was not sufficient to rescue abscission failure in <italic>top2-4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Although SIM-defective Srs2 has a lower affinity to SUMOylated PCNA, it can still interact with non-SUMOylated PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Armstrong et al., 2012</xref>). We then deleted both the PIP-box and the SIM, thereby disrupting both interactions with SUMO and PCNA. The absence of both the SIM and PIP-box partially but significantly rescued the fraction of cells able to complete abscission, increasing it to 28% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). These findings suggest that interacting with PCNA is critical for Srs2 to fully promote a NoCut-mediated abscission delay in the presence of catenated bridges.</p><p id="P14">To determine if PCNA is required during cytokinesis to modulate abscission timing, we used a cold-sensitive mutant of PCNA (<italic>pol30-S115P</italic>). Due to weakened interactions within the Pol30 homotrimer, this mutant shows reduced chromatin accumulation and does not grow at 14 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Ayyagari et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). Wild-type and <italic>pol30-S115P</italic> cells were grown at the permissive <italic>pol30-S115P</italic> temperature of 30°C and exposed to HU for two hours, before shifting to the restrictive temperature of 14°C. Following HU exposure, <italic>pol30</italic> mutants were significantly less delayed in abscission than wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Pol30 inactivation in otherwise unchallenged cells (without HU) did not affect abscission timing. Together, these results further suggest that PCNA integrity, and likely its association with Srs2 on chromatin, is important for the NoCut checkpoint.</p><p id="P15">We next tested whether association of PCNA with chromatin is not only necessary but also sufficient to inhibit abscission. We took advantage of a conditional dicentric chromosome, generated by end-to-end fusion of chromosomes IV and XII, in which centromere 4 is kept inactive thanks to activation of the strong <italic>GAL1,10</italic> promoter. On activation of <italic>CEN4</italic> in glucose-containing media, chromatin bridges (visualised with Htb2-mCherry) form in 50% of anaphases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). These bridges do not trigger a NoCut response, possibly due to their failure to recruit a NoCut-activating factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Amaral et al., 2016</xref>). We asked whether retaining PCNA and Srs2 on chromatin could render dicentric chromatin bridges detectable by the NoCut checkpoint. After replication termination, PCNA is unloaded from chromatin by the Replication Factor C-like complex Elg1. In cells lacking Elg1, PCNA remains associated with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kubota et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P16">We monitored abscission in conditionally dicentric mutants with wild-type <italic>ELG1</italic> and confirmed that abscission proceeds with near-wild-type efficiency, regardless of the presence of dicentric bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, <italic>ELG1</italic>). Similarly, <italic>elg1</italic>Δ cells without chromatin bridges completed abscission with dynamics comparable to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, <italic>elg1</italic>Δ, “no bridge”), indicating that PCNA retention on chromatin alone does not affect abscission timing. However, in the presence of a dicentric bridge, <italic>elg1</italic>Δ mutants exhibited delayed abscission, with approximately 50% of cells unable to resolve the membrane within 60 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>, <italic>elg1</italic>Δ, “with bridge”). This finding suggests that PCNA retention, or the persistence of PCNA-associated factors, specifically on dicentric chromatin bridges is necessary to inhibit abscission, rather than PCNA retention on chromatin in general.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The Srs2 human homolog PARI delays midbody severing in response to chromatin bridges</title><p id="P17">Like Srs2, the human protein PARI acts as an anti-recombinase and prevents the accumulation of recombination intermediates that could lead to genomic instability during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Burkovics et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Moldovan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Mochizuki et al., 2017</xref>). To investigate the role of PARI in the human NoCut / abscission checkpoint, we developed an assay to measure chromatin bridge formation and abscission in HeLa cells. Cells were synchronised in the cell cycle using the double thymidine method. Cells were treated with thymidine for 16 hours to inhibit deoxynucleotide synthesis, causing arrest in S phase. This was followed by an 8-hours release into normal culture media and a subsequent 16-hour thymidine treatment to achieve a more synchronised block at the G1/S boundary. Following release from the double thymidine block, cells progressed to G2/mitosis after approximately 7.5 hours and entered cytokinesis 4.5 hours later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). To induce chromatin bridges with minimal S-phase perturbation, a low dose of the catalytic topoisomerase II inhibitor ICRF-193, which causes both catenated chromatin bridges and ultrafine (UFBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Germann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Bhowmick et al., 2019</xref>), was added during late G2 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p><p id="P18">PARI was depleted in HeLa cells using siRNA. Since neither commercial nor in-house polyclonal antibodies detected the PARI protein at the expected 65 kDa size, RT-qPCR confirmed an 80% reduction in PARI mRNA levels compared to cells transfected with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>).</p><p id="P19">Next, we evaluated abscission timing by measuring midbody stability. The duration from midbody assembly (marked by the constriction of central spindle microtubules into a bundle), to midbody severing is known to increase in the presence of chromatin bridges and serves as a proxy for abscission timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Steigemann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carlton et al., 2012</xref>; Advedissian et al., 2024). We term this duration “midbody lifetime”. To assess midbody lifetime, we conducted time-lapse spinning disk microscopy on synchronised HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-α-tubulin. Chromatin was visualised using H2B-mCherry.</p><p id="P20">Our results demonstrated that in untreated HeLa cells, the average midbody lifetime is 130 minutes. However, in the presence of ICRF-193, midbody severing is significantly delayed to approximately 200 minutes. Remarkably, in the absence of PARI, this delayed midbody severing is partially but significantly reduced, to around 150 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). The severing of midbody microtubules in PARI-depleted cells occurred in the presence of chromatin bridges, as determined by H2B-Cherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B-C</xref>) and confirmed using correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>). Continuous chromatin was observed traversing the intercellular bridge (ICB), passing through the microtubule-dense midbody and Flemming body in cells treated with ICRF-193. The microtubules of the midbody remained straight and ordered along the ICB, even in the presence of a chromatin bridge. Furthermore, depletion of PARI did not appear to disrupt the structure of the ICB during cytokinesis, with morphologies similar to those observed in cells with intact PARI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p><p id="P21">To determine whether the role of PARI in regulating midbody lifetime is specific and not due to off-target effects of the siRNA used, we designed a siPARI-1-resistant version of PARI. The putative seed region of siPARI-1 was identified, and three silent mutations were introduced that did not alter the wild-type protein sequence but rendered the mRNA resistant to degradation by siPARI-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S5A-B</xref>). Additionally, an eGFP tag was added to the N-terminus of PARI. We generated HeLa Kyoto cell lines stably expressing either eGFP or siPARI-1-resistant eGFP-PARI (eGFP-PARI<sup>R</sup>) (see Methods). These cells were depleted of endogenous PARI using siPARI-1 and treated with ICRF-193 as described. The midbody and microtubules were visualised using SiR-Tubulin dye, and midbody lifetime was measured from assembly to severing. In cells expressing eGFP, siPARI-1 treatment significantly reduced midbody lifetime, consistent with previous observations in control HeLa cells. However, in cells expressing eGFP-PARI<sup>R</sup>, siPARI-1 did not reduce midbody lifetime (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S5C-D</xref>). These results suggest that the human homolog of Srs2, PARI, specifically delays midbody severing in the presence of chromatin bridges induced by topoisomerase II inactivation.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>PARI does not stabilise the midbody upon NPC defects</title><p id="P22">It has been shown that defects in nuclear pore assembly, such as those caused by depleting the basket component NUP153, can delay midbody severing without the presence of chromatin bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Mackay et al., 2010</xref>). To determine whether PARI is involved in this response, we partially co-depleted NUP153 along with PARI in HeLa cells using siRNA (see Methods). The NUP153 protein level was assessed by Western blotting and was found to be partially depleted after transfection; co-depletion with PARI did not alter these levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S5B</xref>). Cells were synchronised in G1/S with thymidine for 24 hours and then released for 16 hours. NUP153-depleted cells distinctively arrested in cytokinesis, exhibiting cytoplasmic “abscission checkpoint bodies” (ACBs), which are indicative of an active abscission checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Strohacker et al., 2021</xref>) in cells treated with both control and PARI-targeting siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S5A, C</xref>). These results suggest that PARI is not required for midbody stabilisation in response to nuclear pore assembly defects, but rather plays a specific role in delaying midbody severing in the presence of chromatin bridges.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>PARI promotes actin stabilisation at the intercellular bridge</title><p id="P23">In addition to delaying midbody severing, F-actin has been shown to promote abscission checkpoint-mediated delay by accumulating at the intercellular bridge (ICB) as actin patches, which stabilise the canal in the presence of chromatin bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Steigemann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dandoulaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bai et al., 2020</xref>). To determine whether PARI regulates this process, we examined F-actin dynamics in HeLa cells stably expressing H2B-mCherry and GFP-actin.</p><p id="P24">In control cells (siCtrl + DMSO), actin accumulated at the cleavage furrow during anaphase and gradually dispersed as cytokinesis progressed. Depletion of PARI (siPARI-1 + DMSO) did not significantly alter actin behavior, as actin cleared from the division site with similar kinetics as in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movies S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>). In contrast, treatment with ICRF-193 (siCtrl + ICRF-193) led to a prolonged retention of actin at the division site, in patches often associated with H2B-labeled chromatin, consistent with delayed cytokinesis and the presence of chromatin bridges. These actin patches persisted for at least 200 minutes after membrane ingression, and even 700 minutes post-ingression, only 25% ICR-193-treated cells had disassembled them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A-B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie S3</xref>). Interestingly, in PARI-knockdown cells, actin patches often formed but failed to persist in most cells, with 60% of cells lacking actin patches 700 minutes after membrane ingression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A-B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Movie S4</xref>). These findings indicate that PARI promotes the formation of actin patches at the ICB, facilitating actin-mediated stabilization of the canal in the presence of chromatin bridges.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>PARI regulates midbody stability through an Aurora B-dependent pathway</title><p id="P25">To determine whether catenated bridges induce a delay in midbody severing dependent on the Aurora B-mediated abscission checkpoint, and to investigate if PARI is a component of this checkpoint, we inhibited Aurora B at the time of cytokinesis. HeLa cells stably expressing H2B-mCherry and GFP-α-Tubulin were synchronised using the double thymidine block and treated with ICRF-193 following the standard protocol. Based on previous observations, midbody severing typically occurred approximately 120 minutes after the start of acquisition. At this point, the Aurora-B inhibitor hesperadin was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A-B</xref>). As expected, control cells treated only with ICRF-193 exhibited a mean midbody lifetime of 200 minutes, and Aurora B inhibition accelerated midbody disassembly, reducing the mean midbody lifetime to 90 minutes. In the absence of PARI, the midbody lifetime was similarly reduced, consistent with our previous observations in the presence of catenated bridges. Notably, co-depletion of PARI and inhibition of Aurora B did not further reduce the already shortened midbody lifetime, suggesting that Aurora B and PARI function within the same pathway to regulate midbody disassembly.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">The NoCut checkpoint plays a critical role in ensuring the proper coordination between chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, thus safeguarding genomic integrity during cell division. Disruption of this checkpoint can lead to the damage of chromatin bridges and genomic instability. Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind NoCut is crucial for elucidating how cells protect themselves against such potentially catastrophic events. We hypothesised that DNA helicases might play a role in NoCut signalling because they are well-positioned to mark, either directly or indirectly, chromatin bridges that arise from replication or topological defects, both of which are known triggers of NoCut signalling. Srs2, for example, is recruited to replication forks by SUMOylated PCNA to prevent HR during S phase and G2, and is associated with ultra fine bridges (UFBs). However, its potential functions during mitosis and cytokinesis had not been explored prior to this study.</p><p id="P27">Our findings reveal that Srs2 plays a crucial role in chromosome segregation during mitosis, particularly following DNA replication stress. Srs2 appears to prevent the accumulation of unreplicated DNA during anaphase, reducing the formation of aberrant DNA structures that could otherwise lead to segregation defects. In the absence of Srs2, cells exhibited increased RPA-coated chromatin bridges associated with delayed bridge resolution. This suggests that Srs2’s activity is important for resolving these aberrant DNA structures caused by replication stress.</p><p id="P28">Furthermore, Srs2 may play a dual role in protecting cells from DNA damage: first, by promoting the resolution of these structures, and second, by potentially triggering the NoCut checkpoint if these structures remain unresolved by the end of cytokinesis. The fact that <italic>srs2</italic>Δ cells exhibited delayed bridge resolution but did not display the NoCut-dependent abscission delay typically seen in response to chromatin bridges implies that Srs2 might be involved in signalling unresolved structures for NoCut checkpoint activation.</p><p id="P29">An intriguing aspect of our study is the discovery that Srs2 is required to delay abscission in the presence of both HU-dependent and catenated chromatin bridges. Our observation that depleting the abscission factor Cyk3 reduces DNA damage in <italic>srs2</italic>Δ cells suggests that Srs2’s role in delaying abscission and protecting chromatin bridges from damage is distinct from its anti-recombinogenic function during fork resolution after HU treatment. This indicates that Srs2’s function in cytokinesis (at least in the formation of breaks) is independent of its role in DNA damage repair. Moreover, our experiments with mutants affecting the Srs2 - PCNA interaction suggest that Srs2 retention in chromatin bridges may be both necessary and sufficient to enforce an abscission delay. Thus, Srs2 may act as a chromatin-based signal for the presence of chromatin bridges, potentially marking these structures for recognition by the NoCut checkpoint machinery.</p><p id="P30">In human cells, we found that PARI, the homolog of Srs2, plays a similar role in the abscission checkpoint. Like Srs2, PARI is an inhibitor of HR and is recruited to stalled or collapsed replication forks under replication stress. We also found that PARI is essential for stabilising midbodies and actin structures at the division site, both of which are hallmarks of the NoCut/abscission checkpoint, in the presence of catenated chromatin bridges. This role seems to be specific to the response to chromatin bridges, as it does not participate in the midbody stabilisation seen with nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly defects, highlighting its specificity within the mammalian NoCut checkpoint.</p><p id="P31">In summary, our data reveal an evolutionarily conserved function of the DNA helicase Srs2 / PARI in controlling the timing of abscission events in response to chromatin bridges. Despite these insights, the molecular mechanisms by which Srs2 and PARI function in NoCut remain unclear. We do not yet understand how Srs2 promotes the recognition of DNA bridges. One possibility is that its presence on incompletely replicated or catenated DNA at the spindle midzone—where Aurora-B resides—might enhance Aurora-B activity or signalling to downstream NoCut components. While Srs2 has been associated with chromatin bridges, there is no clear evidence that PARI or PCNA localise to these bridges in human cells. Our attempts to detect PARI-GFP or PCNA by immunofluorescence were unsuccessful, although this could be due to their low abundance at these sites.</p><p id="P32">Interestingly, Topoisomerase II (Topo II) has been suggested to mark catenated bridges for recognition by the human abscission checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Petsalaki et al., 2023</xref>). However, our data indicate that inhibition of Topo II with ICRF-193 remains coupled to key features of the abscission checkpoint, including the stabilization of midbodies and actin structures at the division site. We propose that the low concentration of ICRF-193 used in our study, which is 40-fold lower than in Petsalaki et al., may only partially inactivate Topo II, allowing the formation of chromatin bridges while retaining sufficient Topo II activity to maintain abscission checkpoint function. It is not yet clear whether Srs2/PARI and Topo II mark bridges independently or as part of a larger complex. The possibility of such a complex is supported by yeast two-hybrid studies demonstrating an interaction between Srs2 and Topo II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Chiolo et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that these proteins could collaborate in marking chromatin bridges for NoCut signalling.</p><p id="P33">Finally, PARI’s association with cancer raises the intriguing possibility that its function in the NoCut checkpoint may contribute to maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis. Interestingly, a polymorphism in the human ESCRT-III component CHMP4C, which impairs the abscission checkpoint, has been linked to increased cancer susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Sadler et al., 2018</xref>). Understanding the specific role of PARI in the NoCut checkpoint and how it might intersect with other pathways involved in genomic stability could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying cancer development.</p></sec><sec id="S11" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S12"><title>Yeast strains and culture</title><p id="P34">All <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains are derived from S288c (<bold>Table 1</bold>).
