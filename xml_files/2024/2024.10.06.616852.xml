response against infection. Intracellular DNA sensing PRRs are responsible for initiating innate immune responses to poxviruses and other double-stranded DNA viruses. Poxviruses, in turn, encode an armoury of immunomodulators that inhibit this host defence mechanism. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is an essential component of the cGAS/STING-dependent viral DNA sensing machinery that leads to the initiation of a type-I interferon response during poxvirus infection. Poxviruses counter this host sensing mechanism using the C4/C10 family of proteins that target DNA-PK, interfering with its ability to bind viral DNA. Although the DNA-PK complex, known also for its role in double strand break repair, is conserved across multiple taxa, its function in innate immunity outside mammals is unexplored. Here we analysed the contribution of DNA-PK to poxvirus DNA sensing in chickens, a species that is evolutionarily distant from mammals, but that is also infected by poxviruses. We found that DNA-PK functions as a DNA sensor in chickens, and this process is countered by C4/C10 family members found in fowlpox virus. This host/pathogen interaction is conserved across a broader range of species than other mechanisms of poxvirus antagonism of innate immune sensing, which may reflect the difficulty of the host in evolving escape mechanisms that interfere with a protein that is essential for maintenance of genomic stability.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The molecular arms race between host and pathogen results in the evolution of increasing complexity in both host immune systems and pathogen effector mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. This competition is exemplified by the interplay between host innate immune responses and antagonsits of these systems deployed by viruses that provide extensive selective pressure, shaping the evolution of host immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Across all vertebrate taxa, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) have evolved to sense infection by directly binding molecular components of pathogens. PRR signalling activation results in the rapid transcription of antimicrobial genes, including interferons and cytokines in mammals. Viral effector mechanisms target PRR signalling to effectively block the production of these inflammatory mediators, allowing them to increase the temporal window for their replication and spread. Determination of the mechanisms of antiviral innate immunity in species that cross different orders of life has significant implications both for understanding the evolution of host/pathogen interactions and for understanding the outcome of zoonotic viral disease severity.</p><p id="P3">Intracellular PRRs that sense and respond to nucleic acids are of particular importance in initiating the host response to virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The DNA sensing PRRs initiate interferon transcription following DNA virus infections by sensing viral genomic DNA. A number of viral DNA sensors have been identified that are critical for defence against DNA viruses. These sensors, including cGAS and DNA-PK drive the STING-dependent IRF and NF-⍰B activation responsible for initiating an antiviral transcriptional programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Multiple families of DNA viruses are detected by PRRs that activate STING, including <italic>poxviridae, herpesviridae</italic> and <italic>adenoviridae</italic>, and these virus families encode multiple inhibitors of DNA sensing pathways that significantly reduce the production of interferons and cytokines from infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Poxviruses are an ancient virus family whose members can infect invertebrates, birds, reptiles and mammals. Poxviruses have rapid, lytic life cycles, necessitating extensive interactions with host innate immune systems. In mammals, poxviruses trigger cGAS and DNA-PK-dependent interferon production via STING [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] but encode an armoury of proteins that target this intracellular signalling pathway so effectively that the wild type virus elicits little to no interferon production from infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The effective inhibition of viral DNA sensing PRRs is achieved by several families of proteins that each inhibit a different step in these signalling pathways. Vaccinia virus (VACV) is perhaps the best studied poxvirus in terms of immune evasion mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. VACV encodes several defined inhibitors of DNA PRRs including the C4/C10 family that binds the Ku70/80 component of DNA-PK and sterically impedes DNA-binding to reduce viral DNA-driven interferon production from infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. The C10 protein, in the VACV Copenhagen strain nomenclature used in most databases, is the same as the protein named C16 protein in the Western Reserve strain of VACV that is the most studied member of this family. VACV also encodes an enzyme, B2/poxin that cleaves the second messenger cGAMP that is produced by cGAS and binds and activates STING [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], and E5 that is reported to bind directly to cGAS and target it for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>].</p><p id="P5">We previously defined the function of the chicken cGAS/STING signalling axis in the sensing of the avipoxvirus, fowlpox virus (FWPV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>], confirming the conservation of this pathway in sensing mammalian and avian poxviruses. In this study we asked two specific questions. Firstly, given that bird genomes encode cGAS and DNA-PK, but not IFI16, we asked whether DNA-PK functions as an innate sensor of exogenous DNA and DNA viruses in birds as it does in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. Secondly, we analysed whether this fundamental mechanism of intracellular viral sensing is targeted by poxviruses that infect birds. Our data illustrate the importance of DNA-PK in sensing FWPV and exogenous DNA in chicken cells and determine the breadth of conservation of the mechanism encoded by poxviruses to inhibit DNA-PK-dependent DNA sensing. Surprisingly, we find that this mechanism of interfering with viral DNA sensing is the exists across more speies than other known methods by which poxviruses block intracellular DNA PRRs, cementing DNA-PK as a key component of anti-poxvirus immunity across different orders of life.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>DNA-PK is required for sensing viral DNA in chickens</title><p id="P6">DNA-PK consists of three subunits, DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs, PRKDC/XRCC7), Ku70 (XRCC6) and Ku80 (XRCC5) functioning together as a heterotrimeric protein complex. Broad evolutionary analyses have identified homologues of DNA-PKcs, Ku70, and Ku80 across the eukaryotes and limited functional analysis in diverse lineages supports a conserved role in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) double-strand DNA break repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. These genes are therefore important for the maintenance of genomic stability and, in jawed vertebrates, for V(D)J recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. By sensing viral DNA, DNA-PK has another established function in innate immunity in humans and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], but the degree of conservation of this function across taxa is unexplored. We therefore first examined the distribution of the DNA-PK complex within the chordates, which contain the natural hosts of the economically important, and human infective, chordopoxvirus family. We sampled a range of chordate genomes covering this lineage, with a focus on major chordopoxvirus targets (birds, reptiles, mammals). The DNA-PK complex was identified in the majority of genomes examined and, in every bird, reptile, and mammal that we searched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). If the innate immune function of the DNA-PK complex is also conserved, as shown for humans and mice, then targeting this activity may also be important for poxvirus lineages beyond vaccinia virus. With this in mind, we next examined the specific target of the vaccinia virus C10/C16 protein, the Ku80 subunit of the DNA-PK complex. Ku80 shows high sequence level conservation across the chordates, particularly in the DNA binding domain, likely reflecting its important function in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also note that this conserved DNA binding domain is the target of C10/C16 binding.</p><p id="P7">The Ku proteins and DNA-PKcs carry out NHEJ functions in chicken cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] but they have not been studied in the context of avian innate immune responses. To functionally assess the contribution of DNA-PK to intracellular DNA sensing in chickens we used the HD11 chicken macrophage cell line that has an active STING-dependent signalling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] to generate clonal Ku70 and DNA-PKcs knockout lines using CRISPR/Cas9 and confirmed the generated indels by sequencing across the target loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A, B</xref>). During attempts to produce Ku70 knockout lines we noted that, despite multiple sgRNA guides targeting different exons being used, very few clones could be recovered, and those that were recovered were found to have background levels of cytokine and chemokine transcription that rendered the assessment of Ku70’s role in DNA sensing intractable in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). We found DNA-PKcs to be transcribed in both chicken bone marrow derived macrophages and HD11 cells, and found its transcription to be upregulated by interferon alpha (IFNα) treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). We were able to generate multiple confirmed DNA-PKcs knockout lines that, in the resting state, did not have altered inflammatory gene transcription compared to parental lines. In these cells the DNA-dependent transcription of type-I interferon (<italic>IFNB</italic>) and <italic>ISG12.2</italic> was lost when compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). The transcription of CCL4, however, was unaffected by loss of DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In comparison, no defects were found in RNA-driven transcriptional responses in DNA-PKcs knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>) consistent with a DNA-specific role for DNA-PK in intracellular nucleic acid sensing in chickens.</p><p id="P8">Wild-type poxviruses, including FWPV, often fail to induce an innate immune response due to the presence of a large number of intracellular PRR inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Using a FWPV strain FP9 lacking an immunomodulator (FPV012) that inhibits IFN-I production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], we previously demonstrated that cGAS and STING are essential for sensing FWPV infection and that transcription of <italic>ISG12.2</italic> is a cGAS/STING-dependent signalling output in chicken cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Here we infected WT and DNA-PKcs<sup>-/-</sup> macrophage cell lines with FWPVΔ012 strain and observed lower induction of <italic>ISG12.2</italic> transcription in DNA-PKcs<sup>-/-</sup> cells compared with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). This data indicates that DNA-PKcs acts in concert with cGAS and STING in sensing FWPV infection in chicken cells in the same way that it does in mammals to sense VACV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Chicken cells use a STING/TBK1/IRF7 pathway to sense DNA and FWPV infection</title><p id="P9">To further define the DNA-PK-dependent innate sensing pathway in chicken macrophages we used IRF7 knockout cells HD11 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] and generated TBK1 HD11 knockouts. In mammals, following DNA stimulation, TBK1 phosphorylates STING and IRF3 allowing dimerisation nuclear translocation of IRF3 and subsequent IFN-I transcription. Chickens lack IRF3 but express an IRF7 with a C-terminus similar to mammalian IRF3 with a distribution of serine residues that mimic the mammalian TBK1 phosphorylation sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. Knockout of TBK1 or IRF7 in HD11 cells resulted in a loss of DNA-driven <italic>IFNB</italic> and <italic>ISG12.2</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly the transcription <italic>ISG12.2</italic> in response to FWPVΔ12 infection was completely dependent on TBK1 and IRF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data, combined with our prior description of cGAS and STING knockout macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] indicate that chickens sense cytoplasmic DNA and FWPV infection via DNA-PK, and that this uses a canonical cGAS/STING/TBK1 pathway to drive IFN-I transcription with IRF7 as the dominant transcription factor. As such these core components of the intracellular DNA sensing pathway are highly conserved between mammals and birds.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>The poxvirus C10/C4 family of Ku-binding proteins is highly conserved</title><p id="P10">Poxviruses use a plethora of immune modulators to inhibit PRR signalling and inhibit interferon production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The C4 and C10/C16 proteins made by vaccinia virus bind directly to Ku and inhibit its ability to sense viral DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Since the innate sensing function of DNA-PK is conserved across mammals and birds we postulated that the immune evasion mechanism used by the C4/C10 poxvirus family might also be conserved. We therefore used protein sequence homology searches to identify C4/C10 homologues and analyse their distribution across a broadly representative selection of poxviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). As previously reported, the B2/poxin family demonstrated the broadest distribution, being identified in mammalian and insect infective (entomopoxvirus) poxviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>].</p><p id="P11">However, the distribution of B2/poxin was extremely sparse beyond the orthopoxviruses and centapoxviruses. Of the other inhibitors examined, the C4/C10 family appeared the oldest, being present in the relatively early branching avipoxvirus family. Further examination of the relative positions of C4/C10 family genes within their respective genomes revealed that this family is almost exclusively localised to the genomic termini, either within or adjacent to the inverted terminal repear (ITR) regions. These genomic regions are highly enriched in virulence genes, suggesting that a virulence mediating function may be conserved across the C4/C10 family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). This analysis of the conservation of C4/C10 family homologues indicates that this family is more highly conserved than the poxin (B2) and E5 families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) and suggest therefore that targeting DNA-PK may represent a broadly conserved and ancient strategy for poxvirus immune evasion, likely reflected in the conserved positioning of C4/C10 family genes within ITRs and genome termini.</p><p id="P12">We identified three C4/C10 family member genes in FWPV. This family contains a characteristic bi-domain structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The N-terminal domain is a structural mimic of the prolyl-hydroxylase family responsible for regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1⍰ (HIF-1⍰) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], while the C-terminal domain binds Ku70/80, blocking DNA binding to DNA-PK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. The C-terminal domain amino-acid sequence contains a distinctive ‘LCYC’ motif that is very highly conserved across family members and is structurally essential for the domain fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Two of these genes, 020 and 225, encode identical proteins and, like VACV C10/C16, are duplicate genes found in the inverted terminal repeats (ITR) of vaccinia that contain multiple duplicated genes. The third gene in FWPV is 006 which has a divergent sequence from 0200/255 but is still a member of the same family. To assess further the relationship between the poxviral C4/C10 family members we carried out a phylogenetic analysis of family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). This analysis indicates that there have been multiple independent gene duplication events during the evolution of poxviruses that have led to many poxviruses carrying more than one copy of these genes. The duplication events, for example, that led to the appearance of C4 and C10/C16 in VACV occurred independently of the event that led to 020 and 006 in FWPV. This can be further evidenced by the presence of a C-terminal extension in all three FWPV proteins (006, 020, 225) that is not present in any of the orthopoxvirus family members (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). As such there is a clear evolutionary pressure on most poxvirus families to maintain at least one copy, and in many cases multiple copies, of the C4/C10 family of immunomodulators.</p><p id="P13">Whilst it is true that the C4/C10 family is well conserved in terms of presence, examination of sequence level conservation across family members demonstrated a notable lack of strict sequence level conservation. The previously identified, highly conserved LCYC motif was indeed well conserved across all of our identified genes, however the region of C10/C16 responsible for interacting with Ku80 and thus conferring inhibitory activity appeared only modestly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). This prompted us to investigate experimentally the activity of the divergent avipoxvrus C4/C10 family proteins against their natural host DNA-PK.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The Fowlpox C4/C10 homologues 020 and 006 are immunomodulatory genes</title><p id="P14">To assess the conservation of function in the fowlpox C4/C10 homologues, we used the FWPVΔ020 and FWPVΔ006 deletion viruses and analysed previously generated microarray data from primary chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF) infected with these viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. We compared gene expression profiles of mutant strains to the wild-type fowlpox virus (FP9 strain), known for its disruption of DNA signalling pathways and suppression of interferon signalling in host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. Gene Ontology (GO) biological function analysis revealed significant differences in both knockout viruses compared to the FP9 strain, particularly in cell-to-cell signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A-B</xref>). We then screened the gene lists generated from the comparison between the knockout viruses and the wild-type virus for interferon and DNA-sensing immune response-related and cellular signalling transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. This screening revealed that several genes, including IFITM1, LY6E, MB21D1, IL6, FIB, TLR2-1, IFI30, and TNFAIP2, were subtly but significantly upregulated in one or both of the knockout mutants compared to the wild-type FP9 FWPV strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P15">The identification of interferon-stimulated genes <italic>IFITM1</italic> and <italic>Ly6E</italic> as 020- and 006-regulated genes in FWPV-infected CEFs is consistent with the function of these genes as immunomodulatory proteins and regulators of FWPV-driven interferon production. To identify the upstream signals responsible for transcription of <italic>IFITM1</italic> and <italic>Ly6E</italic> we analysed DNA-stimulated WT and DNA-PKcs<sup>-/-</sup>, TBK1<sup>-/-</sup> and IRF7<sup>-/-</sup> HD11 chicken macrophage cell lines. The DNA-driven induction of <italic>IFITM1</italic> and <italic>Ly6E</italic> transcription was dependent on DNA-PKcs, TBK1 and IRF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D, E</xref>). Similarly infection of these cells with FWPVΔ012 indicated that transcription of both <italic>IFITM1</italic> and <italic>Ly6E</italic> are dependent on DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5 F</xref>). Further, infection of chicken macrophages with FWPVΔ020 in WT cells showed that <italic>IFITM1</italic> and <italic>Ly6E</italic> are transcription is upregulated in chicken cells during infection with FWPVΔ020, as in CEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>). As such, the C4/C16 homologues in FWPV, 002 and 060 regulate the expression of genes that are dependent on the DNA-PK-driven intracellular signalling pathway and, as such, have the same function in FWPV as they do in VACV in inhibiting poxvirus DNA-driven innate immunity.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Blocking the DNA-Binding domain of Ku is a conserved mechanism of poxviral antagonism</title><p id="P16">The structure of VACV Western Reserve C16 (Copenhagen nomenclature: C10) bound to human Ku has been recently solved by CryoEM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].

Several loops in the C-terminal domain of C16 (C10) dimer come together to form a structure that binds the inner surface of the Ku DNA-binding ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Primary sequence analysis of the C4/C10 family, including the FWPV proteins 020 and 006, indicates that the amino-acids forming the Ku-binding loop are not conserved across species, suggesting the possibility of a different Ku-binding modality across different poxviruses. To assess this further, we first used AlphaFold2 (AF) to predict three-dimensional structures of the 020 and 006 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains were predicted with high accuracy, but lower confidence was predicted in the loop between these domains and at the far C-terminus. The predicted structures of 020 and 006 suggest a highly conserved structure between these proteins and C10/C4. Dimeric assemblies of 020 and 006 were created by docking onto the VACV C16 structure, which overlays with very high confidence, indicating the potential for a conserved overall fold of these proteins. Furthermore, the loop regions of FWPV020 and 006 that are predicted to interact with chicken Ku70/80 have a distinctive electronegative surface that mimics the charge distribution on the equivalent region of C16 (C10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6D</xref>). The conservation of this charge-distribution provides an explanation for the conservation of function of this family of proteins in the absence of strict primary sequence similarity conservation in the functional loop regions. To determine binding of these Fowlpox proteins to chicken Ku70/80, we used AF-Multimer to also predict the structure of Ku70/80. The structure was predicted with high confidence with the exception of the N and C-terminal regions which have flexible sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). To illustrate the electrostatic potential of the DNA binding pocket of Ku70/80, we truncated the N and C-terminal regions which are not involved in binding. From the electrostatic potential a strong electropositive patch can be visualised within the DNA-binding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). This electropositive patch is utilised primarily for DNA binding, however the C4/C10 protein family have exploited this by creating proteins with high electronegativity to bind here and prevent DNA binding. This structural modelling offers a potential mechanistic basis for the functional observations from the FWPV 020 and 006 knockout viruses. Taken together, this strongly supports functional conservation of the C4/C10 protein family in Fowlpox and, by extension, across the avipox and orthopoxviruses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P17">There are multiple DNA-sensing PRRs whose function contributes antiviral immunity. In general, these processes are poorly described in Sauropsida, including birds, compared to mammals, despite the ecological and economic importance of birds and their role as reservoirs of zoonotic viruses. To address this knowledge gap, we have recently described the role of cGAS/STING pathway in FWPV sensing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] and the mechanisms of bacterial DNA sensing by TLR21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] in chickens. Here we extend our exploration of comparative immunology and host/poxvirus interactions by determining the contribution of DNA-PK to innate sensing of exogenous DNA and FWPV in chickens and highlight the conservation of the mechanism by which poxviruses inhibit this host response beyond the Mammalia taxon.</p><p id="P18">We found that the DNA-PK complex function in antiviral immunity is conserved between mammals and birds. Chicken cells lacking the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK, DNA-PKcs (encoded by the <italic>PRKDC</italic> gene) fail to produce IFN-I in response to DNA, but not RNA, and in response to poxvirus infection, equivalent to its function in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. We also show that this response requires the kinase TBK1 and the transcription factor, IRF7. This data is consistent with IRF7 being a functional replacement for IRF3 in birds and the main IRF functioning downstream of PRRs in avian antiviral immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. As such, we have now demonstrated that the DNA-PK/cGAS/STING/IRF signalling pathway is highly conserved between birds and mammals. On the other hand, other mechanisms of viral DNA sensing, for example those that use the IF16 and AIM2 inflammasome protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] are not used by birds as these loci are not present in avian species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], which places to date the DNA-PK/cGAS/STING/IRF axis as the main DNA-sensing complex to be functionally available in birds.</p><p id="P19">All poxviruses produce multiple proteins that inhibit PRR-driven IFN-I production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. This is also true of avipoxviruses, since two FWPV proteins, FWPV012 and FWPV184, are known to reduce the amount of IFN-I and ISG transcription in infected chicken cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. These two proteins are not thought to target DNA sensing PRRs directly, but rather to antagonise downstream signalling molecules. Here we add FPV020, FPV006 and FPV225 to the list of FWPV interferon antagonists and identify them as functional members of the poxvirus virus C4/C10 family. The conservation of this family of poxviral immunomodulators is broader than that of B2 and E5, which target cGAMP and cGAS respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. This family is not only highly conserved, but, for unknown reasons, often has 2-3 copies per genome. VACV, for example, has two copies of C16/C10 (in its ITRs) and one copy of C4. Similarly FPV020 and FPV225 are identical genes and FPV006 is part of the same family. The presence of multiple copies of these genes, along with their high degree of conservation among poxviruses, may reflect their importance in the poxvirus life cycle. The C4/C10 protein family is multifunctional. VACV C16/C10 can activate the cellular hypoxic response via an interaction between its N-terminal domain and the host PHD2 protein that activates HIF-1a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], and C4 can inhibit NF-⍰B signalling via an unknown mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. It remains to be understood whether the FWPV020 and 006 encode these functions as well as their function in blocking IFN-I production in chicken cells as described here. It is noteworthy that all identified C4/C10 family proteins share the two-domain structure with an N-terminal domain that mimics mammalian prolyl-hydroxylases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] and a C-terminal domain that has a unique fold and is responsible for interactions with Ku [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. This two-domain structure may be conserved in order to allow the dimerisation to occur that is necessary for Ku-binding, or there may be interdependent functions of the two domains that are not yet understood.</p><p id="P20">Poxviruses habitually acquire host genes by horizontal gene transfer mechanisms either directly recombination or DNA transposons, or indirectly by retrotransposons or retroviral transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. The copy number of these genes can be rapidly expanded, depending on the selective pressure experienced by the virus, and then the new genes evolved to provide later generations of virus with newly functional proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. This method often results in protein families in poxviruses with conserved domain structures (eg BCL-2-like, Ankyrin repeat, PRANC-domain proteins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Here the C-terminal domains of FWPV020 and 006 have the same fold (the same fold as VACV C4 and C10 C-terminal domains) in part due to the conserved LCYC motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. The loops and surface-exposed residues, however, are very different, despite the Ku-binding loops maintaining the electronegative charges required for Ku-binding. This contrasts with the very high degree of conservation of the electropositive region of Ku targeted by this protein family. Targeting this conserved region of Ku is an immune evasion strategy that accommodates extensive plasticity in the C4/C10 protein family sequence, potentially allowing a large sequence space to be explored whilst retaining binding and at the same time limiting the options for host to mutate away. The success of this strategy is reflected in the conservation of the C4/C10 protein family across the poxviridae. The consistent presence of this family may also reflect a clear impact on virulence. In mouse models of VACV infection, C4 and C16/C10 knockout viruses are attenuated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>] and consistent with this is the presence of a C4/C10 homologue in the more virulent clade 1b MPXV that is not present in the less virulent clade 2 virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>].</p><p id="P21">It is estimated that the last common ancestor between avipoxviruses and orthopoxivurses split more than 200,000 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. Combined with the consistent presence of DNA-PK inhibitors in vertebrate poxviruses, our analyses here imply that inhibition of DNA-PK is an ancient immune evasion mechanism employed by this family of viruses. Given the presence of viral proteins found to targeting DNA-PK in multiple dsDNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>] it is likely that this mechanism of innate immune evasion is also conserved across different virus families. Similar to the recent understanding of the ancient nature of cGAS signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>], it is clear that evolutionarily ancient mechanisms of host nucleic acid sensing are present across taxa along with viral inhibitory mechanisms that have resulted in increasingly complex mechanisms of innate sensing in mammals. As such, understanding the differences in PRRs and their variation across taxa could guide future research in wildlife immunology and significantly enhance our ability to predict the zoonotic potential of various animal hosts.</p></sec><sec id="S9" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Reagents</title><p id="P22">Calf Thymus (CT) DNA (Sigma) and Herring Testes (HT) DNA (Sigma), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C), Invivogen), were diluted in nuclease-free water (Ambion, ThermoFisher).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Cell Culture</title><p id="P23">HD11 cells, an avian myelocytomatosis virus (MC29)-transformed chicken macrophage-like cell line, were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2.
