The molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in fibrosis are complex and anti-fibrotic therapies have so far failed to make an impact on patient welfare. Using unbiased proteomics analysis on the <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup> mouse, we found that expression of the integrin α1 subunit is increased in this model of ADPKD. In human ADPKD tissue and two single cell RNA kidney disease datasets, <italic>ITGA1</italic> was also upregulated. To investigate the functional role of this integrin subunit in ADPKD, we generated a <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup><italic>Itga1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mouse. We observed a significant reduction in kidney volume and kidney dysfunction in mice lacking the integrin α1 subunit. Kidneys from <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup><italic>Itga1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice had smaller cysts and reduced interstitial expansion and tubular atrophy. Picrosirius red staining identified a restriction in collagen staining in the interstitium and the myofibroblast marker α smooth muscle actin was also downregulated. Myofibroblast cell proliferation was reduced in <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup><italic>Itga1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice and primary fibroblast cultures demonstrated an abrogated fibrogenic phenotype in integrin α1-depleted fibroblasts. These results highlight a previously unrecognised role for the integrin α1 subunit in kidney fibrosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) affects ~1 in 1000 individuals[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] and accounts for 15% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) cases. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common subtype and is mostly caused by variants in the <italic>PKD1</italic> and <italic>PKD2</italic> genes. <italic>PKD1</italic> and <italic>PKD2</italic> encode for polycystin-1 (PC1) and PC2, respectively[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] and the PC1-PC2 complex forms a transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel that has many roles in cell function[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], most of which are poorly understood. The major feature of PKD is bilateral formation of kidney cysts, which induce chronic inflammation and fibrotic scarring. Combined, these pathologies lead to kidney failure in ~50% of individuals with ADPKD by age 60 years.</p><p id="P3">The common pathological feature and final manifestation of CKD is interstitial fibrosis. Fibrosis is characterised by the replacement of functional tissue with a collagen-rich extracellular matrix (ECM)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>], and there are currently no effective anti-fibrosis treatments. In CKD, the pathological indication of fibrosis involves interstitial expansion, leukocyte invasion, basement membrane thickening, tubular atrophy, vascular rarefaction, and fibrogenesis (accumulation of fibrillar ECM). In ADPKD, fibrotic scarring and cyst formation are coupled; preventing fibrosis reduces cyst formation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], and precluding cyst formation reduces inflammatory signals that initiate fibrosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P4">In fibrosis, stromal cells in the interstitium are activated by inflammatory signals, such as TGFβ, and transdifferentiate to proto-myofibroblasts, and then senescent myofibroblasts[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Myofibroblasts are the main source of new ECM in fibrotic kidneys and are predominantly derived from resident fibroblasts and pericytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Inhibition of mesenchymal cell proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation, ECM deposition and contractility is likely to restrict fibrosis in CKD. Cell-ECM signalling is integral to these processes as the interaction of cells with their surrounding microenvironment determines their fibrogenic potential[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Integrins are the principal cellular transmembrane receptors that bind ECM, and they exist as heterodimers of one alpha and one beta subunit. In mammals there are 18 alpha subunits and 8 beta subunits which form 24 distinct receptors with specific ECM ligand binding activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Integrins connect extracellular ligands with the cytoskeleton and form a signalling nexus called a focal adhesion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The collagen-binding integrin alpha subunits (<italic>ITGA1, ITGA2, ITGA10, ITGA11</italic>) all dimerise with integrin beta 1. Genetic knockouts of these integrin alpha subunits in mice are generally well tolerated[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Genetic deletion of the integrin α1 subunit increases glomerulosclerosis and glomerular deposition of collagen IV in response to adriamycin-induced glomerular injury[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] or a streptozotocin model of diabetic nephropathy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. In the unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO) model of kidney fibrosis, loss of integrin α1 caused an increase in tubulointerstitial fibrosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. In the skin, <italic>Itga1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice also display increased collagen production and an irregular wound response[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. In dermal fibroblasts, integrin α1 positively regulates cell proliferation through activation of the adaptor protein Shc[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. A pro-proliferative function for integrin α1 is supported in cancer studies, where its inhibition attenuates cell proliferation and metastasis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. These results suggest that integrin α1 is an anti-fibrotic and pro-proliferative receptor. However, in other contexts depletion of integrin α1 may reduce fibrosis. A triple knockout of the three major collagen binding receptors <italic>Itga1, Itga2</italic> and <italic>Itga11</italic> is non-lethal, and fibrosis is attenuated in these mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], suggesting that collagen-binding integrins positively control the development of fibrosis. In Alport syndrome, loss of integrin α1 is protective[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>], and this may be in part due to reduced interstitial fibrosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. A recent study showed that Alport mice crossed onto the <italic>Itga1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice treated with the lowering blood pressure drug Ramipril had increased lifespan and delayed fibrosis compared to Alport mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. These results suggest the role of integrin α1 in regulating fibrotic responses may be disease-context and cell-context specific.</p><p id="P5">Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we found upregulation of integrin α1 in a hypomorphic mouse model of ADPKD (<italic>Pkd1</italic><sup><italic>nl/nl</italic></sup>). In parallel, we found integrin α1 localisation in fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in human healthy and ADPKD kidney tissue. To test the biological relevance of increased integrin α1 in ADPKD, we performed global genetic depletion of <italic>Itga1</italic> in <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup><italic>nl/nl</italic></sup> mice and observed a striking reduction in cyst size and interstitial fibrosis. These findings were associated with reduced interstitial fibrosis, fewer interstitial macrophages and a reduction in fibrogenic markers in primary fibroblast cultures taken from <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup><italic>Itga1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> kidneys. Overall, our findings indicate that integrin α1 positively regulates the development of cysts and fibrogenesis in ADPKD and therefore represents a new therapeutic target.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="methods | materials"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="S3"><title>Animal husbandry and maintenance</title><p id="P6">All mouse handling, breeding and disposal was performed in adherence to the culture of care policies of the University of Manchester. The ARRIVE guidelines 2.0 were adhered to when designing, implementing and recording experimental outcomes to ensure best practice and reliable results. Urine samples were collected for urinary Albumin Creatinine Ratio (uACR) measurements by transferring individual mice to a separate sterile cage. Mice were left for a maximum of 15 minutes and spots of urine were collected in this timeframe (at least 50 µl was collected). Urine samples were stored at -20°C and when ready were processed using a Creatinine Parameter Assay kit (R&amp;D systems, cat# KGE005) and a mouse Albumin ELISA kit (Bethyl Laboratories, cat# E99-134). Kidneys for proteomics analysis were collected at P1 and P28, when body weight and two kidney weight measurements were made immediately after schedule 1 killing. For P28 mice, blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture and left overnight at 4°C to coagulate. Serum was collected after spinning samples down at 1200 g for 5 minutes at 4°C to pellet the blood cells. Serum was stored at -80°C. Urea Nitrogen measurements were made on serum samples using the Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) Colorimetric Detection kit (Arbor Assays, cat# K024-H1). Kidneys to be used in proteomics and Western blot analyses were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.

Haemotoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and picrosirius red (PSR) staining was performed on a Leica Autostainer XL CV5030. Images of whole kidneys were collected as tiled images on an Olympus BX63 upright microscope using a 20x / 0.75 UApo/340 objective and captured and white-balanced using a DP80 camera (Olympus) in colour mode through CellSens Dimension v1.16 (Olympus).

Primary antibodies used were integrin α1 (Cell Signalling Technologies 15574T, 1:200, Citrate antigen retrieval), plectin (Boster Bio PB9430, 1:250, Citrate antigen retrieval), αSMA (ThermoFisher 14-9760-82, 1:250, citrate antigen retrieval, used for images in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S8</xref>), αSMA-Cy3 (Merck C6198 1:500 (added with secondaries) no antigen retrieval needed but can be used on citrate or TrisHCl treated tissue), PCNA (Merck P8825, 1:200, TrisHCl antigen retrieval), F4/80 (Proteintech 81668-1-RR, 1:250, TrisHCl antigen retrieval). Species-specific secondary antibodies used were AlexaFluor488, AlexaFluor594, AlexaFluor647 (ThermoFisher, all at 1:500 dilution). Following dewaxing, antigen retrieval was performed. For the citrate pH 6.0 and TrisHCl pH 9.0 antigen retrieval methods, slides were placed in pre-warmed antigen retrieval solution and incubated in a 70°C water-bath for 30 mins, then removed and allowed to cool to room temperature for an additional 30 mins. After antigen retrieval slides were washed 3x 5 mins in PBS and 0.05% Tween20 (PBSTw), then blocked for 2 hours in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 1% donkey serum, 0.5% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies were added, and slides were left overnight at 4°C. Slides were washed 3x 15 mins with PBSTw and then secondary antibodies and Hoechst (5 µg/ml) nuclear stain were added for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark. Slides were then washed 3x 5 mins in PBSTw and left to dry in the dark for 30 mins before being mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant and cover slipped. Images were collected on an Olympus BX63 upright microscope using a 20x / 0.75 UApo/340 objective and captured and white-balanced using an DP80 camera (Olympus) in monochrome mode through CellSens Dimension v1.16 (Olympus).

The confocal settings were as follows, pinhole 1 airy unit, scan speed 1000Hz unidirectional, format 1024 x 1024. Images were collected using hybrid detectors with the following detection mirror settings; FITC 494-530nm using the white light laser with 488nm (20%) and DAPI 405 (10%) laser lines respectively. When it was not possible to eliminate crosstalk between channels, the images were collected sequentially.

To this, four 1.6 mm diameter stainless steel beads (Next Advance, cat# SSB16) were added and the tissue was beaten in a Bullet Blender Storm 24 2x 1 min. 50 µl of lysate was removed and placed in a fresh tube, with the remaining lysate stored at -20°C. 150 µl of RIPA buffer, 70 µl NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (ThermoFisher, cat# NP0007), and 15 µl 1M DTT were added to the 50 µl of isolated lysate, which was then heated at 95°C for 5 mins and stored at -20°C.

Supernatant was removed and 10 ml of DMEM/ 10% FBS/ 1% PenStrep fibroblast complete growth media was added, and the cells were centrifuged again at 260g for 5 mins to pellet. The cells were re-suspended in 10 ml fibroblast complete growth media and split to two 100 mm cell culture dishes. Cells were left for 3 days and then split (1:3) and left a further 3 days then split (1:3) to a 6-well plate and 8-well chamber slides (for EdU and cell spreading assays, 3x10<sup>5</sup> cells per chamber). For EdU proliferation assay, cells were left to adhere for 24 hours then 1X EdU was added, and the cells were left for another 24 hours before fixation in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed with PBS, then stained for EdU following the Click-iT EdU Cell Proliferation kit protocol manual (ThermoFisher, cat# C10340). Cells were then further stained for the nuclear marker Hoechst and αSMA. Proliferation rate was quantified by counting at least 300 nuclei and measuring the % of these that were EdU<sup>+</sup>. Fixed cells were also stained for phalloidin/αSMA to measure the number of primary fibroblasts that retained a myofibroblast state. For cell spreading assays, chambers of an 8-chamber slide were coated with either vitronectin, collagen I or collagen IV. 3x10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded onto coated surfaces (and uncoated controls) and left to adhere for four hours before being fixed in 4% PFA. Cells were visualised by staining for actin filaments; cells were washed 2x 5 mins in PBS containing 3% BSA, left in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 mins, then incubated 1X Phalloidin-Alexa fluor 647 in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100.

The highest resolution was chosen in the Group Level window. When the image opened, the freehand selection tool was used to mark the area of the kidney, and the area was measured in µm<sup>2</sup>. The image was converted to 16-bit grayscale and threshold analysis was performed to mark the fibrotic area (measured in µm<sup>2</sup>). Given cystic kidneys had large areas of non-parenchymal space, we subtracted the cyst area from the total kidney area to get % fibrotic area (PSR<sup>+</sup> collagen fibres area (µm<sup>2</sup>)/(total kidney area (µm<sup>2</sup>) - cystic area (µm<sup>2</sup>))). The cystic area was measured using particle analysis after thresholding, with only particles &gt;200 µm<sup>2</sup> measured as this was the size threshold by which we reliably detected the particle as a cyst rather than a tubule/duct lumen. This same process of measuring cystic index (% kidney area), average cyst size and cyst number was determined using H&amp;E stained slides for the analysis given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. For measurement of fibrotic index in fluorescent images, such as red fluorescent PSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>) and αSMA immunostained whole kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F and 1G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>), similar analysis was performed as described above, but a binary mask was generated in thresholding using the fluorescent signal rather than a colorimetric signal. For the analysis of human kidney samples, three randomly selected areas were imaged by confocal microscopy in each of the patient biopsies. These were then analysed using thresholding in FIJI to obtain % area coverage for integrin α1 and αSMA. For the PCNA/αSMA image analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, whole kidney section views were analysed. Firstly, a binary mask was generated in the αSMA Cy3 channel (Process&gt;Binary&gt;Make Binary), which was then selected (Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Create Selection) and added to ROI list (Ctrl T). This ROI was then placed over the PCNA channel image and non-overlapping staining was deleted using the Edit&gt;Clear Outside function. This image was then made into a binary mask using thresholding and PCNA<sup>+</sup> nuclei in cells co-labelled with αSMA were measured in terms of number and area.

The most statistically significant upregulated protein in the P28 SF was plectin, and immunostaining for plectin in P28 kidney sections confirmed its increased expression in pericystic, epithelial and interstitial regions of polycystic kidneys (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>).

At P28, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins were also enriched. Using the Matrisome database[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], we focussed our analysis on ECM proteins. As expected from results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, there were only seven SF ECM proteins and four LSF ECM proteins that were differentially expressed at P1, with fibrinogen the main protein group altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). At P28, many detected ECM proteins were differentially expressed. In the soluble fraction, analysis showed 36 upregulated ECM proteins and 11 downregulated ECM proteins. The downregulated ECM proteins included the metalloproteases Meprin1a and 1b, the glomerular basement membrane component Col4a3, and the transglutaminase Tgm1. Upregulated proteins included several proteins previously implicated in fibrogenesis and cystogenesis, including Lcn2, Postn, Lgals3, Tnc, Egf, and Fn1. In the less soluble fraction, four proteins were downregulated, and 49 were upregulated, including many ECM components and pro-fibrotic proteins, such as Lgals3, Lamb1, Col12a1, Hspg2, Lamc1, Sparc, and Fn1. Evidence from Voronoi plots and other gene ontology (GO) analysis suggested a dramatic change in cell-matrix adhesion. Filtering for focal adhesion proteins confirmed a significant change in cell-matrix adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Co-immunofluorescence for integrin α1 and αSMA showed integrin α1 labelled mesenchymal cells in the interstitium of normal healthy kidney tissue and co-labels αSMA<sup>+</sup> cells in E-ADPKD tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>). Quantification of Integrin α1<sup>+</sup> and αSMA<sup>+</sup> area showed an increase in E-ADPKD and ES-ADPKD tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). We suggest this is primarily due to interstitial expansion as fibrotic scarring worsens with disease progression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5</xref>).

This was especially important as most analyses in ADPKD research have relied upon transcriptomic approaches. We identified a general increase in cell adhesion proteins, including multiple integrin receptors, in our proteomics dataset. Previous studies have investigated the roles of the integrin β1 subunit[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>] and integrin-linked kinase[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>] signalling in cyst growth and fibrosis in ADPKD. Roles for integrins α<sub>v</sub>β3[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>], α<sub>v</sub>β5[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>], α<sub>v</sub>β6[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>], α3β1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>], α4β1/4[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>] and α<sub>m</sub>β2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>] in fibrosis have also been studied. A general theme from these studies is that integrins augment fibrosis by promoting both the immune response to tissue-specific inflammation and the fibrogenic actions of myofibroblasts. We detected all these integrin subunits with increased abundance in the <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup> proteomics in addition to increased integrin α1, which binds integrin β1 to form the heterodimeric integrin α1β1 receptor. Given the lack of any obvious phenotypes associated with healthy and/or injured Itga1 null mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], it is likely that any therapy targeting integrin α1β1 will be well tolerated. Therefore, we wished to investigate if integrin α1 has a functional role in ADPKD pathogenesis. Analysis of <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup><italic>Itga1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed a dramatic reduction in kidney size and kidney dysfunction, identifying integrin α1 as a mediator of ADPKD pathogenesis. Strikingly, we observed a significant reduction in interstitial fibrosis in <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup><italic>Itga1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> kidneys. The non-cystic parenchyma of these mice was relatively well maintained; the number of glomeruli was similar to wild-type controls and interstitial expansion was relatively restricted. We believe this reduced fibrotic response is the causal factor that improved kidney function in <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup> kidneys depleted of integrin α1.</p><p id="P32">Using immunofluorescence and scRNA-seq data[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], we showed integrin α1 is expressed and localised in mesenchymal cells that populate the kidney interstitium. Previously, integrin α1 expression in mice has been reported in the glomerular mesangium, in embryonic stage proximal tubules and in the kidney interstitium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>] using a specific antibody[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. In <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup><italic>Itga1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> kidney primary fibroblast cultures, integrin α1 depletion reduced myofibroblast contractility and expression of pro-fibrotic genes (<italic>Col1a1, Fn1</italic> and <italic>SerpinE1</italic>). Given the expression profile of integrin α1 in fibroblasts and myofibroblasts and the reduced fibrotic phenotype upon its depletion, it is likely that integrin α1 is directly involved in the tissue repair response performed by myofibroblasts. Intriguingly, we only observed a marginal reduction in αSMA immunofluorescence in primary cultured fibroblasts taken from <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup> and <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup><italic>Itga1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> kidneys. It is likely that a 2D in vitro environment is sufficient to induce a myofibroblast phenotype, which might explain high levels of αSMA expression in both samples. Despite this, integrin α1 depletion reduced contractility in primary kidney fibroblasts of our ADPKD mouse model. Similar observations have been observed in activated liver stellate cells (a type of myofibroblast), where anti-integrin α1 blocked contraction by 70%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. Integrin α1 expression is present in normal stellate cells and persists when they are activated in response to injury[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>], a finding that correlates with our observations in human healthy and ADPKD kidney tissue. Overexpression of integrin α1 in cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells has also been shown to increase contractility of these cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. In heart myofibroblasts, contractility strength is not dependent on the binary presence or absence of αSMA; as fibrosis progresses, so too does contractility strength[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>]. Focal adhesions are integral to αSMA-mediated contractions, and increased contractility further enhances ECM deposition and fibrogenesis in a positive feedback loop[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. Therefore, our finding that integrin α1-depleted primary myofibroblasts express αSMA but are less contractile and less fibrogenic might imply this positive feedback loop is minimised or blocked.</p><p id="P33">Our results contrast with previous observations showing a lack of integrin α1 leads to increased fibrosis in the kidney and skin. In dermal skin wounding, mice lacking integrin α1 have fewer fibroblasts due to lowered rates of proliferation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], but overall more fibrosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. And in models of glomerular injury, <italic>Itga1</italic>-null mice have increased sclerosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the glomerular injury induced by adriamycin or streptozotocin primarily affects mesangial cells within the glomerulus of the kidney. In this setting, integrin α1 appears to be protective against excessive ECM deposition. Glomerular injury is usually not associated with ADPKD, and nephrotic range proteinuria is unusual in patients with ADPKD. Thus, the role of integrin α1β1 in tubulopathy (such as ADPKD) is distinct to that exerted in glomerulopathy. However, interstitial fibrosis is exacerbated in <italic>Itga1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice in the UUO model of fibrosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Fibrosis develops in the UUO model within days, which is more reminiscent of an acute kidney injury rather than chronic kidney disease. Therefore, it is possible that in a more clinically relevant setting, where interstitial fibrosis develops over a longer period because of chronic kidney disease, integrin α1β1 inhibition may be beneficial.</p><p id="P34">Our primary fibroblast culture experiments highlighted that integrin α1-depletion is unable to prevent fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation (based on αSMA expression). This is consistent with our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings where much of the tubulointerstitium of <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup><italic>Itga1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> kidneys was weakly αSMA<sup>+</sup>. As discussed above, the reduced contractility and expression of pro-fibrotic markers in integrin α1 depleted myofibroblasts is likely to be a significant factor for reduced fibrosis in <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup><italic>Itga1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> kidneys. However, additional factors may also be involved, including the role of integrin α1β1 on leukocytes that invade the inflamed kidney and promote fibrosis. We observed a 50% reduction in F4/80<sup>+</sup> leukocytes in <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup><italic>Itga1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> kidneys. These cells are most likely macrophages, the origins of which are either resident embryonic macrophages or infiltrating monocytes. Integrin α1β1 has been reported to be expressed on activated macrophages[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>] in the kidney[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. However, in the scRNA-seq analyses used in this study, the only immune cell type expressing <italic>ITGA1</italic> in the kidney were T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3B and 3E</xref>), thus further study is required to clarify this discrepancy. Inhibition of integrin α1 on immune cells is recognised to reduce their ability to respond to inflammatory signals and anti-integrin α1 treatments have been used to dampen inflammation in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and colitis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>]. These treatments also reduce glomerular and tubulointerstitial scarring in a rat model of glomerulonephritis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]. In a peripheral lesion murine model of acute inflammation, integrin α1β1 promoted retention of macrophages at the site of injury[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. Integrin α1 has also been shown to promote monocyte infiltration into the fibrotic kidney by binding to collagen XIII on inflamed vascular endothelium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>]. As well as a reduction in macrophage numbers in <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup><italic>Itga1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> kidneys, we also observed a different spatial organisation of these cells. In <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup> kidneys, macrophages were observed throughout the expanded interstitium, whereas in <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup><italic>Itga1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> kidneys macrophages were restricted to pericystic regions that are likely to be the primary injury sites. Macrophages are important mediators of fibrosis through proximal and prolonged interaction with myofibroblasts[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. These cells are thought to create a two-cell circuit, where close and extended interaction ensures myofibroblasts become fully activated[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>]. There is also some genetic fate-mapping evidence that macrophages can transdifferentiate to myofibroblasts[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. Therefore, future investigations into how integrin α1β1 affects fibrosis in chronic tubulopathies might focus on its role in the (myo)fibroblast-to-macrophage circuit.</p><p id="P35">Cyst expansion in <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup> kidneys was reduced after integrin α1 depletion. Given <italic>Itga1</italic> is not expressed in expanding cyst epithelium, we suggest the reduced kidney fibrosis in these mice is the cause of precluded cyst expansion. Recently, it was shown that depleting myofibroblasts in the <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>RC/RC</sup> murine model of ADPKD reduced kidney cyst growth[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The mechanism by which myofibroblasts affect cyst growth is likely to be multifaceted. Myofibroblasts may promote epithelial cell proliferation by regulating ECM deposition and turnover, and growth factor production. It is possible that the contractility of myofibroblasts induces stretch-activated proliferation in epithelial cells lining cysts. We note that, even though interstitial fibrosis was perturbed in <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup><italic>Itga1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> kidneys, the pericystic ECM persisted, suggesting different mechanisms of matrix production between fibroblasts and macrophages that are pericystic versus those that are positioned in the non-cystic kidney parenchyma. Integrin α1β1 has previously been shown to promote cell proliferation in dermal fibroblasts[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] and in a variety of cancers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>] through activation of Ras/ERK signalling. We showed integrin α1 depletion reduced the number of kidney <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup> myofibroblasts expressing the proliferation marker PCNA <italic>in vivo</italic>. Measurement of rates of proliferation in primary fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic> using EdU labelling showed no significant change, but it is possible that this is due to the artificial cell culture environment. The mouse model of ADPKD used here (<italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>nl/nl</sup>) yields an early onset of cystogenesis. Given cell proliferation is increased in embryonic stages, and integrin α1β1 is involved in cell proliferation, it is vital that the impact of integrin α1 depletion or integrin α1β1 inhibition in later/slower progressing models of ADPKD is investigated to provide additional evidence that integrin α1β1 is a viable drug target.</p><p id="P36">Overall, our findings suggest targeting integrin α1β1 could be a viable therapeutic approach to limit interstitial fibrosis in ADPKD. Combining our findings with those in the literature, we propose integrin α1β1 promotes kidney fibrosis by regulating the fibrogenic actions and rates of proliferation of kidney fibroblasts, as well as enabling the immune response to inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8F</xref>). Given the lack of phenotypes associated with integrin α1 depletion in healthy mice and the lack of human diseases directly attributed to variants in <italic>ITGA1</italic>, new ADPKD therapies targeting this receptor are likely to be well tolerated. Future studies will test the efficacy of using integrin α1β1 inhibitors to reduce kidney fibrosis and will determine the molecular mechanisms by which integrin α1 promotes fibrogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplemental Figures</label><media xlink:href="EMS199607-supplement-Supplemental_Figures.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d80aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplemental Figure Legends</label><media xlink:href="EMS199607-supplement-Supplemental_Figure_Legends.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d80aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a Kidney Research UK Intermediate Fellowship (to R.N.), Wellcome Centre for Cell-Matrix Research: 203128/A/16/Z, Wellcome Discovery Research Platform for Cell-Matrix Biology: 226804/Z/22/Z, and, in part, by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant R01-DK119212 (A.P.); Department of Veterans Affairs Merit Review 1I01BX002025 (A.P.).
