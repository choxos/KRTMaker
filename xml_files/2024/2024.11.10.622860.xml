This study compared the effects of iron deficiency or treatment with intravenous iron on plasma versus myocardial measures of iron metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in mice and humans. The human study included 31 people undergoing cardiac surgery. Twenty-two (71%) were iron deficient. The mouse study included 88 mice randomly allocated to iron replete diet group (Controls, n=29), an Iron Deficient diet (n=31) or an iron deficient diet followed by IV Iron administration (n=28). Outcomes included plasma iron and ferritin concentrations, and myocardial total iron, ferritin, IRP1 binding, and mitochondrial complex activity and DNA damage. In the human study, plasma ferritin positively correlated with myocardial ferritin (r<sup>2</sup>=0.155, p=0.012). People with iron deficiency had significantly lower myocardial ferritin levels than those without iron deficiency. There were no differences or significant correlations for other outcomes. In the mouse study, plasma ferritin negatively correlated with myocardial ferritin (r<sup>2</sup>=0.113, p=0.004), and iron deficiency reduced myocardial ferritin levels (p=0.018) as well as the binding affinity of myocardial IRP1 to the Ferritin heavy chain mRNA (p=0.033). Intravenous iron had divergent effects on plasma (increased) and myocardial (decreased) ferritin levels, and increased IRP1 binding affinity and mitochondrial respiratory complex activity (p=0.049). These finding suggest that measures of iron metabolism and iron deficiency in plasma do not consistently reflect myocardial iron status across iron replete, iron deficient, and iron replacement states.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Iron deficiency</kwd><kwd>Intravenous Iron</kwd><kwd>Cellular Iron Metabolism</kwd><kwd>Ferritin</kwd><kwd>Mitochondrial Complex function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">In an apparent paradox, people with iron deficiency and anaemia who present for cardiac surgery are at increased risk of adverse outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], however these risks are not reduced by pre-surgery iron replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Dysregulated iron metabolism is central characteristic of cardiovascular disease; for example, clinical progression of Heart Failure Reduced Ejection Fraction is associated with worsening iron restriction that ultimately progresses to iron deficiency, as determined by plasma biomarkers, in late-stage disease. Here again, iron replacement with intravenous iron also has not shown important clinical benefits in trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. We hypothesised three possible explanations for these clinical observations. First, iron status measured in plasma may not reflect iron status in myocardium. For example, it has been established that almost all IV iron is rapidly taken up by the reticulo-endothelial system, where it is converted into plasma ferritin or metabolised as transferrin bound iron for utilisation by canonical cellular iron uptake pathways that are tightly regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. Whether these processes reverse the cellular effects of dysregulated iron metabolism in tissues is unclear, particularly in inflammatory states. Second, effective iron replacement in myocardium may not reverse cellular changes associated with iron deficiency such as mitochondrial dysfunction. Third, iron replacement may have unrecognised deleterious effects, especially IV ferric carboxy maltose, through oxidative mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. To test these hypotheses, this study compared the effects of iron replete status versus iron deficiency on simultaneous measures of iron metabolism in plasma and measures of iron metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage in myocardium from humans and mice, and evaluated the effects of intravenous iron replacement on these measures in iron deficient mice.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Human study</title><p id="P3">A total of 40 people completed the VALCARD trial, of whom 31 provided blood samples for pre-surgery iron and ferritin analyses, and who constituted the analysis population.

Two animals died prior to tissue harvest and were excluded from the analyses. The analysis cohort included 88 subjects.

By chance, baseline weight was higher in the control group compared to the two intervention groups, however this difference was maintained over the course of the study and demonstrated no interaction with treatment such that the differences in weights were similar at tissue harvest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p><p id="P7">In bivariate analysis there was a significant <italic>negative</italic> correlation between plasma and myocardial ferritin levels (r<sup>2</sup>=0.113, p=0.004).

Assessment of compartmentalised iron in the cytoplasm and the mitochondria in a sub-sample (n=39) also demonstrated no differences between the groups.</p><p id="P9">Plasma Ferritin concentrations were not different between Controls and Iron Deficient groups but were significantly higher in the IV Iron group versus the Control group; MD 566ng/ml, (257, 874), p&lt;0.0001, and versus the Iron Deficient group; MD 633ng/mL, (329, 937), p&lt;0.0001. Myocardial Ferritin concentrations normalised for total protein were significantly lower in the Iron Deficient group versus Controls; MD -448ng/mL, (-184, -713), p=0.018.

However, Intravenous Iron resulted in significantly higher activity of Complex III; MD 85.8 nmol/min/kg, (23.6, 1481), p=0.010, and Complex IV; MD 59.5 nmol/min/kg, (4.6, 1144), p=0.043, compared to Iron Deficient subjects. Intravenous Iron also resulted in significantly increased Complex III activity; MD 136.6 nmol/min/kg, (76.2, 1970), p&lt;0.0001 versus Controls and significantly reduced Complex I activity versus Controls; MD -32.0 nmol/min/kg, (-6.2, -70.3), p=0.049. There was no difference between the groups with respect to levels of mitochondrial complex mRNA expression.

This was reversed following IV iron administration; IV Iron-Iron Deficient MD IRP1 binding -2374 AU, (392, -5140), p=0.033 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P12">In adults undergoing cardiac surgery, of whom 71% were iron deficient as defined by plasma ferritin &lt;30ng/mL, there was a significant <italic>positive</italic> correlation between plasma and myocardial ferritin. No correlations were observed for other measures of iron metabolism. People with iron deficiency had significantly lower myocardial ferritin levels than those without iron deficiency, however there were no differences between the groups for other measures.</p><p id="P13">In the mouse study, there was a significant <italic>negative</italic> correlation between plasma and myocardial ferritin. No correlations were observed for other measures. There were no differences between the subgroups with respect to plasma or myocardial total iron. Dietary iron deficiency significantly reduced plasma ferritin compared to controls but there was no significant effect on plasma or myocardial iron or ferritin levels or on the expression or function of mitochondrial respiratory complexes. Iron deficient diets resulted in reduced binding affinity of myocardial IRP1 to the 5’ mRNA IRE for Ferritin mRNA. Intravenous iron administration in the setting of dietary iron deficiency had no effect on total plasma or total myocardial iron levels but had divergent effects on plasma (increased) and myocardial (decreased) ferritin. Intravenous iron increased availability of iron sulphur clusters (increased IRP1 binding affinity) and increased activity of mitochondrial complexes III and IV versus Iron Deficient mice.</p><p id="P14">This study has two significant findings. First, we demonstrated no differences in plasma total iron between iron deficient and non-iron deficient subjects whether mice or humans, or any correlation between plasma and myocardial total iron levels in mice and humans. In contrast, plasma and myocardial ferritin were significantly reduced in iron deficient subjects (both in mice and humans). The correlation between plasma and myocardial iron was positive in humans and negative in mice. This may be explained by the absence of an iron replacement group in the human study and the apparently paradoxical increase in plasma ferritin and simultaneous reduction in myocardial ferritin in mice who received intravenous iron. The reasons for this last finding are not clear from the current results. The Iron deficient diet did alter myocardial iron metabolism in mice; reductions in myocardial ferritin and low binding affinity of IRP1 to the 5’ mRNA IRE for Ferritin mRNA are evidence of reductions in the labile iron pool that is manifest as availability of iron sulphur clusters (ISC). IRP1 is a key regulator of cellular iron metabolism. In the presence of ISC excess, ISC bind to IRP1 increasing its affinity for the 5’ UTR IRE on Ferritin mRNA promoting translation, ferritin synthesis, and iron sequestration. Conversely, in iron deficiency, when ISC availability is low IRP no longer has affinity for ferritin mRNA but instead has affinity for the 3’ UTR for Transferrin Receptor 1 mRNA, promoting its translation and iron influx into cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Counterintuitively, we showed that increased IRP1 binding affinity for Ferritin heavy chain mRNA after IV iron was associated with a reduction in Myocardial Ferritin levels. To our knowledge, no similar study has reported myocardial ferritin in iron deficiency and 48-72hrs after IV iron administration for comparison. Here we hypothesise that other unmeasured suppressors of ferritin transcription such as oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] from acute influx of labile iron via L- and T-calcium channels as reported in a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] as a possible explanation. We did not detect mtDNA damage, a marker of mitochondrial oxidative stress, in our study however we did not measure oxidative stress across other cellular compartments, and multiple previous studies have demonstrated systemic and cellular oxidative stress post IV iron administration in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P15">Second, intravenous iron increased mitochondrial complex activity above that of iron replete controls. These changes were associated with indirect evidence of increased ISC availability as increased binding affinity for the 5’ mRNA IRE for Ferritin mRNA. Paradoxically, and for reasons that are unclear, the effects of IV iron were greatest on Complexes III and IV, whereas Complex I and Complex II and to a lesser extent Complex III are the most dependent on ISC for their function. Together, these observations support previous work demonstrating cardiac specific iron regulation that is not reflected by plasma markers of iron metabolism and identify the ongoing need for better research on the effect of iron deficiency and iron replacement on cellular iron metabolism in myocardial disease.</p><p id="P16">The study has three important limitations. First, the analysis did not directly measure the labile iron pool in mouse hearts which is a major determinant of cellular iron metabolism. We attempted to measure ISC levels in myocardium using an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy Technique, however this was not reproducible. Direct measurement of ISC has previously chiefly been reported only in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Our experience highlights the likely value of novel functional or imaging biomarkers of cellular iron metabolism and labile iron in myocardium for future research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p id="P17">Second, the time points for tissue and blood analyses after iron administration used in this study (48-72 hours) are likely to have missed important acute changes in iron metabolism in blood and tissue. While we did not see any differences when comparing the 48- or 72-hours groups separately as a sensitivity analysis, Lakhal-Littleton and colleagues have shown that intravenous iron results in acute increases in myocardial iron concentrations within one hour of administration in parallel with acute rises in plasma and myocardial total iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Myocardial iron homeostatic mechanisms may therefore have normalised total cellular iron levels by 48-72 hours. In the Lakhal-Littleton study total myocardial iron concentrations were persistently higher at up to 42 days following intravenous iron versus iron deficient controls, whereas they were no different between groups at 48-72 hours in the current analyses. This difference may have been attributable to the slightly different design of the former study, where IV iron was administered at the start of the iron deficient diet, allowing myocardial uptake of RE delivered iron in the absence of dietary iron over the 42-day course of the study.</p><p id="P18">The third and major limitation is that dysregulated iron metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in myocardial diseases such as heart failure occur in the setting of inflammation and biological ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. The expression of Ferritin, and the major iron regulator hepcidin are increased by a number of inflammatory pathways including IL6-JAK2-STAT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Pre-surgery IL6 levels in the human participants were low, and there was little evidence of systemic inflammation manifest as high ferritin in the absence of other factors, in the mouse study. Therefore, our findings may not be generalisable to the spectrum of dysregulated iron metabolism across myocardial disease.</p><p id="P19">Furthermore, there were important differences in the plasma ferritin levels, and in myocardial ferritin levels between mice and humans. Ferritin plasma levels in humans were 5-150 ng/ml whereas in mice the range was 700-4000 ng/ml, and atrial tissue ferritin was 350-1800 ng/ml in humans while myocardial tissue ferritin ranged between 1500-4000 ng/ml in mice. The former may be explained by multiple factors including age and comorbidity of the study subjects. In the latter case atrial iron levels in humans were compared to ventricular iron levels in mice which introduces further potential for heterogeneity. In mitigation, the associations between plasma and tissue iron indices were similar for both species. This represents a strength of the study despite differences in absolute concentration between species.</p><p id="P20">In the current study, plasma and myocardial ferritin levels were positively correlated in humans and negatively correlated in mice. Otherwise, changes in myocardial specific regulation of iron metabolism across iron replete, deficiency, and replacement states were not demonstrated by changes in plasma biomarkers of iron metabolism. Together, these results provide insights into the negative results of trials of iron replacement in people with cardiovascular disease and iron deficiency as defined by plasma biomarkers. The results support the wider use of novel tissue imaging and biomarker measures of tissue labile iron and molecular analyses of cellular responses to iron administration in human studies.</p></sec><sec id="S6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Human Study</title><p id="P21">Human data was obtained from participants in the VALCARD trial (NCT03825250), a dose finding randomised controlled trial of sodium valproate pre-cardiac surgery.

The protein expression data was normalised to the total amount of protein loaded in the wells using the Ponceau S Staining Solution (A40000279, Fisher Scientific, USA)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The DNS sequences of the oligonucleotides used for the RNA probes are as follows:</p><sec id="S18"><title>IRE probe</title><p id="P47">Forward primer: TTAAATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCCAGAGTCGCCGCGGTTTCCTGCTTCAACAG</p><p id="P48">Reverse Primer: TGCTTGAACGGAACCCGGTGCTCGACCCCT</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>GAPDH probe</title><p id="P49">Forward Primer: TTAAATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCGGATCCCCTGCTGGGAGGGGGCAGGG</p><p id="P50">Reverse Primer: GACCTGTTCCCACCGTGTGC</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>T7 promoter</title><p id="P51">AATTTAATACGACTCACTATAGG</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="P52">The data obtained in this study was analysed using SPSS 23.0 software (IBM, San Diego, California, USA). Raw data were presented as Median (Interquartile Ranges). Spearman correlation coefficients were estimated between blood and myocardial measures of iron metabolism and mitochondrial function. Subgroup analyses considered VALCARD participants with pre-surgery plasma ferritin &lt;30ng/mL versus ≥30ng/mL, or individual treatment groups in the mouse study. To determine the significance of the differences between the examined subgroups, one-way Kruskal-Wallis was used. Intergroup treatment effects were expressed as Mean Difference (MD) and (95% Confidence Intervals). Pairwise subgroup comparisons were considered significant if the two-sided p value &lt;0.05, with Bonferroni adjustment where required.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>supplementary material</label><media xlink:href="EMS200011-supplement-supplementary_material.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d23aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S22"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to funding bodies enabling the performance of this research as well as the research and administrative staff supporting this work.</p><p>The authors are also grateful to Prof Samira Lakhal-Littleton for her helpful comments on the manuscript.</p><sec id="S23"><title>Funding</title><p>The study was supported by British Heart Foundation Grants RG/17/9/32812, CH/12/1/29419, e and the Leicester NIHR Biomedical Research Centre (Cardiovascular)</p></sec></ack><sec id="S24" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability statement</title><p id="P53">All data discussed in this study is presented in the form of tables and figures within the study or in the supplementary material.
