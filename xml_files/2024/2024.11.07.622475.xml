Heterozygous variants resulting in <italic>PAX6</italic> haploinsufficiency are the main genetic cause of congenital aniridia, characterized by both anterior and posterior ocular defects and sight loss. The extra-ocular features of <italic>PAX6</italic> haploinsufficiency are becoming more widely recognised, with systemic manifestations like obesity, diabetes, and neurological/behavioural disorders being reported. In this study, we uncovered the metabolomic profile of the blood plasma from 25 <italic>PAX6</italic>-related aniridia patients compared to gender and age-matched controls. We found significant disruptions in lipid and energy metabolism, increased oxidative stress and neurotransmitters imbalances, as well as alterations linked to the gut microbiome. This study identified novel metabolic changes associated with <italic>PAX6</italic> haploinsufficiency, providing evidence for the systemic aetiology of congenital aniridia and emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary management and further exploration into ocular and systemic therapeutic approaches.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">The paired box gene 6, <italic>PAX6</italic>, encodes a transcription factor essential for the development of the eye, pancreas and central nervous system (CNS). Biallelic variants in <italic>PAX6</italic> (OMIM #607108) usually lead to embryonic death but pathogenic heterozygous variants predominantly result in loss of the mutated transcript, leading to <italic>PAX6</italic> haploinsufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. <italic>PAX6</italic> haploinsufficiency is the underlying mechanism behind the pan-ocular disease aniridia (OMIM # 106210), typically characterised by congenital iris hypoplasia, foveal hypoplasia and nystagmus, with later onset of cataracts, glaucoma and corneal opacities, resulting in significant vision loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Aniridia can occur in isolation or as part of the Wilms tumour, Aniridia, Genitourinary abnormalities and mental Retardation (WAGR) syndrome (OMIM # 194072), which results from larger deletions encompassing <italic>PAX6</italic> and neighbour gene <italic>WT1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. A form of WAGR syndrome that includes obesity (named WAGRO, OMIM # 612469) has been described in patients where deletions also encompass the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene, <italic>BDNF</italic>, involved in energy homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. <italic>BDNF</italic> haploinsufficiency correlates with increased appetite and higher Body Mass Index (BMI) in both mice and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Ocular phenotypes in aniridia patients, albeit highly variable, have been thoroughly described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]; systemic manifestations however, have been poorly characterised, despite growing evidence revealing the majority of patients also present with neuronal and/or endocrine abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. PAX6 plays a vital role in pancreatic development, being necessary for the formation of islets cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Accordingly, mice carrying islet-specific Pax6 inactivation are born with reduced number of α, β, and δ cells and die soon after birth with severe diabetic phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Post-natally, Pax6 acts on maintaining the identity and function of mature islet cells and lack of expression results in a severe decrease in insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Metabolic issues reported in aniridia patients include obesity, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Several studies have shown that patients have increased proinsulin levels and altered proinsulin/insulin and proinsulin/ C-peptide ratios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. These observations were recapitulated in mice with the heterozygous <italic>Pax6</italic> p.(Arg266*) stop mutation, which showed altered proinsulin processing and defect in glucose metabolism due to prohormone convertase 1/3 deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>].</p><p id="P5">Pax6 has a crucial role in establishing early brain territories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. It is expressed in both embryonic and adult neural stem cells, contributing to neurogenesis in the postnatal brain, where it is also expressed in the olfactory bulb, cerebellum and amygdala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Structural abnormalities found in patients include pineal gland hypoplasia, absence or abnormalities in olfactory gland, anterior commissure or corpus callosum (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]). Consequently, patients can suffer from sleep disturbances and circadian rhythm alterations, neurodevelopmental disorders like autism or ADHD, depression, anxiety or auditory processing disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Similar to ocular phenotypes, there is a high variability of systemic manifestations seen in aniridia patients, with no clear genotype-phenotype correlations established. Also, no preventive treatments are available due to the lack of comprehensive analysis of these manifestations. Uncovering biomarkers for the identification of early stage metabolic abnormalities would therefore be fundamental to understand phenotypic differences and manage disease comorbidities.</p><p id="P7">Metabolomic analysis of human plasma has increasingly been used to elucidate disease mechanisms and allow the identification of novel biomarkers on a growing number of ocular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. The aim of this study is therefore to characterise the metabolomic profile of aniridia patients and uncover the systemic consequences of <italic>PAX6</italic> haploinsufficiency. We identified strong signals from metabolites associated with oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, neuroactivity and links to the microbiome. Our findings reinforce the aetiology of aniridia as a systemic disorder, propose novel targets and mechanisms linked to <italic>PAX6</italic> haploinsufficiency and explore possible therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><label>1</label><title>Cohort description</title><p id="P8">Twenty-five patients from 18 independent families clinically and molecularly diagnosed with aniridia caused by pathogenic <italic>PAX6</italic> variants were included in this study, together with 25 age and gender-matched unaffected individuals.

Two aniridia patients with variants leading to C-terminal extension (CTE) of the PAX6 protein were also included.

Severity of secondary manifestations appeared to correlate with age and included presence of glaucoma (8/25), lens opacities/cataracts (19/25) and aniridia-related keratopathy (22/25). Interestingly, one patient was also diagnosed with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia.</p><p id="P11">Extraocular phenotypes were documented in all but 5 patients, but no correlation to the mutation type was seen. Obesity (BMI ≥30) was reported in 11/25. Gastrointestinal issues were also reported including gastric reflux in 2/25, irritable bowel syndrome in 2/25 and constipation in 1/25. Neurological issues such as anxiety (3/25), headaches and migraines (4/25), central auditory processing disorders (3/25), depression (2/25), seizures including functional seizures (2/25) and sleep disturbances (1/25) were also described. Structural abnormalities of the brain were present in 2/25. Learning difficulties were identified in three children, while one child was diagnosed with autism and two other were diagnosed with ADHD. Other systemic features reported included fibromyalgia (2/25), abdominal hernias (2/25), hypertension (2/25), eczema (1/25) and hypothyroidism (1/25).

Because significant BMI differences were detected between aniridia and control groups, ANCOVA co-variate analysis was performed to assess the statistical significance of altered metabolites considering the two variates: “group” (control or aniridia patient) and “BMI” (Body max index). Through this analysis, 99 compounds were found significantly altered (p ≤ 0.05) between groups, with 53 compounds increased and 46 decreased in aniridia vs control samples.

Importantly, aspartate levels are decreased in the aniridia group (FC 0.81, p&lt;0.05), coupled with accumulation of downstream metabolite N-acetylaspartate (NAA) (FC 1.17, p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). NAA is the precursor of N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), one of the most prevalent neurotransmitters in humans; however, NAAG levels were not significantly changed (FC 0.95, p=0.5)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>).

Most patients with pathogenic heterozygous <italic>PAX6</italic> variants present with typical isolated aniridia, but a broad range of associated systemic clinical features co-exist. The effect of reduced <italic>PAX6</italic> levels on the metabolic function of aniridia patients has been poorly characterised. This study presents the first comprehensive metabolomic analysis of aniridia patients with molecularly confirmed <italic>PAX6</italic> haploinsufficiency, providing extensive evidence of plasma biomarkers associated with oxidative stress, insulin resistance and overall metabolic deregulation, as well as oxidative stress and neurotransmitter imbalance.</p><p id="P32">The metabolomic plasma profile of aniridia patients evidenced increased oxidative stress responses and redox dysregulation. In aniridia, metabolites upstream of glutathione synthesis like cystine, alpha-ketobutyrate or cysteine-S-sulphate were found in high levels and several downstream glutathione derivatives like cysteine-glutathione disulfide and gamma glutamyl amino acids were decreased. This imbalance points to a higher demand for glutathione, consistent with increased oxidative stress. Levels of taurine and its precursor hypotaurine are also reduced in our aniridia cohort; taurine is produced from cysteine and acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter with neuroprotective and antioxidant properties crucial for brain and eye development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Topical taurine showed significant antioxidant effect and prevented ocular surface damage in rabbit model of dry eye disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. Aside from the antioxidant properties described above, taurine is also involved in bile acid biosynthesis and can stimulate insulin release, which also seem affected in our cohort (discussed below) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Altered plasma taurine levels have been associated with neurological disorders like depression, schizophrenia or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but also with metabolic diseases like hypertension, obesity, or hypothyroidism, most of which were described in our aniridia cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]. Accordingly, taurine supplementation showed promising benefits against several of these diseases, so its therapeutic potential for aniridia patients should be assessed (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>]).</p><p id="P33">The cornea is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress due to its superficial location and exposure to external insults e.g. UV light, and deficient management of oxidative stress is one of the pathomechanisms behind several corneal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>]. <italic>Pax6</italic> heterozygous mice corneal cells showed decreased expression of <italic>glutathione-S-transferase</italic> and are more susceptible to stress, which can be ameliorated by treatment with glutathione [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Furthermore, in the brain, Pax6 was shown to bind to promoters of <italic>SOD1</italic> and <italic>CAT</italic> genes, which code for two important reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>]. The regulatory effect of PAX6 in the expression of ROS scavengers may therefore be expanded to the extra-ocular tissues, which could explain the altered oxidative stress markers found in patients plasma.</p><p id="P34">Nicotinamide (NAM) is essential for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) production and is decreased in aniridia patients, pointing to overall redox disruption. Levels of NAM-derivative NAD+ are decreased in a mouse model of glaucoma, where authors proposed it would cause mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in increased ROS and DNA damage within retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Furthermore, oral supplementation with NAM not only prevented but also improved RGCs survival and inner retinal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. Similar results were shown in humans, where NAM levels were significantly lower in the plasma of 34 primary open-angle glaucoma patients and, recently, a clinical trial with 57 glaucoma patients showed improved inner retinal function in 23% patients after oral NAM supplementation, suggesting its use as a future therapeutic strategy for glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>]. Up to two thirds of aniridia patients develop glaucoma by late childhood or early adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]; in our cohort, 32% (8/25) of patients were diagnosed with glaucoma. Nicotinamide supplementation could be considered in aniridia as it may delay glaucoma development/ progression. Further metabolites found in common with other metabolomics glaucoma studies include decreased spermine, increased acetylcarnitine and increased decenoylcarnitine levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>].</p><p id="P35">Phosphoetanolamines-derived plasmalogens (PLsEth) and lysoplasmalogens were largely reduced in our aniridia cohort, also potentially contributing to the altered oxidative stress status. PLsEth are very prevalent in brain myelin and the lens, where levels tend to reduce with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. In fact, congenital cataracts are a key symptom in patients with defects in plasmalogen synthesis, like Zellweger syndrome or Rhizomelic Chondrodysplasia Punctata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. PAX6 deficiency is associated with cataract formation, with up to 85% of aniridia patients developing early onset lens opacities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]; in our cohort, 75% (19/25) of patients had cataracts/lens opacities. Assessing whether plasma PLsEth levels correlate with those in the cataract lens would establish the potential of it being a biomarker for cataract formation/ severity in aniridia patients.</p><p id="P36">Overall lysophospholipids (Lyso-PLs) were decreased in aniridia plasma. Choline-derived Lyso-PLs have been identified as negative predictor of Type 2 diabetes progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>], and accordingly, several were significantly decreased in aniridia patients. Lower Lyso-PLs may also reflect altered activity of phospholipase A2, which cleaves phospholipids generating Lyso-PL and a free fatty acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. Increased phospholipase A2 has been associated with inflammation, schizophrenia or autism but no link to PAX6 has been reported to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>].</p><p id="P37">Plasma levels of several dicarboxylic and hydroxy FAs were increased in AN plasma. Dicarboxylic acids are produced via omega-oxidation in the peroxisomes and have been shown to accumulate when there are disruptions in mitochondrial beta-oxidation. FA hydroxylation is mostly performed by a family of enzymes termed cytochromes P450s during lipid oxidation. P450s are monooxygenases that also oxidize steroids and xenobiotics, and are important for hormone synthesis and breakdown. Cytochrome P4501B1 (CYP1B1) has functions in adipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation and is the only P450s member we found with known relation to PAX6, as it has been reported <italic>Cyp1b1</italic> proximal promoter contains an alternative binding site for Pax6 in mice adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>CYP1B1</italic> is also essential for eye development, with mutations causing primary congenital glaucoma (OMIM # 231300) and anterior segment dysgenesis/ Peters Anomaly (OMIM # 617315) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>].</p><p id="P38">Our results therefore suggest that PAX6 haploinsufficiency may impact beta and omega oxidation processes in mitochondria. Altered metabolites associated with both processes may suggest that aniridia patients have some alteration to the pathway of lipid oxidation, which, combined with redox abnormalities, may extend to overall mitochondrial function. However, omega-oxidation and some beta-oxidation also take place in peroxisomes. In fact, lower plasmalogens and altered bile acid metabolism are also found in peroxisomal disorders as well as several other altered compounds linked to peroxisomal disorders: 7-alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoate (7-Hoca), increased 3-Hydroxysebacic and 3-Hydroxydecanedioic acids. We therefore hypothesize that the links to mitochondrial dysfunction in aniridia patients can also expand to (or derive from?) the peroxisome. However, it must be mentioned that these results may be affected by differences in the fasting/fed state of the subjects at the time of blood draw.</p><p id="P39">Further metabolic changes in AN patients plasma include increased presence of ketone bodies acetoacetate and BHBA, which suggest a tendency for metabolic acidosis. Accordingly, markers of inborn error of metabolism diseases linked to aciduria, such as isovaleric aciduria (OMIM #243500) or medium chain acylCoA dehydrogenase deficiency (OMIM #201450), were found increased in the aniridia cohort, i.e 3-hydroxy FAs and methylsuccinate. Although symptoms and levels described in patients with the aforementioned metabolic diseases were more severe than observed in the AN cohort, these results suggest that aniridia patients may require monitoring for acidemia symptoms.</p><p id="P40">Ketogenesis can be upregulated by hormones such as glucagon or cortisol; however, insulin is the main hormonal regulator of this process, suggesting an altered insulin state in aniridia patients included in this study. PAX6 plays an essential role in pancreas development and in the continuous regulation of insulin and glucagon synthesis in adulthood. <italic>Pax6</italic> deletion in mice pancreatic β cells caused increase in glucagon and ghrelin hormone levels but decrease in insulin, resulting in hyperglycemia and severe ketosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>].</p><p id="P41">In a recent retrospective analysis of 86 aniridia patients, we showed that 13% of patients were diagnosed with T2D, which is double the UK prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. However, clinically diagnosed diabetics were excluded from this study. Nonetheless, several metabolites associated with T2D were significantly altered in the AN group, such as increased acylcarnitines, a trend towards increases in cysteine, accumulation of ketone bodies and increased bile acids, which suggest most patients could already be in an insulin resistance/ prediabetic stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>]. Plasma long-chain saturated FAs (C14:0, C16:0 and C18:0) may induce insulin resistance and are considered risk factors for T2D and metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>]. Decreased plasmalogens are also associated with increased lipid oxidation and lower Pls-Etn levels have been detected in patients with metabolic syndrome, T1D and T2D, and hyperlipidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>].</p><p id="P42">Bile acids (BA) are important modulators of lipid and glucose metabolism, and increased levels have been found in plasma of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and in serum of T2D patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">65</xref>]. For example, taurolithocholate 3-sulphate, which was over 2-fold increased in our aniridia cohort, was found to induce insulin resistance in <italic>in vitro</italic> rat hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">66</xref>]. It is thought that BA sulphation is a counterbalance mechanism to alleviate BA accumulation by increasing BA solubility and excretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">67</xref>]. Increased BA sulphation is present in cholestasis, characterised by decreased bile flow, resulting in BA accumulation, increased ROS and hepatocytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. However, the clinical consequences of high BA levels in aniridia are unclear but these results seem to point out the need for patients to be monitored for regular liver function tests.</p><p id="P43">Gut microbiome alterations in aniridia patients should also be considered. Secondary BA are produced by modification of primary BA by the gut microbiota and were particularly elevated in AN plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. Furthermore, indoles are gut microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolites and are suggested to exert significant biological effects and contribute to the aetiology of cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychiatric diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R68">68</xref>]. A trend towards a decrease of indole lactate and increased indole-3-carboxylate was identified in AN plasma; indole-3-lactate has known anti-inflammatory properties and Indole-3-carboxylate was detected in uremic patients and has been found elevated in patients with liver diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">70</xref>]. However, the exact role of this compound is not known yet.</p><p id="P44">Serotonin is a hormone and neurotransmitter that regulates sleep, mood and behaviour also derived from tryptophan metabolism. Although its levels seem reduced in AN patients plasma, no statistical significance was achieved after ANCOVA analysis, pointing to serotonin levels being likely more associated with BMI. Accordingly, several reports show that reduced plasma serotonin is related to obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes and metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>]. Other metabolites altered in aniridia patients plasma but associated to obesity/high BMI via ANCOVA analysis included decreased asparagine, increased carnitine and decreased uracil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">77</xref>]. PAX6 role in endocrine pancreas function and in regulation of energy metabolism has been the accepted reason behind the increased BMI detected in many aniridia patients. However, other players and mechanisms could be considered. WAGRO is a form of syndromic aniridia caused by contiguous deletion of <italic>PAX6, WT1</italic> and <italic>BDNF</italic> genes and is characterised by aniridia, Wilms tumour, genitourinary anomalies and mental retardation as well as obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. Variants affecting <italic>BDNF</italic> are associated with obesity and hyperphagia, with reduced BDNF levels correlating with higher BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Pax6 was shown to bind to a <italic>Bdnf</italic> promoter in the mouse brain and Bdnf plasma levels appeared to correlate with brain levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">78</xref>]. The increased BMI in our aniridia group could therefore also be (at least partially) explained by a more direct PAX6-BDNF relationship, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet elucidated. WAGRO patients were not included in this study, but it would be interesting to measure BDNF levels in blood from isolated aniridia patients to understand if <italic>PAX6</italic> haploinsufficiency results in direct reduction of BDNF levels.</p><p id="P45">Several neuroactive metabolites were also significantly changed in aniridia plasma samples compared to the controls. Aspartate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter and can be decreased in depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R79">79</xref>]. N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is one of the most prevalent neurotransmitters in humans and is synthesized from aspartate and acetyl-coenzyme A in neuronal mitochondria, being important for myelin lipid synthesis. Elevated NAA levels are markers for Canavan disease (OMIM #271900), a neurodegenerative disease caused by autosomal recessive mutations in <italic>ASPA</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">81</xref>]. There is no known relation between PAX6 and NAA but <italic>ASPA</italic> as well as <italic>ASNS</italic>, which produces asparagine from aspartate, are known targets of PAX6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R82">82</xref>] and patients can show vision impairment caused by optic atrophy (although optic nerve hypoplasia and retinal degeneration similar to RP have been described) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">84</xref>]. NAA downstream metabolite N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) seems unchanged in aniridia patients. However, levels of β-citrylglutamate, a structural analog of NAAG produced from citrate by the same enzyme, NAAGS, seem reduced. We hypothesize there could be a diversion of NAAGS activity to maintain NAAG levels at the expense of β-citrylglutamate. The biological relevance of β-citrylglutamate is still largely unexplored, but it is found in high levels in the developing brain, testes and eye, where it seems required for differentiation of lens epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R85">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>]. This compound could therefore have a role in the development of cataracts in aniridia patients.</p><p id="P46">Numerous proteins and enzymes in the pathways and processes described in this study, i.e. lipid oxidation, plasmalogen synthesis, bile acid and redox metabolism, are regulated by a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors called Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Based on the current evidence, it could be suggested that the metabolic defects identified in AN patients could be caused not only by the PAX6 defective role in pancreas and insulin production directly but also through PPAR (or even mutual) deregulation. PPAR gamma (PPARγ) was shown to interact with PAX6 in the regulation of glucagon gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref>]. Interestingly, altered <italic>PPARγ</italic> expression also induced an ocular phenotype in octopus, where both overexpression and knockdown inhibited <italic>pax6</italic> expression causing small eye phenotype and lens opacities (microencephaly and enlarged trunk was also described) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref>]. Also, expression of <italic>PPARγ</italic> was shown to be downregulated in aniridia patients’ and <italic>PAX6-</italic>edited limbal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R92">92</xref>]. Although further elucidation between PAX6 and PPARs is required, It would be interesting to test the potential of PPAR agonists, particularly PPARγ, in improving the systemic metabolic (and perhaps also ocular) alterations seen in aniridia patients.</p><p id="P47">Another interesting therapeutic approach could be amlexanox, We have recently shown that this compound can increase PAX6 levels in aniridia patient-derived retinal and corneal cell models through its nonsense suppression properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R93">93</xref>]. Notably, amlexanox has also been shown to improve dyslipidemia and target bile acid synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R94">94</xref>] and its use ameliorated insulin resistance and obesity phenotypes in both mice and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R96">96</xref>].</p><p id="P48">To conclude, this study provides novel insights into the systemic derangements behind <italic>PAX6</italic> haploinsufficiency, and proposes unexplored molecular mechanisms that can ultimately improve clinical care of these patients.

Nonetheless, we identified several limitations to this study that may have affected the group separation. Firstly, whilst ocular findings are clinically acquired through examination, extra-ocular findings in our patient and control cohort are dependent on self-reporting. This may result in an under-reporting of systemic/extra-ocular conditions which are either unreported by the patient or not diagnosed as the patient has not sought medical investigations; for example, hypertension, depression, diabetes and pre-diabetes are often symptomless and unless actively investigated may not be known to the patient. Next, the wide span of ages within the study, which we tried to solve by including age-matched controls. Also, blood samples were collected from non-fasting individuals, the vast majority in the mornings but in a few cases, due to proband availability, samples were collected in the afternoon. A significant challenge of this study comes from the ocular and systemic phenotypic heterogeneity present within the aniridia patients, which is naturally present in <italic>PAX6</italic>-related disease. We could not control the effects of medication that both patients and controls were on, and understanding how these may somehow mask or contribute to some metabolomic signals would be helpful.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S15" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S16"><title>Ethics, Consent and Permission</title><p id="P50">Patients with a confirmed molecular diagnosis of PAX6-aniridia were identified from the Moorfields Eye Hospital Inherited Eye Disease Database (Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK).
