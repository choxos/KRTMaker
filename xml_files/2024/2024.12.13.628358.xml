We have previously demonstrated that interference of the human tetraspanin, CD9, can reduce adherence of multiple species of bacteria to epithelial cells by approximately 50%. However, CD9 does not act as a receptor and is responsible for organising and clustering partner proteins commandeered by bacteria for efficient adherence. CD9 can organise numerous host proteins at the cell membrane but the full interactome has not been delineated. Here, using a novel CD9 proximity-labelling model, we demonstrate a vast and diverse CD9 interactome with 845 significantly enriched proteins associated with CD9 over four hours. These putative proximal proteins were associated with various cellular pathways including cell adhesion, ECM-receptor interactions, endocytosis, SNARE interactions and adherens and tight junctions. Significant and known interactors of CD9 were enriched including Î²1 integrins and major immunoglobulin superfamily members but also included several known bacterial adherence receptors including CD44, CD46 and CD147. We further demonstrate dynamism of the interactome during infection at three separate time points with two different bacterial species, <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. During meningococcal infection, 13 unique proximal proteins associated with CD9 were significantly enriched across four hours compared to uninfected cells. However, upon staphylococcal infection far fewer enriched proximal proteins were identified demonstrating that different bacteria require different host factors during CD9-mediated bacterial adherence. Transient knockdown of CD44 and CD147, candidate receptor proteins identified in our screen, significantly reduced staphylococcal and meningococcal adherence respectively. This effect was ablated in the absence of CD9 or if epithelial cells were treated with a CD9-derived peptide demonstrating the association of these proteins during staphylococcal and meningococcal adherence. We demonstrate for the first time the CD9 interactome of epithelial cells and that bacteria hijack these interactions to efficiently adhere to epithelial cells. This process is bacterial species specific, recruiting several different proteins during infection but a host-derived peptide is able to interfere with this process. We have therefore developed a tool that can measure changes within the CD9 interactome after cellular challenge, established a mechanism in which CD9 is used as a universal organiser of bacterial adhesion platforms and demonstrated that this process can be stopped using a CD9-derived peptide.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Tetraspanin</kwd><kwd>CD9</kwd><kwd>proximity labelling</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd><italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>epithelial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Tetraspanins are a superfamily of transmembrane proteins, consisting of 33 members in humans, that are classically characterised by four transmembrane domains (TM1-TM4), a small extracellular loop (EC1), a large extracellular loop (EC2), along with short intracellular N- and C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>). Sequence and structural divergence within the extracellular loops and the intracellular domains, especially within the C-terminus, provides a unique function for each tetraspanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). A key characteristic of tetraspanins is their ability to associate with various membrane proteins, including integrins, proteoglycans and immunoglobulin superfamily members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), to form molecular complexes known as tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). TEMs are involved in myriad biological processes, including cell adhesion, migration and signalling, and have been identified as a route of infection for many viral and bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Recent studies have implicated tetraspanins in various bacterial adherence pathways, including those of pathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>) and <italic>Mycobacterium abscessus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>). In most cases, the tetraspanins themselves do not act as the bacterial receptor but coordinate organisation and clustering of receptors that allow for bacterial adherence, suggesting the composition of the TEM is important for initial bacterial attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). For example, CD9 promotes <italic>S. aureus</italic> adherence to epithelial cells through organisation of the syndecans, allowing recruitment of fibronectin to create an optimal adhesive platform for the bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). However, each bacterial species that exploits tetraspanin-mediated adherence co-opt different receptors during cellular invasion but the tetraspanins have been demonstrated to associate with many of these membrane proteins.</p><p id="P5"><italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen able to cause invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), uses various bacterial adhesins to adhere to many different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). The canonical adherence pathway consists of an initial interaction between type IV pili and either CD147 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) or potentially CD46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). From here, an intimate association occurs after interaction of the opacity proteins (Opa) with either heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs) or CEACAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>). Similarly, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, a common human commensal which can also cause multiple infectious diseases including pneumonia, osteomyelitis and infective endocarditis, utilises a plethora of adhesins to associate with multiple host cell receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). Perhaps the most studied of these is the interaction of the staphylococcal fibronectin binding proteins to fibronectin which is utilised as a âbridgeâ with Î±5Î²1 integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Still, several other pathways have been investigated and include co-opting host receptors such as CD36, desmoglein 1 and annexin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>). The tetraspanin CD9 has previously been demonstrated to associate with various integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), HSPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), immunoglobulin superfamily members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>), CD36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>) and CD46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>) in the formation of TEMs.</p><p id="P6">Here, we utilise proximity labelling to characterise the CD9 interactome on epithelial cells and demonstrate that different CD9 associated TEMs are required for infection by different bacteria. We also report dynamism of these TEMs during infection with specific proteins recruited to CD9 associated TEMs over time. Finally, we demonstrate that a CD9-derived peptide can disrupt these interactions and reduce specific bacterial adherence to cells. Disruption of TEMs and therefore disruption of the formation of bacterial cell surface receptor complexes is arising as a promising therapeutic target and could aid in overcoming the growing pressures associated with antimicrobial resistance.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Strains and bacterial growth conditions</title><p id="P7">The <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains used in this study were serogroup B MC58 and SH1000 respectively. <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> solid cultures were grown on brain:heart infusion (BHI; Oxoid, Ltd., UK) agar with 10% Levinthalâs solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>) overnight at 37Â°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, while staphylococcal strains were grown on Luria broth (LB; Oxoid) agar overnight at 37Â°C.

Previously, we have observed that the staphylococcal receptor, syndecan-1, is affected by removal of CD9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Here, we investigate the expression of known meningococcal receptors (CD46, CD147, CEACAM1 and CEACAM6) and a known glycoprotein implicated in staphylococcal adherence (CD44) to epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Analysis of cells by flow cytometry demonstrated that removal of CD9 increased the expression of CD46 (39.64Â±35.0%) and CD147 (149.7Â±97.9%) at the cell membrane, however, these increases were not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>). No significant differences were observed in the percentage of cells expressing our target proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supp. Fig. 1A</xref>). Conversely, decreases were observed by Western blot in CD44 expression after CD9 removal (-49.8Â±16.8%). Expression of CEACAM1 and CEACAM6 was also reduced after CD9 removal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supp. Fig. 1B</xref>). Thus, we have confirmed that removal of tetraspanin CD9 can affect multiple bacterial adherence pathways despite changes in expression in putative receptors.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Efficient labelling of CD9 with TurboID</title><p id="P25">We have demonstrated that CD9 interference can affect very distinct bacterial adherence pathways.

To investigate this, we employed a proximity labelling methodology, fusing CD9 to the promiscuous biotin ligase, TurboID, which allows rapid labelling (1-10 min) and identification of proximal proteins (~10 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). TurboID was fused to the C-terminus of CD9 in line with previous strategies which have tagged CD9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). A flexible linker was added to ensure access to the C-terminus and allow free movement of TurboID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The construct also contains a V5-tag at the TurboID C-terminus as another method of detecting the protein. Stable transfection of A549 WT and CD9<sup>-/-</sup> cells followed by Western blotting revealed that the construct was expressed, with both endogenous CD9 and the CD9 fusion present in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Expression levels of the CD9:TurboID fusion protein were similar to those of the endogenous protein. Efficient biotinylation of a range of proteins at different molecular weights was observed after 10 minutes of addition of biotin to the media of transfected cells in comparison to WT and CD9<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Continued accumulation of biotinylated proteins was observed between 1 to 18 hours. Biotinylated proteins were efficiently pulled down using streptavidin beads from CD9<sup>-/-</sup> transfected cells in comparison to CD9<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>).

CD9 was abundantly expressed on the plasma membrane of WT cells in comparison to CD9<sup>-/-</sup> or isotype control treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Stably transfected CD9<sup>-/-</sup> cells demonstrated a recovery of CD9 expression at the cell surface with both transfected cells and WT cells exhibiting strong expression at intercellular junctions with non-punctate expression patterns. Calcein AM assays were used to test the ability of cells to adhere to fibronectin over time. CD9<sup>-/-</sup> cells demonstrated significantly reduced adherence to fibronectin over one hour (50.0Â±13.4%) compared to WT cells, however, this phenotype was partially rescued through stable transfection with the CD9:TurboID fusion protein (80.9Â±11.0%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). No significant difference was observed in cell adhesion to fibronectin after 24 hours. Epithelial cells were also checked for their ability to accommodate bacterial infection, as we have previously demonstrated that CD9 is important for multiple adherence pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). As expected, both meningococcal (57.7Â±3.5%) and staphylococcal (44.1Â±1.5%) adherence was significantly reduced in the CD9<sup>-/-</sup> cells compared to WT and WT cells transfected with an eGFP construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).

However, in CD9<sup>-/-</sup> cells transfected with the CD9:TurboID construct, both meningococcal (90.0Â±2.6%) and staphylococcal (85.6Â±8.6%) adherence increased similar to levels observed in WT or eGFP transfected WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Interestingly, despite overexpression of CD9 in CD9:TurboID transfected cells, only a small increase was observed in both meningococcal (107.1Â±6.4%) or staphylococcal (114.4+12.8%) adherence.

The most enriched proteins were discoidin (DCBCLD1), an integral membrane protein, at 30 minutes, an adhesion molecule with Ig like domain 2 (AMIGO2), at 60 minutes and TACC2, a cytoplasmic protein associated with centrosomes during the cell cycle, at 240 minutes. Several known CD9 interactors were identified including CD9 itself, several integrins (Î±5 and Î²1), other tetraspanin members (CD151, Tspan15) and immunoglobulin superfamily members including IGSF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supp. Data 1</xref>).

Other expected pathways, such as SNARE interactions, were also observed (30 mins, 5/33; 60 mins, 12/33; 240 mins, 16/33), with numbers of proteins involved with these pathways increasing over time. Despite no infectious challenge, proteins associated with several pathways involved in bacterial or viral infection were identified across all time points (30 mins, 4; 60 mins, 8; 240 mins, 10), with specific correlations to <italic>E. coli</italic> invasion, <italic>Yersinia</italic> infection, Shigellosis and <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supp. Data 2</xref>). Numerous pathways often requisitioned by bacteria during infection were also identified including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, critical in actin remodelling at the plasma membrane during infection, and ECM-receptor interaction, which includes important groups of proteins often commandeered for use during bacterial adherence.

We therefore focused on CD46 and CD147 as putative pilus receptors of the meningococcus and CD44 as a known interactor in various bacterial adherence pathways including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>), Group A Streptococcus (GAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>) and <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>). Using pooled siRNA we demonstrated successful knockdown of each of our target proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). After siRNA-mediated knockdown of these proteins we observed significant reductions in meningococcal adherence to CD147-depleted epithelial cells (56.4Â±3.1%) compared to untreated or non-targeting siRNA treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). CD46 or CD44 knockdown did not impact meningococcal adherence to epithelial cells suggesting the importance of CD147, but not CD46 or CD44. As observed previously, addition of a CD9-derived peptide (800C) to untreated and non-targeting siRNA treated cells significantly reduced meningococcal adherence (45.7Â±3.0% and 47.8Â±3.6% respectively) but no effect was demonstrated after treatment with a scrambled control peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). This significant reduction was also observed in CD46- and CD44-depleted cells. However, no significant reduction was observed between CD147-depleted cells with no peptide treatment and CD147-depleted cells treated with 800C. This suggests no major additive effect of these treatments and that CD147 and CD9 interact within the same pathway during meningococcal adherence. As before, meningococcal adherence to CD9<sup>-/-</sup> cells was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type cells (51.1Â±5.3%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). However, as with all siRNA treatments and peptide treatments, CD147-depletion had no effect on meningococcal adherence in CD9<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>) further suggesting the importance of interaction between these two proteins during tetraspanin-mediated adherence.</p><p id="P35">Similarly, significant reductions were observed in staphylococcal adherence to CD44-depleted cells (50.4Â±3.0%) compared with untreated and non-targeting siRNA treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). However, no effects were demonstrated in CD46- or CD147-depleted epithelial cells suggesting CD44 is important during staphylococcal adherence. Upon addition of 800C, staphylococcal adherence was significantly reduced in untreated cells (47.0Â±5.6%), non-targeting siRNA cells (47.8Â±2.4%), CD46- (42.9Â±4.2%) and CD147-depleted cells (45.6Â±4.9%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Addition of a scrambled control peptide had no effect on any of the siRNA-treated cells. However, no significant reduction in adherence was observed when CD44-depleted cells with no peptide were compared to CD44-depleted cells treated with 800C. As before, this suggests that the interaction between CD44 and CD9 is important during staphylococcal adherence. Staphylococcal adherence was significantly reduced in CD9<sup>-/-</sup> cells compared to wild-type cells but no further reductions were observed with any siRNA or peptide treatments, including CD44-depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). These data further suggest the importance of an interaction between CD9 and CD44 during tetraspanin-mediated staphylococcal adherence. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that known meningococcal and staphylococcal receptors, identified within our CD9 proximal protein screen, are important during tetraspanin-mediated bacterial adherence and that, critically, these proximal proteins differ between the infecting organism but CD9 remains as a universal constant during bacterial adherence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S24" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P36">In this study, we have characterised the CD9 interactome using a proximity labelling approach with the promiscuous biotin ligase, TurboID, fused to CD9.

We have identified several novel and known enriched proximal proteins associated with CD9. Many of these proximal proteins are involved in mammalian cell adhesion and their associated signalling pathways, however, there is also a prevalence for proteins utilised during bacterial adherence and invasion pathways. We demonstrate enrichment and recruitment of specific proteins during meningococcal adherence but not during staphylococcal adherence, suggesting dynamic and mobile CD9 microdomains during tetraspanin-mediated bacterial adherence. Finally, we demonstrate involvement of CD147 and CD44 in CD9-mediated meningococcal and staphylococcal adherence respectively, but not vice versa confirming the requirement for specificity of proximal proteins during tetraspanin-mediated bacterial adherence.</p><p id="P37">Tetraspanins have been observed to interact several partner proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>), however, these studies have often focused on the interaction of the tetraspanin with a specific partner. Various techniques have been used to populate a partial interactome for CD9 and the other tetraspanins including immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), super resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>), single molecule tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>), cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>), yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>) and affinity purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>). However, these techniques often require knowledge of potential tetraspanin interactors, require high levels of expression of the target proteins, struggle to evaluate weak or transient interactions and provide limitations to the screen size. Recently, attempts have been made to broadly define the tetraspanin interactome using proximity labelling techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>). Proximity labelling using TurboID followed by mass spectrometry allows rapid biotinylation of proximal proteins to the target protein, providing a broad interactome over time and after specific challenges to the cell which also considers weak or transient interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>). We have developed a tool to measure the CD9 interactome in epithelial cells by fusing TurboID to the C-terminus of CD9.</p><p id="P38">We believe this is the first study of the broader CD9 interactome by proximity labelling, identifying 845 potential proximal proteins after incubation with exogenous biotin for 4 hours. This included known interactors such as IGSF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>), HSPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), various integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>), metalloproteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>) and other tetraspanins but also several novel interactors involved in signal transduction, transportation and cell migration.

Whilst we observed similar pathways and proteins we also describe enrichment of many tight and adherens junction proteins, perhaps unsurprising considering the canonical localisation of CD9 to the plasma membrane in comparison to CD63 localisation within the lysosome. Surprisingly, we detected enrichment of several extracellular proteins, however, we suspect that a cohort of these proteins are not included within our interactome due to fusion of TurboID to the cytoplasmic tail of CD9. For example, despite the robust presence of cell membrane surface HSPGs, such as syndecan-1 and CD44, within our screen we did not detect any glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, such as the glypicans or specific members of the CEACAM family. However, the lack of enrichment of any CEACAM members, either GPI-anchored or otherwise, suggests that CD9 does not directly associate with these proteins but they may be indirectly associated with the tetraspanin through more transient interactions within the cell membrane. Future studies could focus on CD9-interacting extracellular proteins by utilising new proximity labelling techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>). However, CD9 enrichment of both membrane proteins and effectors associated with cell signalling cascades provides further evidence of the role of CD9 as a coordinator of the plasma membrane but also downstream proteins and cellular processes.</p><p id="P39">We have previously demonstrated that CD9 does not act as a bacterial receptor and that their partner proteins are required for efficient bacterial adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>), similar to viral utilisation of the tetraspanins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Here, we confirmed, through transient knockdown, that two highly enriched CD9 proximal proteins, CD147 and CD44, were associated with CD9-mediated meningococcal and staphylococcal adherence respectively. CD147 is a known meningococcal receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>) whilst CD44 has been demonstrated as a phagocytic receptor of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>) and was recently enriched during a <italic>S. aureus</italic> proximity labelling screen during endothelial cell infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>). This, alongside our previous data that two other significantly enriched proximal proteins, Î±5Î²1 integrin and syndecan-1, are involved in CD9-mediated staphylococcal adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>), suggests that proximity labelling of CD9 proximal proteins enriches numerous candidate proteins during bacterial infection. However, we observed no change in meningococcal adherence after transient knockdown of CD46 suggesting no involvement of this putative receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>) in CD9-mediated bacterial adherence despite enrichment of the protein at both 60 and 240 minutes in uninfected cells.</p><p id="P40">Similar to viral remodelling of TEMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>), we observed dynamism in CD9-enriched microdomains, however, enrichment of cognate partner proteins was aligned with infection by specific bacteria. At all timepoints, infection with meningococci led to more enriched CD9 proximal receptors and downstream effectors than infection with staphylococci. We hypothesise that the required receptors for staphylococcal infection, particularly those required for bacterial adhesion after 30 minutes, are likely within pre-formed CD9-enriched microdomains, and thus its recruitment is less dynamic than during meningococcal infection. For example, we observed high enrichment of both Î±5Î²1 integrin and syndecan-1 within uninfected cells, which are linked to canonical and non-canonical staphylococcal adherence pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>). Although, we note that certain proteins enriched during meningococcal infection (DTX2, DGKD and VAMP7) were also present during staphylococcal infection but just outside the significance threshold. Meningococci possess a robust phase variation mechanism allowing rapid switching of expression states for many virulence factors critical for bacterial adherence allowing association with various host surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of a known effector molecule released by the bacteria to signal for membrane composition changes, and the speed of bacterial adherence within our model, changes in bacterial outer membrane virulence factors could cause shifts within CD9-enriched microdomains over time. Future studies could utilise more targeted proximity labelling techniques, such as the use of APEX or APEXII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>). This may delineate further dynamics within CD9-enriched microdomains as biotinylation begins upon addition of hydrogen peroxide therefore allowing specific timepoints and protein localisation to be addressed, however, the addition of hydrogen peroxide may have a detrimental effect on the bacteria.</p><p id="P41">Our study also enriched proteins involved in pathways utilised by both bacteria and viruses to enter cells and provided similar partner proteins to those previously observed in other tetraspanin studies. For example, during HPV entry to cells CD63 interaction with ALIX, an ESCRT-associated adaptor protein, and syntenin-1, a syndecan binding protein, is critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref>). Interestingly, during meningococcal adherence we observed early enrichment of IST-1, an ESCRT-associated protein, suggesting that membrane remodelling and endocytosis are important for infection. Similarly, the potential recruitment of VAMP7 during both staphylococcal and meningococcal adherence would suggest the involvement of endocytic pathways and survival within the cell, which has been reported within both pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>). Furthermore, the enrichment of CD9 proximal proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation and vesicular transport in this study would suggest traversal and survival within the cell. Conversely, the CD9 interactome also contained several tight and adherens junction proteins. Bacterial induced remodelling of the cell surface, particularly of basolateral proteins involved in tight junctions can promote bacterial traversal, particularly of the blood:brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>). We observed delayed enrichment of NDRG1, with low expression of this protein associated with disruption of tight junctions. The involvement of CD9 proximal proteins in both putative intracellular and paracellular traversal routes and in membrane and cytoskeleton remodelling suggests multiple mechanisms by which bacteria could manipulate tetraspanins for adherence and may explain their involvement in many bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p><p id="P42">We have successfully generated a tool to track the CD9 interactome in epithelial cells using proximity labelling and demonstrated dynamism within these microdomains in response to infection with either <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> or <italic>S. aureus</italic>. We demonstrate a robust CD9 interactome with proximal proteins involved in numerous cellular pathways. Furthermore, CD9-mediated adherence required host cell surface receptors already present within the interactome but also recruitment of various proteins dependent on the infecting bacteria. Therefore, we present for the first time; i) a replete CD9 interactome within epithelial cells; ii) demonstrate the utility of CD9 as a universal organiser of âadhesion platformsâ for bacteria; iii) and provide new targets for investigation within bacterial adherence pathways and their downstream signalling responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Data 1</label><media xlink:href="EMS202045-supplement-Supplementary_Data_1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" id="d134aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Data 2</label><media xlink:href="EMS202045-supplement-Supplementary_Data_2.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" id="d134aAcEcB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Figure 1</label><caption><title>CD9 removal affects meningococcal receptor expression.</title><p id="P43">(A) CD9 knockout has no effect on the number of cells expressing critical meningococcal receptors. % expressing cells of meningococcal receptors was determined by flow cytometry. WT or CD9<sup>-/-</sup> cells were treated with an anti-CD9 antibody (602.29), an anti-CD46 antibody, an anti-CD147 antibody. A mouse IgG isotype control (JC1) was included and expression was determined using a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. % change was calculated by comparing WT to CD9<sup>-/-</sup> cells.
