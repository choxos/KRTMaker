In Europe, their application on cereals increased drastically starting from the mid 1970s, contributing to a significant improvement in yields. However, extensive usage has led to the rapid evolution of resistant pathogen populations within just a few years of fungicide deployment. Here we focus on wheat powdery mildew, a disease caused by the ascomycete fungus <italic>Blumeria graminis forma specialis tritici</italic> (Bgt). Previous research on Bgt documented the emergence of resistance to different fungicides and identified various resistance mechanisms. Yet, the frequency, distribution, and evolutionary dynamics of fungicide resistance in Bgt populations remain largely unexplored. In this study we leveraged extensive sampling and whole-genome sequencing of Bgt populations in Europe and the Mediterranean to investigate the population genetics and molecular epidemiology of fungicide resistance towards five major fungicide classes. We analyzed gene sequences and copy number variation of eight known fungicide target genes in 415 Bgt isolates sampled between 1980 and 2023. We observed that mutations conferring resistance to various fungicides increased in frequency over time, and had distinct geographic distributions, likely due to diverse deployment of fungicides across different regions. For demethylation inhibitor fungicides we identified multiple independent events of resistance emergence with distinct mutational profiles, and we tracked their rapid spread in the last decades. Overall, we revealed the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of fungicide resistance mutations in European Bgt populations. These results underscore the potential of genomic surveillance and population genetics to enhance our understanding of fungicide resistance.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">With more than 130 million tons harvested each year, wheat is among the most important crops in Europe (Eurostat 2024). Starting from the 1970s, the application of fungicides to European wheat fields has become systematic, making Europe the continent with the most intense use of fungicides on cereals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Pimentão et al. 2024</xref>). Five main classes of fungicides have been used in the last decades: methyl benzimidazole carbamates (MBCs) and morpholines from the early 1970s, demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) from the late 1970s, quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs) from the 1990s, and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) starting in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bryson 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jørgensen et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lucas et al. 2015</xref>). However, different pathogens have developed resistance to each of these fungicides within a few years from their introduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Brent 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chartrain and Brown 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jørgensen et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lucas et al. 2015</xref>). Because of widespread insensitivity developed by multiple pathogens, the usage of MBCs has declined drastically, while morpholines, QoIs, DMIs and SDHIs continue to be applied on wheat fields. Resistance to these fungicides is managed with mixtures and rotation of products, together with other strategies such as non-chemical control with resistant host varieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Brent 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Corkley et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jørgensen et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Granular up-to-date data about fungicide usage in Europe is not available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mesnage et al. 2021</xref>), however it is known that until 2003, DMIs, morpholines, and QoIs were the three most used fungicides on cereals, while the utilization of SDHIs has increased considerably from the 2010s (Table 5.1.2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Eurostat 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jørgensen et al. 2019</xref>). In addition, there are large differences in fungicide usage across European countries. In Western and Central Europe, fungicide application per hectare of cereal crop has been considerably higher compared to Southern and Eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Eurostat 2007</xref>). For example, until 2003, fungicide usage on cereals in the UK has been more than 30 times higher than in Italy and four times higher than in Poland (Table 5.1.2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Eurostat 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In this study we focus on wheat powdery mildew, a disease caused by the biotrophic fungal pathogen <italic>Blumeria graminis forma specialis tritici</italic> (hereafter Bgt). Bgt is considered a pathogen at high risk of developing resistance, because of its short generation time, its ability to recombine sexually, and the very large number of spores produced by any successful infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">McDonald and Linde 2002</xref>). Indeed, Bgt populations have quickly become insensitive upon exposure to new fungicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jørgensen et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Lucas et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Vielba-Fernández et al. 2020</xref>). For instance, the first Bgt strains insensitive to QoIs were observed just two years after the introduction of this new fungicide class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chin et al. 2001</xref>). Previous research has revealed that in Bgt and other fungi, resistance to QoIs evolved through the G143A mutation in the cytochrome b (<italic>cytb</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cowger et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Fraaije et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Gisi et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Sierotzki et al. 2000</xref>). Similarly, mutation V295L in the C-14 reductase (<italic>erg24</italic>) gene in the ergosterol pathway has been linked to morpholine resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Arnold 2018</xref>), while mutations Y136F and S509T in the sterol 14α-demethylase (<italic>cyp51</italic>) gene, along with the presence of multiple copies of this gene, are known to decrease the efficacy of DMIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Arnold 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arnold et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Meyers 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wyand and Brown 2005</xref>). Additionally, it was recently proposed that the presence of both alleles for Y136F and S509T in different copies of <italic>cyp51</italic> within the same isolate might be associated with increased resistance to DMIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Arnold et al. 2024</xref>). In contrast, resistance to SDHIs has never been reported in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Arnold 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">FRAC SDHI working group 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Currently, the only systematic monitoring effort to screen the sensitivity of Bgt populations to different fungicides in Europe is undertaken by the private sector. Every year the Fungicide Resistance Action Committe (FRAC) gathers data generated by fungicide producers. However, only a summary of the results and usage recommendations are made available to the public. From this information we know that Bgt populations are at least partially insensitive to QoIs, DMIs and morpholines in Northern Europe, and that in Western Europe Bgt is particularly resistant to DMIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">FRAC QoI Working Group 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">FRAC SBI Working Group 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P6">Here we take advantage of a large, previously published collection of genome sequences from Bgt isolates sampled in Europe and surrounding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jigisha et al. 2024</xref>) to perform a systematic screening for fungicide resistance mutations. We focus on eight known Bgt genes coding for proteins targeted by the five fungicide classes described above. We investigate variation in the amino acid sequence and copy number of these target genes, with particular attention to mutations that are known to confer resistance. We determine their prevalence in different regions, and we track how they spread through time and space. We found that resistant mutations for different fungicides have distinct geographic ranges, likely a consequence of different fungicide usage in different countries. Moreover, we identify novel amino acid mutations in <italic>erg24</italic> and we suggest that they are likely to confer resistance to morpholines. Finally, we show that mutations conferring resistance to DMIs are abundant in Europe and Turkey, and that resistance to DMIs evolved multiple times independently and spread rapidly throughout the continent.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="P7">To monitor the prevalence of fungicide resistance mutations, and to study how Bgt populations evolved in response to fungicide pressure, we used whole-genome sequencing data of 415 <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jigisha et al.

That study reported that wheat powdery mildew epidemics in Europe and the Mediterranean can be divided in five populations occupying different geographic ranges: one population in Northern Europe (population N_EUR), two populations in Southern Europe (populations S_EUR1 and S_EUR2), one population in Turkey (population TUR), and one in the Middle East (population ME; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Jigisha et al. 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Here, we defined three datasets: 1) a set of 415 <italic>Bgt</italic> isolates collected in Europe and the Mediterranean between 1980 and 2023 (dataset <italic>Europe+</italic>), 2) a subset of <italic>Europe+</italic> with 368 isolates collected between 2015 and 2023 (dataset <italic>Europe+_recent</italic>) and 3) a subset of 83 samples collected over a period of more than 40 years from the UK, France and Switzerland (<italic>temporal</italic> dataset; Supplementary Data S1). We selected these countries for the <italic>temporal</italic> dataset because we wanted to study shifts in fungicide resistance over multiple decades, and these were the only countries with consistent sampling over the years. For most of the analyses, and unless otherwise stated, we used the <italic>Europe+_recent</italic> dataset. We generated amino acid sequence alignments for the eight known fungicide targets that were the focus of this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S15">Experimental procedures</xref>).

To investigate the sensitivity of European populations of Bgt to QoI fungicides we focused on <italic>cytb</italic>, a mitochondrial gene coding for a subunit of cytochrome bc1, which is known to be the single target of QoIs. The amino acid substitution G143A is associated with field resistance to QoI fungicides in many fungal species, including Bgt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Cowger et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Dorigan et al. 2023</xref>). Across all isolates we found one single nucleotide mutation (G428C), corresponding to the amino acid change G143A. This mutation was present in 146 out of 368 (39.7%) isolates of the <italic>Europe+_recent</italic> dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), suggesting that resistance to QoIs is widespread but not complete in European Bgt populations.</p><p id="P10">However, there were large differences in the prevalence of G143A in different geographic regions.

In Central and Eastern Europe, G143A was present at intermediate frequencies, while in the south of Europe it was rare, and in the Middle East it was completely absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We also investigated how resistance to QoIs changed over time in Western Europe by comparing samples collected in three different periods: 1980-2001, 2007-2020, and 2022-2023 (<italic>temporal</italic> dataset). We observed an upward trend in the occurrence of G143A (Fisher’s exact test <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001 for the comparison between 1990-2001 and 2022-2023 in the <italic>temporal</italic> dataset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>), indicating an expansion of QoI resistance in the last two decades in Western Europe. Altogether, these analyses showed that resistance to QoIs is almost complete in Western Europe, a region in which QoIs have been used intensely in the past, and that G143A is also abundant in Eastern Europe, reflecting the broader application of this class of fungicides.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title><italic>erg24</italic> – morpholine resistance</title><p id="P11">Morpholine fungicides have been used on cereals since the 1970s, although they have been less popular than DMIs and their deployment has decreased over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Eurostat 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Jørgensen et al. 2019</xref>).

Finally, we found G143A at low frequency in Southern Europe and Turkey, possibly due to a mix of migration from Northern Europe and low-level selection.

To test this hypothesis, we encourage further investigations of these mutations, for example by combining sensitivity testing and sequencing of <italic>erg24</italic> of large contemporary Bgt populations.

Site-level hard filtering was executed using GATK VariantFiltration with filters QD&lt;10, FS&gt;55, MQ&lt;45 and –4&lt;ReadPosRankSum&lt;4.

We used the same approach to calculate the coverage for all gene targets (from start to end). We used the ratio between the coverage of the gene targets and the average coverage of the nuclear or mitochondrial genome (depending on the gene target) to estimate the copy number for each sample. After confirming normality (Shapiro-Wilk <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001), but not normality of variance (F test ratio of variances = 2.512, <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0096), we performed a Welch two sample t-test to test for different number of <italic>cyp51</italic> copies in the temporal groups “1980-2001” and “2022-2023”. To study the structure of tandem repeat at the <italic>cyp51</italic> locus we plotted the ratio between the coverage of each base of the locus and the average genome-wide coverage.
