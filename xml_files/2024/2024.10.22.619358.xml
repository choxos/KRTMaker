Curative surgery for VTT is high-risk, but neoadjuvant therapy may improve outcomes. The NAXIVA trial demonstrated a 35% VTT response rate after 8 weeks of neoadjuvant axitinib, a VEGFR-directed therapy. However, understanding non-response is critical for better treatment. We conducted a multiparametric investigation of samples collected during NAXIVA using digital pathology, flow cytometry, plasma cytokine profiling and RNA sequencing. Responders had higher baseline microvessel density and increased induction of VEGF-A and PlGF during treatment. A multimodal machine learning model integrating features predicted response with an AUC of 0.868, improving to 0.945 when using features from week 3. Key predictive features included plasma CCL17 and IL-12. These findings may guide future treatment strategies for VTT, improving the clinical management of this challenging scenario.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Venous tumour thrombus (VTT) occurs in 10-15% of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), where the primary tumour invades the renal vein and inferior vena cava (IVC) and can reach the liver and heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. Whilst these patients are technically curable, the surgery required is extensive and complex, requiring multiple teams and the possibility of cardiopulmonary bypass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>. There is considerable morbidity and mortality associated with surgery (5-15%), which increases with the height of the VTT. If left untreated, RCC with VTT has a median survival of 5 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The NAXIVA trial (Study of Axitinib for Reducing Extent of Venous Tumour Thrombus in Renal Cancer with Venous Invasion, NCT03494816) was a phase II, single-arm, multi-centre study investigating the use of neoadjuvant axitinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), to reduce the ccRCC VTT. Loss of the tumour suppressor Von Hippel–Lindau (<italic>VHL</italic>) in ccRCC tumours activates the hypoxia response pathway of the cell, leading to induction of VEGF-mediated angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. VEGFR-TKIs, either alone or in combination with immunotherapy, are used as first line therapy for advanced RCC and have proven efficacy in patients with metastatic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>. In the NAXIVA trial, 35% of patients experienced a reduction in VTT length of &gt;30% after axitinib treatment, leading to less invasive surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. The remaining patients did not benefit from the neoadjuvant treatment. Progress is needed in understanding the reasons for non-response, to improve treatments for these patients.</p><p id="P6">Little is known about the mechanisms driving treatment response in the VTT. There is evidence that the VTT arises as a rapid outgrowth of the primary tumour and has shared driver events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Studies have shown viable proliferating tumour cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and immune infiltrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> in the VTT. At least one study is currently investigating combination treatment in the specific setting of ccRCC with VTT (NEOPAX, NCT05969496)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>. However, no prospective study has examined the determinants of VTT response to systemic treatment.</p><p id="P7">In metastatic ccRCC, RNA-based signatures have been used to group patients according to the therapies most likely to benefit them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup>. A prospective study (BIONIKK, NCT02960906) classified patients into four transcriptome-based groups, finding that patients with an immune-low tumour microenvironment (TME) had improved survival during combination of two immunotherapy drugs compared to patients with higher immune-infiltration and inflammatory markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. DNA, protein and clinical markers have also been investigated for patient stratification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>, but none have been widely adopted for use in metastatic cases, nor in neoadjuvant settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. In wider oncology practice, the complexity of the TME and the disparate data generated from multiple sources complicates the development predictive signatures. In other tumour types, the use of machine learning (ML) approaches to integrate data streams has provided valuable insights<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">To investigate predictive markers of VTT response to axitinib, we performed a comprehensive multiparametric assessment of the TME and peripheral blood for patients in the NAXIVA trial. An ML model was then used to identify biomarkers for VTT response. Identifying reliable predictors of VTT treatment response would allow a personalised approach to treatment selection, which would improve outcomes, avoid overtreatment, and inform the design of future studies for VTT management.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Assessment of VTT length response on the NAXIVA Trial</title><p id="P9">The design and clinical outcomes of the NAXIVA trial have been fully reported elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Briefly, eligible patients underwent baseline tumour biopsy, then up to 8 weeks of axitinib treatment, followed by surgery to remove the primary tumour and VTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Serial blood samples were collected during the study. Extent of the VTT was assessed by MRI scan at baseline (week 1), week 3 and week 9. For the present study, we included the 20 evaluable patients that were assessed in the trial.</p><p id="P10">In the main trial analysis, the primary endpoint was change in the Mayo level of VTT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. However, the Mayo level is a categorical classification based on anatomical landmarks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>, and relatively small changes in the VTT dimensions may result in a change in Mayo level, or conversely a large change may not cross a Mayo level. To investigate the TME biological response to therapy, we analysed against the continuous percentage change in the VTT length. 7/20 patients achieved a &gt;30% reduction in VTT length by week 9, and we classified this group as responders for our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1a-b</xref>). Considering the main clinical parameters, in keeping with the results reported in the clinical study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>, axitinib dosing, sex and TNM status did not appear to affect the VTT length change after treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c-f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>TME of untreated VTT resembles the primary RCC TME</title><p id="P11">First, we assessed the microenvironment of untreated resected VTTs, outside of the NAXIVA trial, in comparison to the corresponding primary tumour. In keeping with previous studies, VTT consists mainly of Carbonic Anhydrase 9 (CA9) positive viable tumour cells which fill the vessel lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In some examples, the morphology of the VTT was very similar to the primary (such as the cystic structures seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). There are extensive microvascular structures within VTT, with CD31 positive vessels surrounded by alpha smooth muscle actin (SMA) positive pericytes, between the CA9 positive tumour cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). There is immune infiltration of both CD3 positive T-cells and CD68 positive macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). We assessed the relationship between the VTT TME and corresponding primary tumour by quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the following key markers in 10 paired cases: Ki67, CD8 and CD31 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1g-i</xref>). The levels of Ki67, CD8 and CD31 were all significantly correlated between the VTT and primary tumour (CD8 <italic>p</italic> = 0.022, Ki67 <italic>p</italic> = 4 x 10<sup>-4</sup>, CD31 <italic>p</italic> = 0.032, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1g-i</xref>). These data demonstrate that the microenvironment of untreated VTT closely resembles that of its parent tumour, and so therapies that are effective against a primary should be effective against VTT.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Higher microvessel density is associated with VTT response to axitinib</title><p id="P12">To analyse the effect of axitinib on tumour vasculature, whole slide imaging (WSI) of NAXIVA patients’ baseline biopsy, and post-treatment VTT and primary tumour samples were analysed for microvessel density (MVD) by HALO image analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The baseline biopsy CD31+/CD34+ MVD in responders was significantly higher than in non-responders (<italic>p</italic> = 7.88 x 10<sup>-4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), and was followed by a significant MVD reduction in the VTT after treatment (<italic>p</italic> = 4.06 x 10<sup>-4</sup>). In contrast, the MVD remained at a stable, low level in non-responders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). This effect was also seen when quantifying CD31+ and CD34+ mono-markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2a-b</xref>). Upon assessment of SMA+ cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) area coverage, there was a non-significant trend towards a reduction in the SMA+ CAF in non-responders on treatment (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0867, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Circulating angiogenic factors are differentially induced in responders and nonresponders</title><p id="P13">Axitinib inhibits the signalling response of the VEGF receptors to their soluble ligands; therefore, we assessed the plasma levels of circulating angiogenesis markers during the trial. Absolute levels of VEGF-A were not different either before or during treatment in responders and non-responders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3a</xref>). However, the fold change relative to each individual patient baseline showed circulating VEGF-A levels increased significantly by the end of treatment in responders compared to non-responders (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0118 at week 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Absolute placental growth factor (PlGF) levels were low at baseline in both groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3b</xref>), followed by a strong induction in the responders at week 3 and a return to low levels after treatment ended and the tumour was resected.

We developed an ML approach using baseline (week 1) features to predict response outcome, considering a binary classification of response as above, where response is defined as a &gt;30% reduction in VTT length compared to baseline. The input data consisted of 62 features measured for each of the 20 patients. To reduce overfitting of the model to the small dataset, highly correlated features were reduced as part of data pre-processing, and the first part of the model involves a dimensionality reduction step, which selects the features contributing most to response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In this model, three features of the 62 were selected. A logistic regression was then fitted to the reduced dataset. We used a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, whereby the feature selection and model training was repeated for each group of 19 patients, generating 20 models which each predicted the response of the remaining one patient. While the number of patients in the study is relatively low, this approach prioritises feature identification for further investigation and follow up in future studies.</p><p id="P22">The scaled data input to the model are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>. With these baseline features, the model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.868 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>, Table 1). Three specific features were selected repeatedly in at least 8 of the 20 iterations of the model (Table 2). These were found to be plasma IL-12p70, CCL17, and microvessel density. CCL17 was not identified in the univariate data analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>) but had the highest selection frequency and relative weight assigned by the logistic regression. Responders were always low in circulating CCL17 and IL-12p70, and generally, but not exclusively, higher in tumour MVD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). Published scRNA-seq data shows that CCL17 is not expressed by RCC cells but may be expressed by conventional dendritic cells in the TME (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>).

Therefore, we updated the model to include measurements of fold-changes in the plasma angiogenic factors after three weeks of axitinib treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>).

We conduct a multiparametric analysis including tissue factors by digital pathology and RNA-seq, and both cell-based and soluble-factor analysis of peripheral blood. Furthermore, we deploy ML approaches to prioritise and integrate the parameters. This allows us to gain new insights into determinants of response in ccRCC with VTT, a challenging clinical scenario.</p><p id="P26">The highly organised nature of the VTT TME is striking, with an established microvessel network, stroma, and immune infiltrate as seen in primary ccRCC. High baseline MVD was predictive of response to neoadjuvant axitinib, particularly in the CD31/CD34+ subset of vessels. Good response was also associated with greater induction of angiogenic growth factors, particularly stroma-derived PlGF. Non-responders had an immune-high phenotype, with higher levels of IL-7 and IL-12, and trends to increased circulating CD8+ T-effectors in blood and CD8+/PD-1+ T-cells in the TME. Assessing transcriptomic data from baseline biopsies, several genes were associated with good response, notably in the solute carrier gene family. The ML model selected IL-12p70, CCL17 and biopsy MVD for response prediction, with model performance improvements seen after the inclusion of early response data, selecting for sTie-2 and PlGF induction. The identified features could be readily assayed in clinical practice.</p><p id="P27">Our data supports previous reports that the VTT is closely related to the parent tumour and is essentially primary tumour existing within the lumen of the vessel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup>. Our finding that VTT axitinib responders have a pro-angiogenic, immune-low phenotype is in keeping with observations in the metastatic setting, where an angiogenesis-rich subgroup is proposed to benefit from VEGFR-TKI therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref></sup>. Amongst circulating factors, PlGF has previously been described as a pharmacodynamic marker for TKI treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>; however, it has not previously been found to be a predictive marker for therapy outcome as demonstrated here. IL-7 supports lymphocyte proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>, IL-12 is critical for cytotoxic T-cell differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, and there is evidence these cytokines may cooperate to enhance antitumour immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P28">Our study finds that highly upregulated genes in NAXIVA responders were also upregulated in C1/2 patients (angiogenic/angio-stromal) in publicly available IMmotion151 transcriptomic data, whereas the opposite was observed for C4/5/6 (T-effector/proliferative, proliferative and stromal/proliferative), which fitted better with the non-responding patients. When published RNA signatures were applied to the NAXIVA transcriptomic data, we found some correlation with outcome, particularly for the Javelin Renal 101 ‘Angio’ score.</p><p id="P29">The RNA-seq data from the patient biopsies revealed an association between response to axitinib and a number of genes involved in several metabolic pathways, including genes in the solute carrier family, namely <italic>SLC6A19, SLC22A12, SLCO2A1</italic> and <italic>SLC4A1</italic>. The concomitant increase in MVD and expression of genes related to solute metabolism and transport point towards a relationship between the metabolic pathways in the tumour and the induction of angiogenesis. For example, <italic>SLCO2A1</italic> (a prostaglandin transporter) may regulate the endothelial response to prostaglandins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>, influencing angiogenesis and potentially responsiveness to anti-angiogenic therapy. Three of the SLC family members identified in NAXIVA responders were associated with favourable prognosis in TCGA data, where they were also predictive of immune microenvironment and drug response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Considering other upregulated metabolic genes, <italic>ALDOB</italic> has also been reported to have prognostic significance in RCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></sup>. These genes are expressed by normal renal tubules, so they may mark well-differentiated, less aggressive tumours.</p><p id="P30">A further question in the treatment of metastatic ccRCC is the potential synergistic effect of combining immunotherapy with VEGFR-directed TKIs, where the TKI is proposed to boost the effect of immunotherapy. Pre-clinical data indicates that VEGFR-TKIs enhance immunity by a variety of effects, including the reduction of immune suppressive myeloid cells in the tumour microenvironment (TME)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. In our data, we did not find any clear evidence of axitinib altering the immune profile and the overall immune phenotype remained stable on treatment. This is consistent with a study of neoadjuvant pazopanib in localised RCC, which did not find any change in immune signatures on treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. Axitinib has a narrow range of targets compared to other TKIs used in RCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, so these observations do not rule out an immune modulatory effect of TKIs that target a wider range of receptors such as lenvatinib or cabozantanib.</p><p id="P31">Induction of PlGF at week 3 was a key marker of good outcome in NAXIVA. Biological heterogeneity, both between patients and within tumours, is a challenge for the development of baseline predictive biomarkers, whose limited performance could be surpassed by dynamic measurement of blood markers such as PlGF. Early blood biomarker changes may have significant clinical utility as they are readily assayed in the clinic. In the scenario of VTT management, it may give confidence in continuing with neoadjuvant therapy against proceeding directly to surgery. Our data do not provide a mechanism for the PlGF induction; however, we hypothesise that in responders, the effective blockade of the VEGFR axis induces a hypoxic response with increased production of VEGF-A and PlGF as a compensatory mechanism. It is not clear whether the responders and non-responders are biologically distinct in this respect, or whether there is a spectrum of effects depending on the degree of VEGFR inhibition achieved. PlGF is reported to potentiate the effectiveness of VEGF signalling, and so it may be a mechanism to overcome blockade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, particularly important in pathological angiogenesis compared to physiological angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. PlGF is an attractive marker for further exploration as there is an existing clinical assay used for pre-eclampsia, which might be re-purposed.</p><p id="P32">A challenge in the analysis of small clinical trial datasets with extensive translational analysis is the large number of parameters assessed for predictive value in comparison to the number of patients enrolled in the study. ML approaches may enhance the analysis of similar datasets. The ML model based on baseline features achieved good performance for response prediction on an internal validation set. Performance is enhanced by data from week 3, again demonstrating the potential value of dynamic marker assessment. The models are limited by a small dataset and no current external validation data, but do provide an indication of putative response markers. The models selected a small number of factors based on plasma and tissue measurements which could be readily translated into the clinic. The result for CCL17 illustrates the utility of the ML approach, as this cytokine was assigned high priority by the ML models despite not being seen in our initial single parameter screens of the data. CCL17 is an important regulator of T cell immunity, acting on CCR4, and has been shown to be negatively prognostic in RCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref></sup>. The ML approach provided some insight into the interaction between the different features, particularly with responders being low in both IL-12p70 and CCL17. Changes in sTie-2 were also important in the dynamic model, which could be an alternative pathway for angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>; however, we interpret this finding with caution: although the fold change was consistent, the absolute changes in sTie-2 concentration in each patient were small. RNA-seq data was not included in our ML model due to the potential for noise amplification of adding several thousand differentially expressed genes to the other parameters. We observed differences in RNA and protein results; for instance, CCL17 was undetected in our RNA-seq and present at low levels in published single-cell datasets. This may suggest low transcript expression in tumours, making detection challenging, or indicate the importance of a non-tumour source, such as primary or secondary lymphoid tissue.</p><p id="P33">The study is limited by the small size of the trial, with only 20 participants, and by the lack of an external validation set for the key parameters identified, due to the unique nature of the study. We are restricted in both respects by the lower prevalence of VTT relative to all RCC cases; specific VTT management has been the subject of phase II trials to date, but a dedicated phase III VTT trial is likely unfeasible. Thus, we are limited to suggesting these markers as priorities for further work. Axitinib has been superseded by more active treatment combinations of TKIs and immunotherapy in the metastatic setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref></sup>, which is now being explored in pre-operative trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref></sup>; nonetheless, the TKI monotherapy in NAXIVA provides a useful comparator to any translational data arising from these IO-TKI studies.</p><p id="P34">Beyond phase II trials of current treatments, newer agents such as more potent TKIs or bispecific immunotherapies may have application in improving oncologic outcomes for VTT patients. This must be balanced against risks of toxicity. Our investigations of the microenvironment and blood features have identified predictive biomarkers that might be validated in these studies, either alone or as a combined assay. It will be interesting to see whether the key features identified by our study, which mainly divide the patients into ‘immune’ and ‘angiogenic’, are still valuable when combination treatment is used, or whether others emerge. It is critical that a range of translational analysis approaches, including tumour, blood, RNA and protein-based approaches linked to advanced cancer imaging, are built into future study designs to gain a full understanding of the mechanisms of tumour response and resistance.</p></sec><sec id="S12" sec-type="materials | methods"><title>Materials &amp; methods</title><sec id="S13" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p id="P35">NAXIVA was a single arm, single agent, phase II, open label, multicentre UK based study (NCT03494816, UK ethical approval REC reference: 17/EE/0240).

Samples were only included in analysis if the sequencing duplication rate was &lt; 65%. Genes were included if the maximum count per biopsy was &gt; 10 and if more than 50% of the biopsies had counts &gt; 0. Counts were normalised by variance-stabilised transformation and the top 500 genes generated principal components for the PCA plot.

We used leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) on NAXIVA’s 20 patients to train and optimise the models. We used an increasing number of features, starting with baseline biopsy and blood features (62 features, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>); then adding growth factor fold-change features at Week 3 of axitinib treatment (69 features, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>). For each combination we retrained the framework and derived a new model. The full list of features can be found in Supplementary Information. The models included recursive feature elimination using a logistic regression estimator, and the predictions were done by logistic regression with stochastic gradient descent, all coded in Python using scikit-learn version 1.4. Before entering the machine learning algorithm, all data underwent three pre-processing steps: iterative imputation, min-max standardisation and collinearity reduction. The estimator used for the iterative imputation was Bayesian Ridge. Collinearity reduction removed all features with a Spearman’s Rank correlation above 0.75, retaining one feature at random from the collinear group. The Spearman’s correlation between all features is visualised in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S10</xref>. We used a five-fold cross validation setup to optimise model hyperparameters in the LOOCV training set, covering the hyperparameter ranges shown in Supplementary Information. The optimisation was based on a grid search in the hyperparameter space to optimise the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Once the optimal hyperparameters were found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Information</xref>), we determined model parameters by re-fitting the model to the training set. To increase the robustness of the model with this dataset, LOOCV was done in 20 iterations, leaving one of the NAXIVA patients out at a time. The prediction for each left-out patient was done according to the model trained on the remaining 19 patients.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><title>Feature importance</title><p id="P48">We evaluated feature importance in two different steps. First, we computed the frequency with which features were selected after the recursive feature elimination. We repeated the process for each of the LOOCV iterations, which means that features could be selected between 0 and a maximum of 20 times. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref> displays only features that were chosen at least eight out of twenty times in each cross-validation loop. Second, we computed the importance (i.e. weight) of each individual feature within the logistic regression algorithm. The weights were averaged across the iterations in which they were picked.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Information</label><media xlink:href="EMS199679-supplement-Supplementary_Information.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" id="d122aAcEbB" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the staff at the core facilities that were key to the success of this work: The Histopathology Core, Genomics Core, and Compliance &amp; Biobanking Team at the CRUK Cambridge Institute, the Cancer &amp; Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, The Human Research Tissue Bank and The Core Biochemical Assay Laboratory at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and the NIHR Cambridge BRC Cell Phenotyping Hub.
