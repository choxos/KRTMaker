To understand how SPRTN’s promiscuous protease activity is confined to the cleavage of crosslinked proteins, we reconstitute the repair of DPCs including their modification with SUMO and ubiquitin chains, using recombinant human proteins. We discover that DPC ubiquitylation strongly activates SPRTN independently of SPRTN’s known ubiquitin-binding domains. Using protein structure prediction, MD simulations and NMR spectroscopy we reveal that ubiquitin binds to an interface at the back of SPRTN’s protease domain, promoting an active conformation. Replacing key interfacial residues prevents ubiquitin-dependent activation of SPRTN, which leads to genomic instability and cell cycle defects in cells expressing hypomorphic SPRTN variants that cause premature aging and liver cancer in Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome patients. Collectively, our results demonstrate that SPRTN activation is coupled to the modification of the crosslinked protein, explaining how specificity is achieved during DPC repair.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Cells invest in extensive repair mechanisms to ensure the fidelity of the genetic information stored in their DNA. Defective DNA repair results in mutagenesis and genome instability, major hallmarks of cancer, aging and aging-related diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref></sup>. DNA repair pathways are regulated by sophisticated networks of post-translational modifications, deploying various enzymatic activities to target specific lesions in highly controlled manners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are especially detrimental lesions that can arise enzymatically upon stabilization of covalent complexes between DNA-processing enzymes and their substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>. For example, the transient covalent reaction intermediate formed between topoisomerase 1 and DNA can not only be stabilized by camptothecin and its clinical derivatives but also spontaneously by adjacent DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. Other enzymatic DPCs have important protective functions. The protein HMCES actively crosslinks to abasic (AP) sites within single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to prevent AP site scission during DNA replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref></sup>. Additionally, various endogenous and environmental bifunctional reactive agents such as metabolic formaldehyde or ethanol-derived acetaldehyde inadvertently crosslink proteins to DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">DPCs are highly toxic because large protein adducts block vital chromatin processes, including DNA replication and transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. The collision of the replication or transcription machinery with crosslinked proteins initiates repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, which can additionally be triggered by global-genome mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>. During the repair, the protein adduct is modified by ubiquitylation in all cases. During replication, ubiquitylation is carried out by the replisome-binding ubiquitin E3 TRAIP and the ssDNA-associated E3 RFWD3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>, while the CRL4<sup>CSA</sup> E3 ubiquitylates DPCs that have stalled elongating RNA polymerases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>. During global-genome DPC repair, ubiquitylation is preceded by SUMOylation of the protein adduct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>, which then leads to subsequent ubiquitylation by the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin E3s RNF4 and TOPORS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Following modification of the DPC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>, repair proceeds by proteolytic destruction of the protein adduct. While the proteasome can degrade DPCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, they are also targeted by specialized DPC proteases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup>. SPRTN, the major human DPC protease, targets DPCs during replication and in global-genome pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Loss of SPRTN is lethal in virtually all human cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup> and leads to dramatic genome instability and early embryonic lethality in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>, highlighting SPRTN’s critical role in repairing endogenously arising DNA damage.</p><p id="P7">SPRTN features a metalloprotease domain at the <italic>N</italic>-terminus, which, together with the ssDNA-binding zinc-binding domain (ZBD), forms the conserved SprT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>. SPRTN’s protease activity is not specific to certain amino acid sequences, which is perfectly suited to target diverse types of protein adducts, but also requires tight regulation to prevent accidental cleavage of chromatin proteins. The SprT domain is followed by a basic region (BR) that specifically interacts with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. ZBD and BR couple SPRTN activity to the recognition of DNA structures that contain both single- and double-stranded features, including ssDNA-dsDNA junctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. Such junctions arise when replicative polymerases stall at DPCs during replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Despite these insights, the recognition of ssDNA-dsDNA junctions or similar structures cannot explain how specificity is achieved during SPRTN activation, given that these DNA structures are not specific to sites of DPC formation. On the contrary, they are common throughout the genome, for example on the lagging strand during DNA replication. Therefore, it remains unknown how SPRTN’s protease activity is confined to cleavage of crosslinked proteins. Presumably, SPRTN activation must involve a conformational change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, given that the only available structure of the SprT domain revealed a closed conformation, in which the ZBD domain restricts access to SPRTN’s active site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">In addition to its DNA-binding domains, SPRTN bears interaction motifs for binding to the segregase p97 (SHP box) and PCNA (PIP box)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref></sup> but neither is required for SPRTN’s DPC repair function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Furthermore, SPRTN carries a <italic>C</italic>-terminal ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ), promoting mono-ubiquitylation of SPRTN, which has been linked to its inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref></sup>. A motif interacting with ubiquitin (MIU) has been predicted at SPRTN’s very <italic>N</italic>-terminus but has not been experimentally confirmed yet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. The precise role of ubiquitin in SPRTN-mediated DPC cleavage has remained controversial. Cleavage of a model DPC by SPRTN can be observed in frog egg extracts even if the protein adduct has been treated with formaldehyde, to prevent efficient ubiquitylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, ubiquitylated DPCs accumulate upon SPRTN depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>, suggesting that they are substrates of the protease. It has been speculated that the UBZ may help to recruit SPRTN to ubiquitylated DPCs. In agreement, the UBZ domain supports efficient DPC cleavage in frog egg extracts and also in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. Surprisingly however, the UBZ domain is not essential for SPRTN’s function. Patients with Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome (RJALS) express truncated versions of SPRTN that lack the <italic>C</italic>-terminal part of the enzymes including the UBZ (SPRTN<sup>ΔC</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), either alone or in combination with active site mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>. RJALS patients suffer from premature aging and predisposition to liver cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref></sup>, phenotypes that are recapitulated in a mouse model of reduced SPRTN function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></sup>. Yet, the truncated SPRTN patient variants are clearly compatible with life, in contrast to full loss of SPRTN. In agreement, the severe growth defects associated with SPRTN loss in conditional mouse knock-out cells are fully rescued by expression of truncated SPRTN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref></sup>. Hence, it has remained enigmatic how SPRTN patient variants target DPCs in the absence of the UBZ and, more generally, whether and how SPRTN activity is regulated by DPC ubiquitylation.</p><p id="P9">Here, we investigate the role of ubiquitin in SPRTN activation using a multi-pronged approach, encompassing the biochemical reconstitution of DPC modification and repair, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, NMR experiments and cellular assays. We find that ubiquitin, particularly DPC ubiquitylation, strongly activates SPRTN. The ubiquitin-dependent activation of SPRTN occurs independently of its UBZ, but instead requires a novel ubiquitin-binding interface at the back of its protease domain. This interface is critically required in cells expressing <italic>C</italic>-terminally truncated RJALS patient variants to maintain cellular fitness and to prevent chromatin bridges, micronuclei and cell cycle defects. Collectively, our results reveal a novel regulatory principle that confines SPRTN’s protease activity by linking its activation to the ubiquitylation of the DPC and explain how residual SPRTN function is maintained in RJALS patients.</p></sec><sec id="S2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ubiquitin stimulates SPRTN’s DNA-dependent protease activity by promoting an open conformation</title><p id="P10">To explore the relationship between SPRTN and ubiquitin, we monitored DNA-dependent autocleavage of recombinant human SPRTN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1A</xref>) in the presence and absence of ubiquitin; in this type of assay, autocleavage occurs <italic>in trans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>. Upon addition of ubiquitin, SPRTN autocleavage was enhanced in the presence of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, compare lanes 9-12 and 13-16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> for quantification). In the absence of DNA, no autocleavage was observed independent of whether ubiquitin was present or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 1-8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> for quantification), suggesting that ubiquitin promotes SPRTN’s DNA-dependent protease activity. The stimulating effect required ubiquitin’s Ile44 residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, compare lanes 13-16 and 17-20, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> for quantification). Given that most ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) interact with ubiquitin by binding to the hydrophobic patch around Ile44<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></sup>, this observation indicated to us that a UBD in SPRTN is mediating the stimulating effect of ubiquitin. Notably however, deletion of SPRTN’s UBZ or its predicted MIU domain had no effect on the ubiquitin-dependent activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1C</xref> for quantification). Even a minimal catalytically active SPRTN fragment (SprT-BR, aa28-245) displayed further activation upon addition of ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1E</xref> for quantification). Because autocleavage fragments produced by truncated SprT-BR are difficult to compare with fragments originating from full-length SPRTN, we additionally assessed <italic>in trans</italic> cleavage of a catalytically inactive Flag-tagged SPRTN (Flag-SPRTN-E112Q). SPRTN and SprT-BR cleaved Flag-SPRTN-E112Q with comparable efficiency in the absence of ubiquitin and were further activated to the same extent upon addition of ubiquitin <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, top panel, compare lanes 1-4 with lanes 9-12, and lanes 5-8 with lanes 13-16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref> for quantification). The stimulating effect of ubiquitin on truncated SprT-BR suggested the presence of an additional ubiquitin-binding site within this region of SPRTN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p id="P11">To explore this possibility, we used ColabFold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref></sup> to predict complexes between SprT-BR and ubiquitin. In the top-ranked model (Rank_1), ubiquitin was predicted to interact via its Ile44 patch with an interface at the back of the SprT domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1F-G</xref>), hereafter referred to as ubiquitin-binding interface at the SprT domain (USD). Interestingly, the SprT domain was predicted in all models to adopt an open conformation with a highly accessible active site facing the ZBD’s DNA binding site. A similar conformation was predicted in the absence of ubiquitin, in stark contrast to the published crystal structure of the SprT domain (PDB:6mdx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup>) that shows a closed conformation with the ZBD restricting access to the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F-H</xref>). Next, we set out to gain insights into whether the predicted open conformation of the SprT domain may be in equilibrium with the closed conformation and thereby enable interaction with ubiquitin. Therefore, we conducted all-atoms MD simulations using the crystal structure or ColabFold-based predictions of the SprT domain, alone or in combination with ubiquitin, as starting points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I-K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1H</xref>). The compact conformation observed in the crystal structure remained largely unchanged over the entire 400 ns timeframe in three independent simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). To reveal the predominant SprT conformations within the different simulations, we employed RMSD-based clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1L-N</xref>). Simulations of the crystal structure consisted of a single cluster with a closed conformation (radius of gyration (Rg)=1.7 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1L</xref>). In contrast, simulations of the ColabFold-predicted SprT structure revealed larger conformational changes during the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>). We observed transient collapses of the SprT domain to a compact conformation with low Rg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>, red arrow). The collapse was either followed by rapid reopening of the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>, dark blue trace) or prolonged collapse lasting several hundred nanoseconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>, light blue trace). Indeed, clustering revealed three main clusters. The first and third cluster exhibited an open conformation (Rg=2.0 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1M</xref>, left), whereas the second cluster showed a closed conformation (Rg=1.8 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1M</xref>, right). The presence of ubiquitin prevented conformational transitions to the closed structure within the SprT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1K</xref>) and the simulations predominantly remained in an open conformation (Rg=2.0 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1N</xref>). Notably, ubiquitin binding to the USD interface of the SprT remained stable across all three independent simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1K</xref>). These data indicated to us that ubiquitin binding at the SprT domain may promote SPRTN activation by stabilizing an open conformation of the enzyme with an accessible active site.</p><p id="P12">Next, we wanted to determine amino acid residues within the USD interface that are important for ubiquitin-binding. In the predicted SprT-ubiquitin complex, Leu38 and Leu99 of SPRTN appeared to mediate the interaction via hydrophobic interactions involving multiple amino acids within ubiquitin’s hydrophobic Ile44- and Ile36-patch, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1O-P</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1I</xref>). To assess the effect of replacing either leucine residue with a hydrophilic serine (L38S, L99S), we conducted free energy end-point calculations using MMPBSA in conjunction with alanine scanning (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref> for details), which enabled us to quantify the effect of each leucine-to-serine replacement to the overall binding affinity of the SprT-ubiquitin complex. We calculated a decrease in binding affinity of around 0.6 kcal/mol for the L38S replacement and 3.74 kcal/mol for L99S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1Q</xref>). This effect is explained by replacement of Leu38 and Leu99 resulting in the loss of hydrophobic contacts to ubiquitin’s Ile44 and Ile36 patch, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1O-P</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1I</xref>).</p><p id="P13">Collectively, our results suggest that ubiquitin may stimulate SPRTN activity by interacting with the USD interface of SPRTN’s SprT domain, potentially stabilizing an open – presumably active – conformation of the protease.</p><p id="P14">To experimentally test whether ubiquitin binds to the USD interface and whether ubiquitin binding affects SPRTN’s interaction with DNA, we used NMR spectroscopy.

Nonetheless, we were able to transfer many chemical shifts from our previous analysis of the ZBD-BR construct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. The large CSPs of residues aa151-160, presumably reflect interaction of this region with the protease domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2B</xref>). Due to the non-optimal sample stability of SprT-BR, we could not assign the individual resonances of the protease domain.

Additionally, Trp ε1 amide resonances were not affected by the mutation. Upon adding ubiquitin in five-fold excess, we observed changes in the protease domain of SprT-BR spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2C</xref>, blue boxes, top panels). Trp ε1 resonances located in the protease domain were slightly broadened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, top left panel, blue circles). In the L99S variant, the effects of ubiquitin addition were significantly reduced, implying that they correspond to ubiquitin binding to SPRTN’s USD interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom left panel, blue circles). While the ubiquitin-induced effects were subtle and mostly affected resonances corresponding to the protease domain, we also observed line-broadening for signals corresponding to ZBD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>, left). These residues are again located in the β-sheet close to the linker region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3B</xref>, right panel). On the other hand, the addition of an activating DNA structure in two-fold excess led to major spectral changes in ZBD-BR regions, showing significant line-broadening, which was comparable between wild type (WT) and L99S constructs for the Trp ε1 resonances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, middle panels).

Therefore, we compared activation of SPRTN by mono-ubiquitin (Ub<sup>1</sup>) with linear (M1-), K48- and K63-linked tetra-ubiquitin chains (Ub<sup>4</sup>) in SPRTN autocleavage assays. All tetra-ubiquitin chains stimulated SPRTN activity to a substantially stronger degree than mono-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A and Figure 3B</xref> for quantification, chain concentrations refer to the concentration of mono-ubiquitin moieties). Furthermore, activation by K63-linked ubiquitin increased with increasing chain length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C and Figure 3D</xref> for quantification). Even though the UBZ domain promotes SPRTN binding to ubiquitin chains in pulldown assays (Ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref></sup> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A-C</xref>), it – and SPRTN’s MIU – was not required for activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E and Figure 3F</xref> for quantification). In contrast, Leu99 in SPRTN’s USD interface was strictly required for activation, while replacement of Leu38 had no apparent effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E and Figure 3F</xref> for quantification), which is consistent with its smaller predicted contribution to ubiquitin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1Q</xref>). Of note, the L99S substitution had no effect on ubiquitin chain binding in pull down assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S4A-C</xref>), suggesting that while the ubiquitin-USD interaction is critical for activation, it is too weak to withstand the washing steps during pulldown experiments.</p><p id="P20">Given that SPRTN autocleavage occurs <italic>in trans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup>, we considered the possibility that ubiquitin chains are particularly potent at promoting autocleavage because they can bridge two SPRTN molecules. To test this hypothesis, we assessed <italic>in trans</italic> cleavage of inactive SPRTN (Flag-tagged SPRTN<sup>FL</sup>-E112Q) by different active SPRTN variants (WT, L38S, or L99S).

In the reverse scenario, we replaced Leu38 and Leu99 in inactive Flag-tagged SPRTN-E112Q and tested whether this affects cleavage by active WT SPRTN. In both cases, cleavage was at least as efficient as cleavage of inactive SPRTN with an intact USD interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I and Figure 3J</xref> for quantification). Together, these results show that the USD is dispensable in the SPRTN molecule that is cleaved but is required in the cleaving SPRTN molecule.

HMCES<sup>SRAP</sup>-DPCs were incubated with increasing concentrations of SPRTN and the helicase FANCJ. FANCJ is essential for DPC cleavage in these assays, because it unfolds the protein adduct by loading on the ssDNA 5’ of the DPC, then translocating into the crosslinked protein, resulting in its unfolding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref></sup>. Upon unfolding, SPRTN can access the underlying DNA junction and cleave the protein adduct. As expected, DPC cleavage increased with higher SPRTN concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 3-5 and lanes 23-25) and required the presence of FANCJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 6 and lane 26 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5C</xref>, lane 3 vs 6).

Remarkably, in addition to the standard HMCES<sup>SRAP</sup> cleavage fragment produced by SPRTN (cleaved DPC), additional smaller cleavage products (cleaved DPC*) appeared specifically in the presence of both types of ubiquitin chains. The appearance of these cleavage products was reduced (L38S) or absent (L99S) in SPRTN mutant variants with a non-functional USD interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S5D</xref>).

To this end, we employed synthetic engineered ubiquitin E3s (streamlined versions of the previously published Ubiquiton system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></sup>) to modify HMCES<sup>SRAP</sup> with K48- or K63-linked ubiquitin chains prior to DPC formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). First, we fused a <italic>C</italic>-terminal tag containing a mono-ubiquitin moiety, as well as an FK506-binding protein (FKBP) domain to HMCES<sup>SRAP</sup>. We then incubated this substrate with ubiquitin, an engineered ubiquitin E3 carrying an FKBP-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain, ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), ATP and rapamycin. Rapamycin induces proximity between the substrate and the E3, promoting modification of the single ubiquitin moiety fused to HMCES<sup>SRAP</sup> with either K48- or K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (depending on the identity of the E2/E3 enzymes used in the assay). Following cleavage of the 3C site between ubiquitin and the FKBP domain, HMCES<sup>SRAP</sup> modified with short (HMCES<sup>SRAP</sup>-Ub<sup>[short]</sup>) or long (HMCES<sup>SRAP</sup>-Ub<sup>[long]</sup>) ubiquitin chains was purified over several steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5A</xref>).</p><p id="P23">DPC ubiquitylation strongly enhanced DPC cleavage by SPRTN, independently of linkage type, with long chains activating stronger than shorter ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>, lanes 11-20 (K48) and 31-40 (K63)).

The DPC protease SPRTN features a bipartite DNA binding module, consisting of ZBD and BR, which provides a first layer of specificity by restricting activity to the cleavage of DPCs near ssDNA-dsDNA junctions and other structures with single- and double-stranded features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup>. However, such junctions are widespread across the genome. Hence, SPRTN’s DNA structure-specific activity alone is insufficient to explain how the protease achieves specificity.</p><p id="P33">Our study reveals that SPRTN activation is linked to the ubiquitylation of the crosslinked protein. By reconstituting DPC ubiquitylation <italic>in vitro</italic>, we observed that this modification stimulates SPRTN activity by up to two orders of magnitude, regardless of ubiquitin chain linkage type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Ubiquitin activates SPRTN by binding to the USD interface at the back of the protease domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The ubiquitin-dependent activation allows the enzyme to process DPCs not only more efficiently but also to a greater extent, which may be crucial for enabling efficient translesion synthesis bypass of the remaining peptide adduct during replication-coupled DPC repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></sup>. Our MD simulations further suggest that the USD-ubiquitin interaction stabilizes an open conformation of the enzyme, exposing its active site. This model is supported by our NMR data, which additionally indicate that the ubiquitin-induced change of SPRTN’s conformation is especially pronounced in the presence of an activating DNA structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Indeed, while ubiquitin enhances SPRTN’s DNA-dependent activity, it is not sufficient to trigger SPRTN activation by itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P34">These insights help explain why cells extensively ubiquitylate DPCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup> and why ubiquitylated DPCs accumulate in cells following SPRTN depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref></sup>. The observation that SPRTN-dependent cleavage can occur without DPC ubiquitylation in frog egg extracts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup> is not necessarily inconsistent with our findings. It is plausible that the DPC cleavage observed in egg extract in the absence of ubiquitylation originates from SPRTN’s basal, ubiquitin-independent activity, which is also evident in our assays.</p><p id="P35">Consistently, while amino acid substitutions within the USD interface substantially reduced DPC cleavage activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells, they did not completely abolish SPRTN function. SPRTN with a replacement of the USD residue Leu99, which showed stronger phenotypes across all our assay compared to replacing Leu38, was able to generally complement the loss of <italic>Sprtn</italic> in MEFs. The same is true for the RJALS SPRTN<sup>ΔC</sup> patient variant, which also displayed strongly reduced DNMT1-DPC cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup>, while successfully complementing <italic>Sprtn</italic> loss. Thus, only a minimal amount of SPRTN activity appears to be necessary to fulfil its essential role in suppressing genome instability. The critical role of the USD became evident when Leu99 was replaced in SPRTN<sup>ΔC</sup>, resulting in cell fitness defects and formation of micronuclei and chromatin bridges in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p id="P36">The synthetic effect observed between the combined loss of SPRTN’s <italic>C</italic>-terminal tail and a functional USD interface, is only partially explained by the loss of the UBZ domain. While the UBZ is required for efficient DPC cleavage in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></sup> and egg extracts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, it showed weaker defects in processing ubiquitylated DPCs in combination with the L99S substitution than the corresponding SPRTN<sup>ΔC</sup>-L99S variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6C</xref>). In addition to lacking the UBZ domain, SPRTN<sup>ΔC</sup> also exhibits reduced DNA binding compared to the WT protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>, which may contribute to its reliance on the USD for full functionality. Based on these considerations, we propose a partially speculative ‘triple-lock’ model in which SPRTN activity is controlled by at least three mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). First, the UBZ supports SPRTN function by recruiting it to ubiquitylated DPCs, as previously suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>. This recruitment function is likely more important in the crowded environment of a cell than in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, explaining why the loss of the UBZ had no or only weak phenotypes in our assays. Second, the binding of an activating DNA structure induces an open conformation of SPRTN. Third, this open, active conformation is further stabilized by binding of ubiquitylated DPCs to SPRTN’s USD interface, facilitating rapid and complete proteolysis of the crosslinked protein adduct.</p><p id="P37">This model offers a potential explanation for why SPRTN<sup>ΔC</sup> displayed defects in processing DPCs modified by SUMO-targeted ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5G</xref>) but not of DPCs modified using the artificial ubiquitylation system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S6D</xref>). In the synthetic system, the DPC is modified exclusively at the <italic>C</italic>-terminal ubiquitin tag. In contrast, our MS analysis revealed that SUMO-targeted ubiquitylation affects multiple lysine residues within the DPC and the SUMO chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C-D</xref>). Some of these ubiquitylation events may hinder SPRTN function by interfering with efficient DNA binding. Thus, SPRTN’s full DNA binding capacity is likely required in this context.</p><p id="P38">The ability of SPRTN to be activated by both K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains suggests a first hypothesis as to why SPRTN is essential, despite acting redundantly with the proteasome in most experimental systems investigated so far<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>. The proteasome mainly targets substrates modified with K48-linked ubiquitin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref></sup>. Therefore, our data implies that key endogenous substrates of SPRTN may be modified by K63-linked ubiquitin and are consequently not amenable to proteasomal degradation.</p><p id="P39">In conclusion, we have demonstrated how the key DNA repair enzyme SPRTN is precisely deployed. The recruitment of DNA repair factors via canonical ubiquitin binding domains is a common theme in the DNA damage response.
